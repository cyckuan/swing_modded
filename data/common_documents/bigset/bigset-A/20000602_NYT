BUSH DELAYS AN EXECUTION FOR THE 1ST TIME IN 5 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 19th graf to correct Murphy's role in McCain's campaign)  
 By FRANK BRUNI with RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ In a step he had never taken over the
course of 131 executions in five years, Gov. George W. Bush
Thursday night agreed to a 30-day reprieve for a death-row inmate
in Texas, citing concerns that adequate tests on DNA evidence in
the case had not been performed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his decision, which he had telegraphed well in
advance, after both the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and the
U.S. Supreme Court late Thursday rejected final-hour pleas by
lawyers for the inmate, Ricky Nolen McGinn, who had been scheduled
for execution by lethal injection at 6 p.m. Central time.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn was convicted of raping and killing his 12-year-old
stepdaughter in 1993, but Bush acknowledged over recent days that
the DNA evidence connecting McGinn to the rape was inconclusive and
might be clarified by modern tests. It was the rape, layered on top
of the murder, that qualified McGinn for a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who had just arrived at the state capitol building here
for a conference of governors, announced the stay only about 15
minutes before the originally scheduled time for McGinn's
execution. Bush noted that the actual reprieve would be granted by
Texas state Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat who was
technically acting as governor while Bush and the lieutenant
governor were both out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have recommended and Senator Ellis has accepted my
recommendation to grant a 30-day reprieve in the case of Mr.
McGinn,'' Bush told a group of reporters who huddled around him in
a corridor of the state capitol building here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime DNA evidence can be used in its context and be
relevant as to the guilt or innocence of a person on death row, we
need to use it,'' Bush explained, in a straightforward, unemotional
voice. ``We're doing so in the state of Texas. I expect the courts
and all relevant parties to act expeditiously to review the
evidence and to finally determine his innocence or guilt as to the
charge of rape in the case of Ricky McGinn.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Bush is now the presumptive Republican nominee for
president, his actions as governor are under more intense scrutiny
_ none more so than his vigorous enforcement of the death penalty.
Texas easily leads the nation in executions.
</P>
<P>
   Although his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, also
supports capital punishment, some of his allies would like to use
the issue to cast doubt on Bush's efforts to portray himself as a
``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Bush's unusual action in the case of McGinn
underscored the way in which modern DNA testing and technology have
begun to affect the debate over capital punishment by casting doubt
on convictions once considered solid and just.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, even some staunch conservatives have begun to
acknowledge qualms about capital punishment, in light of a number
of death sentences that have been overturned recently after DNA
testing exonerated the inmates. How these developments will
ultimately affect public support for the death penalty, which has
been broad and strong and often independent of political party
affiliation, remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said that his action was not even remotely
influenced by politics and noted that he had made many tough and
unpopular decisions about the death penalty in the past, including
several since he declared his candidacy for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush's only independent authority is to grant a
30-day reprieve of an execution. He cannot pardon someone or
commute a death sentence without the prior recommendation of the
Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and, under those circumstances,
has commuted only one death sentence over the last year, sparing
the life of Henry Lee Lucas, a confessed serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, as in this one, the argument against the death
penalty was not a sentimental but an evidentiary one, with
questions emerging about some of the testimony and material
marshaled to establish the defendants' guilt and seal the
particular conviction for which he received his death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the first time that Bush agreed to a reprieve for a
death-row inmate, and he did it against the wishes of the pardons
board, which had voted 11-7 not to stay McGinn's execution. For the
moment, Bush's action merely delays McGinn's execution, although
his lawyers hope that they can now perform new DNA tests that will
shed new doubt on McGinn's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush did Thursday, and the way in which he presaged it with
a series of remarks on Wednesday, suggested that he was at least
somewhat sensitive to his image as an especially fervent advocate
of capital punishment and pleased to happen upon a case that
allowed him to temper it.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Bush had almost always waited for courts to
complete their reviews of death-row inmates' appeals before he
signaled his own intentions or thinking on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush broke from that pattern this time around, gladly
telling reporters on Wednesday that he was likely to grant McGinn a
30-day reprieve. At the time, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
had yet to rule on the issue, and McGinn's lawyers had not turned
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican political strategists around the country said
that they doubted Bush was simply trying to soften his image by
showing a capacity for clemency. They noted that public support for
capital punishment still runs high and that Bush three years ago
declined to grant a reprieve in a much showier, more widely covered
case: that of a woman named Karla Faye Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that this is political,'' said Mike Murphy, who
was one of the principal strategists for Sen. John McCain's
presidential campaign. But, Murphy added, ``The truth is that the
explosion in DNA technology has really changed the death penalty
dynamic, and perhaps he's taking that reality into account a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, a spokesman for Bush, said Thursday afternoon
that McGinn's case was the first one Bush has faced as governor in
which the possibility of further DNA testing was so central to the
question of innocence or guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNA testing at the trial level was inconclusive and
there's an opportunity to get more information now from that test,
so he feels it's the right thing to do,'' Hughes said. ``These are
life and death decisions, and Governor Bush makes them based on
principle.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fate of McGinn from this point on remains unclear, because
his lawyers are in waters largely uncharted in Texas. They must
obtain the evidence they want tested, including clothing from the
victim that contained a semen stain and a pubic hair found on the
victim's body, and then analyze the DNA. But they said Thursday
that they are not certain whether they have just 30 days to
complete this, or whether the case now returns to a state district
judge to set a new execution date, which would give the defense
team at least 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   If DNA tests show that the hair and semen were not from McGinn,
``obviously he's not guilty of rape and he can't be executed,''
said Barry Scheck, a DNA expert who joined McGinn's defense team
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' Scheck said, ``the DNA testing might link
him to other crimes. These are all things to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how the tests turn out, prosecutors say they
expect the murder conviction to stand because of other evidence
that tied McGinn to the girl's killing.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, murder is punishable by death only if the killing
occurred under certain specified circumstances, including the
murder of a police officer or fireman in the line of duty;
committing murder during a kidnapping, burglary, robbery, rape,
arson, or prison escape; murdering for money, or paying someone
else to do so; and murdering a child under the age of six.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the death penalty threshold was achieved when the
jury found McGinn had also raped his stepdaughter.

TROJANS CONFIDENT DESPITE PLAYING NO. 1 TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC plays the No. 1 team in the nation at its own
ballpark, but the Trojans hardly sound intimidated heading into
this weekend's college baseball super regionals.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth-ranked Trojans (41-18) are in Atlanta to face
top-ranked Georgia Tech (50-14) in a best-of-three series beginning
at 4 p.m. PDT today. The winner advances to the College World
Series next week in Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're the team to beat,'' USC pitcher Mark Prior
said. ``We don't think we're an underdog. If they do, that's fine.
We're right up there with them, if not better than them.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior's confidence could stem from the fact he beat Georgia Tech
9-2 when the teams faced each other March 3 in a tournament at Cal
State Fullerton. But the Yellow Jackets did not use their ace,
left-hander Cory Vance (13-2, 3.21 earned-run average), who is 6-1
this season against ranked opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 50 games ago. We didn't see their No. 1 or No. 2
pitcher in that game,'' USC coach Mike Gillespie said. ``I thought
coming away from there they were a good club.''
</P>
<P>
   USC enters the series on a 13-game winning streak, the nation's
longest, and will start All-America second-team selection Rik
Currier (13-3, 3.27 ERA) tonight with Prior (9-6, 3.62) pitching
game three on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident. There's no question about it,'' Prior
said. ``The feeling on the team is we can come in and take two and
get out of here. I don't feel many people across the country feel
we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both teams feature quality pitching, the cramped
dimensions of Russ Chandler Stadium (320 feet down the foul lines)
could lead to high-scoring games. Tech third baseman Mark Teixeira,
who Thursday was named The Sporting News' College Baseball Player
of the Year, has hit 18 home runs and left fielder Jason Basil has
added 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the size of the ballpark, I'd love it if
we hit a couple cheap ones,'' Gillespie said. ``Our pitchers will
be ordered to throw only ground balls.''
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for the Trojans' offense figures to be shortstop
Seth Davidson, who was named the most outstanding player of last
week's regional at Cal State Fullerton. Davidson went 10 for 14
with a double, home run and six RBI last week and has hit safely in
23 of the past 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most significant difference on our team,'' Gillespie
said. ``For about a month, he's been on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have been resilient during their winning streak.
They overcame a 3-1 deficit in the ninth inning to defeat
Washington 4-3 on May 21 and allowed Virginia Tech, Loyola
Marymount and Cal State Fullerton to build 2-0 leads before
defeating those teams in regional contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think anything is going to stop us,'' Prior said.
``We want to send a team home on their home field, just like last
week.''
</P>
<P>
   USC will be the visiting team tonight and the home team
Saturday. A coin flip determines the home team for Sunday, if a
game is necessary.

SCHOOL VENDORS CHARGED WITH PRICE FIXING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Justice Department Thursday charged more than a
dozen food vendors that supply New York City schools with rigging
prices on multimillion dollar contracts for produce and frozen
foods.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors charged that 13 contractors conspired to fix
prices for more than $210 million in food contracts for the city
schools. They said that part of the price-fixing arrangement lasted
nearly a decade. Six of the 13 companies have agreed to plead
guilty and cooperate with the investigation, prosecutors said. They
said 22 officers and employees of the companies have also been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors estimated that the vendors inflated prices of the
food contracts by about 10 percent, or roughly $21 million for the
entire scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money should have been spent on the schoolchildren of New
York, not to line the pockets of greedy vendors,'' Joel L. Klein,
assistant attorney general for the antitrust division, said in a
statement on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said that some of the vendors were
also charged in another bid-rigging conspiracy involving other city
agencies, including city hospitals, jails and homeless shelters.
City contracting officials said Thursday that four of the companies
accused in the Board of Education case also sold to those city
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Manhattan Thursday afternoon, Klein said
that as a graduate of Brooklyn public schools, he was personally
offended by the evidence of ``despicable behavior'' uncovered by
federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see people come in and rip off these schools that are
trying to do a good job really tugs at one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the companies charged with the bid rigging
included almost all of the Board of Education's suppliers of frozen
food, like fish sticks, meats and french fries, as well as most
suppliers of fresh produce.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education has known about the investigation for
nearly six months, and has been working on a contingency plan to
ensure that food delivery to the schools would not be interrupted,
board officials said Thursday. The board has also hired an
independent monitor to oversee the operations of all food vendors.
Chad Vignola, general counsel to the chancellor, said the board
would continue to do business with some of the companies ``as we
attempt to work our way through this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the reason we would continue to do business with a
company is that it is under an independent monitor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Thursday that they have not uncovered any
incidents of bribery or public corruption in the case. Instead,
they said, the conspiracy involved vendors agreeing to submit false
bids to stifle competition for the food contracts. The prosecutors
said that vendors would designate one company as the low bidder for
a particular contract and would arrange their bids so that the
designated company would win.
</P>
<P>
   Barry W. Mawn, the assistant director in charge of the FBI in
New York, said the investigation, which began about 18 months ago,
established that the vendors secretly controlled the prices on many
of the contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had secret meetings,'' he said. ``They had secret
agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said in a statement that the companies
charged included: the Nick Penachio Co.; Irving Libertoff Inc.;
West Side Foods Inc.; M &AMP;F Meat Products Inc.; DiCarlo Distributors
Inc.; FHR Inc.; the Landmark Food Corp.; Loeb &AMP; Mayer Inc.; Food
Service Purchasing Agency Inc.; A. Bohrer Inc.; Kanowitz Fruit &AMP;
Produce; Clifton Fruit &AMP; Produce; and the Baiardi Chain Food Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the lawyer for one of the companies, the Nick Penachio
Co., said the firm would work to resolve the suit in a responsible
way. Gerald Shargel, the lawyer, said the company holds a contract
with the city's Board of Education and expects to retain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick Penachio Corp. has been a responsible corporate citizen
for 63 years,'' he said. ``The company will survive and the
business will continue.''

SHARE MISSILE-SHIELD IDEA WITH RUSSIANS, JOINT CHIEFS LEADER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, Mo. _ The administration's top military
adviser backed President Clinton's offer Thursday to share missile
defense technology with the Russians as a way to show that it poses
no threat to them.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry ``Hugh'' Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said during a visit to this home of the country's most
sophisticated bomber force that sharing the workings of the missile
defense system could ease Russian fears of the still-developing
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, who came to Missouri to speak at a conference of
prospective defense contractors in Warrensburg, repeated the
Pentagon's position that a missile defense would be geared only to
stop a nation with a few nuclear missiles, not the thousands Russia
could rain on U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is designed against a rogue nation, against a limited
threat, not anything like what the Russians have available to
them,'' Shelton told reporters in a hangar holding a B-2 stealth
bomber. ``We never will have that capability.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the two countries have helped stave off nuclear war
with the principle of so-called mutually assured destruction. It
promises that any nuclear launch would be suicidal because it would
trigger a retaliation leaving both nations, and perhaps the world,
in ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians see a missile defense as threat to that precarious
balance by giving the United States the ability to obliterate
targets without suffering similar losses. Clinton's statement this
week that he would share the know-how intended to ease those
worries, but there remains the question of whether the
cash-strapped Russians could afford to deploy a missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Recent scientific efforts suggest that it would be easy to foil
a missile defense by filling the skies with scores of dummy
missiles. Tests of the system _ its task is compared with striking
one bullet with another in flight _ have been mixed at best. And
Shelton noted that a full-blown attack of thousands of Russian
missiles would pose too many difficult targets for any system
currently imagined by defense planners.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the procurement conference organized by U.S. Rep.
Ike Skelton, a Democrat from Lexington and ranking minority member
of the House Armed Services Committee, Shelton said American
relations with the Russians, ``despite some bumps in the road...is
coming along.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his forces, however, were being stretched ever thinner
by peacekeeping operations and other long-term deployments around
the globe. And the general called for increased spending to outfit
America's military to ensure the country's invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't plan to settle for a fair fight...or `just good
enough.'... That's not the American way,'' Shelton said. ``We've
got to transform our military...in order to assure an unfair
advantage over any potential adversary....an advantage so great
that our enemies dare not challenge us.''

LAZIO FINDS IT TOUGH TO STICK TO SCRIPT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMARONECK, N.Y. _ As Rep. Rick A. Lazio set out from the
Republican convention in Buffalo, the immediate concern of his
Senate campaign was not what he said, but how he was photographed.
Everywhere Lazio went _ a vineyard in the Finger Lakes Wednesday, a
suburban schoolyard here Thursday _ his staff members vigorously
stage-directed the candidate and the news media, seeking the best
photographs of Lazio's inaugural bus tour.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Lazio was advised to refrain from attacks on
Hillary Rodham Clinton, because they might distract from these
carefully arranged images.
</P>
<P>
   That restraint lasted for all of five hours. Just past noon on
Lazio's very first day out, at a small sidewalk rally in Watkins
Glen, the candidate's high-minded and deliberately low-octane
discussion of education and the economy gave way to a mocking jab
at Clinton's book, ``It Takes a Village.''
</P>
<P>
   By dusk, he was heartily attacking the first lady as a
cloistered carpetbagger, suggesting that she was using the Secret
Service to shield her from the press and the public. ``We're not
going to have a bunch of bodyguards to hide behind,'' he pledged.
</P>
<P>
   The new Republican candidate for U.S. Senate has presented a
conflicted message during these opening days of his campaign. At
one moment, he has condemned negative campaigning and promised New
Yorkers a candidacy grounded in his values and ``mainstream
ideas,'' a campaign drawn in a series of settings chosen to
encourage picturesque, and not particularly weighty, coverage of
his first official swing as a candidate for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But at the next, Lazio has gone after Clinton with as much
spirit as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ever did, before he quit the race
for health reasons. ``Being a New Yorker is more than moving into a
multimillion-dollar house and putting on a Yankee cap,'' Lazio said
at a rally by a golf course in Binghamton. Some of these discordant
moments have even come within the space of a few lines in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, according to aides, it is the first Lazio that voters
should be seeing for now. The strategy, one Republican said, is for
Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, to keep his guns holstered for
the time being, allowing New Yorkers to get to know him for what he
is and what he stands for, rather than as a harsh carrier of
attacks on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he is intending to be somewhat vague and studiously
noncontroversial, relying on carefully arranged pictures _ like of
him eating a sandwich Thursday at Katz's Deli on the Lower East
Side _ rather than words to get himself known.
</P>
<P>
   That this task has turned out to be more than a little difficult
is, in part, a reflection of the aggressive nature and relative
inexperience of the 42-year-old candidate the Republicans have
chosen to send up against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, as Giuliani discovered when Lazio threatened to run a
primary race against him, has a taste for political combat. But
this is only his first race for statewide office, and a key skill
for any successful politician is knowing when not to say something,
a lesson that often comes only with time.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the conflicting signals out of the Lazio camp
suggest the difficult terrain that the candidate confronts as he
enters this complicated race. If this contest is going to be about
Clinton's shortcomings _ and that is, to a large extent, what his
aides want it to be about _ he needs to make Clinton the issue, and
one way is by raising questions about her credentials, philosophy
and character.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is time. In a more traditional campaign, Lazio would
have had months to quietly establish his credentials, biography and
record in the minds of voters, giving him the foundation from which
to attack his opponent come the fall. But Lazio is getting a
relatively late start, because of Giuliani's delayed departure from
the race. Clinton has been campaigning for a nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   And the candidate is facing conflicting pressures from inside
and outside his campaign on how quickly to proceed, which no doubt
accounts for the different faces he has shown during these early
days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has surely noticed that the applause lines that he uses in
more high-minded campaign moments _ ``We don't want to export any
more of our children out of state, do we?'' for example _ do not
get quite the response from his audience (or the reporters covering
him) as when he lashes out at the first lady as an opportunist.
</P>
<P>
   And senior Republicans in New York are expressing impatience
with Lazio's emphasis on image over political substance, and are
urging him to dispense with his slow wind-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about connecting with the voters and identifying the
candidate with the voters, as opposed to showing up in a nice
picture on a daily basis for 30 seconds on the national news,'' a
senior New York Republican said as part of a generally unhappy
assessment of Lazio's first run out. ``There's a legitimate need to
talk about Hillary's record and her stand on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and his advisers, in particular his chief strategist, Mike
Murphy, are not known for being shy about going on the attack. But
they are constrained by the history of candidates who have
squandered their credibility by starting off on the attack, and
this concern has been evident in the Lazio camp in the last few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has chastised reporters who have suggested in their
questioning that he is attacking Clinton. And Lazio's aides were
upset with newspaper headlines that portrayed Lazio as going on the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers are not strangers to tough campaign tactics
and, sensing the Republican candidate's discomfort, have thrown
marbles in his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like Congressman Lazio's bus took a wrong turn off
the high road today, offering New Yorkers more insults instead of
ideas,'' Howard Wolfson, the campaign spokesman, said moments after
Lazio made some critical remarks about the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Lazio's aides said that he would continue to steer away
from engaging Clinton as much as possible, hoping that with
experience comes restraint. And they are not even trying to conceal
their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   When Lazio was posing with workers at a milk processing factory
in Syracuse early this week, one of his aides noticed that
reporters were spilling into the picture and shooed them to the
back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing this for the cameras,'' he declared.''

NFL PLANNING EXPERIMENT TO PLACE CAMERAS IN HELMETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The National Football League is planning to let its
four television partners wire its players with microphones and put
miniature cameras inside their helmets during preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to experiment in the preseason and see how it
works,'' Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the league, said on Thursday.
If the plan works out, the technological toys could be used in the
regular season. ``But it may not be likely for this season,''
Aiello said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the most likely player to wear a ``HelmetCam'' or
a microphone would be the quarterback so viewers could hear him
barking signals. ``But it could be done for the free safety or the
middle linebacker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials may also be outfitted with miniature cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS, Fox and ESPN have wanted to use such enhancements for
years, but the league resisted. Last season, cameras were allowed
into locker rooms before games, and one player per team could wear
a microphone in pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer, the producer of ABC's ``Monday Night Football,''
asked owners last month to expand the use of cameras and sound this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL may be reacting to the wishes of networks paying a
combined $2.2 billion a year for the rights to show games _ as well
as to the announced plans of the XFL, the football league created
by the World Wrestling Federation and NBC, which starts play next
February. &QL;

BLAZERS FEEL CONFIDENT WITHIN CONFINES OF HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The ultrasound wire poked from underneath the
bandage on his left hand, causing Scottie Pippen's two dislocated
fingers to look like an antenna.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's some new technology we're trying out, to see if Mike can
send me some signals from the bench,'' Pippen, referring to Coach
Mike Dunleavy, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pippen was a beacon for the Portland Trail Blazers as
they avoided elimination with a 96-88 victory Tuesday night against
the Lakers at Los Angeles. Even after sustaining the injury to his
nonshooting hand early in the second quarter, Pippen continued to
play aggressively and energized the Trail Blazers' chances in the
four-of-seven-game Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that trails three games to two, the Trail Blazers
sound as though they are in command of this series. Their
confidence hinged on the fact that Game 6 is Friday night at home
in the Rose Garden, where the Lakers won Games 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers contend that the odds of losing three straight
games at home are as improbable as Pippen's not playing Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers had the fifth-best home record in the National
Basketball Association during the regular season and were 5-0 in
the playoffs until the Lakers beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie gave up his body for the whole game and really
motivated us to take the ball to the hole strong,'' Brian Grant
said of Pippen's 22 points, 6 steals, 6 rebounds and 4 blocked
shots in Game 5. ``That is the thing we haven't been doing the past
couple games.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen said of his two dislocated fingers: ``I feel better. I've
got a little more motion in them. I'll be fine.``
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's hand and the sprained foot of the Lakers' Kobe Bryant's
are the subplots to Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   While Pippen took control of his team, Bryant faded from the
Lakers' offense, especially after hurting his foot in the first
quarter. He forced shots and passes, finishing with 17 points on
4-of-13 shooting. And he had six turnovers before fouling out with
4 minutes 45 seconds to play. He missed practice on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers' defense, especially Pippen, has clamped down
hard on Bryant, who is 9 of 28 in the last two games. For the
series, he has averaged 17 points, shot 40.6 percent and made 15
turnovers, well off his numbers (24 points, 7 turnovers and 55.6
percent shooting) in three regular-season games against the Trail
Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been a lot of talk about Kobe guarding Pippen and
doing what he had done,'' Dunleavy said. `Basically, I said the
game plan was to go at Kobe more.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's only breakout came in Game 3, when he scored 25 points,
including 18 in the first half, to keep the Lakers afloat with a
93-91 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not giving him any space to operate out there,''
Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said. ``I think that he's trying to
figure out how to get himself free. As a consequence, once he takes
his second dribble, they're able to jump all over him.'' &QL;

KNICKS STILL HEARING THE EWING QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Just after the New York Knicks lost Game 5
Wednesday night, the door to the locker room swung open. Slumped
forward in a chair, his face weary from exhaustion, Patrick Ewing
was decorated in ice bags like purple hearts.
</P>
<P>
   He was a vision of valor, but also a figure cursed by longevity.
At age 37, Ewing's aching body has the dents and rust of an
appliance placed curbside even as he continues to push forward. As
he nears the end of his 15th season with the Knicks, he has amassed
wealth and an historic place, but his extended stay in New York
City has yet to turn up a title or public affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the legacy has already been written for Patrick
here,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said Thursday after practice. ``He is
the best Knick ever, but he's not the most popular one.''
</P>
<P>
   He limps, but he is not Willis Reed. Thursday, on the eve of
Game 6 at Madison Square Garden, with his team one game from
elimination, down 3-2 to Indiana, Ewing was forced to confront an
issue that has only cemented his status as a tragic figure: are the
Knicks better without him? Just the question must sting even the
callous skin Ewing has developed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to it,'' said Ewing, who expects to play in Game 6
after his Game 5 comeback from a two-game absence due to tendinitis
in his right foot. ``I don't worry about it. I'm hurt. But I feel
like I can step on the court and help the team. I've got to come
out and try to play.''
</P>
<P>
   And play effectively _ or else the season could end. The Knicks
are in a dire situation, similar to the one they were in when they
fell behind Miami, 3-2 , in the conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest difference is, Indiana's a better team''
than Miami, Van Gundy said. ``Again, we have to find a way to play
one great home game to get the season down to one game back there
in Indiana. That's all we should be thinking about, making the
necessary corrections to be ready mentally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   They were at their prepared best against Miami. In that series,
Ewing came through with critical free throws and timely offense to
help remove the team from harm's way. But the Heat series seems so
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Ewing's teammates seem to have had their
consciousness pierced by the repeated quote of a glaring statistic:
over the last two years in the playoffs, the Knicks are 5-1 without
Ewing against Indiana. Privately, one player uttered his
frustration with the way the pace of Game 5 bogged down once the
offense started to go through Ewing. It was certainly not his
fault, but an 18-point Knicks lead in the second quarter began to
vanish once Ewing, among others, began lofting up jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did nothing better in the first quarter other than we made
shots,'' Van Gundy said. ``We didn't guard any better. We didn't
rebound better. We didn't make hustle plays. It's fool's gold
thinking you're going to shoot your way to a win.''
</P>
<P>
   In Games 3 and 4, the Knicks were a penetrating team that
created open shots. And they also rebounded, which they didn't do
with a bigger lineup in Game 5. This lack of aggressiveness with
Ewing on the floor in Game 5 puzzled Latrell Sprewell, for one. Was
it Ewing, the Pacers' assertiveness, or something else?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's the case or not, with Patrick on the
floor, whether we're better or not,'' Sprewell said Thursday. `'I
just don't know. I feel in my heart that we need Patrick and need
him to play well. We need everyone to play well if we expect to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look just at the numbers, the numbers definitely say
we're better without him. We've won five and lost one without him.
If you look at that, that's probably the case. That's what the
numbers say.''
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Ewing partially tore his Achilles' tendon against
Indiana during Game 2 of the conference finals and missed the rest
of the playoffs. In his absence, a liberated Knicks team used an
up-tempo style as it went on a journey to the NBA finals. With a
boot cast on his foot, and despair in his mood, Ewing watched from
the bench in a suit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the scene was revisited when Ewing pulled up six
minutes into Game 2. Unlike last year, Ewing is back _ whether his
teammates welcome it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point of the year, to me, it's an overanalyzed
issue,'' Van Gundy said. ``We had no problem winning with Patrick
on the floor against Miami. And this has nothing to do with
Latrell, but when you lose at this time of the year, when the
stakes are higher, there's not enough reflection on what each
person can do differently by the individual. And there's more
reflection on what others should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it, the players have been asked about it so often. Once
you've been given this stat all the time, you start to believe it a
little. I don't think our strong-willed guys will believe it.''

FASHIONMALL.COM SWOOPS IN FOR THE BOO.COM FIRE SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The remnants of Boo.com, the fashion Web retailer that
sought bankruptcy here last week when investors refused to give it
more cash, were acquired Thursday by Fashionmall.com, a New York
Internet company, for an undisclosed price.
</P>
<P>
   The deal opens a new chapter in the troubled life of Boo.com,
which was originally backed by the French luxury-goods magnate
Bernard Arnault, the Benneton family of Italy, J.P. Morgan and
Goldman Sachs, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by two 29-year-old Swedish entrepreneurs, the company
burned through 125 million pounds, or about $188 million, in just
six months in an attempt to create a worldwide fashion e-tailer
selling goods in multiple languages and currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Boo.com's rapid expansion and its staff's spending on luxury
offices, first-class plane travel and five-star hotels came to
symbolize the excesses of the Internet boom.
</P>
<P>
   Although its Internet technology won raves for an ability to let
users view clothes in three dimensions from all angles, the company
utterly failed to generate the kind of business it had envisioned.
Boo.com's demise was Europe's biggest Internet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Boo.com's remains Thursday to Fashionmall.com
includes the Boo.com brand, Web address, advertising materials and
online content. The deal does not include any of Boo.com's back-end
technology, distribution and fulfillment systems or physical
assets. Boo.com's back-end technology was sold earlier this week to
Bright Station PLC, a British Internet company, for 250,000 pounds
_ a fraction of the reported 70 million pounds Boo.com was said to
have paid for it. KPMG, the consulting and advisory firm, is
handling the liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Nasarin, chief executive of Fashionmall.com, declined
to say how much he spent, but said it was more than what Bright
Station paid.
</P>
<P>
   Fashionmall.com opened in 1994 as one of the first Internet
fashion sites. It plans to use the Boo.com brand to create a
high-end site similar to its existing one rather than continue to
run the company as an online retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a phenomenal job building their brand,'' Nasarin
said. ``They were probably ahead of their time, but such is life.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashionmall.com is hoping to migrate Boo.com's existing
customers to a new site using the same name that will act as a
virtual mall, selling goods through separate vendors and charging a
commission for each sale.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Boo.com's troubles, it attracted more visitors than
Fashionmall.com. According to Media Metrix, a research firm that
tracks Internet site visits, Boo.com recorded 558,000 visitors in
April, versus 208,000 for Fashionmall.com.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts questioned the rationale for buying a brand that has
the taint of failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been much maligned,'' Ken Cassar, senior retail analyst
at Jupiter Communications, said of Boo.com's brand. ``It's an open
question if it's an asset or liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasarin asserted, ``The brand has not been tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's business plan may have been tarnished,'' he
added, ``but I'm not buying their business plan.''

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an effort to spruce up Los Angeles for the
Democratic National Convention in August, city animal officials
have ordered a roundup of stray dogs and plan to euthanize more
dogs to relieve crowded kennels, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge we're facing is severe overcrowding,'' said Dan
Knapp, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Animal
Services. ``Point A, and the catalyst for this change, is the
Democratic National Convention. Point B is the City Council ...
emphasizing getting these stray dogs off the streets to make the
streets safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights activists are outraged by the plan, saying the
aggressive push to reduce overcrowding is inhumane and does nothing
to solve the problem of unwanted dogs in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is slaughter,'' said Laura Heisen of Agoura, a volunteer
at the Los Angeles Animal Services East Valley kennel. ``I believe
that we do have a big problem with pack dogs in some parts of the
city, but what they're doing is not going to solve the problem.
They just want to make things nice for the reporters and the
politicians for the Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, animal-control officials put up for adoption about
200 dogs every day at each of the city's six kennels. Under the new
plan, which could begin the second week of July, workers will hold
for adoption only about 61 dogs a day at each shelter, Knapp said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Strays not suitable for adoption will be kept separately and
euthanized after five to seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Knapp said he does not know how many more dogs will be
euthanized under the new plan, but that about 40 percent are put to
sleep now because of illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in grief, and we're depressed. This is a hard decision
to make. We exist to provide life, and we've all struggled with the
reality,'' he said. ``The casualties will be that we will be
euthanizing more dogs that would have been available for adoption.
We don't know how many.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is so severe that Knapp estimates the kennels are
nearly 200 percent over capacity.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most cramped kennel is in South Central -- a
1920s-vintage temporary shelter with a population of 7,845 dogs as
of January. The second most crowded kennel is in the Northeast
Valley, with 5,183 dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Animal Control Department, with a nearly $13 million budget
and approximately 50 animal-control officers, has struggled over
how to deal with the severe crowding for several years.
Animal-control officers catch nearly 8,000 stray dogs a year and
receive an additional 27,000 dogs as dropoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding pressure is a law that took effect in January 1999 that
forces cities and counties to provide more care for sick and
injured animals rather than euthanize them. It extended the
mandatory hold period from three to seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski recommended that
officials approve a $140 million bond measure on the November 2000
ballot to pay for five more kennels in the city and to refurbish
the other six.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached a period where the animal population is simply
out of control in the city,'' according to Miscikowski's deputy,
Glenn Barr. ``Nobody likes to enhance the collection and
euthanization of animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with attacks by pit bulls and other stray dogs citywide,
the City Council has pushed aggressive spay-and-neutering programs,
including a new, higher fee for unaltered dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacoima and the Northeast Valley have always been the highest
ranked areas (for) stray dogs, unfortunately,'' said Councilman
Alex Padilla's spokesman, David Gershwin. ``There are far too many
stray dogs on the street. We need to beef up and provide additional
funding, greater coverage for this chronic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers also established a Web site devoted to displaying
pictures of dogs offered for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Tia Maria Torres of the Villalobos Rescue Center, a Los Angeles
pit bull rescue group, believes there are other, longer-term
solutions to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many humane groups (that) offer help fostering
these animals with aggressive adoption programs and volunteering to
help train owners,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is like the major talk of the town right now.
Pit bulls are going to be the first to go. I understand (the
shelters') dilemma. They're filled up. But stop running with the
problem and get with these humane groups to solve the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Teri Austin, president of Amanda Foundation, an organization
that rescues dogs and cats from city animal shelters, is critical
of the plan, calling it a ``cold and inhumane way to handle the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a numbers game,'' she said. ``It's about looking good. If
you make less animals adoptable then you should have a higher rate
of adoption. The result is that more animals are going to die
because they're not going to get a chance to be adopted.''

DIMAGGIO TRUSTEE SUES SAN FRANCISCO TO KEEP NAME OF BASEBALL 
 GREAT OFF CITY PLAYGROUND
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By EDWARD EPSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  The trustee of Joe DiMaggio's estate declared war on San
Francisco Thursday, suing to prevent the city from renaming the
North Beach Playground in honor of the baseball great.
<P>
   The action by longtime DiMaggio attorney and friend Morris
Engelberg of Hollywood, Fla., was greeted with disbelief and anger
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, filed in Miami, Engelberg charged that San
Francisco's plan was not a suitable honor for someone of the
stature of DiMaggio, the North Beach sandlot star who went on to
Hall of Fame greatness with the New York Yankees and then earned a
place in America's celebrity pantheon through his marriage to
Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco ``should not be given carte blanche to name the
city junk yard, the city waste dump, in this case the North Beach
Playground, or any other such facility after Joe DiMaggio, without
consent,'' says the lawsuit filed in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to forcing the city not to rename the playground
where DiMaggio and his brothers played ball as kids, Engelberg
sought unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaintiff doesn't believe that it's a fitting park or
place that should carry the DiMaggio name,'' said Miami attorney
Jeffrey Herman, who worked on the suit for the estate.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg, who has been feuding with San Francisco since shortly
after DiMaggio died at age 84 in March 1999, said naming the
playground after DiMaggio ``is both morally and legally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised Joe, not only during the years I was with him but
also on his deathbed, to protect his name at whatever sacrifice to
myself,'' Engelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   When Supervisor Gavin Newsom, who has worked to find a suitable
honor for the longtime Marine District resident, sent Engelberg a
long list of possible honors for DiMaggio, the attorney selected
either the Bay Bridge or San Francisco International Airport. But
Mayor Willie Brown and Newsom later said those were unworkable,
too-grand ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Newsom thought he had heard the last of
Engelberg. In April, when Brown and Newsom announced plans to
finally act on a 20-year-old city plan to name the playground for
DiMaggio, Engelberg told The Chronicle that his earlier comments
threatening legal action had been overblown.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had never threatened a lawsuit. ``I'm not going to
take money from (DiMaggio's) grandchildren'' to go to court, said
Engelberg, who is trustee for an estate in which the grandchildren
are heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that's consistent here is Mr. Engelberg's
inconsistency,'' Newsom said Thursday. ``Once again, he's
contradicting his own statements.''
</P>
<P>
   He charged that Engelberg had commercial motives for the
lawsuit. ``Mr. Engelberg's got a book deal and hired a personal
manager. I hear he's looking for $2 million for his book and that
magazines are doing articles about him and Mr. DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsom also said it was a slap in the face for Engelberg to
compare the playground to a garbage dump. ``That's an insult to
every San Franciscan, to North Beach and to tens of thousands of
kids who use that playground every year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said $3.5 million of renovations will begin next month at the
2.5-acre park, which includes blacktop ball diamonds, tennis and
bocce courts, a swimming pool and a playground. No signs honoring
DiMaggio have yet been erected.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom said private local attorneys, including Iran-contra
prosecutor John Keker, have written to him offering to handle for
free any suit filed by Engelberg.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Slavin, an assistant to City Attorney Louise Renne, said
the city will fight Engelberg's suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the playground was renamed recently, it was our opinion
that it was a legally sound action,'' Slavin said. ``That's still
our opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, it's a frivolous lawsuit and an
insult to San Francisco and a great American who we are trying to
honor,'' Slavin added. ``It's hard to fathom any opposition to such
a human gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Slavin said the city's first step probably will be to try to get
the suit moved from Florida to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In his suit, Engelberg said he he was trying to protect the
commercial value of the DiMaggio name. Allowing use of the name
without permission dilutes that value, causing financial problems
for the estate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city attorney's office has said Engelberg's concern can
extend only to the commercial use of the name and not to the city
naming a public site after someone.
</P>
<P>
   In North Beach, an old DiMaggio friend, 81-year-old Dante
Benedetti, said Engelberg was being a bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anyone ever have the guts to ask him where he comes
from?'' Benedetti said. ``He should stay in Florida and mind his
own business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe DiMaggio spent most of his young life at the North Beach
Playground,'' recalled Benedetti, the owner of the New Pisa
Restaurant and former University of San Francisco baseball coach,
who was there with DiMaggio and his brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In his suit, Engelberg also went after Joe DiMaggio's younger
brother, Dom, who has endorsed the playground plan.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said Dom DiMaggio, a major league star in his own
right, does not speak for the estate and ``was not even included in
the will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominic DiMaggio owns real estate in the North Beach
Playground area which would benefit from the use of the Joe
DiMaggio name in the neighborhood,'' the complaint read.
</P>
<P>
   Dom DiMaggio could not be reached for comment Thursday. In
April, he said, ``I am personally extremely pleased'' by the
planned honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know deep down in my heart that Joe would be very thrilled
as deeply as I am,'' added Dom DiMaggio, who has rarely had
anything good to say about Engelberg during the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was in New Orleans Thursday for a one-day civic trip. His
spokesman Ron Vinson said, ``Our efforts to honor one of our most
accomplished athletes will withstand any self-serving legal
challenge from Mr. Engelberg.''

LAKERS WILL TRY TO LAND KNOCKOUT PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The avenues surrounding Staples Center are
newly resurfaced, as if some overly eager public-works official got
a little ahead of himself and ordered up a downtown preening in
anticipation of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   So the streets of L.A. appear ready for the party. But its
basketball team appeared otherwise earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could have had their finals invitations in hand by
now, but the Portland Trail Blazers denied them that honor Tuesday
night by winning Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the Lakers weren't quite ready for prime time. Their
coach said as much when he called the loss ``good for us,'' musing
once again that they had lessons to learn.
</P>
<P>
   They'll get another chance to show progress, and wrap up this
series, tonight in Game 6 at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to understand there's a certain sense of carriage
that you have as a basketball team, there's a certain sense of how
you go about taking care of business when you have an opportunity
to close out a series like this,'' coach Phil Jackson said
Thursday. ``That you make adjustments during the course of a game,
you don't stay rigid, denied.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened when the Lakers failed to cope with early foul
trouble to guards Kobe Bryant, Ron Harper and Brian Shaw, or adjust
to the Blazers' pressure defense.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Lakers could face their greatest adjustment of all _
playing with a hobbled Kobe, and perhaps no Kobe at all.
</P>
<P>
   Though listed as probable for tonight's game, Bryant is bothered
by a sprained right foot, and Jackson called him a ``game-time
decision.'' So a team that seems to play its best under duress has
an added source of stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're already on edge, with or without having to deal
with the fact that Kobe's injured right now a little bit,'' said
teammate Derek Fisher. ``We recognize that we let another
postseason opportunity to close out a series get by us.
</P>
<P>
   ``And dealing with that is sometimes tough and disappointing,
but we've just talked about the fact that it's still part of this
learning process we've been going through all season long, trying
to learn how to be the best team in this league. And we have
accomplished more this season than we ever have. And this is
another step in trying to reach that potential and reach that
plateau that people want us to r know that we're capable of
reaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland has the momentum and the home court tonight, but
neither concept has meant much in this series.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won convincingly in Game 1 but stumbled in Game 2.
They put together an impressive two-game sweep in Portland last
weekend but couldn't deliver that energy in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   As for home-court advantage, there has been none. The road team
has won the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's down to a battle of sports truisms: On one side,
there's the challenge of beating a team three straight games on its
home floor (the Lakers' task tonight); on the other side, the
challenge of beating a top-rated team three straight games period
(the Blazers' task if they can stretch this to a seventh game).
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that it's tough to beat a good team three times in a
row, it's a challenge for us to beat Portland three times in a row,
and a good enough team to understand that,'' Jackson said. ``In the
same regard, they have to beat us three times in a row. So we know
that we' driver's seat of this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To close it out, the Lakers will try to regain the poise and
precision their offense lacked in Tuesday's loss. That will mean
finding Shaquille O'Neal early and often, but it will also require
finding a shooting rhythm for everyone else to avoid another 38
percent shooting night.
</P>
<P>
   ``One game, you know,'' said Robert Horry, who made 3 of 11
shots in Game 5. ``So we've got a lot of opportunities for guys to
come out there and just keep shooting. I just hope nobody's
hesitant, because that's going to make your shot really off, to be
hesitant.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Lakers have the mathematical advantage _ they
have two chances to get a win, while the Blazers have zero room for
a slip-up. Not that anyone is counting on coming home for a Game 7
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our eyes we have no cushion,'' Horry said, ``because we
want to go out and take care of the next game. People always say
you've got a cushion because you've got two games. That's not an
option. Yo go out there and play hard for the game you got, because
you never know what's going to happen.''

SCIOSCIA AND OTHER EX-DODGERS TO FACE OLD CLUB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Almost from the moment he was announced as the
Anaheim Angels' new manager, Mike Scioscia has had to answer
questions about his past.
</P>
<P>
   His Los Angeles Dodgers past.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when one spends 22 years in one
organization. He spent 17 seasons as a player in the organization
and five as a coach/manager. He credits all-time greats like Roy
Campanella and John Roseboro, among others, for being his mentors.
</P>
<P>
   But when his Angels take on the Dodgers tonight to begin a
three-game series at Edison Field, Scioscia says the Dodgers might
as well be from Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concerned with the 25 guys in this clubhouse than
about any other club,'' he said. ``As far as playing the Dodgers,
honestly, it's just another ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, Mike. Just another ballclub?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's a strong connection to where I am now in my
baseball career and what I did with the Dodgers,'' he said. ``All
of my foundation was laid with the Dodgers. There are a lot of
people over there who took time to work with me. I have a lot of
great memories and a lot of great friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't change my commitment to this club. (The
Dodgers) are just another club we're trying to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia has the Angels over .500 (27-26) and in the middle of
the AL West race, despite predications of doom and gloom. Scioscia
talked confidently of his club from the start of spring training
and his players have backed him up both on the field and in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He is a manager who preaches to his players the importance of
``turning the page'' from one game to the next. And he practices
his approach with his own career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about where I am now, to be here with the
Angels,'' he said, ``helping lay down the building blocks to get
this organization to be the perennial contender everybody thinks it
can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia's coaching staff is made up primarily of ex-Dodgers.
Hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, third-base coach Ron Roenicke and
first-base coach Alfredo Griffin all spent time with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Roenicke played for the Dodgers only three seasons (1981-83),
but he coached and managed in the organization from 1992-98,
including managing Triple-A Albuquerque for the last half of the
1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any way to block that out,'' Roenicke
said. ``When I was a player, I went to so many other teams that
coming back to face them then wasn't really a big deal. But now
after going back to coach for them, I can't block that out. I can't
say I want to beat up on them, but the games are more meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenicke left the Dodgers after the 1998 season to manage at
Fresno, the Giants' Triple-A club. After spending so much time in
the Dodgers organization, particularly working with the players in
the minor leagues, one might think Roenicke wishes he could have
stayed there. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the same people were still running the club there, that
would have been great,'' he said. ``But (Peter) O'Malley left,
(Fred) Claire left. With all those changes over there, no, I'm much
happier where I am because of the people here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher became a fan favorite with the Dodgers for his hustle
and goofy demeanor. He also coached from the low minors up to the
major-league club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a place I thought I'd spend the rest of my life,''
Hatcher said. ``There's going to be emotion because of the fans.
The fans meant a lot for me. They motivated me and were behind me.
That part's going to be good. In Anaheim we see a lot of people
that went to Dodger games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's changed so much over there now, a lot of people I was
close to have gone somewhere else.''

 THE CITY OF THE RUDE AND CRUDE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
I'll tell you where I stand on dog poop.
<P>
   I am opposed to it as lawn sculpture in public parks.
</P>
<P>
   I fully support Mayor Willie Brown's plan to assign two park
patrol cops to full-time duty citing dog owners who don't clean up.
The city has a SWAT team, it should also have a SQUAT team.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani launched a campaign
to promote common courtesy, and it's about time San Francisco did
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Civility is on the decline. We've got road hogs, jaywalkers,
jaybikers, jayboarders, stereo blasters, cell-phone yellers,
litterbugs, rude Muni and taxi drivers, rude Muni and taxi riders.
</P>
<P>
   The city is brimming with selfish oafs who wouldn't give up
their seat on the bus to a 90-year-old pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   High on my list of the rude &AMP; crude: dog owners who don't scoop.
Disgusting. They should be ordered to do community service, given a
glove and assigned to fill a 10-gallon receptacle.
</P>
<P>
   That said, how would you like to draw this patrol assignment
right out of the Police Academy?
</P>
<P>
   Reader Steve Abney is worried about possible snags in the
mayor's plan. Establishing guilt could be difficult, he notes,
because this isn't like ballistics, where you match the bullet to
the gun barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what if you snitched on a negligent pet owner?'' Abney
wonders. ``Would you be a stool pigeon?''
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the Pooper Troopers.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW Chrysler PT Cruiser is hot, because a lot of Boomer men
have always secretly lusted for a hip, customized '40s delivery
van. It's a Boomer guy thing. You wouldn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Dieter Rapp phoned John Irish Chrysler in San Rafael to arrange
for a test drive. Sorry, the salesman said, no demos. Go rent a
Cruiser from Thrifty, then come in and place your order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee,'' said Dieter, ``that's not the way I envisioned buying a
new car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's working for us,'' the salesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp phoned Chrysler, was told if he ordered right away, he
might get his Cruiser within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Wow, a delivery van that takes a year to be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   CONCRETE JUNGLE: Steve Wall has noticed something missing at SFO
over the years _ landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a single plant alive anywhere near SFO?'' Steve asks,
rhetorically. ``Nope. Which is amazing, in a state with such a
great gardening climate. Maybe they could use that shot-up Muni bus
as a huge flower pot, to get things started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns, police, buses and flowers. Add some music (and drugs?),
and the summer of eLove has just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they're going to use that bus for street cleaning.
Fill it with water (driver in scuba gear, of course) and drive it
around town.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T BOTHER to try to get a cab or dinner reservation next week
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   JavaOne is in town Monday through Thursday with its high-tech
show and 20,000 javaheads. It's probably San Francisco's
second-biggest show-convention of the year (Seybold brings in about
36,000).
</P>
<P>
   Twenty thousand human search engines in search of a high-tech
old time. Is that a mouse in your pocket, or a roll of venture
capital?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what JavaOne is, but if these people are searching
for java, they're coming to the right place.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENTISTS have found an ozone hole above the North Pole much
like the one above the South Pole, which proves what Randy Alfred
has suspected _ ``The planet is suffering from a bipolar
disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what the ozone holes looks like above the heads of TV
news people and country singers who use too much hair spray?
</P>
<P>
   And I wonder what Rush Limbaugh has to say about the latest
scientific discovery above the North Pole. I forgot to listen to
his show today.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his best-selling books, Rush devoted a lot of space to
debunking the laughably baseless claims of fear-mongering
environmentalists who are trying to deprive captains of industry of
their divine right to pollute for profit.
</P>
<P>
   As scientific evidence piles up against Rush's arguments, we
await his best-selling mea culpa and pledge to help rescue Earth.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, a recent reference here to the Rushster as blimp had
nothing to do with his size. Give the man credit, he has trimmed
his jib, now consumes a far smaller share of the world's oxygen and
dead-animal treats.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's a svelte bag of hot gas.
</P>
<P>
   THE BANDITO in ``Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' for those
hoping to fill crucial gaps in their educations in anticipation of
cashing in on ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' was Alfonso
Bedoya.
</P>
<P>
   He's the grinning Mexican bad guy who made the famous ``stinking
badges'' speech to Humphrey Bogart. Bedoya was born in Mexico, was
a character in more than 40 movies in the U.S. and Mexico, and died
in Mexico in '57, at age 53, his health destroyed by drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports that Bedoya is buried in Hollister, the three
cemeteries in that city say they have no record of him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he didn't need no stinking headstone.

 TECH MAVENS MEET CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS AT 3-DAY RETREAT  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ About 20 House and Senate Democrats will meet
with Silicon Valley business leaders Friday and Saturday in a
get-together that's as much about old-time politics as it is about
the nation's high-tech future.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth annual Bay Area New Economy Retreat, which began
Thursday, features three days of workshops on such issues as
``Biotechnology and Genomics'' and ``Emerging Issues in E-Commerce
and the Internet.'' But between the high-powered seminars, there's
plenty of time built-in for the technology mavens to chat quietly
with members of Congress about what Silicon Valley needs from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just an opportunity for (scheduled) discussion,''
said Gabriela Prado, a spokeswoman for TechNet, the Silicon Valley
business group co-sponsoring the San Francisco retreat. ``There are
also receptions scheduled and places where our members can get
together with the political people.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with the event's other sponsor, the New
Democrat Network. Linking politicians with high-tech leaders _ and
their money _ is an important part of what the group does.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the premier gathering of New Economy leaders in
Northern California,'' said Simon Rosenberg, president of the New
Democrat Network. ``We want to be a force for a more modern
Democratic Party, but we also want to influence the agenda for the
entire Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that likely agenda is going to be important to Silicon
Valley. The so-called ``New Democrats'' helped pass the Internet
tax ban and provided most of the Democratic votes for the China
trade bill that passed last week, both measures strongly backed by
the high-tech community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Democrats are just a modern version of the traditional
Democrats,'' Rosenberg said. ``They're usually more
internationalist and trade-oriented, but tolerant on social
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   With 65 members, the New Democratic Coalition is now the largest
caucus in the House, and their centrist agenda plays well in the
moderate swing districts that are going to be the battlegrounds in
the Democrats' efforts to grab control of the House from
Republicans in November. The NDN is a political action committee
that raises money to get more of those New Democrats elected,
Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a venture capital fund for the Democratic Party,
investing in a new generation of leaders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the reasons Assemblyman Mike Honda, state Sen.
Adam Schiff, Assemblywoman Susan Davis and former Rep. Jane Harmon
_ all Democratic candidates in California's four most hotly
contested congressional races _ will be at the retreat, rubbing
shoulders with the high-tech leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Even the technology seminars have their political side. The
topics, which include privacy, education and the digital divide,
cybersecurity and intellectual property protection, are all issues
important to the high-tech world and likely to come before the
Congress soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to design an agenda that covers issues that not only
the Valley is focused on, but that members of Congress might have
questions about,'' Prado said. ``Often the politicians aren't as
well-versed as they would like to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Bob Graham of Florida and John Kerry of Massachusetts top
the list of attendees, while California Reps. Anna Eshoo of
Atherton, Cal Dooley of Visalia and Mike Thompson of Napa are among
those expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important gathering, because it brings members (of
Congress) into the place where ideas are created,'' said Eshoo,
whose district includes strongholds of the computer and biotech
industry. ``When Congress is in session, we have very little time
to meet with people who are part of this (high-tech industry) to
have discussions and ask questions. This is a very important
tutorial.''
</P>
<P>
   About 150 members of TechNet, which works with both Democratic
and Republican groups, are expected at the retreat, which began
Thursday afternoon with a seminar at a Palo Alto biotech firm and
continues through tomorrow with meetings at the Metreon in downtown
San Francisco.

MARTINEZ A BIGGER HIT THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Alex Rodriguez remembers the exact situation when he
realized Edgar Martinez was in the middle of something special.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third inning on May 15 vs. the Twins at Safeco Field.
Rodriguez was on first base after a leadoff single.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had been demolishing baseballs with consistency for a
couple of weeks already, but in this at-bat he surprised even his
long-time teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits a ball (foul) out to left field,'' Rodriguez said.
``Then he hits a ball (again) foul out to right field. Then he hits
the ball out to center (for a home run).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching this and going, `What's up? That not fair.'
Nobody's supposed to be able to do that. I've been Edgar's teammate
for six or seven years now, and I thought I'd seen everything he
could do, good and bad. But he still surprises me. He's been
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez continues to amaze and surprise American League
pitchers, too, although it's unlikely they are as jazzed about it
as Rodriguez. For the month, Martinez hit, as he did in the May 15
at-bat against Minnesota's Eric Milton, line drives to left, right
and center.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez owned May. He hit .441 (45-for-102). He hit 10 homers
and drove in 32 runs. He scored 24 runs. He was a machine. The
batting average and RBI total were the best in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Now here comes June, and here come the San Diego Padres. And
here comes Tony Gwynn. To many people, Gwynn (begin italic) is (end
italic) the Padres. To Martinez, Gwynn is hitting. Although
Martinez is regarded as one of the best right-handed hitters of his
generation, he looks to the left-handed Gwynn, an eight-time
National League batting champ, the way a Catholic looks to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony's one of my favorite hitters,'' Martinez said. ``I'd love
the chance to just sit down and talk hitting with him. I never have
had the chance, but I watch his every at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   As the designated hitter, Martinez generally leaves the dugout
when the other side is hitting. He'll go do some stretching or take
some swings _ anything to stay loose. But if you're among the
Safeco crowd this weekend, watch the Mariners' dugout when Gwynn is
at the plate. You'll see Martinez, soaking up every nuance of the
master. Michelangelo honing his craft in Da Vinci's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make sure I watch all of Tony's at-bats,'' Martinez said.
``His swing is amazing. He is so aware of what he's doing right and
of what he's doing wrong. He studies his swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, a career .320 hitter, also studies Gwynn's swing, even
though the Padres legend, a career .339 hitter, is left-handed and
Martinez is right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always anxious to learn what he does at the plate, to
adapt it to what I do,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   And what Martinez does, simply, is what Gwynn does. He hits.
They both hit. Against right-handers. Against left-handers. Against
flame-throwers. Against marshmallow tossers. What has made both men
special over the years is an ability to hit against anyone at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that amazes me about Edgar,'' said teammate Jamie
Moyer, Friday night's starting pitcher, ``is the way he can control
an at-bat. Normally, as a pitcher you always feel you control the
at-bat. You have the ball, you know what pitch you want to make,
and where.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with Edgar, he takes that away from you. He controls the
at-bat. ... As long as he's got one pitch left, he's in control. If
you're pitching to him, it's scary to see how good he is.''
</P>
<P>
   For left fielder Rickey Henderson, now playing with Martinez
after years on the other side of the field, Martinez is simply
``the best right-handed hitter around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just watch what he does,'' Henderson said. ``He studies
hitters. He studies pitchers. He learns from both of them. I've
been watching him for 10 or 12 years now, and he still has the same
habits, the same bat speed and the same bat control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always a tough out.''
</P>
<P>
   For manager Lou Piniella, who has the pleasure of writing
Martinez's name into the lineup 150 or so times a year, Martinez's
special skill is his ability to make the good times roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched Edgar for a lot of years now (eight), and the
thing that separates him from just about every other hitter is his
ability to stay locked in,'' Piniella said. ``If a normal batter
will get in a zone for a week, he'll get in it for two weeks. If a
normal batter will get in a zone for two weeks, Edgar will get
there for three or four.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to extend things when he's going good, and he
knows how to keep the bad times, the slumps, to a minimum. That's
what makes him so dangerous. He's a threat to get a hit or drive in
a run almost every time he's at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella and Rodriguez both mention Martinez in terms of the
Hall of Fame. Martinez says he is flattered by the nominations, but
quickly adds, ``I don't have the numbers yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He does have two batting titles (1992, '95), and he leads the AL
in hitting (.376), so a third title is within reach. At 37, he has
three or four years ahead of him. One more batting title would
strengthen his case considerably. Two more would make him a major
contender.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, no player who has mostly been a DH has ever
made it to Cooperstown, although by the time Martinez is eligible
for consideration, current Baltimore DH Harold Baines may have
broken through.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people talk about the Hall, I know I have a long way to
go,'' Martinez said. ``When you compare my (power) numbers to the
Hall of Fame guys, I'm short. The hits and the average are good,
but I don't have the homers and RBIs.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be changing this year. He's among the league leaders
in both categories, and shows no sign of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never hit for this kind of power before, but I'm seeing
the ball good, and my bat speed is as good as ever,'' Martinez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers beware.

BUSH URGES `COMMONSENSE' CONSERVATION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAND HARBOR STATE PARK, Nevada _ Striving to distance himself
from criticism that he heads one of the nation's most polluted
states, Texas Gov. George W. Bush went to the pristine shores of
Lake Tahoe Thursday to call for ``commonsense conservationism'' and
more local control to save America's environmental treasures.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he prepared to deliver the address, Bush couldn't
quite bring himself to use the ``e'' word. Asked by reporters
traveling on his plane this week if he would consider himself an
environmentalist, Bush demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself someone who cares deeply about clean air and
clean water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to an invited crowd of about 100 at the shores of the
lake, Bush promised Thursday that he would be ``a president who
would set a new tone ... to come up with commonsense conservation
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is we trust local folks to make the right
decisions for the community in which they live,'' Bush said.
``Somehow the mentality of Washington is `we know better.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush called for ``conservation partnerships'' that encompass
federal, state and local governments and private landowners. He
also said the government should provide tax incentives for private
landowners who engage in conservation efforts, and eliminate estate
taxes so they can more easily pass on their lands to their
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor's heralded environmental event proved a
contrast to some of of his home-run hits in recent weeks, in which
he delivered strong addresses on issues like  &LR; such as Social
Security, military funding and education. Even with the azure blue
Tahoe waters and stunning mountains as a backdrop, Thursday's
``major policy address'' was hardly a blockbuster. He included
parts of his usual stump speech and spent only 10 minutes on
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, prominent Lake Tahoe conservationists who were
invited to attend, such as Rochelle Nason, executive director of
the nonpartisan League to Save Lake Tahoe, appeared largely
unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's foray into environmental issues also gave Democrats and
ecology activists an opening to raise his Texas record. And they
argued that Vice President Al Gore _ who appeared at nearly the
same site with President Clinton two years ago for a major summit
on Tahoe issues _ has established far stronger credentials on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush proposed a handful of initiatives, including
giving a 50 percent tax break on capital gains incurred when
private landowners sell property for conservation purposes, and
abolishing the inheritance tax so landowners won't be encouraged to
sell property to developers to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called for full funding of the federal Land and Water
Conservation Fund and for mandating that 50 percent of the proceeds
be spent on state and local efforts. Created by Congress 35 years
ago, the fund was about $900 million at its 1978 peak, but today is
at about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also called for providing $50 million in
matching grants for states to offer incentives to private
landowners, including farmers and ranchers, if they engaged in
conservation efforts that would protect rare species and restore
habitats. Bush said he would recommend $10 million toward the
establishment of a stewardship grant program for private
conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference later, Bush also repeatedly criticized
Clinton for ``making a grand promise he couldn't fulfill'' on Lake
Tahoe preservation, although Bush provided no details. His staffers
said later the reference was to $300 million in funding that the
president and Gore had promised after their 1997 summit for the
purpose of conserving water and land at Tahoe, the balance of which
was not included in Clinton's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway called it ``another charge with no
basis in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., was scathing. ``George W. Bush speaking
on the environment is like Josef Stalin talking on human rights.
... He has the worst environmental record in America,'' Reid said.
``His idea of saving the lake to is to repeal the estate tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Nason, of the save-Tahoe league, said Bush's ideas _ while
differing in tone from Democratic proposals, particularly in the
calls for local control _ differed little in substance from
policies supported by the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax credits can be effective'' as a tool for environmental
preservation,'' she said. ``But they're not as precise a tool. ...
They're one of a number of tools that would be needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nason noted Bush's reluctance to call himself an
environmentalist. ``Most Americans call themselves
environmentalists,'' she said. ``I'm not sure what distinction he
has in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have the proven track record of many years that
Gore has,'' she said, ``but that doesn't mean he doesn't have
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign released figures suggesting that Texas ranks at
the bottom on a number of key environmental issues. On spending for
state parks, for example, the list puts Texas in 49th place.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's camp immediately countered, saying Bush has done much
to turn around a decades-long series of state problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you torture the statistics enough, you can say anything,''
said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the crowd didn't appear convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Invited guest Teresa May Duggan, a Democrat who lives in Kings
Beach, said Bush has little credibility on the issue. ``It's not
happening in Texas, how can we expect it to happen in Lake Tahoe?''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Ron Slaven, a board member with the Lake Tahoe Basin Federal
Advisory Committee, was also critical, saying of Bush's speech:
``The lake has lost three (more) feet of clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of kayaking protesters, carrying signs saying ``Texas
Number one polluter,'' were ordered by state troopers to keep a
mile from shore _ well out of sight of television cameras filming
the event.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Lake Tahoe, Bush flew to Sacramento to attend the
two-day Border Governors Conference. The meeting brings together
governors from the U.S. and Mexican states that make up the 2,000
mile border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stayed in the background during Thursday's opening
ceremonies, shaking hands briefly with the conference's host _ Gov.
Gray Davis, who is also the chairman of Vice President Al Gore's
California campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Work sessions Friday will cover economic development,
environment and border crossing issues.  &LR;

COMETS GRACIOUS GUESTS _ UNTIL TIP-OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Comets sat on the visitors' bench, their game
faces firmly in place.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time reigning champions of the WNBA weren't exactly
patient, but during the long and winding pregame ceremony, they did
their best to endure the hype and hoopla surrounding the unveiling
of the Storm.
</P>
<P>
   Houston coach Van Chancellor paced like a lion, just for the
effect, as the public address announcer bellowed out the starting
five of Seattle's newest pro sports franchise:
</P>
<P>
   Edna Campbell, Charmin Smith, Kamila Vodichkova, Quacy Barnes
and Sonja Henning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cool-as-a-cucumber Sheryl Swoopes spread her long
arms over the back of two chairs, feigning serious boredom with a
cold stare that made you think twice about meeting up with her in a
dark alley.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time league MVP Cynthia Cooper studied the top of her
sneakers, as if they might sprout hair.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson applied another layer of plum-red lipstick, just
to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   In a league starting its fourth season, the reigning queens of
the WNBA understand they have to be somewhat gracious toward their
newest peers, so they let the new girls have their moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to see the growth of the new league, new faces,
new talent, new teams and their fans and the excitment generated
around the new franchises,'' said Cooper, a star whose attitude and
professionalism is somehow even greater than her stalwart game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to see growth, especially in a very young
league,'' Cooper said, being nice.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where the niceness and patience ended.
</P>
<P>
   The second the warm and fuzzy pre-game ceremonies were wrapped
up, the Comets went to work.
</P>
<P>
   They brought their finesse game and their lunchbuckets and their
ornery determination, showing the Storm and their eager fans the
meaning of hardwood excellence.
</P>
<P>
   The Storm had not even broken a sweat and there was Thompson,
dropping a moon-shot 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Next came Swoopes, picking up a loose ball in the backcourt and
heaving a bomb to Thompson for an easy layup.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper drove the lane for a layup, Thompson followed with
another 3-pointer, and that was how it started. An 11-point Houston
lead swelled to 18, then to 22, and then, well, the outcome was
pretty much as expected, with the reigning champs clamping down a
monster win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they'd be fired up,'' said Storm coach Lin Dunn. ``I
think they were embarassed by going to double overtime (Thursday
night at Portland), but give credit to Swoopes and Cooper. They got
us down early on.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't fair _ it couldn't be against this WNBA dynasty _ but
at least it was exciting.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not talking about watching Sonics star Gary Payton hug
Sonics owner Barry Ackerley's wife Ginger during a time out.
</P>
<P>
   No, Thursday night at KeyArena was about the women.
</P>
<P>
   The Storm held their coming-out party, and the WNBA production
seemed a reasonable facsimile of the NBA game, with all the good
and bad that sort of entertainment juggernaut entails.
</P>
<P>
   The swirling laser lights played havoc with retinas. The sound
system shook the very depths of your inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   And there were games and giveaways and the unveiling of the new
mascot, Doppler _ a fuzzy, red Barney-like creature, who thankfully
is a much better dancer than Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn is a much better dancer than Barney, too. Another bonus.
</P>
<P>
   While the real, live Dunn could be seen patrolling the sideline,
extolling her Storm to get after the Comets, a videotaped version
of Dunn could be seen during timeouts on the JumboTron, leading the
KeyArena crowd in the ``Fan Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere at the heart of all this lightheartedness was a
basketball game _ and the first look in Seattle at a women's pro
basketball league whose future depends upon how long it takes for
the expansion teams to be competitive, for a more national audience
to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   While the Comets have every intention of hammering the expansion
franchises, they are not unaware of the importance of being good
ambassadors, about doing all the right things _ other than going
easy on the new girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the players that's well-known in the league, and
hopefully, I'll do what I have to do to keep the league healthy and
exciting, and will motivate other players to do exactly the same
thing,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had the fortune of having to be the opener for two
expansion teams, and they're very motivated, very focused. We
already knew that we were going to have to play our best
basketball. The expansion teams have veteran players. They know
what it takes to play in the WNBA. When we come to town, they give
it a little extra.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets came and cleaned the Storm's clock, but at least the
champs said all the right things.

L.A. IS LOSING MILLIONS IN REVENUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ City Controller Rick Tuttle has accused Los
Angeles of mishandling taxpayer dollars, saying the city could save
more than $100 million a year with better management.
</P>
<P>
   In his report that city revenue growth was sluggish despite a
flourishing economy, a frustrated Tuttle identified eight areas
where the city wasted millions of dollars yearly. They include
allowing permit and license fee payment checks to sit uncashed for
months and neglecting to collect hundreds of thousands in tax
credits from the county and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over and over again, my office issues audit reports or makes
other recommendations to improve revenue collections, only to see
the recommendations get bogged down in bureaucracy,'' Tuttle wrote
in a report released Thursday. ``The buck-passing has got to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle issued the report with a letter urging City Council to
revive a plan to create a city finance director position to oversee
revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor proposed forming the new post in July, but the council
excluded it from the 2000-2001 budget, saying the job could be done
by the city treasurer. The mayor vetoed the item in the budget that
reflected the council's view, and said his proposal would do more
to strengthen the city's financial management.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the city collected $2.26 billion in revenue from
various sources -- including property, business and sales taxes and
license and permit fees, according to Tuttle's report.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, the city projects revenues of $2.79 billion, which
equals $2.18 billion in 1990 dollars -- a decline from 10 years
prior, after inflation is factored in, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even reached the level of 10 years ago, despite a
booming, vibrant economy and many more city fees at higher rates,''
Tuttle wrote. ``Something is wrong here.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer, chairman of the council's Budget and
Finance Committee, said the city needs to improve its revenue
collection, but he disagreed that creating a director of finance
would accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about the fact these things need to be
pursued,'' Feuer said. ``But it's not necessarily the job of a
single individual nor is it even possible for that to be the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   City Clerk Michael Carey, whose department oversees several of
the areas mentioned in Tuttle's report, agreed the city could save
money in certain areas. But he took issue with the report's
assertion that the City Clerk's Office fails to process checks fast
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city controller doesn't know what he is talking about,''
Carey said. ``We hire our own employees to quickly deposit money.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's
Association, questioned that the city's revenues could decline when
those of cities and counties statewide are soaring. But he said he
agrees the city could improve many of its systems, perhaps by
contracting more services out to private businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been study after study telling the city of Los
Angeles how to be more efficient and they haven't followed
through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle made the following eight recommendations, saying they
would save the city millions of dollars:
</P>
<P>
   --Better use of discounts in city contracts. The city should
make it a habit to use discounts already negotiated with vendors,
and negotiate discounts for paying early or on time. The report
estimates the city could immediately save $250,000, and eventually
up to $20 million a year, by changing its practices in this area.
</P>
<P>
   --Curb overtime. Overtime surged $18 million, or 15 percent last
year over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   --Process checks faster. The city should use lock boxes -- or
outside contractors -- to process checks for taxes, permits and
license fees. According to Tuttle's report, checks sit for days and
even months before being cashed. The report estimates the city
could collect millions in interest by depositing the checks more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   --Improve business tax collection enforcement. City officials
estimate some 60,000 businesses operating in Los Angeles do not pay
the city's business tax. The city now is advocating state
legislation that officials say will help identify those scofflaws,
which could mean up to $60 million more in the city's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   --Enforce collections. More than $75 million in the city's
accounts receivable -- including money owed to the city for fees --
is more than three months in arrears. A 1 percent improvement would
boost city revenue by $750,000, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   --Increase police fees. The city now collects police fees from
certain types of businesses -- such as firearms vendors,
pawnbrokers and carnivals. But the report says the cost of
providing the services is almost $4 million greater than the amount
the city collects in those fees, and that other political
jurisdictions charge more than the city does.
</P>
<P>
   --Recoup state and county tax credits. Now, the report states,
no single department is responsible for ensuring the city receives
reimbursements from the state and county for certain items such as
lab fees and tax credits. In 1998, the city identified $1.5 million
in reimbursements owed from the county.
</P>
<P>
   --Secure a users tax permit, which would increase the city's
revenues by some $170,000 annually, based on the city's purchases
from out-of-state vendors.

CSUN ATHLETIC PROGRAM PUT ON PROBATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Further damaging Cal State Northridge's
beleaguered football team, the NCAA on Thursday put CSUN's ath on
three years' probation and imposed a number of other serious
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it had ``no doubt the institution failed in its
obligations,'' the NCAA also barred the football team from
postseason eligibility for the coming season and limited the number
of scholarship players to 75, 10 below the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   With the athletic program's move in 2001 to the Big West
Conference, which does not have football, CSUN interim President
Louanne Kennedy acknowledged the sport will be de-emphasized. While
remaining steadfast in her support of football and a new stadium,
Kennedy said CSUN is in negotiations with Los Angeles Pierce
College to play football there as a Division I-AA independent in
the future and that ``there are a lot of other facilities issues
ahead of the (football) stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The football program will be different,'' Kennedy said. ``I
can assure your readers that it was not my intention to become
involved in the death of football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to continue to play football. How it's going to
pan out with the teams that we play and how many scholarships we
offer and so forth, those are issues that (will be worked out).
There is a coming in. She may have other ideas and interests that
she hasn't shared with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolene Koester, formerly of Sacramento State, will take over at
CSUN on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA released its findings in a 27-page report following a
lengthy review of an internal CSUN investigation that was completed
nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge fired football coach Ron Ponciano last summer after
discovering recruiting and other rules violations rampant in the
football program. CSUN's investigation was prompted by an anonymous
letter.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA found that Ponciano and two assistants had improper
contact with a pair of recruits following a high school basketball
game, despite being advised ahead of time that it could be in
violation of NCAA rules. The infractions committee also said
Ponciano arranged air transportation for one recruit to be flown to
California at no cost as well as arranging for local
transportation, lodging, meals, telephone calls and cash for
tuition to enroll at a local junior college.
</P>
<P>
   Other violations included improper recruiting of players
enrolled at other schools, payments to players, supplemental pay
for an assistant coach and granting too many football scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said Northridge failed to maintain control of and
conduct financial audits of the Quarterback Club, an independent
booster club. In 1998, a Northridge athletic representative who was
a member of the club used club funds to pay for 10 weekly barbecues
for the football team. The committee said there was no clear
guidance from Northridge athletic officials about whether the
barbecues were improper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institution on a number of occasions had the opportunity
to control the situation,'' said Jack Friedenthal, the chairman of
the NCAA's Division I Committee on Infractions. ``They did not give
adequate instructions to the head coach, who was new. It was really
a failure to educate.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee said some of the violations could be attributed to
Ponciano's inexperience. It also decided, however, that some
violations appeared to demonstrate ``willful and blatant disregard
for basic NCAA legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano, who now is an assistant coach at Los Angeles Valley
College and has demanded a settlement from CSUN, also was punished
further by the NCAA. The organization limited his ability to be
hired by any NCAA-member school until July 15, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano, in Utah for a football clinic, was unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano's lawyer, Scott Campbell, said his client disputes that
his behavior was unethical, that he never made any call to arrange
a flight and that neither he nor any booster gave the recruit cash.
CSUN has not responded to Ponciano's demand for a settlement and
ignored his threat to file a wrongful-termination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always difficult to take personnel action against
someone, knowing that it will affect their life profoundly,''
Kennedy said in reference to Ponciano's dismissal. ``But a year ago
I did what I felt was right, and the NCAA has now agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   Following its internal investigation last year, CSUN imposed a
number of penalties upon itself _ common in such matters, as the
NCAA considers how a university censures itself in determining
final punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the additional sanctions, Kennedy expressed satisfaction
with her school's handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, we strongly support the (NCAA) report,'' Kennedy
said. ``The football program has had problems in the past. We have
taken actions to remedy them. This is in the past. This report is
about the past. We believe we have the people in place now (for a
successful future).''
</P>
<P>
   Among them is a new fund-raising officer, who is embarking on a
major campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalties are in line with what we anticipated,'' said Tom
Shannon, CSUN's NCAA faculty representative. ``They have other
penalties they could have imposed and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the actions CSUN has taken has been to hire a new
compliance officer, dissolving the Quarterback Club, educating the
staff its football scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic director at the time of the rules violations was
Paul Bubb, who was forced to resign in the aftermath of the arrest
of former women's basketball coach Michael Abraham on federal
drug-trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   Football coach Jeff Kearin reacted with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our recruiting's done,'' he said. ``Our team's in place, for
the most part. We'll play at Pierce if we have to. The president
has been clear the stadium issue will take care of itself after the
fund-raising campaign. . . . We haven't lost players I know because
of the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge has set a goal of raising $150,000 by July.
</P>
<P>
   As for a lack of conference affiliation, Kearin said as long as
Northridge plays a strong Division I-AA schedule, it will be
nationally ranked and a postseason contender.

CATHOLIC COLLEGE STUDIED FOR VALLEY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Valley could have its first Catholic university in as soon
as two years, serving a growing number of students who now must
leave the state for a Catholic college degree.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Brothers, a Catholic order that already runs seven
universities across the nation, has been studying the Phoenix area
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have been meeting with Valley leaders monthly. This
summer, they will look for money and land to build a four-year
liberal arts university, which also would offer professional and
graduate programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's started a school like this for quite a few years,''
said Mike Waters, chairman of the board of Lewis University, a
Christian Brothers school south of Chicago. ``You've got the
growth. It's a great spot to have a new university.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not say when a final decision would be made or
where the university would be located. But local Catholic leaders
are thrilled by the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is far and away the largest city in the country
without a Catholic university,'' said Monsignor Edward Ryle,
director of the Arizona Catholic Conference. ``We've got grammar
schools and high schools, but we don't have any Catholic
higher-education institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona school would be similar to Lewis University, which
enrolls almost 5,000 students studying nursing, education,
business, justice studies and aviation. Tuition runs about $13,000
a year. About 70 percent of its students are Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible Arizona's university could open in rented space
while the campus is built.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has about 780,000 Catholics. In the Phoenix Diocese,
13,000 students attend 14 Catholic preschools, 24 elementaries and
five high schools. And their numbers are growing.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic enrollment jumped 18 percent in the past five years. In
1998, a $25 million fund-raising campaign was launched to build the
Valley's first new Catholic schools in 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   St. John Bosco, a kindergarten-through-eighth-grade &QL; 
school, will open next fall at Chandler Boulevard and 48th Street.
Catholic leaders expect others to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Already, families are clamoring to attend St. John Bosco, even
though it's still too early for even a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Brothers, which also operates schools in Latin
America, is a teaching order that originated 300 years ago in
France. Observers say it is a sound group.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Lawless, president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, met
with Waters and sees the importance of keeping Catholic students in
the state after high school.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Catholic colleges now are in Los Angeles, San Diego,
San Francisco and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have open arms, and we should be encouraging it,''
Lawless said. ``That diversity is positive for Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   Local Catholic school officials also welcome a local Catholic
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives our graduates that opportunity to go to a university
without having to leave the state,'' said Sister Joan Fitzgerald,
principal of Xavier College Preparatory in Phoenix, a Catholic high
school. ``It will enrich the whole education system.''
</P>
<P>
   Remi McLean's 13-year-old daughter, Brianna Vasquez, is an
incoming Xavier freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to see her stay here (after high school),''
McLean said. ``We believe values and morals should be adjacent to
your regular learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Brianna likes the idea, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could live in the dorms and still be close to my family and
carry on my beliefs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Kim Joyce is thinking about college for her 2-year-old
daughter, who will go to a Catholic elementary school when the time
comes and then, hopefully, a Catholic university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a Catholic education is very important,'' the Phoenix
resident said. ``It provides a little bit of shelter from
society.'' &QL;

BILL SIGNING BOOSTS VERO'S CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The city of Vero Beach, Fla., and Indian River
County took an enormous, and possibly final, step in keeping the
Los Angeles Dodgers in Dodgertown for the next 20 years thanks to
the long-awaited signature of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on a funding
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed a bill late Thursday that will allocate between $7
and $8 million toward the effort to keep the Dodgers'
spring-training site in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Vero Beach and Indian River County already had secured $12.5
million, boosting the financial package to about $20 million, which
should be enough to keep the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials low-keyed Bush signing the bill because they
are also negotiating with Las Vegas officials about a four- to
six-team spring-training complex, but the increased funding puts
Florida in a favorable position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense of relief but also excitement, for Dodgertown
and all the facilities in Florida,'' Dodgers vice president Derrick
Hall said. ``It enables us to pursue our negotiations more speedily
with the city and county (in Florida) and Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said a soft deadline of mid-June was in place to make a
final decision. Dodgers officials will travel to Florida next week
to meet with city and county officials to discuss a deal, which is
expected to be for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But a decision needs to be made quickly because of stipulations
in the newly signed bill. A private enterprise isn't eligible for
the funding through the bill, so Indian River County needs to buy
the land from the Dodgers before they can apply for the money. The
application deadline is Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are the only major-league club that owns its spring-
training facility, but under a proposed agreement with the Florida
municipalities, the land would be bought by Indian River County.
The Dodgers are also asking for renovations to the complex, where
the Dodgers have trained since 1948. Among the improvements are the
additions of practice fields and a better weight facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to move ahead and start going quickly,'' said
Dodgertown managing director Craig Callan. ``We need to look at
Indian River County and Vero Beach and Las Vegas. And Vegas is
still involved. Vegas is still a viable contender with Indian River
County and Vero Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also relief since Bush decided not to fund a similar
bill last year that would have provided $7.5 million in funding. In
the months after that, several Dodgers officials said the
organization would have signed a long-term deal with Vero Beach and
Indian River County if Bush funded that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas officials are expected to make their offer to the
Dodgers, and the five other teams interested in moving there, by
the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   However, given the Dodgers' history at Dodgertown and managing
general partner and CEO Bob Daly's affinity for it, Las Vegas will
have to knock the Dodgers over to lure the organization to the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can Florida offer an economically attractive package
with the additional funding, but Las Vegas has other elements
working against it. The Dodgers are concerned about the gaming
factor and the weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate the weather is cooler than that in Florida
during the spring-training months, and the heat becomes an issue
for players in extended spring training and for minor leaguers in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Brown OK: Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said
right-hander Kevin Brown's injured right shin wouldn't keep the
staff ace from making his Monday start in Texas. Brown had
stiffness in the leg Thursday but no other problems after getting
hit with a line drive in his Wednesday start.

PETTER LINDSTROM, 93, NEUROSURGEON, EX-HUSBAND OF INGRID BERGMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN BECK   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ A biographer researching the life of Petter
Lindstrom would find two drastically differing perceptions of the
renowned Swedish-born brain surgeon who died last week at his
Sonoma home at age 93.
</P>
<P>
   To most he was known as the husband dragged unwillingly into the
public spotlight in the late 1940s when his first wife, actress
Ingrid Bergman, abandoned him and their only child for Italian
director Roberto Rossellini.
</P>
<P>
   But to family members, friends and colleagues, he was simply the
son of modest Swedish flower farmers _ a caring, unpretentious man
who pioneered advances in neurosurgery, and yet, despite his
wealth, drove a Dodge Dart most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to terms with it before it really became the scandal
it became,'' said his youngest child, Karl Lindstrom, the
39-year-old owner of a Sonoma construction company. ``The hard part
was that it became a scandal and that other people never forget
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Petter Lindstrom, who died May 24 at the age of 93, had lived in
Sonoma for the past four years with his surviving wife, Agnes
Rovnonek. He is survived by daughter Pia, of New York, his only
child with Bergman; and four children he shared with Rovnonek _
Karl, Peter of Ridgecrest, Michael of Boise, Idaho, Brita of San
Diego; and eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   After a short courtship, he married Bergman in 1937. At the
time, he was a practicing dentist in Stockholm, Sweden. An orphan
who had enrolled at Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre, Bergman had
already appeared in several Swedish movies.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Lindstrom received a degree from the University of
Rochester in 1943, Bergman's career had taken off. The couple moved
to Beverly Hills, where Lindstrom acted as her manager and agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it started out as a great thing for both of
them,'' said Karl Lindstrom. ``And I think that they had a time
when it was really wonderful and they were really happy. It's just
something that didn't work out. It didn't last. Today, that's
really common. Back then it was unusual, particularly the way it
turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time it was the hottest scandal in Hollywood, as press
from around the world converged on islands off the coast of Italy
where Rossellini and Bergman were filming ``Stromboli.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid widespread gossip and speculation, Lindstrom and Bergman
divorced in 1950, two years after Bergman had begun an affair with
Rossellini, with whom she later had a son, Roberto, and two
daughters, Ingrid and Isabella.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Lindstrom didn't say much to the press. And
although he would occasionally run into Bergman, who died of cancer
in 1982, he quickly moved on, marrying Rovnonek in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1949 and 1987, his widely recognized medical pursuits
took him all over the country. He taught neurosurgery at the
University of California at Los Angeles, held chief of neurosurgery
positions at Los Angeles and Pittsburgh hospitals, and at
Presbyterian Medical Center and Children's Hospital in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for safe alternatives to lobotomy, he pioneered the
development of ``bloodless surgery'' in the deep regions of the
brain using ultrasound.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, his favorite pastimes included waltzing
with his wife, Agnes, at weekend dances and teaching his children
to ski.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he had put it behind him, seeing Bergman for the
last time during a short visit in La Jolla in the late 1970s,
Lindstrom received items in the mail _ letters, pictures and news
stories _ throughout his life reminding him of the scandalous
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it annoyed him incredibly'' to realize he was
remembered by most for a very short period of his life, Karl
Lindstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   Private funeral services were held last week in Sonoma.

PACERS AIM TO GO WHERE THEY'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ His team is on the cusp of taking its first trip
to the NBA finals and Reggie Miller is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same team that was down 15 or 16 points against
Miami in Game 6 at halftime and found a way to win that ballgame,
force a Game 7 and go down and win in Miami,'' Miller said Thursday
after the Pacers' practice at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm not counting nothing. I'm not overlooking nothing from
them. They are a very scary and dangerous team that you got to put
the dagger in and you got to make sure the heart ain't pumping no
more. Because if there's any type of life in them, you never know
what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you got to kill the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopping onto a flight for Game 6 Friday night at Madison Square
Garden, they know the drill _ having lost in the Eastern Conference
finals four of the past six seasons, including the last three in a
row. Whether it was Patrick Ewing in 1994 or Latrell Sprewell,
Allan Houston and Larry Johnson in 1999 _ or the Orlando Magic of
Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee Hardaway in 1995 or the Chicago Bulls
of Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen in 1998 _ the Pacers have
fallen short.
</P>
<P>
   With major free-agent questions to be answered in the
off-season, the Pacers never have had a greater sense of urgency to
close out the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is now or never,'' Miller said. ``If you can't get
it done now, then there probably will never be another golden
opportunity like it is now. But like I said, it's up to the 12 guys
in the locker room to get it done. You can only blame yourself if
you don't get the job done. So, it's all on our shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson said, ``We've been down 3-2, but to be up 3-2 and
to have all the pressure on the other team, what a great
opportunity for us to finally seal the door shut.'' The Knicks'
season is close to expiring because they blew a 37-19
second-quarter lead and lost by 88-79 on Wednesday in Game 5. The
Game 5 comeback changed the mood inside the Pacers' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're hungry,'' Jalen Rose said. ``We need to create a
scenario in our locker room that this isn't the third straight
year. That this is the first time we need to treat it like we're
excited about the moment, something that we can't take for granted
and we've got to also treat it as though we won't get to this point
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think getting down 18 woke us up and made us
realize that playoff life is short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as focused as I've seen this team,'' coach Larry Bird
said. ``Yeah, we have our ups and downs. But they know what's on
the line here. I don't think they've ever been in this situation
here. Well, maybe when they played New York and New York came in
here and beat 'em and then beat 'em in a Game 7. But this a little
bit different.'' For the record, the dog would not die in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is the lone Pacers holdover from that season, and he
remembers well how Indiana let the series slip away. The parallels
are almost eerie. The Pacers had a 3-2 lead after a pulsating Game
5 victory at the Garden and needed only to close out the Knicks in
Game 6 at Market Square Arena or Game 7 at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   They could not do it. ``If I remember right, it's all the little
things,'' Miller said. ``Rebounds. Loose balls. Throughout the
course of a game, making shots and defending will take care of
itself, but it's who does the little things that really separated
us from New York in '94. I think they got all the loose balls, a
lot of second shots and they played much harder. I remember them
getting up big and us coming back. But we could never get over that
hump in '94.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest obstacle next to outplaying the Knicks may be
overcoming their recent misfortune at Madison Square Garden.
Indiana has not won at the Garden since Game 4 of last season,
having dropped five straight games. Going back to Larry Johnson's
controversial 4-point play in Game 3 of the 1999 conference finals,
they have had their share of bad calls on the Knicks' floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't count five straight,'' Jackson said. ``There's been
fluke calls. There's been missed calls to be quite honest. Which
happens. We feel we haven't put together 48 minutes of basketball
at Madison Square Garden the last couple times, especially Games 3
and 4.''
</P>
<P>
   If they played poorly in Game 3, the Pacers were abysmal in Game
4 on Memorial Day, unable to stop the Knicks on defense and find an
offensive rhythm until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's fondest memory is of knocking the Knicks out at the
Garden in Game 7 of the second-round playoff series in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the opportunity to have one place to get the job done _
other than our place _ that would be the top choice,'' Jackson
said. ``It'll be a lot of fun and should be a great time tomorrow
night in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Jackson was asked how it felt to be so close to
advancing to the finals. ``Unbelievable,'' he said. ``I thought
about it last night. I got a little choked up just thinking about
it. We're right there. And it's great to be right there, but it's
nothing like being there. I don't want to look at it and say, `We
were right there.' We have to knock down the door because we're
facing a team that has no quit. They're not going to lay down
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's up to us to go into Madison Square Garden in an ideal
situation for us and take care of business. And then dance.''

FALLING STAR: SWAYZE MAKES FORCED LANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL SOWERS AND JUDI VILLA  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESCOTT VALLEY - Actor Patrick Swayze was piloting a
twin-engine Cessna that made an emergency landing Thursday on a
half-mile-long paved road in an undeveloped subdivision near here,
the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   He was not seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze, who was flying with his two dogs, brought the plane down
along Buckshot Road, shearing off part of his right wing on a
street light and felling a stop sign before he apparently taxied
the plane into a dirt lot, said John Bolstad, sales manager at the
Mingus West subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Swayze made a series of sharp turns and narrowly
missed several electrical cables.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed if he was a foot lower, he would have hung
himself,'' said Marty Zalucki, who was working at a con struction
site about a mile from the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze walked away from the plane and hitch-hiked a ride from a
motorist on Arizona 89A, Prescott Valley police Sgt. P.J. Janik
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was ``shaken up but not injured,'' said John Clabes, an FAA
spokesman in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Clabes said Swayze, 47, was flying on instruments from Van Nuys,
Calif., to Las Vegas, a town near Santa Fe, N.M., when he
disappeared from radar and radio contact about 11 a.m. He was
flying at 13,000 feet and was 38 miles northeast of Flagstaff at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Janik said the plane experienced a pressurization problem that
forced Swayze to land. When FAA authorities lost contact with the
plane, they notified Prescott area law enforcement agencies, who
first found the plane in the dirt. Two homes were under
construction on the two-lane street, but neither was hit, Bolstad
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot Road is off Arizona 89A, on the eastern outskirts of
Prescott Valley, near Mingus Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 feet of the plane's right wing was shorn off, but its
three wheels were still intact, chalk blocks placed behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fabulous landing job,'' said Chuck Skowronek, a
former pilot and nearby resident. ``He was fortunate to have that
street there. To put a plane that size in that space available says
a lot about his skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd fly with him anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Janik said Swayze called the FAA from a private residence in the
Prescott area to report the landing. FAA officials were at the
scene Thursday; the plane was to be dismantled and brought to
Phoenix today.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of gawkers also pulled up to the scene
throughout the evening. As many as 10 cars arrived each minute to
check out the plane and inquire whether anyone knew where Swayze
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very quiet here, and you rarely hear anything. And when
something like this happens, it makes it more exciting,'' said Kory
Reuna, who moved to the area about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze is best known for the 1987 film`` Dirty Dancing'' and the
1990 film ``Ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   He was ``the talk of the town'' Thursday, said Robert Hamill,
owner of Robert's Marketplace, about six miles from the landing
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's looking for Patrick Swayze,'' Hamill said. ``It's
crazy around here.'' &QL;

STATE FUNDS SHIFTED AMONG L.A.'S PARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A state Senate budget subcommittee has taken $8.75
million promised for parkland in the Greater San Fernando Valley
and shifted it to inner-city parks and other projects from South
Pasadena to Maywood.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate action has infuriated backers of Propositions 12 and
13, but when the Daily News challenged the move, state Sen. Tom
Hayden, a member of the committee that shifted the funds, said it
was a ``mistake'' and would be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Unconvinced, Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who
campaigned for the $2.1 billion parks bond approved in March, said
he's concerned about the fate of the Valley's share.
</P>
<P>
   ``How this got siphoned off is quite a mystery,'' Yaroslavsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ought to know what is going on so they can keep an eye
on this. Unless you are doggedly watching every move the
bureaucrats make up there, you can find yourself with your pockets
picked.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters approved the proposition after being told the money was
earmarked for the Santa Monica Mountains and the Rim of the Valley
Trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you tell people if they vote yes on Proposition 12,
they'll get $35 million for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy
and Rim of the Valley, you owe it to them, legally and morally, to
keep your word,'' Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Valley's share was shifted during a budget
subcommittee hearing May 22, when $5 million of the $24 million
appropriated for the conservancy was set aside for the Arroyo
Seco-Confluence Park, $1 million for the Compton-Slauson Natural
Park, $2.5 million for the city of Maywood's Los Angeles River
Parkway and $250,000 for a South Pasadena Park. The committee
deferred the remaining $11 million that is earmarked for the
conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said he has assured Yaroslavsky the mistakes will be
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake made at the staff level against my explicit
memo to the staff,'' said Hayden. ``I'm not asking anybody for any
special understanding, but these staff are up for 100 hours
straight putting together the final subcommittee reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said the Conference Committee on the Budget will be asked
to fix the mistakes when it meets over the next two weeks. ``The
two houses have to reconcile the different versions of the budget
in the Conference Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other projects, they also will receive funding from
other parts of Proposition 12, Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, is concerned about
the funding mix-up because much of the Valley project is within his
district, said his spokesman, Paul Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker is a supporter of the conservancy, and the Rim of
the Valley Trail, and he is working to ensure the legislative plan
for park expenditures reflects the Valley's needs as well as the
rest of the needs of the state,'' Hefner said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Subcommittee Chairman Byron Sher, D-Redwood City, said
the projects were ``incorrectly charged.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're correcting that as the budget moves forward,'' Sher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, the author of
the park bond, said he understands that mistakes are made. ``They
are trying to balance the budget items in the different categories
so they sometimes identify a pot of money that is not the
appropriate pot.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica
Mountains Conservancy, blamed the mistakes on a ``lot of
confusion'' at the subcommittee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was anything intentional. I'm 100 percent
sure these things will get changed. If things are different next
week, I'll be the first one to say we've got a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Safe Neighborhood Parks, Clean Water, Clean Air and Coastal
Protection Bond Act of 2000 -- or Proposition 12 -- is supposed to
invest in neighborhood parks and state parks, coastal beaches and
scenic areas.
</P>
<P>
   The $35 million for the conservancy was intended to buy land in
the conservancy zone and for the trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to ring the San Fernando Valley with a string of parks,''
Edmiston said. ``We call it the emerald necklace around the San
Fernando Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy has received hundreds of nominations for land
acquisitions and other uses of the money. The conservancy is
expected to decide this month which ones are the most important,
said Rorie Skei, deputy director for natural resources and planning
at the conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the potential purchases include 1,700 acres in the Santa
Susana Mountains above Granada Hills and Chatsworth called the
Joughin Ranch, a key wildlife corridor linked to other public
lands.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy is also looking at the 6,000-acre Big Sky Ranch
between Moorpark and Simi Valley where ``Little House on the
Prairie'' was filmed, property along the unpaved portion of
Mulholland Drive, restoration of a portion of the Tujunga Wash in
the Van Nuys area and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   The money will also be used to buy land to help complete the Rim
of the Valley Trail, a trail that when completed would run along
the Santa Monica, Santa Susana, Angeles and San Gabriel mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the trail and parks can be found on the
Internet at www.smmc.ca.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Marco Antonio Firebaugh, D-Cudahy, said he learned
recently that the subcommittee had ``inadvertently'' funded the
Maywood River Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the action taken in the Senate was technically in
error in the sense that they inadvertently funded it out of a pot
of money that can't be spent on Maywood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the $2.5 million for his district's park will be taken
out of the Murray-Hayden Urban Parks portion of the bond so the
conservancy will get its full $35 million.

HULL SCORES TWICE AS STARS EVEN SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Dallas Stars captain Derian Hatcher
waited by his locker for Game 2 to begin, surrounded by silence.
Only occasional sounds invaded an otherwise quiet locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, it was more quiet than normal,'' Hatcher said.
``I guess everybody had their own things to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Each player waded through his own thoughts about what he
personally could do to make up for the collective embarrassment
that had been Game 1. The Stars then went out and did exactly that
in a 2-1 victory against the New Jersey Devils on Thursday night in
Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The victory not only made up for the humiliating 7-3 loss in
Game 1, but allowed the Stars to return to Dallas with the split
they originally came to Jersey in search of.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are simple. Stars winger Brett Hull did what he does
best, scoring, not once, but twice. Stars goalie Ed Belfour bounced
back from his worst performance of the playoffs with one of his
best. And mostly, the Stars did what they do best: Dust themselves
off after a butt-kicking.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 9-0 after their past nine playoff losses,
including 6-0 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes to be embarrassed in the Stanley Cup Finals when
everybody is watching,'' Stars forward Guy Carbonneau said. ``We
got our butt kicked the first game. Everybody knew it. We talked
about it. We wanted to come back tonight and play a lot better.
This team seems to be in trouble, and we come out of it and play a
great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Great will probably be debated by those in the NHL who prefer
more scoring.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars played the game they need to play if they're going
to repeat as Stanley Cup champions. They were patient. They clogged
up the neutral zone. They negated the Devils' speed. They didn't
take a lot of chances. They scored on the ones they had.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, they got a great game from their goalie.
</P>
<P>
   They proved in Game 1 they're in a heap of trouble when they
don't. Belfour stopped only 12 of the 18 Devils shots in the series
opener after a prescription decongestant he took left him feeling
lightheaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something you try and do is forget about nights when you don't
have such a good night,'' Belfour said. ``It's definitely hard, but
I didn't have any problems sleeping. I knew it wasn't a good night
for myself. It's happened to me before, and I knew what to do to
get ready for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   And ready he was.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour stopped 27 of the Devils' 28 shots, making a number of
spectacular saves to keep the Stars in the game until Hull scored
his game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Belfour) was a step late in the first game,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``But he was much more energized tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that surprise you?'' Hatcher asked. ``I'm not surprised
at all. I don't think anyone should be surprised. He's been that
way all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, because Hull has played exactly like he didn't all
season.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off his worst regular season in terms of goals, Hull has
had his best postseason in that regard. He just keeps scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had talked of the importance of having a strong,
energetic start, and Hull obliged. His snap wrist shot beat Martin
Brodeur high, glove side, at 4:25 of the first period after Mike
Modano had done the dirty work to pry the puck free from along the
boards.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars needed a game-winner, and Hull obliged on that, too.
He deflected a shot by Jere Lehtinen with four minutes and 16
seconds remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say, `They don't make $6-7 million a year for
nothing,''' Carbonneau said. ``They have a knack to score the big
goals. They seem to be out of the game for 56 minutes then reappear
and score the big goals. That's something you can't teach.
Obviously, Brett and Mike have that knack.''
</P>
<P>
   Devils coach Larry Robinson said that he thought Lehtinen had
been offside for Hull's winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   But New Jersey blamed itself for losing Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played absolutely terrible, and we still had our chances to
win the game,'' Devils forward John Madden said. ``We turned the
puck over time and time again, and it wasn't just one line. It was
every line.''
</P>
<P>
   Jersey looked to be in good shape after responding almost
immediately to Hull's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Like in any series, tempers soon flared, leading to a couple of
coincidental minors. Not good for Dallas. Four-on-four proved once
again to be a burr in the Stars' behinds as New Jersey forward
Alexander Mogilny answered Dallas' early goal with his shot at
12:42 of the first period. His wrister beat Belfour high, glove
side, on a four-on-four.
</P>
<P>
   Only Dallas didn't panic, retreating quickly to the game that
some would call boring but the Stars can count on to win. They
stuck with it, not one or two players, but all 20, to get
themselves to late in the third period with the score still tied.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and Modano simply put the icing on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike and I talked,'' Hull said. ``Things had to change, and
everybody pulled up their pants and went at it.''
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, the Finals are tied. The 7-3 loss is gone,
although not quite forgotten. They were tested, slapped in the face
they said, and they responded the way a winner should.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about being an athlete,'' Stars winger Blake Sloan
said. ``If someone punches you in the face, you got to dust
yourself off, get back up, realize it's a new day, a new
opportunity. We try to, what's that phrase, `''carpe diem''.' '' nn

IPS DELAYED BY INSTABILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles _ Despite a couple of good days of recovery, the
stock markets remain sharply lower than their March peaks, a
scenario that is putting the brakes on the market for stock
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   As stock prices drop, so does the number of proposed initial or
secondary offerings that actually go through.
</P>
<P>
   Three local companies are among those that have chosen to delay
or cancel their offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Canoga Park-based Qualstar, which had made it as close to an IPO
as being placed on the weekly offering schedule, has now postponed
its offering, said David Menlow, president of IPOFinancial.com,
which tracks the IPO market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Qualstar, Westlake Village-based Rightstart.com
has withdrawn a planned IPO, and Camarillo-based Interlink
Electronics on Thursday withdrew a secondary stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many deals in the system waiting to come public
and too many of them will find out over the next few months they
have missed their opportunity,'' Menlow said. ``Many of them may
just find it's relatively impossible to get back in the market for
the near term.''
</P>
<P>
   The market's harshness, however, isn't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ultimately is a good thing because there's a culling
process that will shake out the deadwood,'' Menlow said.
</P>
<P>
   In Qualstar's case, the offering has not officially been
withdrawn, but it hasn't taken place despite being ready to price
for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, a company sets its IPO price the night before it goes
public.
</P>
<P>
   Qualstar has revised its price range downward from a $10 to $12
range to $7 to $9 and reduced the number of shares it plans to
issue from 3.25 million to 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the stock is being viewed ... as having a
problem,'' Menlow said. ``That is something that's difficult for
any stock to shake.''
</P>
<P>
   For Interlink Electronics, which filed its registration
statement when the company's stock was around $60 a share, a
secondary stock offering just isn't worth it anymore, Menlow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount they were expecting to raise at the price was close
to $150 million,'' Menlow said. ``When they say `due to market
conditions,' what they're really saying is `we really needed all of
the money.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's market price, Interlink's take would have been
closer to $55 million, Menlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials at Interlink were not available Thursday.
Officials at Qualstar declined to comment, citing Securities and
Exchange Commission restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, companies involved in stock offerings are prevented
from discussing the stock -- SEC rules require a silent period
before and after the offering.
</P>
<P>
   Rightstart.com's withdrawal is symptomatic of a broader loss of
interest in consumer-based e-commerce sites, Menlow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone that's trying to bring a deal into this space had
better do it in a very pristine fashion,'' Menlow said. ``We have a
very difficult market right now, and it's not nearly as forgiving
as it was a few months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are looking for top-tier underwriters, he said. Only
the big-name brokerages will do in this market. And a company had
better be healthy. Companies without actual products or revenue
streams are not so revered as they once were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a buyer's market, there's no question about it,'' Menlow
said. ``The market wants the better deals and they've clearly
spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that withdraw their offerings lose more than the money
they would have raised selling the stock, said Allen Sussman, an
attorney with the law firm of Brobeck Phleger Harrison who
specializes in IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   The expenses of preparing and filing the documents required to
hold a stock offering are steep, typically more than $1 million,
Sussman said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that is not recoverable once an IPO is withdrawn, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The further along a company gets in the IPO process before
withdrawing, the deeper the stigma, Sussman said. ``I've been
involved in deals where they've gone on the road and it hasn't
sold,'' he said, alluding to the road show company executives
typically engage in to drum up interest in the stock.
</P>
<P>
   A company that withdraws its registration statement can expect
to sit out for a while before it tries again, Sussman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common wisdom has been that you have to wait a good amount
of time -- usually at least a year -- in order to distance yourself
from the perception that you're somehow troubled or tainted,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In that time period, the companies often pursue other options,
such as a purchase or securing private financing, he said.

suspended the seller and voided the sale of a vivid abstract
painting whose price shot from $.25 to $135,805 last month, his
offense had nothing to do with the authenticity of the painting.
Rather, Kenneth Walton had entered a bid of $4,500 on his own
offering _ a practice known as shill bidding that violates eBay's
rules _ on the second day of a 10-day auction, long before
speculation that the painting might be by the renowned painter
Richard Diebenkorn sent the price soaring. But an analysis of that
and other eBay art auctions reveals that the flourishing
cyberauction world faces a deeper problem: rings of shill-bidders
that may include self-bidding. By Judith H. Dobrzynski.

SUBURBAN MALL WILL HOST FARMERS MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tapping into a growing trend in the San Fernando
Valley, The Westfield Shoppingtown Promenade in Woodland Hills will
host its first farmers market today.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers markets have been credited with helping local shopping
malls increase foot traffic and provide a boost in store sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Promenade market's target clientele will be workers from the
Warner Center area just blocks from the mall, organizers say. It
will start out with about 40 vendors, including artists and local
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   This week's market will last from 11:30 a.m. to 4:40 p.m., but
organizers say they may extend hours to 7 p.m. next week if there's
sufficient demand.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers markets have been popular at other local shopping
centers, including the Northridge Fashion Center, and The
Promenade's market manager, Jennifer McColm, said she expects the
weekly event will offer customers a change of pace from the workday
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fast-paced community, especially one like the Warner
Center, (a farmers market) slows the pace down and takes you back
in time a little bit to when things were easier,'' McColm said.
</P>
<P>
   McColm -- a Bell Canyon resident, writer and mother of three --
said customers from her 6-month-old Westlake Village market asked
her to open a location near the Warner Center area. And considering
the interest from customers and vendors, she said, The Promenade
market should do well.
</P>
<P>
   Mall officials said they believe the market will complement the
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're popping up all over the place, so we thought we would
try it,'' said Karla Hubbell, general manager for The Promenade.
``It's a nice amenity for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers markets can also bring new customers to shopping
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Char, marketing director for the Northridge Fashion Center,
said his mall's year-old Farmers' Market and Family Festival has
boosted foot traffic and store sales at the center. The Wednesday
evening market includes about 30 farmers and 30 to 40 food vendors,
crafts sellers and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our foot traffic in April was up 36 percent over April '99,''
Char said. ``I'm sure the market had a lot to do with that
number.''
</P>
<P>
   The Promenade's market will be held in the parking lot at
Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Erwin Street.

DEFENSE CLICKS, BUT ONLY BECAUSE BELFOUR DOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ This one looked very familiar. This one
was the Stars doing what the Stars do, as opposed to that mile-long
list of whatever the heck that was 48 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And what the Stars do best is play positional, defensive hockey,
which some call boring. And this Stanley Cup Finals' Game 2 last
night did drag at times, which meant the strategy was working well.
</P>
<P>
   And what boring hockey does, based on strong positional play, is
force the opposition to press and ponder, leading to mistakes the
Stars hope to pounce on, particularly in that area of every man's
land known as the neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, they pounced last night. Pounced twice with Brett
Hull, who scored early in the first period and late in the third
period, providing a 2-1 victory that gave this series a completely
different spin.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Devils won't sweep, which seemed to be a prominent New
York media theme after that 7-3 trashing of the Stars in Game 1.
The next stop is Reunion Arena for two games. Buckle up everyone,
particularly you New Jersey visitors. The bull ride has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   But ...
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are where they now are in this series, and where they
are in the playoffs, and where they are in the NHL's big picture _
meaning defending Stanley Cup champs _ because of one reason.
</P>
<P>
   That reason is Eddie Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   You can take all the positional defensive schemes, and all the
scoring heroics of a Hull throughout the playoffs, and all of it
fits into a certain pattern. None of it works, however, without
Belfour providing the ... well, the medication.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie was feeling much better last night, not drowsy or anything
from a bad dose of decongestant for a cold.
</P>
<P>
   When all's well with Eddie, then all's well with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Facing 28 shots, with about eight of them from right there on
his front porch, Belfour left the Devils sick and drowsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people have made a big deal of this,'' said
coach Ken Hitchcock, meaning Belfour revealing after the Game 1
beating that his medication had gone sour on him.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hitchcock, Belfour's illness went back to Game 7
against the Avalanche. His goalie was feeling so lousy the Stars
almost left him at home for a couple of days, instead of arriving
here with the team on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked up to him after the skate this morning, asked how he
felt, and Eddie's answer was `good,' '' Hitchcock said. ``I think
anybody who knows what it's like to play goal understands that if
you don't have energy and you are a step late, you are going to get
scored on. He was a step late in that first game, but he was much
more energized today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils felt that Belfour energy last night. And it drained
them. The Devils walked out of Continental Airlines' Arena thinking
they had played the stronger game, and at least as far as good
scoring chances went, they would certainly be right.
</P>
<P>
   But the good chances stopped at Belfour. At one point, midway
through the third period in a 1-1 game, New Jersey's Randy McKay
screamed something unprintable after Belfour had stoned him from
right in front. Eddie got McKay twice in the third period when
McKay only had the goalie to beat. It was the same with Claude
Lemieux, who also thought he had the go-ahead goal in his cross
hairs _ twice in the final period _ only to have Belfour stop the
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie at his best again is a worry the Devils hadn't considered
after such easy pickings in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I had anything to prove tonight; I just
tried to forget about \RGame 1\S,'' said Belfour, who sounded like
an excuse-maker when he mentioned the ``drowsy'' stuff after the
Tuesday night beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I knew I didn't feel well for the first game, and I knew I
felt a lot better for this game,'' added Belfour with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 followed the same trend Belfour and the Stars have used
throughout the playoffs. Play lousy _ so lousy there is no logical
explanation _ and then rebound in the next game. The only question
about rebounding last night was that Game 1 had reached the lowest
postseason point for this team in the past two playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, however, allowed the U-turn to happen, and the Stars'
commitment to defensive positioning followed his lead.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Devils were trigger-happy in this one, probably
an unavoidable reaction to the scoring-at-will fun of Game 1. The
good shots on Belfour mainly resulted from strong forechecking by
New Jersey. Almost no offensive threat came as a result of battles
won in the neutral zone or at the Stars' blue line. This, of
course, was a major change from Game 1 when the Devils used
superior speed to turn those areas into the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils kept trying the puck-rush again last night from
center ice, and were repeatedly turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had four men across the blue line and we continually
wanted to carry the puck in there,'' Devils' coach Larry Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Devils' took the medicine, while Eddie felt just
fine.

HULL DISCOVERS SCORING TOUCH AT RIGHT TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Well, dad, how is he doing now?
</P>
<P>
   By his own silent admission, Brett Hull had a bleak regular
season. Between a goal drought as he pursued his famous father and
a plus-minus tattoo that seemed to grow like the national debt, the
Dallas Stars' most prolific career goal scorer languished in his
mediocre results.
</P>
<P>
   But blessed be the mute. In the playoffs, Hull has taught us,
they shall have plenty to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hull's two goals, including the game-winner with 4:16 to
play, that breathed new life into the defending champion Stars on
Thursday night at Continental Airlines Arena. After the schoolyard
spanking that the New Jersey Devils had administered Tuesday night,
the Stars' 2-1 victory was yet another example of this team's
uncanny ability to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   And the postseason Lazarus of the bunch has to be Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things weren't going good the whole season,'' Hull said after
the series-knotting victory. ``But now things are.''
</P>
<P>
   In 79 regular-season games, Hull scored the fewest goals (24) of
his 15-year NHL career. His quest to equal dad Bobby Hull's mark of
610 career goals seemed to linger over several major American and
Canadian holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the playoffs, he no longer chases his father. The
attainable goal is named Conn Smythe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so focused on making a change from the way things were
in the regular season,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``It was a very
difficult regular season for Brett Hull.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hull was on the ice during the season, the Stars were
minus-21. The number branded Hull as a noncontributor.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock was quick to remind Thursday night that that
wasn't necessarily the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything seemed to go wrong,'' Hitchcock said. ``I think he
was on the ice for 11 or 12 empty-net goals against.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's just made so many believers of all of us in the
playoffs. It's great to see.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight months, Stars watchers finally see it again, too.
</P>
<P>
   He shoots, he scores. It is why Brett Hull wears a Stars jersey
in the first place. It is what Bobby Hull's kid does best.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, it was a good time for teammate Mike Keane
to break out the cap, the navy blue ballcap with ``Shut Up Hull''
stitched onto it. Keane first broke it out when Hull was in the
midst of his longest season scoring drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we have to play,'' Keane said, reciting the
Stars' ode to selfless teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this before, but our star players deserve a lot of
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   What Keane was lauding is how Mike Modano, Joe Nieuwendyk and
Hull _ especially Hull _ have sacrificed the scoring flash and Ice
Capades dash to play at both ends of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Hull is no longer any one-trick pony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Hully deserves a lot of credit,'' Hitchcock said.
``It's tough when you're an older player, when you've played when
the league was a little more wide open. It's a difficult decision
that you have to make in your career when you know that the game is
so closed off now. There's not a lot of open space. You've got to
be able to go out and fight for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Hull has fought more tenaciously and found his room
to blossom in this postseason. With his two goals Thursday night,
he remains the NHL playoffs' leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hull is prepared to fight for it now,'' Hitchcock said. ``He
is a committed guy. He's committed to this team. He's committed to
the organization. He deserves an awful lot of credit.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hull's first goal, a huge weight seemed to lift off the
defending champs' shoulders. It came on the Stars' first shot of
the night and spoke volumes. New Jersey goaltender Martin Brodeur
would not be a stone wall on this night.
</P>
<P>
   On his second one, Hull said, ``I just threw my stick out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you're hot, you're hot. The puck finds you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just keep hoping they do,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   In the winners' locker room Thursday night, they talked about
pride. They talked about resurrection. They talked about how it
stung after the 7-3 embarrassment in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about the kinds of things that kept Brett Hull so
silent for much of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   As Keane, wearing his cap, said, ``I hope he's here talking till
three in the morning.''

DEVILS LOSE HOME ADVANTAGE WITH GAME 2 LOSS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Seven goals. Ten goals. Twelve goals.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter what the New Jersey Devils did in Game 1 of
the Stanley Cup Finals or how many goals they scored on Ed Belfour.
What the Devils didn't do in Game 2 was hold on to the
ever-precious home-ice advantage, and as the two teams return to
Dallas, the only numbers that really matter are 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Translation? Advantage Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you can go two games up on anybody and don't it's an
opportunity missed,'' New Jersey center John Madden said. ``Now
we've gotta do this the hard way. We knew we weren't going to win
this thing in four straight, but we had all intentions of taking
the first two games.''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't, and that could turn out to be bigger than the
optimistic Devils realize.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, after all, are a league-best 9-1 at home during the
2000 playoffs, the only loss coming to Colorado in Game 1 of the
Western Conference Finals. Dallas has also outscored its postseason
opponents by a 26-12 margin in Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And last night, when the Devils handed the Stars a turnover that
resulted in the game-winning goal by Brett Hull, they also handed
the Stars home-ice advantage. All the Stars have to do is win every
home game and the Cup stays in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was certainly there for us,'' Devils defenseman Ken
Daneyko said. ``That's the disappointing part. We had opportunities
to win but we had too many defensive mistakes. There's a fine line
there between winning and losing.''
</P>
<P>
   That fine line just became a tightrope for the Devils, who
seemed to have the world in their hands after the 7-3 blowout in
Game 1. They kept saying the score of the opener didn't matter
unless they took care of things in Game 2. They knew all along
Belfour was going to play better. And they knew there would be no
shooting gallery last night.
</P>
<P>
   They also knew they had to play better against a Stars team that
would obviously be better. And the Devils didn't.
</P>
<P>
   So for the Devils, the highs of Game 1 become the lows of Game
2. They just have to hope it's not a repeat of the Eastern
Conference Finals, when they won Game 1 against Philadelphia only
to lose the next three games and fall behind 3-1. Because against
the Stars, there might not be a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as they have to feel good about themselves, we don't
feel very good about ourselves because we didn't show them our best
game,'' Devils coach Larry Robinson said. ``So now we are 1-1. They
didn't play their best game; we didn't play our best game. So we
are going back to Dallas to see who is the best when we both play
well.''

LITTLE THINGS BECAME BIG WIN FOR STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The NHL has awards for seemingly every
statistic it tracks. There is, however, no Jane M. Doe Little
Things Award for the team or player who does all the minutia _
checking, faceoffs, digging pucks _ better than anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   If there were such a piece of hardware, the Stars would have won
it Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our game,'' Stars winger Blake Sloan said, ``is doing
those little things.''
</P>
<P>
   After not doing little things so well in Game 1, the Stars made
sure that lines one through four covered every angle, and it paid
off in a 2-1 victory against New Jersey in Game 2 of the Stanley
Cup Finals on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was winning the faceoffs when they had to, digging
out pucks, creating chances, clearing pucks out of the defensive
zone or beating the Devils to neutral-zone pucks, the Stars'
sometimes faceless players did all the things that got them to this
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's definitely a contributing factor,'' Sloan said.
``If you eliminate those things from the game, you might be looking
at a different score.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Joe Nieuwendyk's line didn't score. It didn't allow
one, either. Neither Jon Sim nor Sloan created waves of chances,
but they combined for five hits and were both primary reasons why
the Devils never scored in the second period despite outshooting
the Stars, 17-10, in the first 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that the Stars junked their wide-open style in Game 1
that resulted in a 7-3 defeat. Thursday night, they played more of
their conservative style that often bores fans but wins games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win faceoffs, that's puck possession, and that's half
the battle of carrying the puck around,'' Stars winger Mike Keane
said. ``Our centers did a great job tonight controlling the puck
and getting the pucks back. Once again, we had four strong lines
going.''
</P>
<P>
   They blocked 13 shots, won 31 of 63 faceoffs, dished out 31 hits
and absorbed the same amount and had 23 takeaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last game, we got caught trying to play an easy game,''
Stars center Guy Carbonneau said. ``We got beat off the wall, beat
in front of our net. That's what we talked about after Game 1 and
(Wednesday) in our meeting. Tonight, it showed a little bit more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have any easy pucks in the neutral zone, they
didn't hit that blue-line with a lot of speed too often and every
time they did they had to battle with one guy and (another) guy was
coming back so they didn't have much time to make their plays.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Devils made plays, they were quickly shut down, cleared
out of the zone or stopped by Stars goalie Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   To win the Cup, the Stars likely must continue to excel in the
sometimes invisible-to-the-naked-eye tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it's going to come down to,'' Stars captain Derian
Hatcher said, ``is all the little things.'' nn

NICE MOVE BY MOGILNY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. Think Alexander Mogilny's first-period
step around Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk, which left Mogilny
one-on-one with Ed Belfour and resulted in a goal, was a great move
by the Devils? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well it never would have happened without a big move by the
Devils' front office this spring. Every team tries to make a great
addition near the trade deadline that will spark a deep postseason
run, and New Jersey might have made the best when it traded Brendan
Morrison and Denis Pederson to Vancouver on March 14 to get
Mogilny. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the postseason, Mogilny has been the man mentioned
when anyone speaks of New Jersey's more potent offense. He might
have been forgotten after Game 1 because of the great play by the
first line of Jason Arnott, Petr Sykora and Patrik Elias, but he
showed last night he's still dangerous in the open ice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And should the Devils get him and that first line going at the
same time, they could give the Stars' stifling defense a big test
for the rest of the series. &QL; 
\Nsubheds:End of a streak &QL; 
 &LR; agatea:Last night's 2-1 loss was the first in Stanley Cup Finals
competition for New Jersey goaltender Martin Brodeur. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur was with the Devils when they swept Detroit in 1995, and
he's now 5-1 in Finals games. His career playoff record is 47-32. &QL; 
\Nsubheds:Case for defense &QL; 
To no one's surprise, Devils coach Larry Robinson said he did not
believe the 10 combined goals scored in Game 1 would be indicative
of the rest of the series. Well, he was right. Game 2 was a titanic
defensive struggle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Each game is a series in itself, and so once that game is over
with, let's forget about it and go on to the next one,'' Robinson
said. ``We have to be prepared to meet a Dallas team at its
best.'' &QL; 
\Nsubheds:Stevens' milestone &QL; 
Devils defenseman Scott Stevens notched his 100th career playoff
point with his first-period assist on Alexander Mogilny's goal that
tied the score 1-1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who is being regarded as the Devils' playoff MVP if
they win the Stanley Cup, has 10 points (three goals, seven
assists) in the playoffs. &QL; 
\Nsubheds:Open Devil denied &QL; 
Devils winger Randy McKay had three solid scoring opportunities
squashed by Stars goalie Ed Belfour. Two came in the second period,
and a golden chance got away with a little more than 13 minutes
left in the third period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The play started with Stars center Guy Carbonneau's winning the
draw against John Madden to the left of Belfour, but the puck
squirted into the slot. McKay was all alone, but he couldn't get
off a strong shot, and Belfour made the save. Had McKay been a
left-handed shot, he might have gotten more on it. &QL; 
\Nsubheds:The kid is back &QL; 
New Jersey center Scott Gomez broke a streak of seven games without
a point with his assist on Alexander Mogilny's first period goal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, a finalist for the Calder Trophy (league's top rookie),
last registered a point on May 16, in Game 2 of the Eastern
Conference Finals. In that game, a 4-3 loss to Philadelphia, Gomez
had a goal and an assist. &QL;

STARS WIN SECOND ROUND IN BATTLE OF TOP LINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils and Stars are hunkering down
for a battle of whatever you can do, I can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Devils coach Larry Robinson initiated the matchup of top-line
supremacy by pitting center Jason Arnott, Petr Sykora and Patrik
Elias against Stars center Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Jere
Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   Two games down, the lines have gone tit-for-tat, and Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock is apparently ready to let this series come down to a
battle of big guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it yesterday. We made the decision that our
line is going to play against Jason's the rest of the series,''
Modano said. ``He \RRobinson\S didn't really seem too interested in
getting away from that \Rlast night\S with the last change. We were
a little more responsible with the matchup. It is something that we
didn't have in Game 1, but I think that will be the way it is the
rest of the series.''
</P>
<P>
   With the advantage of last change, Hitchcock could change the
matchup when the Stars return home for Games 3 and 4 beginning
Saturday. That apparently won't be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Awakened by a Game 1 in which the Devils' line tattooed Modano
and mates for four goals and 11 points, the Modano line retaliated
with suffocating defense and two Brett Hull goals for a 2-1 victory
in Game 2 at sold-out Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Arnott line was held scoreless and was a minus-2, victimized
on both Hull goals, the game-winner coming at the 15:44 mark of the
third period on a redirect on Lehtinen's shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a specific job to do,'' Hitchcock said, ``and they
got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock started the line the way it finished Game 1, with
Lehtinen, a two-time Selke Trophy winner as the league's top
defensive forward, playing left wing in place of rookie Brenden
Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's game-winner was a result of hard work. The Stars got the
turn over, Lehtinen put the puck on net and Hull redirected it past
Devils goalie Martin Brodeur. Hull's first-period goal, which put
the Stars up 1-0, was again set up by outworking the Devils' top
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modano can create his own space out there,'' Robinson said.
``He is such a skilled player when he gets the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen and Modano dug the puck out of the corner. Modano
gained possession and fed Hull, who seemed to lurk into the right
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first goal was just a lot of hard work by Jere and Mike as
usual,'' Hull said. ``I was just trying to stay in good position as
the third man. Mike got it to me, and I just hurled it and shot it
as quick and hard as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arnott line still managed to throw 10 shots on Stars goalie
Ed Belfour, butits space was severely limited compared to Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we talked about was our quickness and our position as far
as defensively in our own zone,'' Modano said.

BELFOUR REBOUNDS IN STYLE AFTER GAME 1 MISERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Goalie Ed Belfour was feeling a lot
better Thursday night and so were the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals was just what the doctor
ordered for the Stars. Belfour, with a little help from his
friends, saved 27 of 28 shots as Dallas rebounded with a 2-1
victory against the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I had to (prove anything),'' Belfour said.
``I knew I didn't feel good the first game. I just tried to forget
about it and get ready for tonight and prepare the same way and
just go out there and try to do my best. I feel a lot better today,
a lot stronger definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour allowed six goals on 18 shots before being pulled in the
third period of the Stars' 7-3 loss Tuesday night. He blamed his
poor performance on a decongestant prescribed for cold symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, there were no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something you try and do is forget about nights when you don't
have such a good night,'' Belfour said. ``You do the best you can
to just try and forget about it. It's definitely hard, but I didn't
have any problems sleeping. I knew it wasn't a good night for
myself. That's happened to me before, and I knew what to do to get
ready for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was back to normal in Game 2. In his past nine starts
after a loss, Belfour is 9-0 and has allowed less than two goals
per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was anyone in here concerned with Eddie,''
Stars forward Kirk Muller said. ``You know he's human, and we
didn't play well in front of him the other night. Everyone looks at
Eddie, but we have to play better for him, and we did (Thursday
night). He responded like he has all year. We felt like we let him
down the other night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars made it up to Belfour on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Either defenseman Darryl Sydor or his defensive partner, Sergei
Zubov, were on the ice for all 10 goals in Game 1. They had two
hits and three shots Thursday night, and neither was on the ice for
the Devils' only goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 1 was a big slap in the face,'' Sydor said. ``We talked
to each other. We told each other we need to pick it up
defensively, and I think it was a little better. Obviously, I think
it was a lot better than Game 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was feeling like himself again Thursday night. He said
he did not take any medication before Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a lot stronger,'' Belfour said. ``I felt a lot better.
Naturally, I saw the puck move well.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 of the third period, Belfour dropped his stick when he
left the crease to try to clear a shot by Claude Lemieux. It's the
only thing he lost all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to poke the puck, and I dropped my stick and when I
tried to cover, obviously, I was way behind on the play,'' Belfour
said. ``They got it back to the point there, and I just tried to
get back to the net as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was back in a big way in Game 2, and so were the Stars,
who come home with the series even at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Eddie was going to bounce back,'' Stars forward Mike
Keane said. ``We had no concern with Eddie. We know he is very
strong. We know he is a very proud person. If we want to win, we
have to have him playing good hockey.''

STARS' LANGENBRUNNER A SCRATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner was a
scratch last night as he continues suffering from a sprained right
knee. He has now missed four consecutive games dating to Game 5 of
the Western Conference Finals against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is better,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``But he's not
a player.'' Sloan sighting Stars winger Blake Sloan played for the
first time in the Stanley Cup Finals last night, moving Grant
Marshall out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan was put on the line with Guy Carbonneau and Kirk Muller
and played 10 minutes, 17 seconds on 17 shifts. He had one hit and
one penalty for roughing.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan hadn't played since Game 6 at Colorado of the Western
Conference Finals. Struggles continue The Stars have struggled all
season on four-on-four situations, and it bit them again last
night. With Devils defenseman Brian Rafalski and Stars winger Blake
Sloan in the penalty box for roughing, the Devils' Alexander
Mogilny used his speed to tie the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up the loose puck, skated deep into the Stars' zone
and outskated Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk to the slot.
Mogilny beat Belfour high to the glove side at the 12:42 mark of
the first period. Penalty kill is back The Stars' penalty kill is
back at the high level it was at during the regular season. They
killed two more Devils power plays last night and have killed 22 of
the past 23 penalties.
</P>
<P>
   For the playoffs, they have killed 81 of 92 penalties. Hull
milestone Stars winger Brett Hull's playoff-leading 10th goal early
in the first period last night was No. 86 of his career, moving him
out of a fifth-place tie with former New York Islanders forward
Mike Bossy on the all-time playoff goals-scored list. He added No.
87, the game-winner, late in the third period. The game-winner tied
him with his father for sixth all-time with 15 career multi-goal
playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Anderson (93), Jari Kurri (106), Mark Messier (109) and
Wayne Gretzky (122) rank ahead of Hull. Feeling good Stars
defenseman Derian Hatcher played with a hyperextended right knee.
He had three shots and two hits and survived a nasty check from
Jason Arnott at 4:23 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all right,'' said Hatcher, who was injured in the third
period of Game 1. ``I think there were a lot of questions in my
mind to be honest with you, but it felt great throughout the
night.'' Fewest shots The Stars' penchant for low shot totals
bordered on the ridiculous in the first period. They had three
shots, a team-low for this season's playoffs. Hull scored the
Stars' first goal at 4:25 on their first shot. The Stars' next shot
didn't come until 13:39 on Sylvain Cote's shot from the left
circle. Derian Hatcher had the other on a soft wrister from the
left circle at 14:12.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' previous low was four shots. They did that twice,
both coming during second periods against Colorado in the Western
Conference Finals. The Stars had four shots in the second period of
Game 1 and Game 3, both Dallas losses. Lehtinen's conditioning
Stars winger Jere Lehtinen waited patiently, sometimes impatiently,
to finally return after playing all of 17 regular-season games due
to a fractured right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it finally feels good,'' Lehtinen said. ``It's kind of
lucky that I am back for the Stanley Cup Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen, who has scored one goal with four assists since
returning to the playoffs for Game 1 of the Western Conference
Finals, said that his ankle is mostly pain free and that his
conditioning is improving every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I would get tired \Rat the end of games\S,''
Lehtinen said. ``Now, it's getting better. I feel better and I am
not getting tired as much.'' Shattered glass Stars winger Mike
Keane is known to be a checker, but his hit on Devils winger Jay
Pandolfo at the 4:10 mark of the first period was no average check.
It shattered the glass between the team's benches.
</P>
<P>
   Neither player was injured, and the glass was replaced in five
minutes. Hey, that's quick; the crew in Colorado that replaced the
shattered board from a Ray Bourque pass took eight minutes.
Home-change advantage In Games 3 and 4 at Reunion Arena, the Stars
will have the advantage of last change in determining matchups. If
checking center Guy Carbonneau has his way, his line will match up
against the Devils' top line of Petr Sykora, Jason Arnott and
Patrik Elias, who burned the Stars for four goals and 11 points in
Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we've talked a lot about,'' Carbonneau said.
``That's one thing about Hitch \RStars coach Ken Hitchcock\S: He
listens to what we say. He's still the one that makes the decision.
When you are on the road, it is kind of tough to \Rto get a good
matchup\S. We're going back home for two games, and I'm sure we'll
try to match something.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau's line in Game 2 included Blake Sloan, who was a
scratch in Game 1, and Kirk Muller. Hitchcock has usual Carbonneau
partner Mike Keane playing on the fourth line to try to spread out
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   In both games, the Devils opted to match their first line
against the Stars' first line of Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Jere
Lehtinen. Cut-up Muller Stars winger Kirk Muller suffered a cut to
his upper and lower lip after being hit with a deflected puck
during yesterday's morning skate. Muller left the ice and did not
return to practice. He had the cuts glued together instead of
receiving stitches, he said. The injury did not keep him out of
Game 2. Yankee approval Stars winger Mike Keane has a New York
Yankees tattoo on his shoulder. He's that big of a fan. Yet his
trip to Yankee Stadium for a game against the Oakland A's on
Wednesday was his first despite formerly playing for the New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   So what did he think?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very nice, very nice stadium for being as old as it is,''
Keane said. Upset friends, eh? Stars winger Brenden Morrow's
friends aren't too happy with him, and they called to let him know.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, folks have Stanley Cup pools a lot like the Final
Four pools in the United States. Morrow's friends took the Stars
because that's whom he plays for. The Stars' lack of scoring didn't
exactly help their chances in the pool. ``They were a little upset
because the New Jersey guys got all the points and none of the
Dallas guys did,'' Morrow said. ``Their playoff pools aren't doing
too good.''

SAVING GARFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, the Garfield neighborhood near the heart of
Phoenix was dying, struck down by the classic urban ills of
poverty, gangs, crime and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 1-mile-square area is still battered and blighted but
still alive.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't come cheap: The price tag has been at least $10
million in taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves some officials and residents asking whether
Garfield's history showcases government's ability to rescue
troubled neighborhoods or shows the limits even the best intentions
can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have accomplished quite a bit,'' said Douglas Fox, a
longtime resident of the area bounded by Seventh and 16th streets,
Van Buren Street and the Papago Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I sometimes wonder if we spent twice the money if we could
finally clean this area up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been very expensive, and we have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with residents, police, city officials and others
suggest several lessons from Garfield's experience:
</P>
<P>
   _Only years of targeted efforts and millions of dollars can even
begin to rescue neighborhoods so far lost to urban blight.
</P>
<P>
   _Participation by neighbors themselves is essential for even
moderate success.
</P>
<P>
   _The forces affecting urban neighborhoods often involve broad
social and economic forces outside anyone's control.
</P>
<P>
   _``Saving'' one neighborhood can mean transferring its problems
to others.
</P>
<P>
   _The years and money spent on Garfield may preserve it only
until the rising downtown housing market arrives for the real
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   _But if such gentrification does bring new upscale residents to
Garfield, it may also drive poorer residents out. &QL; 
Definitely worth saving
</P>
<P>
   ``Neighborhood redevelopment is never cost-effective,'' said
Terry Goddard, a former Phoenix mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But is the neighborhood worth saving? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime resident Helen Trujillo remembers when Garfield was a
lower-middle-income community of well-kept homes and friendly
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the downtown started to die in the 1960s, our
neighborhood started to die,'' Trujillo said.
</P>
<P>
   As residents moved, she said, investors bought the houses for
rentals, bringing in tenants who ``didn't care as much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars were in yards,'' Trujillo said, ``old furniture was left
out. Gangs got started.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crept up on us.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, gunfire was the nightly music in Garfield. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Army of occupation'
</P>
<P>
   ``The gangs were like an army of occupation,'' Phoenix police
Lt. Robert Settembre said. ``They terrorized the old people, shook
them down for money.
</P>
<P>
   Settembre said criminals sold drugs openly, shot each other in
broad daylight and sexually assaulted women too frightened to
report it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   And it looked it. City officials found that three out of four
homes and apartment buildings needed significant repairs, often
equaling half the structure's value.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, residents and police say, Garfield had become a
``community of first arrival'' for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of undocumented workers still occupy apartments in the
area until they obtain documents necessary to get work. Police say
the illegals are easy prey for drug dealers and slumlords.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our problems, from drugs to the market in selling
illegal documents, are rooted in the folks from other countries who
move into here,'' Fox said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
10 million fight
</P>
<P>
   To stem this tide of urban woes, taxpayers have poured more than
$10 million into Garfield since 1995 to fight crime, repair streets
and sidewalks, plant trees, rebuild homes and fund social programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Phoenix brought the first of several programs to
Garfield. Neighborhood Fight Back carried an $80,000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our department and the police helped get Block Watches
started, a newsletter printed and some improvements done in the
area,'' said Tom Boling of Phoenix's Neighborhood Services
Department.
</P>
<P>
   And the locals began to buy in. Douglas Fox said a neighbor,
Lupe Sisneros, talked him into joining the FightBack program.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``She founded the Garfield Organization,'' Fox said of
Sisneros, whom many neighbors credit with saving their community.
She died four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had meetings, got advice from the police, had some
neighborhood cleanups,'' Fox said. ``There was an increased police
presence, and that helped some, but it still was a tough place.''
</P>
<P>
   Settembre said that about 150 drug houses have been closed since
increased enforcement began in 1995. Hundreds of gang members, drug
dealers and prostitutes have been arrested. &QL; 
`Less shooting'
</P>
<P>
   ``We've almost broken the power of the gangs,'' Settembre said.
``There is less shooting. The streets are safer at night.''
</P>
<P>
   However, police still count Garfield in the top 100 of the 1,600
Phoenix crime grids.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Garfield Neighborhood Organization and the city
sought and received a federal ``Weed and Seed'' grant for $727,523.
In the next four years, an additional $2 million in Weed and Seed
money and about $7 million in Community Development Block Grant
money poured into the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Weed and Seed programs seek to weed out the criminal element
while planting the seeds of home improvement, education and social
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the best things Weed and Seed got us were a
bunch more street lights and a heck of a lot more trees,'' Fox
said. ``You felt a little safer at night, and the trees made the
place look a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Continued police pressure also helped. &QL; 
Gang influence down
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``Since the police started hitting hard on the gangs, their
influence has gone way down,'' said Manuel Ramirez, principal of
Garfield Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, single-family home construction and rehabilitation
efforts began with federal funds. Social-service programs were
launched, including day care, job placement, remedial education, a
folk dance group, a youth crime watch, a teen council and others.
</P>
<P>
   The city began refurbishing buildings that could be saved and
demolishing the rest. In the past five years, 234 Garfield homes
have been rehabilitated or reconstructed, with neighbors using
low-interest block grant loans.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 new houses have been built by Neighborhood Housing
Services, a non-profit organization that promotes homeownership in
downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Central City Precinct Commander Joe Klima said that stings to
arrest prostitutes and their customers have begun, efforts against
slumlords will be boosted and that a special city prosecutor will
be assigned to the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Police statistics suggest a positive effect. Since 1994, violent
crimes in Garfield have dropped by about 10 percent while citywide,
there has been a 5 percent decrease. Property crimes and drug
crimes also have decreased. Calls for police service in Garfield
have declined by 22 percent since 1994 while increasing citywide. &QL; 
Yuppification ahead?
</P>
<P>
   Physically, Garfield remains tattered. Scores of buildings are
surrounded by trash, have peeling paint, broken windows and sagging
doors.
</P>
<P>
   But there is evidence that the years of work and money may have
set the stage for a further transformation. In December, Camden
Property Trust opened high-end apartments at Eighth and Van Buren
streets, across the street from the Garfield neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   There are more to come, according to urban planner John F.
McIntosh, who calls Garfield ``a prime area for `yuppification.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh, of Arizona State University, said young professionals
already have bought heavily in the nearby Roosevelt and Coronado
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The demand for nice places to live downtown will only
increase,'' McIntosh said. ``We're running out of available,
intact, historic neighborhoods. The Garfield neighborhood will see
more and more places like Camden.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the average Garfield home sold for $65,000. The
average price now is $90,000, according to real estate affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old houses will continue to gain in value, the slum
apartments will be bought up and demolished,'' McIntosh said. ``The
neighborhood should only get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Goddard notes, however, that yuppification of the
area, although good for homeowners, will not solve the problem of
the poorer folks, the mostly illegal immigrants who live in rentals
and likely will leave when upscale places are built.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will go somewhere else,'' Goddard said. ``The
neighborhood will get better, but part of its problem will just
move.'' &QL;

HOUSTON COMETS SPOIL STORM'S HOME OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MEREDITH BAGLEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The celebration of the Seattle Storm's historic,
first-ever WNBA game in KeyArena began with fireworks and ended
just as abruptly after the opening tip.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Comets, three-time league champions, were not in a
generous mood one night after nearly being upset by the expansion
Portland Fire, and took their frustration out Thursday night,
pounding the Storm, 77-47.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our worst nightmare was for them to have a close game in
Portland,'' Seattle coach Lin Dunn said of Houston's 93-89
double-OT victory over the Fire on Wednesday. ``They wanted to show
the world why they're the champs in Seattle _ we received their
wrath.''
</P>
<P>
   Comets forward Sheryl Swoopes, who scored 28 points in Portland,
led all scorers with 20 points, 13 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Storm were led by center Quacy Barnes' career-high 16
points, while forward Kamila Vodichkova grabbed seven rebounds.
Guard Edna Campbell, who led the league with 19.5 points per game
in the preseason, managed only 11 points on 5-for-17 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we got good things from Kamila and Quacy, but needed
to get more points from our perimeter,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle won the opening tip and took a 5-2 lead on Vodichkova's
3-pointer. The good news ended there.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, game faces on and vengeance pumping in their veins,
went on a 22-3 run to take a 24-8 lead midway through the half.
Forward Tina Thompson hit two 3-pointers in the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we did a poor job of early was finding Tina Thompson
and contesting her 3-point shot,'' Dunn said. ``I don't think we
had enough respect for what she can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who missed her first seven shots, broke the Storm
scoring drought with a free throw. Barnes brought Seattle's offense
back to life with strong inside moves and soft outside shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quacy is our warrior,'' Dunn said. ``I think she arrived
tonight as a legitimate post player who can be forceful in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, facing the size and skill of Houston forwards Thompson
(6-foot-2), Tammy Jackson (6-2) and Tiffani Johnson (6-4), scored
seven of Seattle's final nine points before the break, narrowing
the deficit to 40-23 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough in there,'' Barnes said. ``I think I fight harder
since I'm only 180 pounds, but I tip my hat to Tina Thompson. She's
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets picked up where they left off in the second half,
roaring out of the break with a 12-4 run in the first seven minutes
to extend the lead to 52-27.
</P>
<P>
   The Storm continued to struggle offensively, missing easy
baskets and committing turnovers in the face of relentless Houston
pressure. For the game, Seattle shot just 34 percent from the field
and only 57 percent from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just could not execute on anything,'' guard Robin Threatt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn used her bench extensively, playing her entire roster and
resting starters Campbell, Vodichkova and Sonja Henning as time
wound down.
</P>
<P>
   Henning, who had two points and three assists, played just four
minutes in the second half as Dunn used Jamie Redd and Threatt at
the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonja wasn't scoring,'' Dunn said. ``We were down, and I
thought it was an opportune time to give Jamie and Robin some
minutes. We need to get scoring out of our backcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn also tinkered with her lineup facing the potent Comet
offense, starting defensive specialist Charmin Smith in place of
the slower Katrina Hibbert. Smith's best efforts were for naught,
however, as Swoopes showed no signs of playing 48 minutes in
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swoopes came out on fire,'' Dunn said. ``She's world-class. I
think she's the premier player in the world. We've got nobody on
our team like her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn remained upbeat after her team's second loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me a team in this league that opened with a more
difficult and challenging schedule than the Seattle Storm,'' she
said. ``Portland is a bigger game for us _ we'll see where we are
Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland was supposed to be a break for the Storm after facing
Sacramento and Houston back-to-back, but with the Fire's surprising
performance vs. the Comets, the Storm has three tough games in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be nights like this,'' Threatt reflected
after the game. ``I just hope we got our worst one out now. I think
you'll see a different team (Saturday) against Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Dunn was pleased with the 10,840 fans who turned out for
the Storm's inaugural game in KeyArena. ``It was exciting ... to
see the crowd get into it. They were ready to erupt. I wish we'd
scored more points for them.'' ... The 17-member Storm Dance Troop
made its KeyArena debut and drew rave reviews from Sonics star Gary
Payton: ``Lavonte (Jackson, the youngest member of the squad at age
5) is the man. I can't do what he does.'' Payton, who sat
courtside, was impressed with the Storm's losing effort. ``I think
it's good the WNBA came to Seattle,'' he said. ``I like that
Campbell's game _ she gets her hands on the ball, plays defense and
goes to the hoop.''

<P>
   Offense, the saying goes, is often the best form of defense.
Since the destructive force of the atom gave mankind the power to
blow up the world, this military dictum has been elevated to high
moral principle and guaranteed by treaty.
</P>
<P>
   For almost 30 years, America and Russia have agreed to leave
themselves vulnerable to attack by limiting their use of defenses
that could protect them from each other's most destructive weapons:
long-range missiles carrying nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of such mutually assured destruction _ MAD, for short
_ required both to renounce an effective missile shield, since its
owner might be tempted to attack the other in the belief that it
would be safe from a counterstrike.
</P>
<P>
   This ``balance of terror'' gives America and Russia the
confidence to go on cutting their huge nuclear arsenals. But U.S.
President Bill Clinton now wants to persuade his Russian
counterpart, Vladimir Putin, starting at their summit on June 4, to
rewrite the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposes to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty to allow limited land-based defenses against a limited
missile attack, not from unthreatening Russia, but from hostile
regimes, such as North Korea's.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the start of an easy shift to a defense-dominated world?
Or are America's proposed national missile defenses (NMD) destined
to cause new offense all around?
</P>
<P>
   To judge by recent rhetoric, they already have. Russia's Duma
threatens to tear up the Start-2 arms-cutting treaty it belatedly
ratified in April if America abandons its ABM vows. China would
review its (minimal) participation in arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Some Europeans at first pooh-poohed NMD as another wacky idea
out of Washington _ like the 1980s ``star wars'' plan for an
(unachievable) impenetrable shield over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans are pressing on. Can their harshest critics
and their closest friends all be wrong? Or is nostalgia for a MAD
world a relic of Cold-War thinking?
</P>
<P>
   The ABM treaty, though it has been amended several times
already, was indeed written for a different world. Its core
proposition, however, still holds: in the nuclear age, an attempt
by America or Russia to make itself uniquely invulnerable to the
other's rockets would fundamentally upset the strategic balance.
</P>
<P>
   Even short of that, it would be folly for America to build
defenses against one set of limited threats only to unleash a new
arms race with Russia whose likely result was reduced security for
all.
</P>
<P>
   Whether NMD spells No More Disarmament therefore depends on
whether America strikes out alone or manages to do a
stability-preserving deal with Russia: a ``grand bargain'' that
preserves both the essentials of the ABM treaty and the hope for
deeper weapons cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says he will decide later this year whether to start
building the limited anti-missile shield his officials have
devised. And, though technology and timing are still controversial
even in America, many of NMD's critics, including many Russians and
Europeans, acknowledge that the threat it has been designed to
defend against is real; it is numerically smaller than in Cold-War
times, but also less predictable.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's launch in 1998 of a far-flying rocket showed that
the big-power monopoly over such weapons had been broken. Within
the next decade, several other countries _ Iran and Iraq are the
main suspects _ are likely to develop similar rockets, thanks to
the Russian, Chinese or North Korean technology they have already
been given.
</P>
<P>
   Some, if not all, of these countries have a history of
belligerence against America. So, with allies to defend in
dangerous parts of the world, American officials worry that they
may soon find themselves squaring off against an aggressive regime
with the capacity to threaten New York or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that America was unprotected, that country might
calculate _ or miscalculate _ that aggression was easier to get
away with.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as NMD's advocates point out, Russia has long kept an
anti-missile shield around Moscow. Shorter-range systems are
already in service, and regional ones _ theatre missile defenses _
are being discussed. These are not limited by the ABM treaty,
because they do not call into question the Russian or American
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's NMD plan would not do that either, since it would
defend against just a few warheads, not the hundreds Russia could
muster in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened to good old deterrence, ask skeptical
Europeans _ the trigger-blocking threat to respond to any attack on
America or its close allies with massive retaliation? They worry
that in a crisis America might just hunker down under its shield,
decoupling its security from that of its friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans respond that their proposed defenses could at best
complement deterrence, not substitute for it. And America's first
resort would still be diplomacy, arms limits, export controls and
sanctions to prevent or contain such threats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the allies worry that Clinton's plan, if achieved, would
not be the end of the matter: grander schemes would follow.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone. Putin knows that, though Clinton's plans
offend the letter of the ABM treaty, not its spirit, many other
Americans would like much more ambitious, treaty-busting
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Putin also wants deeper cuts in nuclear weapons, since
Russia cannot keep up those it has. He would rather negotiate a cut
in numbers _ hence the possibility of a bargain _ than be at a
unilateral disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing America does will mollify China, though, since its
deterrent is small (albeit expanding), and it objects particularly
to America's plans for regional missile defenses: what can protect
American forces in Japan from North Korean missiles could one day
protect Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
   After all China, which has often been ready to provide missiles
to dodgy regimes, has repeatedly threatened Taiwan. Yet, if America
can do a deal with Russia, China might be persuaded to trade upper
limits on its nuclear forces and proper export controls in return
for an American pledge to keep defenses limited.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly a risk, however, that China will build lots
more weapons, prompting others, such as India and then Pakistan, to
do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   As threats change, so the balance of offense and defense may
need to change too, and missile defenses could have a role to play.
But they are no magic fix, and could provoke a destabilizing arms
race, leading to general proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   So if America is to go ahead with them, it should proceed
cautiously, in cooperation with others, not just on a technological
whim and a timetable set by its election calendar.
</P>
<P>
   America's Democrats and Republicans need to agree that such a
controversial decision should be for a new president to make.
</P>
<P>
   Though America and Russia can probably agree that the ABM treaty
is worth preserving, Russia needs to accept that its preservation
may involve its modification. That would give time to weigh the
technologies available against their shortcomings, costs and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If subsequent talks with Russia produced no agreement, both
countries would have the right they have always had to withdraw
from the ABM treaty and defend themselves as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   Far better, though, that they should look to their defenses in
cooperation, rather than in confrontation. And far better, too, if
all those affected _ America, Russia and their allies _ have more
time to consider the implications of NMD.
</P>
<P>
   At best it will offer some protection against only one way of
delivering a nuclear bomb. It is too big a decision to be rushed. &QL;

   It is little wonder that George Speight is known as a ``failed
businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundations of Fiji's economy are its citizens of Indian
descent, who farm the sugar and own many of the country's trading
and tourism businesses. Before a military coup in 1987, Indians
made up over half the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   Since that coup stripped them of many political and other
rights, tens of thousands left for more welcoming climes. The
economy foundered, and the remaining Indians' rights were restored
in a new, 1997 constitution _ which, last year, gave rise to the
election of Fiji's first ethnic-Indian prime minister, Mahendra
Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   So on May 19 Speight and other rebels took the government
hostage, in a bid to drive more Indians away and to hurt the
economy further. The trouble is, he is proving to be a successful
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   The Fijian authorities are in a terrible bind. Solving just a
hostage crisis would be hard enough, with many ministers among
those held, including the daughter of the country's venerable
president, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the man who led Fiji to
independence from Britain in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   But this two-week-old crisis is also a constitutional one,
because Speight has demanded the scrapping of the 1997 document and
has support from some other indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   The indigenous Fijians' Great Council of Chiefs, which is mainly
a symbolic body, has not supported the terrorists but has felt
unable to condemn them outright.
</P>
<P>
   Speight keeps changing his demands, but the authorities _ even
the army, which has nominally taken power _ keep giving into them.
The 1997 constitution has been scrapped, Sir Kamisese has resigned
as president, prime ministers have been suggested and withdrawn,
amnesties have been offered to all and sundry, including the
egregious Speight.
</P>
<P>
   But still the standoff goes on. What can be done?
</P>
<P>
   The first answer is that Speight's bluff must be called. The
concessions must cease. The Fijian army has already gone too far in
scrapping democracy and thereby sanctioning the rebels' efforts to
strip the Indians of their rights.
</P>
<P>
   A line must be drawn, and Speight expelled from Fiji. In the
longer term, a solution is needed for the underlying dispute
between Fijians and Indians, which is over land.
</P>
<P>
   A colonial-era compromise, confirmed by Sir Kamisese's
post-independence government, reserved the ownership of 80 percent
of Fiji's land to the indigenous race, but granted long leases to
Indian farmers.
</P>
<P>
   These will soon expire, and suspicions over the terms of
renewal, under an Indian prime minister, have stoked the racial
fires.
</P>
<P>
   The proper answer would be to abolish racial preference. The
practical answer may well be new long leases, with cash for ethnic
Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   The onus to solve this peaceably must lie on the Fijian elders,
for only they can persuade their fellows to live harmoniously with
the Indians. And if they cannot? There will be further riots. Those
Indians with skills and money will rightly leave.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders, notably Australia, New Zealand and the wider
Commonwealth, should use sanctions to pressure the Fijians to reach
a democratic solution. As in Zimbabwe, aid money could help ease
the land issue, as long as the political structure is there.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Speight must not be rewarded. &QL;

<P>
   De Beer's nightmare has shifted from a flood of diamonds to
blood on diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the diamond giant has manipulated the supply of the
earth's hardest but most overrated natural substance, successfully
keeping it one of the most valuable.
</P>
<P>
   It has survived slumps by stockpiling and booms by keeping
prices ahead of inflation, all the while telling consumers that, in
the words of its long-running advertising slogan, ``a diamond is
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers has run its cartel by buying diamonds, whether from the
Soviet Union or anybody else _ no questions asked. That is now its
biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   At least three wars in Africa are ``fuelled'' by diamonds. In
two, rebel movements control mines and sell diamonds to buy
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA rebels in Angola and the Revolutionary United Front in
Sierra Leone have been condemned internationally for breaking peace
agreements and committing atrocities. The United Nations wants to
cut off their source of cash: diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign, partly financed by Britain, is seeking to alert
consumers to ``conflict diamonds.'' Seeing what animal-rights
campaigners did to fur, this has terrified the whole industry.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer campaign that broke the De Beers cartel and created a
free market in gem diamonds would be a splendid idea. But there is
a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   America is the only country that has tried any serious antitrust
action against the company. Europe, where De Beers's Central
Selling Organization is based, could do far more.
</P>
<P>
   Even if trust-busters fail, however, the cartel is under
pressure, not just from conflict diamonds, but also from newly
discovered deposits mined by companies that do not work with De
Beers.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take years for such a cartel to unravel. And there
is a risk that the process might temporarily raise prices of
conflict diamonds if big mining houses, finding their huge deep
mines uneconomic, were to close them down _ for that would mean a
better price for rebels, scratching around river beds for alluvial
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The question is what else to do in the short run to cut off
rebels' diamond income. De Beers claims to have stopped scooping up
loose gemstones on the open market that might have come from
African war zones.
</P>
<P>
   It has withdrawn buyers from these areas, promised not to buy
diamonds from war zones at source or in Antwerp, the main market
for diamonds, and is offering guarantees that the diamonds it sells
have no ``blood'' on them.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers also says it has leaned on wholesale purchasers who buy
from its stockpile, but also buy diamonds on the open market, to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good _ if also, rather obviously, good for De Beers's
own interests. The firm is now considering ways of marketing
diamonds as branded luxury goods, marked with the De Beers
guarantee of quality and untainted origin.
</P>
<P>
   But even if most conflict diamonds no longer sail unchecked
through Antwerp or London, the evidence is that many are merely
diverted to Tel Aviv and Mumbai. The rebels might get lower prices;
but if their trade is to be dented any further, more concerted
international action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is that all rough diamonds should be certified,
with the certification made open to outside scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers has long maintained that this is impossible: that
diamonds are harder to police even than drugs, because once cut and
polished, their origin is impossible to determine. But experts can
tell the origin of a packet of rough diamonds, even if individual
stones or mixed parcels are harder to identify.
</P>
<P>
   Until now the diamond trade has been barely regulated. Most
smuggled diamonds, stolen or illegally mined, have turned up in
Antwerp, where both the Belgian government and the EU have turned a
blind eye. Other countries, including Israel and India, have been
worse.
</P>
<P>
   That must change. Customs officers should be trained to ensure
that all diamonds are declared on entry, with certificates of
origin provided (not just the country of shipment) and values
registered.
</P>
<P>
   If De Beers and other big companies want to keep their business
blood-free, they must help to police these measures.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, whose troops are facing the rebel movement in Sierra
Leone, is particularly keen to stem the trade from that country,
where at present the government controls not a single diamond. But
Britain, where De Beers holds its stockpile, has itself done
little.
</P>
<P>
   Acceding to De Beers's requests for secrecy, it refuses to
disclose figures on the import and export of rough diamonds, their
origin or their value.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the sort of complicity that must stop if conflict
diamonds are to be curbed and a proper market established. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The only way that George W. Bush's presidential
campaign could go any better these days would be for Al Gore to
announce that, as well as smoking a little dope as a student, he
also joined the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The election is being fought on Democratic issues (education,
health care and welfare) at a time of extraordinary prosperity. Yet
Bush is dominating the policy debate, sounding exciting Republican
variations on familiar Democratic themes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest opinion polls show Bush ahead by between six and ten
percentage points. He is ahead among almost every important
demographic group _ men and women, Catholics and Northeasterners,
married couples and independent voters and, in all probability,
among married swingers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Gore's constituency seems to be shrinking to what
might be unkindly described as geezers and losers: the over-65s and
people earning $20,000-40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   There are still good reasons for thinking that the vice
president is a much more powerful candidate than he currently
appears. But, at the very least, Bush has justified some of the
hopes that the Republican establishment invested in him.
</P>
<P>
   He has not only made far better use of the two months following
the major primaries than Gore; he has also outperformed him on what
ought to be Gore's strongest ground, policy wonkery.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Gore is being deafened by criticisms from his fellow
Democrats, while Bush basks in the praise of the Republican
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The public face of Bush's makeover has been a series of
well-choreographed press conferences. More interesting has been
what has gone on behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has established a friendly relationship with the press
corps, a group that he initially tried to micromanage and
spoon-feed.
</P>
<P>
   Within his own party, he has cleverly used his struggle with
Senator John McCain to silence the right-wingers who have often
seen the Bushes as unsound Rockefeller Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And he has proved a master of using the full range of his
party's resources _ from policy intellectuals such as Steve
Goldsmith and Larry Lindsey to clean-scrubbed young activists. A
party that threatened to fall apart during the McCain insurgency is
now pulling in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   The main aim of all this activity has been to eliminate Bush's
two big negatives. The most obvious is the fear that he is a
prisoner of the far right. This is always a risk if you are
governor of a state that executes more people than most countries
do.
</P>
<P>
   But the risk became a serious political liability when Bush
aligned himself with Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian
Coalition, and Bob Jones III, the head of a university that banned
interracial dating, in order to crush McCain in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then Bush has tried to rebrand himself as ``a
different kind of Republican.'' He regularly boasts that he won the
support of 50 percent of Hispanic voters and 25 percent of blacks
in his last election as governor.
</P>
<P>
   He has perfected an aggressive new form of affirmative action
relating to photo opportunities: he is always surrounded by
minorities, even when he is in the whitest of suburbs. And he has
also belatedly made friends with the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay
pressure group.
</P>
<P>
   This might look like gesture politics. Gore's aides talk about
Bush going on a ``Bob Jones Redemption Tour.'' But the tour is
currently selling out most of the arenas.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush has been busy burnishing his ideology as well as his
image.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not only marched happily into Democratic territory such
as schools, housing and, in the next few weeks, family policy. He
has borrowed a clutch of bright ideas from Bill Clinton's favorite
think-tank, the Democratic Leadership Council, and endorsed
Medicare reforms suggested by one of the Democratic Party's
brightest luminaries, Louisiana's John Breaux.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to dismiss somebody as a right-wing nut if they spend
more time talking about education than anything else _ and if they
steal many of their best ideas from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Whittman, a political analyst at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think-tank, points out that this policy
offensive is also eroding Bush's second big negative: his
reputation as a lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will never entirely escape from his frat-boy image _ indeed
his very likeability may be one of his strongest weapons against
the cold Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the flurry of policy initiatives is meant to suggest that
young George sometimes kept a copy of the latest Brookings policy
paper concealed inside his Playboy, and that he also knew who to
call when the homework assignment was due.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps not surprising that Bush has closed the gravitas
gap on issues such as education. But he has also notched up more
unexpected victories. One such is foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was a leading architect of the Clinton administration's
Russian policy. Bush, by contrast, was until recently best known
for referring to Greeks as ``Grecians'' and having trouble naming
the leaders of large countries. Yet Bush's team has been working
hard to close this gap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the China-trade bill, which the House of
Representatives passed last week, was something of a gift for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore, conscious of his union supporters, held back a
little in his support for permanent trading relations with China,
Bush, who comes from the free-trading, pro-immigration side of his
party, was more effusive about globalization.
</P>
<P>
   He also seized on the opportunities to appear both bipartisan
and statesmanlike _ praising Bill Clinton as well as the House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Missile defense, by contrast, is one of Gore's specialities. Yet
on May 23, Bush put forward the case for substantially reducing
America's stockpile of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was a little vague on details, but Bush surrounded
himself with some of the mightiest members of his party's
foreign-policy establishment _ Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft,
General Colin Powell and George Shultz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Excited talk about both Colin Powell and John McCain finding
their way into a Bush cabinet is also helping to close the gravitas
gap.
</P>
<P>
   Put all these things together and it is clear that over the past
two months Bush's team has done more than just downplay negatives.
They have begun to substantiate Bush's often-repeated claim to be a
``leader.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes leadership to suggest radical reform of the
Social-Security system, something that even a retiring politician
like Clinton is loth to do. Indeed, the Bushites have thoroughly
colonized a territory that Gore has bizarrely decided to leave
empty: that of intelligent social reformer.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Bush has begun to put more flesh on the bones of
``compassionate conservatism,'' positioning it as more cautious
than Gingrichism but more pro-market than his father's Country Club
Republicanism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 375 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,150) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   On education, he offers a mild form of school choice and teacher
accountability. (Pupils who are trapped in persistently dismal
schools will be given vouchers to leave.)
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, he wants younger workers to be able to
invest a small portion of their payroll taxes on their own.
</P>
<P>
   On welfare, he supports a bigger role for voluntary
organizations, particularly those that try to change people's
character, not just tide them over from day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   All this has forced Gore onto the defensive. The vice president
seems forever to be objecting to ``risky schemes'' but never
advancing any interesting ideas of his own. (``If Al Gore would
have been around in Philadelphia when they were signing the
Declaration of Independence,'' Tom Ridge, the governor of
Pennsylvania and a possible Bush vice president has quipped, ``he
would have refused to sign it because it was a risky document.'')
</P>
<P>
   Gore seems increasingly allied with the most stick-in-the-mud
elements in the Democratic coalition _ the people who think that
New Deal liberalism is too perfect to need redesigning. And he is
alienating the brighter elements in his Party.
</P>
<P>
   New Democrats such as Bob Kerry, the senator for Nebraska, and
Will Marshall, the head of the Progressive Policy Institute, worry
that Gore's liberal fundamentalism will condemn their party to
defending entitlement programs (particularly for the old) that eat
up an ever-greater share of federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the pages of the New
York Times to argue the case for retirement saving accounts. Brian
Lunde, a sometime executive director of the Democratic National
Committee, has even announced that he is supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   All this suggests that, if he is elected in November, Bush will
be able to form working links with the New Democratic Coalition _ a
group of 65 pro-business Democrats in Congress who regularly
champion high-tech issues and who broke with their party last week
to secure the passage of the trade deal with China.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a Gore administration might squander one of the
greatest opportunities in modern politics: the chance to redesign
the welfare state at leisure, while the coffers are full, rather
than being forced to redesign it by a crisis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,600) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Polls can change. But the battle for ideas is usually a
slower-moving process. Whatever the result, one of the lasting
ironies of the 2000 campaign may prove to be that the
``lightweight'' Bush grabbed the intellectual edge from the
``heavyweight'' Gore.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any such thing as a ``vital center,'' it now belongs
to the Republicans rather than the Democrats. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ By the zany sartorial standards that prevail on the
Santa Monica boardwalk, a man wearing a cardboard box daubed with
the words ``Big Hotel'' barely merits a second glance.
</P>
<P>
   The pantomime staged outside one of Los Angeles' ritzier hotels
by left-wingers protesting against the low wages paid to
chambermaids was passionate enough. But it did not distract the
muscle-heads swinging on the nearby parallel bars.
</P>
<P>
   When Ralph Nader, the Green Party's probable presidential
candidate, rose to speak, the most conspicuous outsider he
attracted was a heckling drunk.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly scruffy sideshow is just what left-wing activism
looks like to the political establishment in Washington at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton ushered the China trade bill through
Congress by a surprisingly large majority of 40 votes, despite
relentless opposition from the AFL-CIO, the country's largest
trade-union organization and one of the building blocks of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rowdier forms of activism that wrecked the Seattle
trade talks last year look as if they are running out of steam: the
repeat performance in Washington in April failed to close down the
joint meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the perspective of Southern California, the idea that
the left is on the march again looks a little less zany.
</P>
<P>
   The body builders might have paid scant attention, but the
campaign to institute a minimum ``liveable wage'' for workers in
Santa Monica's hotels and restaurants has so rattled local business
owners that they have started their own petition for a rival
``living wage'' law.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of this week's demonstration was to point out that this
was not good enough: there were too many loopholes for the
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, labor activism is on a roll in Southern
California _ galvanized by the union bosses dropping their
opposition to immigration.
</P>
<P>
   This year has already seen one big success: a popular strike for
better wages by janitors, 98 percent of whom were Latinos. Mexico
has a strong union tradition in which noisy strikes and
demonstrations are routine.
</P>
<P>
   Last year home-care workers in the region became unionized,
proving that unions can reach out to a highly dispersed work force.
</P>
<P>
   The cheering chambermaids of Santa Monica were joined at their
rally by placard-waving comrades from the Screen Actors Guild,
currently striking over pay for commercials reshown on cable
television (a strike that is costing the entertainment industry $1
million a day).
</P>
<P>
   And there is Nader. A craggy figure in a battered suit, the
perennial hero of consumer-rights crusades is also on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party is scoring about 5 percent in nationwide polls,
but 9 percent in California. A pool-side fund-raising party after
the union rally pulled in a string of $2,000 contributions from a
Hollywood crowd, edging the campaign a little closer to its goal of
$5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Nader seemed something of a relic _ the man who
made cars safer and then seemed to go slightly bonkers about trade.
</P>
<P>
   Now he seems ahead of the curve _ one of the first people, for
instance, to argue that Microsoft was a monopoly and needed to be
broken up; one of the strongest supporters of wide-scale
campaign-finance reform; and, from some perspectives, the godfather
of all the nongovernmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Another California maverick, Jerry Brown, sounded some of these
themes in 1992. So far Nader can claim slightly more success in
terms of the great challenge of the left in America _ bringing the
movement together.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the 1960s, when the Vietnam demonstrations pitted
blue-collar workers against university radicals, who not only
wheedled their way out of fighting for their country, but even spat
on returning heroes, the left has had a class problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, tree-hugging environmentalists marched alongside car
workers. John Sweeney, the head of the AFL-CIO, did his bit by
sending out organizers to college campuses to fan the flames of
protest against ``sweatshop'' employers. But most of the
organization for Seattle seemed to come from the NGOs _ and from
the Naderite Public Citizen organization in particular.
</P>
<P>
   For Nader, this new coalition is a logical result of money
politics. When money alone buys access to politicians, he says,
civil society starts to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of global capitalism over social equity is creating
an alliance between all sorts of people who have previously been at
odds.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative for voters is ``the pro-life corporate party or
the pro-choice corporate party,'' ``George W. Bush, he of the oil
industry,'' or ``Albert Gore, he who doesn't know his own
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's immediate challenge is to clinch the Green Party
nomination at its convention on June 24. (His rivals are Jello
Biafra, a punk rocker campaigning to abolish the Army and introduce
a maximum wage, and Stephen Gaskin, a hippie campaigning to
legalize marijuana.)
</P>
<P>
   Providing he can overcome this little local difficulty, his next
target is to secure 5 percent of the vote in the presidential
election, thus winning federal funding for a campaign in 2004, and
thereby laying the foundation for a viable third party.
</P>
<P>
   Not a large target _ yet one that could have a profound effect
on Al Gore's chances. Nader says that he attracted only three
Democrats for every two Republicans in the 1996 race (when he did
not actively campaign). That looks far too balanced a split.
Already Democrat bosses are waking up to the idea that, in a tight
race, Green votes could swing some states for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Even in California, strong support for the Greens in the latest
polls means that Gore's lead over Bush has narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least Nader could force Gore to throw money at races
which he would otherwise take for granted. This presents a problem
for the Democrats. But it also presents a problem for Nader's new
left coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Nader says that ``we owe Gore nothing,'' reeling off the
subjects on which the environmentalist left feels betrayed by the
Clinton-Gore administration, from automobile safety and fossil
fuels to biotechnology and forestry. But the labor unions in
particular want Gore to win.
</P>
<P>
   If Nader delivers victory to the party least sympathetic to the
left, it is hard to believe he will not run into all sorts of
problems with Sweeney _ not to mention Biafra and Gaskin. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What can Al Gore do to lift himself out of his
current doldrums? Change from earth tones to black leather, to up
the ante on last October's Alpha-male makeover? Replace Naomi Wolf
with Tina Brown? Appear on Oprah Winfrey?
</P>
<P>
   A more modest strategy would be to sit back and reflect on the
campaign of the last Democrat to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dukakis's defeat at the hands of George Bush senior not
only stands as a warning against reading too much into early
opinion polls. It also provides, courtesy of George senior, a
perfect playbook of how to destroy George junior.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1988 Dukakis was beating George senior by as
much as 17 percentage points in the polls. The governor of
Massachusetts had a reputation for being a pragmatic liberal _
``this election is not about ideology; its about competence,'' he
told the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   George senior, on the other hand, was regarded as an awkward
holdover from the previous regime.
</P>
<P>
   And the result of the election in November? The ``wimp, wasp,
weenie'' and ``every woman's first husband'' trounced ``the
architect of the Massachusetts miracle'' by eight points.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president can draw three big lessons from the Dukakis
debacle. The first is that being the governor of a freak state can
be a huge liability.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and Texas are both well outside the American
mainstream. In the 1980s Massachusetts was famous for liberal
Northeastern public policies that struck most Americans as utterly
crazy, such as buying a modern art sculpture for a prison.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Texas is often seen as a redneck state, famous for
public policies that strike most Americans as utterly barbaric,
from allowing people to carry guns in houses of worship (unless
signs specifically forbid the practice) to letting oil firms
dictate environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
   The second lesson is that attack politics can work. As the older
Bush's negative rating topped 40 points, twice that of his
opponent, the reluctant patrician took the decision to go negative.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign aide, Lee Atwater, famously told his sidekick,
James Pinkerton, ``We're gonna have to use research to win this
campaign. You get me the stuff to beat this little bastard and put
it on this three-by-five card.'' A relentless series of attacks on
the Dukakis record followed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is much happier with attack politics than George senior, as
Bill Bradley, for one, can testify.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is busy presenting Texas as the Appalachia of the
Southwest, a place where you cannot breathe without choking, where
preachers carry guns while delivering sermons, and where children
drop dead at a Third-World rate.
</P>
<P>
   The third lesson is that incumbents almost always win when the
economy is doing well. In 1988 people asked themselves whether they
were doing better than they were under the last Democratic
president, and pulled the lever for Reagan's chosen heir.
</P>
<P>
   The five academic forecasters who have got the best track
records of predicting election results (usually based on a
combination of the state of the economy and public opinion) predict
that Gore can expect to win 53-60 percent of the two-party vote in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between 1988 and 2000 are far from perfect. Gore
is more likely to take a book on Swedish land planning on vacation,
as Dukakis once did.
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Dukakis tried to dispel her husband's reputation as a
robotic calculating machine by dubbing him her ``passionate
partner''; now Tipper gore loyally boasts about the sexual tiger
lurking within her own besuited automaton.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, the number of Americans who say that the country
is on the right track has been steadily slipping since the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore is also finding it surprisingly hard to attract
contented voters, either because they give him little credit for
the ``Greenspan boom,'' or because they do not see Bush as a threat
to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   All these things should be enough to guarantee an exciting race.
But in the end the smart money is still in the same place that it
was this time 12 years ago: on the luckless vice president rather
than the governor. &QL;

   KFAR KILA, LEBANON _ As a procession of helicopters sweeps in to
land, loudspeakers blast Wagner's ``Ride of the Valkyries'' over
the hillsides of southern Lebanon. The U.N. peacekeepers' noisy
display is a deliberate reference to the Vietnam War, as depicted
in the film ``Apocalypse Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pundits had predicted an apocalypse in Lebanon if Israel made
good its promise to withdraw from the country's southern fringes
even without a peace deal with Syria. The angry Syrians, it was
said, would send mercenaries to fire over the border, and the
Israelis would respond with unparalleled severity.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israeli-Lebanese border has remained remarkably quiet
since Israel's army retreated to its side of it on May 24, ending a
22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The most persistent sound on the border these days is not
Wagner's martial bombast but the plonk and tinkle of vans bringing
ice cream to merrymakers.
</P>
<P>
   At the former crossing at Kfar Kila, where the last Israeli
tanks rolled out of the country, curious Lebanese buy
vanilla-chocolate swirl in waffle cones before strolling to the
border fence for their first glimpse of Israel _ or Palestine, as
many of them call it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Palestinian families, separated by the conflict,
have met at the border fence to reacquaint themselves for the first
time in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The only disturbers of the peace are the hotheads shouting
insults under the noses of the po-faced Israeli sentries standing
just three meters (ten feet) across the barbed-wire fence.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days after the evacuation, gun-toting youths threw
stones and tried to rush the flimsy barricade. The Israelis turned
them back with warning shots, injuring a couple. But these, along
with several Lebanese civilians killed or wounded by land mines,
have been the main casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, too, is celebrating the fact that the withdrawal,
however hasty and sloppy, was carried out without any Israeli
casualties at all.
</P>
<P>
   The approval rating of the prime minister, Ehud Barak, has
soared, and he is now turning his attention to the Palestinians in
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even the embarrassment of the army's unsentimental abandonment
of its Lebanese allies is quickly dissipating as the government
offers cash handouts and resettlement promises to the mercenaries
and their families who straggled in as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese army has now reimposed restrictions on travel to
the former occupied zone, making it difficult for troublemakers to
get near the border.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government, in deference to its ally Syria, refuses
to send troops to ``guarantee Israel's security,'' it has filled
the border area with policemen. And Hezbollah, the guerrilla group
that spearheaded resistance to the Israeli occupation, is also
behaving responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen who swarmed through the area in the first days after
liberation have disappeared. Instead, bulldozers bearing Hezbollah
banners are building earth barricades to keep cars away from the
most sensitive spots along the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader, insists that the struggle
against Israel will go on until Lebanese prisoners are freed from
Israeli jails, and a disputed patch of land, the so-called Shibaa
farms, is returned to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, it seems, is not to restart any fighting straightaway,
but to reserve the right to make mischief in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Locals are busy adjusting to life in Lebanon. One Christian
shopkeeper announces that the Shia Muslim guerrillas of Hezbollah
are his ``cousins,'' as he hides his last cases of Israeli beer.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some looting, and one or two reports of beatings,
especially in the Christian villages considered most sympathetic to
the Israeli occupation. But most residents profess astonishment at
the prevailing peace.
</P>
<P>
   The situation seems so calm, in fact, that several hundred of
the 5,500 Lebanese who fled with the departing Israelis have now
announced that they want to return. Heartened by the peaceful
atmosphere and the absence of a pogrom against supposed
collaborators, they have started trickling back across the
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. says that it is close to setting its seal on the
proceedings by certifying Israel's full withdrawal. Teams of
soldiers, cartographers and mine-sweepers have worked their way
along the front-line, trying to chart the old international
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army, eager to earn the inspectors' approval, has
been demolishing fortifications that straddle the border. It blew
up a communications mast that stood a few meters inside Lebanon on
May 29, and other minor salients are due to get similar treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things could still turn sour. The Lebanese government, like
Hezbollah, disagrees with the U.N. about the Shibaa farms, at the
eastern end of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the U.N. tries to defer this question and
endorses the withdrawal, the Lebanese government may refuse to
accept its findings.
</P>
<P>
   At best, that would mean the continued threat of cross-border
attacks by Hezbollah. At worst, Lebanon could refuse to allow U.N.
peacekeepers to patrol the disputed border. Without their
checkpoints, a Lebanese with a grudge, or any of the hundreds of
thousands of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, could take a potshot
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing could easily happen in reverse. The Israeli
government has started handing out machine guns to residents of
border villages, along with stern but unenforceable warnings to use
them only in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the governments on both sides intend to frighten, not
fight, one another, the distinction may be lost on some of their
more lawless citizens. &QL;

<P>
   RICHMOND, VA. _ In a corner of a big warehouse in rural
Virginia, Bobby Thompson spends his days, amidst stacks of
Teletubbies and incontinence products, waiting for e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   When the PC dings with a message, he follows its instructions,
picking some product off the shelf, then boxing and labelling it to
be picked up. This is a new venture and still quiet, with hours
between messages, so Thompson fills in time by sweeping the floor
and tidying up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in this sleepy scene lie the seeds of a radical
transformation of the trucking industry, one that is catapulting it
to the forefront of e-business.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thompson's employer, Great Coastal Express, is a
mid-sized regional trucking firm, the goods on the shelves around
him belong to small Internet retailers and business-to-business
(B2B) firms from as far away as Canada.
</P>
<P>
   They pay Great Coastal's GCX logistics subsidiary to handle
their order fulfillment, its bricks complementing their own clicks.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing particularly novel about that. After all,
mail-order retailers have been outsourcing fulfillment to ``pick
and pack'' logistics firms for years, and e-tailers, which are even
more virtual, have adopted the model with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   More telling is how Great Coastal and companies like it got into
the business in the first place: as a fortuitous outgrowth of the
desperate measures they were forced to employ to stay alive in an
increasingly tough trucking business.
</P>
<P>
   Once, America's trucking industry was a cozy, regulated
semi-cartel, with a few big companies dominating most regions. CB
radio and the call of the open road made every boy dream of one day
driving his own rig; the 18-wheel-culture boom created a bottomless
pool of available drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But when deregulation hit in the early 1980s, the business
quickly lost its charm. Hundreds of thousands of small firms
sprouted (there are now 450,000 trucking firms in America, compared
with 10,000 two decades ago), creating vicious price competition
that forced drivers to spend sleepless weeks at a time on the road
merely to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Burnout took its toll on experienced drivers, while drug testing
and a requirement that drivers be at least 21 years' old limited
the inflow of new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its lost mystique, the industry continued to grow fast,
doubling and tripling in capacity even as prices dropped. The
result was that trucks grabbed the lion's share of the transport
market from trains, and now account for more than 80 percent of the
nation's freight bill.
</P>
<P>
   But an ever-growing call for trucking services has combined with
the diminishing appeal of the job to create an increasingly tight
market for drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Today the industry is short of an estimated 50,000-80,000
drivers (out of 3 million). And the average firm has to replace the
equivalent of its entire work force every year, a turnover rate
five times as big as in the fabled tight job market in technology.
</P>
<P>
   This has forced the trucking firms to take desperate measures to
attract and keep employees. Carriers now have to pay well _ the
best drivers make more than $80,000 a year _ and to offer such
perks as chiropractors, in-cab e-mail and special encouragement to
husband-and-wife (and even pet) teams.
</P>
<P>
   But the most effective way to make the job more attractive has
been to reduce the length of most trips to 300-400 miles, so that
drivers can spend more time with their families.
</P>
<P>
   As drivers defected from long-haul firms to short-haul ones to
recover a home life, trucking firms of all sorts had to change the
way they worked to stem the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Many responded by setting up ``terminals'' and regional
warehouse hubs at which one driver could hand over to another,
Pony-Express style, or loads could be redistributed, both to limit
the distance travelled and to avoid the bane of the industry,
trucks carrying half-empty trailers for part of their journey.
</P>
<P>
   Once they had built these warehouses, trucking firms found new
ways to use them, moving upstream into the logistics market that
was rising to meet demand from manufacturers looking for ways to
save money by outsourcing their warehousing and shipping.
</P>
<P>
   GCX, for instance, warehouses inventory for KB Toys and DuPont.
Although owning and operating warehouses is expensive, it is also
lucrative, allowing trucking firms to forge lasting relationships
with manufacturers and to move beyond the cutthroat commodity
business of basic freight.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, despite the trends of just-in-time
manufacturing and shortening supply chains, total warehouse space
in America has increased by 700 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the increase was in the third-party logistics industry,
as it is known, which grew by nearly 17 percent to $45 billion last
year, according to Armstrong &AMP; Associates, a consulting firm based
in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Then, by sheer coincidence, along came e-commerce. Suddenly the
value of those warehouses became glaringly obvious. Few of the
thousands of new e-businesses wanted the expense and trouble of
building their own fulfillment operations.
</P>
<P>
   If FedEx can package and ship computers for Dell (and the
customer is none the wiser), surely the average
trucking-turned-logistics firm can do the same for online firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor shortages changed the industry, forcing us to move
toward warehouses,'' says Emmett Williamson, GCX's president. ``It
just so happened that this plays well to e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, reckons Armstrong, there are about 250 successful
e-commerce fulfillment and logistics firms in America, of which
around 25 have come out of the trucking industry. But it expects
that number to grow, as more trucking firms capture the obvious
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some of the larger trucking and logistics firms, such
as Schneider National, are building dedicated B2B e-commerce
fulfillment operations.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when a buyer clicks on the ``ship now'' button on
paperloop.com, a bulk paper distributor, the order goes directly to
Schneider, which fills it from its own warehouses on its own
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce is a paradigm shift much more dramatic than
deregulation was in 1980,'' proclaimed David Stubblefield,
president of ABF Freight System, a big trucking and logistics
company, at a recent conference. ``It will change all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas deregulation turned a cozy and profitable business into
a thin-margin snakepit, e-commerce could restore trucking's glory
days
</P>
<P>
   CB radio has given way to e-mail, GPS tracking and wired hubs.
With all that seductive technology, a new generation of kids might
even dream of being truckers again. &QL;

   LIMA _ ``Democracy is dead,'' declared President Alberto
Fujimori's defeated challenger, Alejandro Toledo, to 50,000
supporters in Lima's central San Martin Square after the polls had
closed in the May 28 presidential run-off. ``Fujimori, murderer,''
chanted the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Latin America tacitly agreed. So, loudly, did the United
States. But what were they all, Peruvians or others, to do about
the result: a president re-elected to power, however bogus the
count, in a sovereign country and with a firm grip on its election
authorities, media, judiciary and, it appears, soldiery _ and this
in a continent with a historic dislike of foreign intervention?
</P>
<P>
   That was less clear. After a first-round count plagued with
irregularities (though it credited Fujimori with a fraction less
than 50 percent), Toledo had refused to take part in the run-off
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Election observers from the Organization of American States then
proposed a face-saving way out: postpone the vote for at least ten
days, while they checked new counting software.
</P>
<P>
   Private opinion polls showed Fujimori's lead growing, so this
might have favored him. But, after some negotiations, the electoral
board said no.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, Fujimori won, polling about 51 percent, against
17 percent for Toledo, whose name remained on the ballot. But
nearly a third of the voters spoiled their ballot papers, after
Toledo had urged them to write ``No to fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   That protest and opposition rallies on election night _ the Lima
meeting was the biggest in the capital in a decade _ are
significant. In the past, many Peruvians inclined to opposition
have been afraid of being labelled ``terrorists,'' like the
guerrillas whom Fujimori crushed in the early 1990s. Now he must
reckon with a new readiness for political activism.
</P>
<P>
   How will he react? He has never been a man of compromise:
witness his ``self-coup'' in 1992, when, with army support, he sent
Congress packing. But then he had wide public backing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Peru is split roughly down the middle between those who
back him and those who have had enough. Despite his post-election
message to the nation promising conciliation and more democracy,
Fujimori today looks a lonely man.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police had to disperse demonstrators in Lima and several
provincial cities; violence may not be far off. The generals and
the intelligence-service boss, Vladimiro Montesinos, may well
foresee their already large role in the state growing larger still.
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, Fujimori's style of government, unravelling what feeble
institutions Peru had, has tried the patience even of former
ex-admirers.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans called the election invalid, and Fujimori's
response to complaints about it ``a serious threat to the
inter-American system and its commitment to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, they drew back: a ``flawed'' election was now
the word. One can guess why. Though the OAS mission did much to
expose the flaws, Latin American countries do not like to meddle,
or see the United States do so, in each other's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The election was rigged, but it was within Peruvian law; ``the
business of Peruvians,'' said Mexico's foreign minister. The
Venezuelans, whose President Hugo Chavez has no wild esteem for the
formalities of democracy, are swayed by Fujimori's argument that
half of those who voted his way.
</P>
<P>
   When OAS ministers met this week, the United States won no
agreement even to condemn the election, let alone apply sanctions.
It will have to twist arms hard to do better at a fuller OAS
meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has vowed to go on campaigning until Fujimori steps down.
But without an organized political party structure, he may be
hard-pressed to keep the momentum of opposition going, even if
resentment continues.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will be reluctant to cut aid off altogether:
Peru is a major ally in its war on drugs. And even Toledo thinks
that the sort of halfhearted sanctions that might drag on, slowing
Peru's economy without bringing down its president, would hurt
those Peruvians who are worst off already.
</P>
<P>
   One option that Toledo claims has been discussed within
government circles is that the vice-president, Francisco Tudela,
might take over from Fujimori after a few months.
</P>
<P>
   That might offer a convenient way out for foreign governments
anxious to see any sign of official penitence. But the result might
merely be a change of face, as in the old days of everlasting
one-party rule in Mexico. It certainly would not satisfy Toledo:
Fujimori and Tudela alike, he says, are both illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   More important, perhaps, would the notion satisfy Fujimori? He
had to work hard _ not least on the judiciary _ to get the
constitutionally questionable right to run for a third term at all.
His friends had to rig the electoral machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Has he really gone through all that just to step down, without
being pushed? &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Even in the democratic heyday of post-communism, Russia
was a tough place for greens.
</P>
<P>
   Where the right laws existed, they were hard to enforce. A
combination of abundant natural wealth, plenty of space and
careless habits meant that few Russians took environmental
housekeeping seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a mix of business interests, criminal activity and
government paranoia threatens to make matters even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Last month President Vladimir Putin abolished the main agency
for environmental protection, handing over its central functions to
its chief bureaucratic rival, the Ministry for Natural Resources.
Environmentalists say that this amounts to putting an alcoholic in
charge of the vodka store.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is true that, like many of its other laws, Russia's
environmental rules (and the bureaucrats who enforce them) can be
maddeningly pedantic, contradictory and susceptible to corruption,
abolishing the agency that monitors them seems an unhelpful
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists believe that the agency was axed under
pressure from powerful business interests, which argue that green
regulation is blocking development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people now in power think that ecology is for rich
countries,'' says Alexei Yablokov, president of the Center for
Environmental Policy, a pressure-group.
</P>
<P>
   Gangsters who profit hugely from illegal logging and fishing are
another powerful force. Their activity contributes to a largely
invisible environmental catastrophe in the remoter parts of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Natural resources are plundered on a stupendous, unsustainable
scale. The ministry now in charge at once announced that it would
``simplify'' the environmental rules governing industry, suggesting
a further relaxation of controls that have already proved
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   The government has made a few rhetorical nods to the
environmental cause, for example by promising to protect the
embattled sturgeon, the fish that produces caviar. It has also
allowed Russia's best-known environmental campaigner, Alexander
Nikitin, to leave the country after his acquittal on charges of
treason.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little sign that Putin cares about the environment.
Last year, when he was still head of the security service, he
accused ecological groups of providing a ``convenient cover'' for
foreign spies.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's greens have been squawking. They hope their American
friends can help them put the issue on the agenda for Bill
Clinton's visit to Moscow this weekend. And the main green groups
have called an emergency joint congress for June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the government has been increasingly treating
environmental campaigners as a subversive menace. Some have been
arrested, and then released, on drug and terrorism charges.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups have been subject to threatening financial audits,
allegedly ordered by the federal prosecutor's office. A spokeswoman
for that office has said that a number of green groups are indeed
being checked for ``confidential'' reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace's Moscow office briefly faced closure this year on
flimsy-sounding bureaucratic grounds. ``It looks as though they
have organized an attack on the environmental movement as the
avant-garde for civil society,'' says a worried Yablokov.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists fear that later this year they will face
new legal obstacles, especially if they receive grants from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all this, the new government announced ambitious plans
on May 25 to build 40 new fast-breeder nuclear-power stations in
Russia over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   And it is considering another alarming project: the export of
floating nuclear-power plants to Asia. Just the sort of thing for
environmentalists to shout about _ if the government will let
them. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ As the Euro 2000 championship looms and the
continent again becomes football-crazy, an old question is being
asked once more: will Americans ever learn to love football _
European football, that is _ or are the rhythms of the world's most
popular game somehow out of sync with the American spirit?
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is the fourth most popular game in American playgrounds
after basketball, volleyball and softball, and the fastest-growing
recreational activity among schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   America has hosted two hugely successful World Cups and is
rapidly emerging as an international force.
</P>
<P>
   Football's place alongside more traditional American pastimes
would seem assured. But when it comes to a professional league of
their own, Americans remain blissfully indifferent to this variety
of football.
</P>
<P>
   Currently in its fifth season, Major League Soccer (MLS), the
long-awaited successor to the North American Soccer League (NASL),
is still playing mostly to empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Los Angeles Galaxy and the defending champions, DC
United, have cultivated small but deeply loyal followings. And the
calibre of play has clearly improved. Seamus Malin, America's
foremost football analyst, reckons the MLS is now a credible
second-tier league and believes some of its clubs could well hold
their own against many European sides.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, although the MLS drew 17,000 spectators a match during its
inaugural season, the average attendance is now just 14,000. The
league does even worse on television; its games barely register a
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Selling football to Americans requires patience, say MLS
executives. Above all, they want to avoid repeating the experience
of the NASL, which folded in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The NASL, they say, depended too much on one star-studded team,
the New York Cosmos, and its free-spending owner, Warner
Communications. The Cosmos fielded a lineup that included Pele,
Franz Beckenbauer, Carlos Alberto and a host of other legends who,
though no longer in their prime, were still highly entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   But when Warner lost interest in football it pulled the plug on
the Cosmos _ and on the entire league. Given the money top
internationals now command, the MLS does not have the option of
importing superstars.
</P>
<P>
   The league has a few big-name foreigners, but it believes that
Americans generally prefer to watch Americans and that its main
purpose is to serve as a showcase for home-grown talent. Keeping
the talent at home is a headache for these very reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of world-class competition diminishes the league's
appeal and the pay is uncompetitive. To help contain costs (or at
least limit the bleeding: the MLS reportedly lost over $100 million
in its first four seasons), the league caps team payrolls at $1.73
million and salaries at $270,000, though exceptions are
occasionally made for high-profile imports.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some of America's finest, among them Joe-Max Moore,
Claudio Reyna and Tony Sanneh, have taken their studs abroad.
Up-and-coming stars are also defecting. Landon Donovan, named
player of the tournament at last year's under-17 world championship
in New Zealand, has joined Bayer Leverkusen, a German club.
</P>
<P>
   Another promising junior, DaMarcus Beasley, Donovan's runner-up
in New Zealand, is, for the moment, sticking with the Chicago Fire.
But several European clubs, including Arsenal, Barcelona, and PSV
Eindhoven, are said to be interested in the 17-year-old midfielder,
and it may be just a matter of time before he too departs for
greener pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, the inferior quality of the MLS is keeping fans away.
More likely, though, Americans just find football too slow and
maddening.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas basketball guarantees 48 minutes of slam dunks, football
threatens 90 minutes of dashed hopes. Americans, not always known
for their patience, seem to prefer more gratification _ that is,
more scoring _ from their pastimes. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Databases are becoming increasingly important
research tools in scientific fields from astronomy to genetics. But
they can also have other, more surprising uses _ in etymology, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Shapiro of Yale Law School, who is the editor of the
forthcoming ``Yale Dictionary of Quotations,'' has been using a
database of academic journals called JSTOR to track down the
origins of new words and expressions.
</P>
<P>
   His latest finding, announced in a note in the current issue of
the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, is of the earliest
known published use of that now-ubiquitous word, ``software.''
</P>
<P>
   This word was, he found, used in 1958 by John Tukey, a
mathematician at Princeton University, in an article published in
the American Mathematical Monthly. Tukey was a major figure in
20th-century statistics and, says Shapiro, he also had a fondness
for coining new words and phrases.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest contribution to the vocabulary of computing was
previously thought to be his invention, in 1946, of the word
``bit,'' short for binary digit.
</P>
<P>
   But it now seems that he is also responsible for introducing the
term ``software,'' in the following sentence: Today the
``software'' comprising the carefully planned interpretive
routines, compilers, and other aspects of automative programming
are at least as important to the modern electronic calculator as
its ``hardware'' of tubes, transistors, wires, tapes and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ``software'' and ``hardware'' appear in inverted
commas suggests that Tukey expected these words to be unfamiliar to
his readers. Previously, the first recorded appearance of the word
``software'' in print was in 1960. So this sentence may well be the
original source of the term.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Shapiro has used JSTOR to push
back the first known use of a particular word. The database
consists of over 100 scholarly journals in multiple fields, going
back many years, and in some cases over a century.
</P>
<P>
   Journal pages are scanned in at high resolution, and the text is
extracted using optical character-recognition software. It is then
possible to retrieve journal pages that match particular search
terms. (JSTOR is operated by a not-for-profit organization and is
available online by subscription.)
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro has previously uncovered uses of words and phrases
including ``double standard,'' ``post-modern'' and ``racist'' that
predate the earliest-known uses listed in the ``Oxford English
Dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   But the OED could yet have the last word on ``software.''
Shapiro says that a member of the OED staff has uncovered an
example of the word dating back to 1850, though in a rather
different context.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, ``soft-ware'' and ``hard-ware'' were terms used by
trash-can scavengers to distinguish compost from non-biodegradable
matter. So a Victorian would have been baffled by the modern use of
the term.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ The only way that George W. Bush's presidential
campaign could go any better these days would be for Al Gore to
announce that, as well as smoking a little dope as a student, he
also joined the Communist Party. Whatever the outcome of the race,
one of the lasting ironies of the 2000 campaign may prove to be
that the ``lightweight'' Bush grabbed the intellectual edge from
the ``heavyweight'' Gore. &QL;

   KFAR KILA, LEBANON _ As a procession of helicopters swept in to
land, loudspeakers blasted Wagner's ``Ride of the Valkyries'' over
the hillsides southern Lebanon. The U.N. peacekeepers' noisy
display was a deliberate reference to the Vietnam War, as depicted
in the film ``Apocalypse Now.'' Pundits had predicted an apocalypse
in Lebanon if Israel made good its promise to withdraw from the
country's southern fringes even without a peace deal with Syria.
But the Israeli-Lebanese border has remained remarkably quiet since
Israel's army retreated to its side on May 24, ending a 22-year
occupation. &QL;

   RICHMOND, VA. _ Once, America's trucking industry was a cozy,
regulated semi-cartel, with a few big companies dominating most
regions. CB radio and the call of the open road made every boy
dream of one day driving his own 18-wheel rig. But when
deregulation hit in the 1980s, the business quickly lost its charm.
Yet a radical transformation of the trucking industry is now under
way, thanks to e-business. CB radio has given way to e-mail, GPS
tracking and wired hubs. Who knows? As e-commerce restores
trucking's glory days, a new generation of kids might even dream of
being truckers again. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ When U.S. President Bill Clinton meets with Russian
President Vladimir Putin beginning June 4, he will propose to amend
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to allow limited
land-based defenses against a limited missile attack, not from
unthreatening Russia, but from hostile regimes, such as North
Korea's. Clinton and Putin should look to their defenses in a
spirit of cooperation, rather than confrontation. It is too big a
decision to be rushed. &QL;

But since May 19, when Speight and other rebels took the Fijian

Speight expelled from Fiji. In the longer term, a solution is
needed for the underlying dispute between Fijians and Indians,
which is over land. Whatever happens, Speight must not be

would be to sit back and reflect on the campaign of the last
Democrat to lose. Michael Dukakis's 1988 defeat at the hands of
George Bush senior provides a perfect playbook of how to destroy
George junior. &QL;

CHRIS CARTER ON THE SHAPE OF `X-FILES' TO COME 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color photo of Chris Carter, executive producer of
``The X-Files.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    The truth is still out there.
 &HT;    After weeks of intense intrigue and even fading hopes, Fox
finally announced that ``The X-Files'' will return for an eighth
season in the fall. And so, too, will series creator Chris Carter
and stars Gillian Anderson (Agent Scully) and David Duchovny (Agent
Mulder). However, Duchovny signed on for only 11 episodes, or half
a season.
 &HT;    ``I know `The X-Files' is a show that still has plenty of
mileage left on it,'' Carter says by telephone from his production
office in Los Angeles. ``There are lots of stories to tell.
 &HT;    ``What you don't want to do is go forward with people who are
uninterested in doing the work,'' he says. ``I wanted to make sure
that, if we went forward, everybody was excited about continuing to
do good work, that it wasn't just a payday and a trip to the
bank.''
 &HT;    Carter and company were prepared, albeit reluctantly, to carry
on without Duchovny. The actor's compromise deal _ which also
settles his acrimonious lawsuit with Fox over syndication revenues
_ creates both challenges and opportunities.
 &HT;    ``I think it will certainly throw an emphasis on Scully,''
Carter says. ``I think we'll get to explore the paranormal in a way
we haven't before. I think you got a hint of that in Gillian's
episode, `All Things' (which she wrote and directed).
 &HT;    ``I think we're going to look at mythological and perhaps
fantasy and magic realism in ways we hadn't really explored
before,'' the executive producer says. ``There are other areas I
think the show can expand into beautifully.''
 &HT;    Even as he was fighting for the future of ``The X-Files,''
Carter was looking to its past _ literally. He spent a great deal
of time readying all 24 first-season episodes of ``The X-Files''
for release on DVD.
 &HT;    Now arriving in stores, ``The X-Files'' Season One DVD Gift Pack
sells for $149.98 and features seven disks that serve up the series
pilot and all subsequent freshman-year episodes, as well as Carter
interviews, episode teasers, ``Behind the Truth'' segments, deleted
footage and an 11-minute documentary dubbed ``The Truth About
Season One.''
 &HT;    ``We've been such sticklers for quality,'' Carter says, ``and
the thing I'm happy about is that the effort and the attention to
detail are now rewarded, because we've got a format that lets us
really showcase all that hard work. Our philosophy was, `We're
making a little movie each week.'''
 &HT;    Carter describes screening the old episodes again as a ``walk
down Memory Lane.'' As the best stops along the way, he picks
``Beyond the Sea,'' ``Deep Throat,'' ``The Erlenmeyer Flask,''
``Squeeze,'' ``Darkness Falls'' and ``Miracle Man.''
 &HT;    Two other topnotch episodes from the first season are ``Tooms,''
a classic creepfest that introduced Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), and
``E.B.E.,'' a conspiracy episode that marked the arrival of that
intrepid trio of paranoids, the Lone Gunmen (Tom Braidwood, Bruce
Hardwood and Dean Haglund).
 &HT;    Come the fall, Carter and Fox will unleash the boys in their
very own spinoff series entitled _ what else? _ ``The Lone
Gunmen,'' with the pilot directed by ``X-Files'' veteran Rob

 &HT;    ``We had done episodes devoted to them and they were all
successful,'' Carter says. ``They were fun to do. This was a chance
to take our enthusiasm and turn it into another storytelling
vehicle.
 &HT;    ``I think it's going to be very different from `The X-Files,'''
he says. ``It will be kooky and fun. It's a chance to develop three
completely unlikely heroes who are kind of postmodern nerds _
something I think people are very familiar with now, in this age of
technology.''
 &HT;    Carter intends to be ``super-involved'' in the day-to-day
production of ``The Lone Gunmen,'' which will film in Vancouver,
British Columbia. He'll also be overseeing ``The X-Files'' in Los
Angeles and prepping the script for ``The World of Ted Serios,'' a
film he'll direct.
 &HT;    Sometimes, admits Carter _ who also pulled double and triple
duty in recent years by guiding ``The X-Files'' movie and the
quickly axed series ``Harsh Realm'' _ he wishes there were two of
him.
 &HT;    ``I tease people that I'm like a chicken,'' he says, laughing.
``There's no part of me they don't use.''

 MAGNETIC ATTRACTION: IAN McKELLEN PREVIEWS `X-MEN'

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Sir Ian
McKellen with Patrick Stewart in a scene from ``X-Men.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    For a guy who didn't have a lot to do with science fiction or
fantasy for his first 60 years, Sir Ian McKellen is really making
up for lost time.
 &HT;    The 61-year-old Shakespearian actor is playing not one but two
iconic figures in four upcoming films, risking the wrath of
aficionados of two much-loved alternate universes by starring as
Magneto in Bryan Singer's ``X-Men'' and then as Gandalf in all
three parts of Peter Jackson's ``Lord of the Rings'' trilogy.
 &HT;    First up: ``X-Men,'' opening July 14.
 &HT;    Based on the phenomenally popular, 37-year-old Marvel Comics
series, ``X-Men'' follows the travails of a band of mutants who
fight the good fight on behalf of a mankind which fears and
despises them.
 &HT;    The story also pits mutant against mutant: The students of
Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) _ Cyclops (James Marsden), Jean
Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman)
and Rogue (Anna Paquin) _ face off against Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a.
Magneto, and his disciples Toad (Ray Park), Sabretooth (Tyler Mane)
and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos).
 &HT;    ``Magneto is a serious-minded, concerned citizen who believes,
as many people do in civil rights, that you only get to achieve
your ends through violence,'' McKellen says by telephone from his
Los Angeles hotel.
 &HT;    ``So that, I think, is the moral and political crux of the
comics and the movie,'' he says. ``Who do you agree with? Do you
agree with Magneto's view or with his old friend Xavier's view,
that integration and the soft, lobbying approach is the best way to
achieve your ends?''
 &HT;    Dramatic as that may sound, McKellen insists that ``X-Men''
never dips into the melodramatic. And, he promises, his Magneto
hews more to his Richard III than to Jack Nicholson's Joker.
 &HT;    ``If it were a melodrama, well, then one could play a
mustache-twirling villain,'' says McKellen, who portrayed an
elderly ex-Nazi in Singer's 1998 psychological thriller, ``Apt
Pupil.'' ``But Magneto is not of that sort.
 &HT;    ```Batman' is more simplistic in its storytelling than `X-Men,'
which is what I think has made `X-Men' so popular for 37 years,''
the actor says. ``Whoever writes to me about this film is always
very protective of the attitude that Magneto not just be a crude
villain.
 &HT;    ``I haven't intended to make him one.''
 &HT;    McKellen will take a turn to the good when he tackles ``Lord of
the Rings.'' Gandalf is the father figure in J.R.R. Tolkien's
``Ring'' novels, protector of the hobbits and mentor to Frodo
(Elijah Wood).
 &HT;    ``Gandalf is the wise wizard, the spirit from afar who is
concerned about preserving Middle Earth,'' McKellen says. ``From
the first time you meet him, you think he's a man to be trusted.
You feel that probably the hobbits will, somehow, come safely
through the dreadful adventure they have to endure.''
 &HT;    McKellen is enduring an adventure of his own in making ``Lord of
the Rings.'' Gandalf appears in all three films, first as Gandalf
the White and then as Gandalf the Grey. By the time production
ends, McKellen will have spent a year on location in New Zealand.
 &HT;    ``These films are a real curiosity,'' he says. ``Peter has said
this, but this is the biggest film ever made, in terms of logistics
and technology. Day by day, you get a sense of that. Sometimes
there are four different camera crews working on different scenes,
with Peter moving around from set to set.
 &HT;    ``The films are happening over 16 months,'' he adds, ``and
they're happening in New Zealand, away from any sense that there's
a world outside of Middle Earth.
 &HT;    ``We're all utterly absorbed in it.''
 &HT;    Expectations for both ``X-Men'' and the ``Rings'' trilogy are
sky-high and growing. McKellen understands the ardor, but asks fans
to temper their anticipation with a dollop of objectivity.
 &HT;    ``The most likely concern about `X-Men' is coming from people
who know the source material very well,'' McKellen says. ``They're
universally concerned that their image of the comic will be the one
that prevails on the screen.
 &HT;    ``My answer is always the same: We've been involved in an act of
translation from the page to the screen,'' the actor says. ``It is
Bryan Singer's `X-Men' that you are coming to see and Peter
Jackson's `Lord of the Rings.'
 &HT;    ``Once you appreciate that, you can perhaps be more open to what
you actually see on the screen,'' he says, ``and not dismiss it
because it doesn't totally accord with how you would have made the
film _ if you'd raised the money and committed an awfully big slice
of your life to bringing it off.''

Foreign Affairs: Arabs Fight, Israelis Surf 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Israeli Army's hasty withdrawal from Lebanon has triggered a
debate both within Israel and in the surrounding Arab states _ a
debate that could be headlined simply: ``Is Israel wimping out?''
</P>
<P>
   The right wing in Israel argues that the unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon was an embarrassing sign of weakness _
which will only invite more Arab attacks. The Shiite radicals in
Lebanon describe this Israeli withdrawal as a sign of the Muslims'
superior willingness to fight, and one that will only lead to more
victories over Israel.
</P>
<P>
   How should one think about these arguments? Well, does the term
hogwash mean anything to you?
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak's courageous decision to unilaterally
withdraw Israeli forces from Lebanon has, for the first time in 22
years, restored a clear-cut border between Lebanon and Israel, and
that will only leave Israel with a tighter fist and a more unified
public, ready to protect what is really important. Why? It all
starts with borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak discovered something extremely important in Lebanon,''
remarked the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi, ``that a
border is a source of power. Because when you don't have a border,
you have a constant problem justifying the use of power. Whenever
Israel has found itself in conflicts without borders _ south
Lebanon, the Palestinian intifada in the West Bank _ it has always
lost, because it always found it difficult to win support, either
at home or abroad, for the force that is required to win a war
without borders. Israelis will only sanction such force and
sacrifice for a war of clear-cut self-defense over a defined
border.''
</P>
<P>
   And Barak, by drawing such a clear-cut border with Lebanon, has
enabled Israel to reassert its real strengths there: It can now use
its powerful air force, unrestrained; it can hold the Lebanese and
Syrian governments responsible, without ambiguity; it now has the
backing of the world community for any self-defense along the
Lebanon border.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli right's favorite line about Lebanon is, ``If you
won't fight for this thing, you won't fight for anything.'' But
most Israelis know exactly the difference between what is worth
fighting for and what isn't. Barak's drawing that distinction in
Lebanon was not a loss of ``will,'' it was a loss of willingness to
go on doing something self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   The great mistake Western observers make when writing about
Arab-Israeli affairs is assuming that only Israelis want to raise
their living standards, send their kids to college and get better
jobs, and that those aspirations never apply to Muslims,
particularly Muslims fighting Israel. In the view of Israeli
right-wingers, the Muslims just want to kill Jews and the Jews just
wanna have fun; the Shiites live to die and the Israelis live to
surf the Web. So the Jewish right accuses the Muslims of not
wanting a better life for their families and they accuse Israel of
wanting it too much, being too ready to compromise instead of
fight.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, both peoples aspire to much the same things. Yes,
there are Muslims in south Lebanon dedicated to destroying Israel.
I've met them. But they are in the minority, and they can be
effective only when the majority is ready to tolerate them and pay
the price of their hatred. But the vast majority of south Lebanese
simply wanted the Israelis out of their lives so they could make
their own better. And now that the Israelis are gone, few Lebanese
are prepared to sacrifice their future to a self-defeating fantasy
of marching on Jerusalem. It is not because they have learned to
like Israel, but because they want to live like Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Americans thought Vietnamese were subhuman too, ready to bear
any sacrifice just to kill Americans. And then we quit Vietnam, and
now the visa line at the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi for Vietnamese
trying to get into the U.S. stretches down the block.
</P>
<P>
   You see, power is about a lot of things. It's about the strength
of an economy, the democratic quality of a society, the shared
values of a community and most of all the will of a people to fight
to protect all those things when they are clearly endangered. Mao
was only half right: Power grows out of the barrel of a gun _ but
only if it is held by a soldier who knows what border he is
protecting and why. In that sense, Israel today is more powerful
than ever. (BOX)

PERSONAL HEALTH: MIGHTY CYBERENGINES SPEW HEALTH MYTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mighty Cyberengines Spew Health Myths
</P>
<P>
   When my sons were in the first grade, a rumor circulated through
New York City elementary schools that cockroaches often
contaminated canned tuna. Though the boys liked other fish,
including sardines, they refused to eat canned tuna in any form and
still avoid it more than 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Like alligators living in the sewer, many urban myths assume a
life of their own despite a total lack of supporting evidence. The
alligator myth is more a source of amusement than a problem for
anyone, since very few of us venture into sewers. But when myths
involve health issues, they can result in needless anxiety,
avoidance behavior and inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, these unsubstantiated rumors about health hazards
lurking in our midst spread relatively slowly from person to person
by word of mouth, unless some radio or television program happened
to give them national airing. Now there is a new rapid-fire means
of transmitting misinformation nationwide, even worldwide, via
e-mail and the Internet. And since these communications appear in
writing, rumors about health hazards floating around cyberspace
seem to acquire an undeserved validity that makes them more likely
to be believed than any oral warning.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone is equally gullible. Still, some people
react with fear, even panic, when a cybermyth about health appears
on their computer screens. Several of these ``urban health myths''
are exposed for what little they are worth in the May issue of Mayo
Clinic Women's HealthSource, a newsletter published by the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn. I have added one of my own, on aluminum,
that predates cyberspace but refuses to die.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH: Cooking in aluminum pots causes Alzheimer's disease. The
sick brain cells of people with Alzheimer's disease have been found
to contain high amounts of aluminum. This prompted people to point
a guilty finger at aluminum pots and pans as a source of this
element that they believe damage brain cells, resulting in
senility. Countless people tossed out all their aluminum cookware,
replacing it with stainless steel and enameled cast iron.
</P>
<P>
   But what those who panicked failed to realize is that sick cells
tend to accumulate toxic metals because they are unable to
eliminate them. Despite numerous investigations, there is no
scientifically reliable evidence that aluminum is the cause, rather
than the result, of a diseased brain.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH: Antiperspirants cause breast cancer. A persistent Internet
myth is that since antiperspirants block sweat glands, those in the
underarm are unable to eliminate toxic substances, sending them
instead into nearby lymph nodes, where they cause genetic mutations
that result in cancer.
</P>
<P>
   First, sweat glands do not eliminate toxins and are not
connected to the lymph system. Rather, toxins are processed through
the liver and kidneys. Second, breast cancer does not arise in
lymph nodes. It may spread to underarm nodes, but it starts within
the breast tissue, usually in milk ducts. Third, there is no
evidence linking breast cancer to not sweating. Fourth, no
ingredient in antiperspirants is known to cause cancer. Finally,
among countless studies of risk factors associated with breast
cancer, not one has pointed to antiperspirants as a remotely
possible cause.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH: Costa Rican bananas carry flesh-eating bacteria. Whenever
a frightening, mysterious illness gains widespread attention, myths
tend to abound as to its source. Hence the myth that touching the
skin of bananas grown in Costa Rica can expose a person to the
bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis, a potentially deadly
disease caused by bacteria that attack the flesh in science-fiction
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Necrotizing fasciitis is caused by various bacteria, including
Group A streptococcus that is found on people's skin and in their
throats. It is transmitted from through saliva or mucus or through
sores on the skin to another person who broken skin. The bacteria
cannot infect intact skin. Nor are they carried on bananas.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH: Aspartame causes ... you-name-it. According to the Mayo
Clinic, one woman is the source of the belief that the artificial
sweetener aspartame causes everything from obesity to manic
depression to multiple sclerosis. The woman maintains that the Food
and Drug Administration, in cahoots with commercial interests, has
suppressed evidence of aspartame's risks and that all the studies
indicating its safety are tainted because they have been financed
by the company that produces it.
</P>
<P>
   One study published in 1997 linked aspartame to a rise in brain
tumors. But the increase in these tumors, which began in the 1970s,
predates the introduction of aspartame into the food supply. There
are many factors that might account for the rise in brain tumors,
but none, including the use of cellular phones, has been
established with any degree of scientific certainty.
</P>
<P>
   When aspartame was first introduced, there was a suspected link
to seizures and depression that also has not been substantiated by
further research. And the claimed link to multiple sclerosis has
been disputed by the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In an indirect way, however, aspartame and every other sugar
substitute might be partly to blame for the rise in obesity. While
the sweeteners themselves contribute few or no calories to the
diet, they do help to perpetuate the desire for very sweet foods.
Since 1975, the per capita consumption of sugar and other caloric
sweeteners has sharply increased, by more than 28 pounds a year.
That certainly is no help to America's expanding waistline.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of other urban health tales now circulating
on the Internet that have been refuted by reliable sources with no
ax to grind, including the government agency most directly
concerned with the public's health, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Among the prevailing myths are that kidneys and
other organs are being stolen from live victims without their
knowledge (the National Kidney Foundation says no way!) and that a
deadly spider dubbed Arachnius gluteus lives under the seats of
public toilets awaiting a sumptuous derriere to bite. A report
attributing the deaths of three women to such a bite was supposedly
published in The Journal of the United Medical Association.
However, as noted by the Mayo newsletter, there is no such spider
and there is no such journal.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of this story is don't be so quick to believe
everything you read on the Net or hear on a broadcast. Check the
source and evidence before you panic.

 Foreign Affairs: Arabs Fight, Israelis Surf  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Israeli Army's hasty withdrawal from Lebanon has triggered a
debate both within Israel and in the surrounding Arab states _ a
debate that could be headlined simply: ``Is Israel wimping out?''
</P>
<P>
   The right wing in Israel argues that the unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon was an embarrassing sign of weakness _
which will only invite more Arab attacks. The Shiite radicals in
Lebanon describe this Israeli withdrawal as a sign of the Muslims'
superior willingness to fight, and one that will only lead to more
victories over Israel.
</P>
<P>
   How should one think about these arguments? Well, does the term
hogwash mean anything to you?
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak's courageous decision to unilaterally
withdraw Israeli forces from Lebanon has, for the first time in 22
years, restored a clear-cut border between Lebanon and Israel, and
that will only leave Israel with a tighter fist and a more unified
public, ready to protect what is really important. Why? It all
starts with borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak discovered something extremely important in Lebanon,''
remarked the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi, ``that a
border is a source of power. Because when you don't have a border,
you have a constant problem justifying the use of power. Whenever
Israel has found itself in conflicts without borders _ south
Lebanon, the Palestinian intifada in the West Bank _ it has always
lost, because it always found it difficult to win support, either
at home or abroad, for the force that is required to win a war
without borders. Israelis will only sanction such force and
sacrifice for a war of clear-cut self-defense over a defined
border.''
</P>
<P>
   And Barak, by drawing such a clear-cut border with Lebanon, has
enabled Israel to reassert its real strengths there: It can now use
its powerful air force, unrestrained; it can hold the Lebanese and
Syrian governments responsible, without ambiguity; it now has the
backing of the world community for any self-defense along the
Lebanon border.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli right's favorite line about Lebanon is, ``If you
won't fight for this thing, you won't fight for anything.'' But
most Israelis know exactly the difference between what is worth
fighting for and what isn't. Barak's drawing that distinction in
Lebanon was not a loss of ``will,'' it was a loss of willingness to
go on doing something self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   The great mistake Western observers make when writing about
Arab-Israeli affairs is assuming that only Israelis want to raise
their living standards, send their kids to college and get better
jobs, and that those aspirations never apply to Muslims,
particularly Muslims fighting Israel. In the view of Israeli
right-wingers, the Muslims just want to kill Jews and the Jews just
wanna have fun; the Shiites live to die and the Israelis live to
surf the Web. So the Jewish right accuses the Muslims of not
wanting a better life for their families and they accuse Israel of
wanting it too much, being too ready to compromise instead of
fight.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, both peoples aspire to much the same things. Yes,
there are Muslims in south Lebanon dedicated to destroying Israel.
I've met them. But they are in the minority, and they can be
effective only when the majority is ready to tolerate them and pay
the price of their hatred. But the vast majority of south Lebanese
simply wanted the Israelis out of their lives so they could make
their own better. And now that the Israelis are gone, few Lebanese
are prepared to sacrifice their future to a self-defeating fantasy
of marching on Jerusalem. It is not because they have learned to
like Israel, but because they want to live like Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Americans thought Vietnamese were subhuman too, ready to bear
any sacrifice just to kill Americans. And then we quit Vietnam, and
now the visa line at the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi for Vietnamese
trying to get into the U.S. stretches down the block.
</P>
<P>
   You see, power is about a lot of things. It's about the strength
of an economy, the democratic quality of a society, the shared
values of a community and most of all the will of a people to fight
to protect all those things when they are clearly endangered. Mao
was only half right: Power grows out of the barrel of a gun _ but
only if it is held by a soldier who knows what border he is
protecting and why. In that sense, Israel today is more powerful
than ever. (BOX)

&HT;     A BUSY SEASON FOR NASCAR DRIVERS AND CREWS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LEE SCHEIDE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Bill France Jr.'s version of a forced march.
</P>
<P>
   For 24 of the next 27 weeks, the NASCAR Winston Cup series will
conduct a race somewhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That's three weeks off in the next six months. Six months worth
of bent sheet metal and long, desolate drives back on Sunday night,
trying to get to the shop in time to turn the cars around for the
next race.
</P>
<P>
   A victory does wonders for the soul, but it doesn't provide
sleep for the weary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to the point where we are going to have to hire
more people to run the shop while we have a crew on the road,''
team owner Richard Childress said. ``That's just going to make the
sport more expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the marathon started May 20 in Charlotte,
N.C., when everyone tried to qualify for The Winston, a special
All-Star event.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, it was the Coca-Cola 600, which marked the start of a
march that won't end until July 9 in Loudon, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   After a week off, the crews load up for Pocono and then enjoy
another weekend off.
</P>
<P>
   When the teams arrive in Indianapolis for the Brickyard 400 on
Aug. 5, it will be the first of 12 consecutive weekends on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's can be a brutal schedule,'' Terry Labonte said in April
at the Texas Motor Speedway for the DirecTV 500, the eighth race in
a 10-week opening run for NASCAR 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that difficult on us (the drivers), because we get to
fly home and fly to the track. The crew guys, though, they are the
ones that are dead tired by the end of the season. I (have) more
and more respect for them each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the issue: When John Force beat Tony Pedregon in the
Funny Car final Sunday at the Castrol Nationals in Ennis, it tied
Force with Bob Glidden with 85 career victories.
</P>
<P>
   As Pedregon saw his chances of defeating his boss go up in smoke
at the starting line, Jerry Toliver watched his points lead
disappear just as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Force, a nine-time world champion who has won the past eight
titles consecutively, has 677 points to Toliver's 644. Ron Capps,
who Force has defeated in each of the past three events, is third
with 600 points and Pedregon is fourth with 557.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock at the top of the career-victory list could last
one week as Force looks to extend his winning streak to four when
the series stops at Route 66 Raceway in Joliet, Ill., this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Lyn St. James has been one of the top women drivers for years
and, for much of the past decade, she has competed at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   But during the most recent ``Greatest Spectacle in Racing,'' St.
James was less than thrilled when all the questions directed her
way concerned 19-year-old Brickyard rookie Sarah Fisher and not St.
James' efforts to make the field.
</P>
<P>
   St. James' public-relations representative asked reporters to
make sure they asked her several questions about her effort before
bringing up Fisher's name in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   St. James made the field for her fourth Indianapolis 500,
qualifying 32nd in the 33-car field. But at 53, St. James' time in
the cockpit and spotlight at the Brickyard has passed, much like
the field just 10 laps into the race.
</P>
<P>
   She is no longer considered a Northern Lights Indy Racing
regular, and there is no bio for her in the media guide.
</P>
<P>
   On Lap 71, St. James reportedly had an ill-handling car, but
that didn't stop her from coming down on Fisher when the latter
made a pass going into Turn 1. The move put St. James into the Turn
1 wall and Fisher into the wall in the short chute, and left both
of them out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in the race Fisher had lapped her elder.
``It's not that difficult on us (the drivers), because we get to
fly home and fly to the track. The crew guys, though, they are the
ones that are dead tired by the end of the season. I (have) more
and more respect for them each year.''

 &HT;    The healing continues at Lourdes
 &HT;    By Katherine Ullmer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ They prayed together, ate together, laughed and
cried together.
</P>
<P>
   Candles in hand, the dames and knights, malades (French for
``sick ones'') and caretakers filed in nightly procession through
the streets of Lourdes, France.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission: a spiritual healing in the place where in 1858 a
poor young French girl named Bernadette Soubirous began seeing
apparitions of the Virgin Mary. Mary told Bernadette to pray, do
penance and tell the priests to build a chapel, bathe in the cold
springs at the site and to have people come in processions.
</P>
<P>
   The sick, disabled and poor are honored guests at Lourdes, a
sacred place of pilgrimage in southwestern France, famed for
miraculous cures and spiritual healing. A village of 16,000
inhabitants, it has more than 5 million visitors a year and four
churches, including an underground one capable of holding 30,000
worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   Each May, members of the Order of Malta, also known as the
Knights of Malta, a 900-year-old lay religious order of the Roman
Catholic Church, make a pilgrimage to Lourdes. Their mission: to
take care of the sick and poor. Their insignia, the Maltese cross,
is worn on robes and capes.
</P>
<P>
   At Lourdes, the knights (male members), dames (female members)
and auxiliaries (younger members, often children of knights and
dames) of the order act as hosts or caretakers for the malades.
</P>
<P>
   Dionne Chanatry, 46, a member of Incarnation Church, who has
multiple sclerosis, was a malade or honored guest, from May 3-10.
</P>
<P>
   Her illness, which gradually weakened her left arm and leg,
struck at age 34, when she was a fitness instructor in California.
Now it has made even standing and moving with a four-wheeled walker
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   As a malade in Lourdes, her every need was catered to. She was
given preferential treatment, pulled to group events in a voiture
(blue metal cart), and surrounded by helpers _ a dame and a knight,
priests who prayed for her, and auxiliaries who saw to her needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty spiritually awesome experience,'' she said.
She said she went for the spiritual healing, though ``in the back
of your mind you hope that you're going to be the one person going
to be healed.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances are slim. Though millions have visited Lourdes, it
has only had 66 documented physical healings, said Dionne's
husband, Michael Chanatry, who accompanied her.
</P>
<P>
   The only physical healing in their group, Dionne Chanatry said,
was when a man with fingers paralyzed from a stroke found he could
move them. He walked with a cane and was not cured in that regard,
she said, ``though I observed an incredible spiritual healing in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dionne Chanatry was chosen in January by the American
Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, based in New
York, as one of 45 malades, 13 of them children, to make the
pilgrimage this year.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association, with about 1,600 members, is the
largest of three Order of Malta associations in the United States,
the others being the Federal Association, based in Washington,
D.C., and the Western Association, in San Francisco, Calif. The
three U.S. groups total about 2,500 members, with around 10,000
members worldwide, according to Bill Burleigh, of Rabbit Hash, Ky.,
co-chairman with his wife, Anne, of the American Association's
pilgrimage this year.
</P>
<P>
   The group of pilgrims from the American Association, including
spouses, members and other volunteers, totaled around 300, the
biggest group they've ever had go, Burleigh said. It included many
cancer patients, but there were also people with paralysis, autism,
cerebral palsy and other disorders, including mental illness, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Order of Malta groups from around the world were also there
hosting malades, many on stretchers, and there were other pilgrims
and tourists, so the town had 30,000 to 40,000 pilgrims at times,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The malades travel free as guests of the order. Dionne
Chanatry's expenses were all paid for. Her husband paid his own
way.
</P>
<P>
   Chanatry's name was submitted by Albuquerque, N.M., artist Dan
Paulos, who does artwork for the American Association's Order of
Malta, and knew Chanatry's mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how people usually are selected to go,'' she said.
``They usually know somebody who knows somebody who recommends them
to go. Malades are not exclusively Catholic. They are invited from
all faiths.''
</P>
<P>
   A medical committee sorts through the applications to make sure
certain medical criteria are met to ensure the well-being of
everyone on the trip, Burleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Knights and dames must be asked to join by current members. The
order includes lawyers, CEOs, doctors, and others in high
positions, though as members of the order, ``they are all very
humble,'' Dionne Chanatry said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the American Association pay about $2,500 dollars to
join, Burleigh said, and are expected to donate yearly to support
the order's charitable projects. The American Association supports
hospitals and schools in Haiti and has a number of volunteer
efforts in Latin America, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Lourdes, the group participated in a daily schedule of
events, from masses to processions, confessions, baths for
purification, vigils, visits to the grotto where the apparitions
took place, and a trip to the village of Pau in the French
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French, they're not afraid to reach out and help somebody,
whether it be in a wheelchair or whatever physical hang-up they
have,'' Dionne Chanatry said. ``They're eager to be there to
help.'' People in the United States often act afraid of someone
with a disability and don't offer help for fear of insulting them,
she said. Also, ``they're afraid they might catch what you have.
Over there, everyone was accepting of everyone else,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly a life-changing experience,'' she said.
``People gain a lot of strength there _ maybe not physical healing
per se, but strength to deal with whatever it is they have to deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chanatry said he gained more confidence and awareness as
a caregiver. One day, the caregivers shared their stories and
experiences. ``That was one of the most moving sessions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``this MS has been one of the biggest blessings,''
Dionne Chanatry said. ``It brought me back around to my faith and
into a deeper relationship with God. It has made me ask why am I
here and what do I need to do with my situation.''

 &HT;    ``Sex and the City'': An educational experience
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Sex and the City'': Season premiere, 9-9:30
p.m. Sunday, HBO
</P>
<P>
   Why do I love ``Sex and the City'' so much?
</P>
<P>
   Is it because I get to see Kim Cattrall naked each week?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. But that certainly doesn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I'm fond of the chi-chi fashion _ you know, the elegant
Christian Dior dresses, vintage jeweled shows and Fendi embroidered
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Not particularly.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I just enjoy watching four pouty-mouthed women gabbing
about men and sex. And sex and men.
</P>
<P>
   That's it!
</P>
<P>
   I've always found ``Sex and the City,'' which kicks off its
18-episode third season tonight, funny and scathingly clever. And
the writing is always blade sharp. For instance, when Carrie (Sarah
Jessica Parker) finds herself dancing to disco tunes at a Staten
Island club in tonight's episode, she cracks that New York's
forgotten borough ``is like a quaint European country. The American
music was 20 years behind and you could smoke wherever you
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most men, I find women fascinating. Just when you think you
have them figured out, they toss another curveball your way. Oh,
I'm sure women say the same thing about us.
</P>
<P>
   For me, ``Sex and the City `` has been both educational and
entertaining. This delightfully raunchy series lets me be that
proverbial fly on the wall when women are saying what they really
think about men and how they really feel about relationships. While
I don't think most women are as sex-obsessed as Carrie; Samantha
(Cattrall); Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and, my personal favorite,
Charlotte (Kristin Davis), I still believe these are realistic
characters who are often trapped in all too familiar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty certain women could relate to Charlotte's partner
falling asleep during sex. Or Carrie's torturous on-and-off
relationship with Big (Chris Noth), which produced some of the
show's most achingly tender moments. Or Samantha sleeping with a
man who wasn't exactly, uh, that well endowed. Or Miranda's
reluctance to date an average-looking, blue-collar nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   So few TV shows are told from a strong female point of view.
When one as hilarious and thought-provoking as ``Sex and the City''
came along, I immediately embraced it. You don't see many TV series
in which guys are treated like disposable sex objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City's'' third season gets off to a fine start.
Carrie is mourning her breakup with Big. Charlotte is determined to
find Mr. Right. Samantha continues sleeping with Mr. Right Now and
Miranda learns that being rescued by a man doesn't mean she's weak.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, folks. ``Sex and the City `` is back. That means school's
in session. Wonder what I'll learn this year?

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Just in time for Fathers' Day, the gun crowd is
shanghaiing no less than the Founding Fathers themselves into its
service, bandying about quotes from Jefferson, Franklin and others
to the effect that an armed citizenry is the surest, and an
essential, hedge against tyrannical government. (Tom Teepen is

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Oh, how the world is turning. It is almost
acceptable on the European side of the Atlantic that mistresses are
a tolerable part of daily life. Yes, there is some grouching but
reality is reality to Europeans. Now, on the U.S. side, mistresses
and other things naughty, while still raising some apoplectic
reaction, are becoming more common. (We give Europe Starbucks
Coffee and McDonald's and they give us mistress
tolerance.)(Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED THURSDAY.

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ For richer or poorer, the Internet

columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington bureau.) MOVED

   MISSISSIPPI-RIVERROAD _ On the famous River Road between Baton
Rouge and the Big Easy, the once-grand houses of the old sugar cane

queens. All sit in the shadow of the petrochemical empire. ``The
striking juxtaposition is what the modern age has supplied, a
reflection of ourselves and what we find important,'' photographer
Richard Sexton says. Sexton, an Atlanta native, grew up in
Georgia's Miller County. His latest book, ``Vestiges of Grandeur,''
is artistic documentation of one of the strangest, haunting

   CUBA-ART _ HAVANA _ It's Sunday afternoon in a sweaty Havana

crowd, looking cool despite the sweltering heat, bearded, dark-eyed
Salvador Gonzalez greets friends, visitors and devotees to his
secluded, chic corner of Havana. Gonzalez has earned a world-wide
reputation as one of Cuba's most important mural painters. His
subject is Santeria, the mystical Afro-Cuban religion filled with

correspond with Catholic saints. We profile Gonzalez and his work.

 &HT;    Face-frame joinery method a matter of preference
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An individual self-described as ``VERY new to woodworking''
wants to know the best way to put together a face frame for a
built-in entertainment center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to decide on mortising the joints (or) using dowels
instead, or just finish nail the pieces so they look like they're
all attached together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If mortising is recommended, what would be the best and most
versatile piece of equipment to use _ a mortising machine, a drill
press with a mortising attachment or a router with a mortising
bit?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the answer is: It all depends. Mainly, it depends on
whether you want the finest possible construction, and I believe we
amateurs should always go for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Nails are out. Forget nails.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of commercial cabinetmakers use pocket screws, which are
quick and probably will do well enough if the frame is subject to
no stress or wracking at all. Still, though, they are a method of
expedience, not of quality.
</P>
<P>
   Dowel joinery is just about a thing of the past. It really isn't
a very good way to make joints, despite the fact that some very
fine craftsmen have relied upon it over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the useful glue surface is quite small, and
the dowels themselves are not very strong unless you get into
half-inch dowels or larger.
</P>
<P>
   Dowel joinery has been largely supplanted by biscuit joinery.
The hand-held biscuit joiners make aligning the work far easier,
and their shape gives a great deal more glue surface than dowels.
They share with dowels the problem of expansion when moistened by
the glue. This can sometimes result in telegraphing or
print-through of the dowels or biscuits to the surface of the work.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are better ways than biscuit joinery, if you're
working with solid wood. If plywood, then biscuits are as good a
way to go as any.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to make up a face frame, or any kind of frame, is
any of the several variations on the mortise and tenon. The method
to use depends on the strength required and whether visible end
grain bothers you.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest of all these is, of course, the ordinary mortise
and tenon, with a tenon cut on the end of one piece fitting snugly
into a pocket, or mortise, in the other.The result is two broad
areas of side grain for the glue. The mortise helps keep it in
place. Cutting a shoulder on the tenon makes it even better.
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue that the ``loose'' mortise and tenon, which
involves mortises in both pieces joined by a tenon cut from another
piece of wood, is even stronger. It would, however, involve
mortising into end grain, which can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you insist on mitered corners, it's the method I
would use.
</P>
<P>
   Then we have the half-lap and the bridle joint, both of which
are easily cut on the table saw. Neither has the mechanical
strength of the standard mortise and tenon, and end grain will be
visible on the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as to the best tool for cutting the mortise, the mortise
milling machine wins hands down. However, you don't find many of
these within the reach of the ordinary amateur unless they are
included as part of another tool. The mortising attachment for a
drill press seems to be enjoying a revival, but I'm leery of them.
</P>
<P>
   Absent a mortise miller, I'd use a router with a good homemade
jig to keep everything in alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Tenons generally are best cut on the table saw using a tenoning
jig, although they can also be cut on the band saw. Heck, you can
waste the wood off with a router if you build a jig for it.

hear from you but are unable to acknowledge every message.

&HT;     LAKE PLACID TO STAGE IMPRESSIVE FILM FORUM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Tributes to the past, nods to the future and
a whole mess of movies are on the slate at the Lake Placid Film
Forum next week, when films converge with filmmakers over a long
weekend in the Adirondack Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the Adirondack Film Society, the forum will run
June 8 through June 11, at sundry locations throughout the bustling
Olympic town. Fittingly, its first event is ski jumping (with
water-soaked plastic substituting for snow).
</P>
<P>
   In its inaugural year and already stuffed with high-wattage
events and filmmakers, the Lake Placid Film Forum will include:
more than 40 films (old and new, domestic and foreign, features,
shorts and documentaries); a baker's dozen of panels and workshops;
and a gala, Saturday-night tribute to Czech-born director Milos
Forman.
</P>
<P>
   All told, more than 100 filmmakers and pundits _ directors,
screenwriters, actors, critics, studio executives and experts in
digital technologies _ are scheduled to take part in the festival
as panelists and presenters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fest's many prominent participants are actors Jill
Hennessy, Chris Noth (both known from ``Law and Order'') and Cliff
Robertson; authors Russell Banks (``The Sweet Hereafter''), Michael
Ondaatje (``The English Patient'') and Donald Westlake (``The Hot
Rock''); and directors Paul Schrader (who made ``Affliction,''
based on a Banks novel), Jay Craven (``Where Rivers Flow North''),
Terry George (``Some Mother's Son''), Robert Downey Sr. (``Putney
Swope'') and Richard Rush (``Color of Night''). Sony Classics
co-president Michael Barker, Shooting Gallery president Eamon Bowls
and Hallmark Entertainment vice president Lynn Holst are also
scheduled to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep (describing) this event as a microbrewery _ it's a
really yeasty event,'' said Naj Wikoff, executive director and
co-founder of the Film Forum. ``It's regional, it has quality, and
it has character. And the yeasty bit is, we have a lot of people
with a lot of strong personalities coming to talk about film. It
should be very entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have people who are passionate about film, and people
who are passionate about digital technologies, and people who are
passionate about screenwriting, and we'll have all these passionate
people here to show their wares. ... It's a great opportunity to
get behind the scenes and see how a movie is made, and see what the
issues are.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend is a mad weave of films, forums and special events.
Workshops on the art of collaboration and how-to sessions on ``the
perfect pitch'' overlap with screenings that run virtually nonstop,
morning to midnight, throughout the festival's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   One forum, ``From Novel to Screen,'' will address the serpentine
path of a creative project and will feature as panelists Banks,
Schrader, Ondaatje, Forman and critic/screenwriter Stephen Schiff.
Another, ``Role Models: Finding Inspiration in the Work of the
World's Great Filmmakers,'' boasts Downey (discussing Preston
Sturges), Westlake (on Alfred Hitchcock) and screenwriter Greer
Goodman (giving John Cassavetes his due).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievably auspicious for a first event,'' said Wikoff
of the Film Forum's packed schedule and burgeoning profile. ``We've
really caught people's eye in the industry. They cannot believe
it's the first (year) because of the depth. So I think it bodes
well for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Programmed for screening next week are numerous area premieres
and a smattering of oldies but goodies. Among the older films are
one silent classic (``Peter Pan'') and three by Forman:
``Amadeus,'' ``Loves of a Blonde'' (a 1965 Czech work) and last
year's unsettling ode to Andy Kaufman, ``Man on the Moon.'' An
early favorite by black-humorists Joel and Ethan Coen, ``Blood
Simple,'' will reappear, as will Richard Rush's 1980 tour-de-force,
``The Stunt Man'' _ along with Rush's newly unveiled DVD
documentary, ``The Sinister Saga of Making the Stunt Man.''
</P>
<P>
   A staged reading of a screenplay, Tom Mercer's ``Choice of the
Cross,'' has also been wedged into the Film Forum's crowded
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Shorts abound _ several programs' worth, of varying lengths and
from around the world. One program is devoted to shorts by film
students at Columbia and New York universities; another,
``Fledgling Films/Ten by Teens,'' features work by adolescents. In
addition, the forum will screen a 28-minute documentary,
``Conversations in World Cinema: Atom Egoyan,'' about the filmmaker
who directed 1997's profound Russell Banks adaptation, ``The Sweet
Hereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   Included among the new and new-to-upstate releases being
screened at the festival:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Acting Class,'' about a hellish acting coach and his
browbeaten minions; directed by Jill Hennessy and Elizabeth Holder;
starring Hennessy, Holder, Jerry Orbach, Chris Noth, Benjamin
Bratt, Austin Pendleton and Courtney B. Vance.

   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ ATLANTA _ The best way to make up a face frame,
or any kind of frame, is any of the several variations on the
mortise and tenon. The method to use depends on the strength
required and whether visible end grain bothers you. (Warner,

   MISSISSIPPI-RIVERROAD _ On the famous River Road between Baton
Rouge and the Big Easy, the once-grand houses of the old sugar cane
plantations flank the Mississippi. Some are pristine and
refurbished; others are sagging and fading, forgotten beauty
queens. All sit in the shadow of the petrochemical empire. ``The
striking juxtaposition is what the modern age has supplied, a
reflection of ourselves and what we find important,'' photographer
Richard Sexton says. Sexton, an Atlanta native, grew up in
Georgia's Miller County. His latest book, ``Vestiges of Grandeur,''
is artistic documentation of one of the strangest, haunting
corridors in America, the so-called River Road. The geography is
specific, the debate universal. The River Road is many roads ...

   CUBA-ART _ HAVANA _ It's Sunday afternoon in a sweaty Havana
barrio called ``Callejon de Hamel,'' and curious tourists mingle
with dark-skinned Cubans as drummers pound out an Afro-Caribbean
beat and dancers sway to the hypnotic rhythm. Strolling through the
crowd, looking cool despite the sweltering heat, bearded, dark-eyed
Salvador Gonzalez greets friends, visitors and devotees to his
secluded, chic corner of Havana. Gonzalez has earned a world-wide
reputation as one of Cuba's most important mural painters. His
subject is Santeria, the mystical Afro-Cuban religion filled with
superstitions, animal sacrifices and frightening spirits that
correspond with Catholic saints. We profile Gonzalez and his work.

&HT;     HBO'S `SEX' IS NOW HIP STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Would Sarah Jessica Parker be hosting the
upcoming MTV Movie Awards if she weren't in HBO's ``Sex and the
City''?
</P>
<P>
   Even the MTV crowd is now aware of ``Sex and the City,''
(Sunday, 9 p.m., HBO), the superb romantic comedy now entering its
third season. In the first year, with the quality as high as its
been ever since, this show couldn't get arrested. Most critics flat
out didn't get it. That's partly because many of them were men and
the thought of powerful, intelligent, shop-a-holic women who talked
frankly about sex just didn't register with them. There was no show
like it on the networks, so nowhere to pigeonhole it.
</P>
<P>
   By the second season, the show moved firmly out of the cult
arena and women around the country were having ``Sex and the City''
parties, inviting their best friends over for 30 minutes of
well-written, often funny, often sad and almost always dead-on
realism about how four thirtysomething women in New York deal with
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The hip cachet that ``Sex'' brought with it has now blossomed
into full-blown must-see TV. It helps that more people get HBO now
(thanks largely to ``The Sopranos,'' although that show airs at
opposite ends of the year and attracts different viewers). But now
that the pay cable is hooked in, more people are realizing what
massive holes there are in network shows that try to deal with
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   If ABC's angst-filled fortysomething ``Once and Again'' captured
people's attention (then lost it) because it tried to be grown up,
think of how much better that show would be if it were on HBO,
where adults can have their lives reflected back at them without a
laugh track or through a censorship filter.
</P>
<P>
   In the third year of ``Sex and the City,'' viewers should be
just giddy: it has lost none of its luster, nor its lust. None of
the off-season hype or the loss of several key behind-the-scenes
players has hurt this series. It comes out of the gate on Sunday as
saucy and cerebral as ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie (Parker) is still rocked emotionally by her involvement
with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), and it manifests when she starts dating
an almost perfect politician (John Slattery). While he rushes
things, the open-to-almost-anything Carrie moves along hesitatingly
until one little sexual quirk makes her realize she needn't worry
about whether she's ready for another long-term relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prudish Charlotte (Kristin Davis) has an epiphany
while drunk on Staten Island, which leads to The Question _ posed
in each episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been dating since I was 15,'' Charlotte says. `I'm
exhausted. Where is he?''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha (Kim Cattrall), the sexual adventurist in the bunch,
thinks she may have found something in a dumb hunk of a fireman _
not that she's looking for anything long-term. And Miranda (Cynthia
Nixon) battles her indecision over looking for Mr. Right or
settling with bartender Steve (David Eigenberg), who's nice and
seems to love her. In a later episode, she ponders talking to Steve
_ who wants to be monogamous _ about not committing because ``what
if someone better comes along?'' To which Carrie counsels, ``You've
gotta put a better spin on it than that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City'' is not just about sex, although that seems
to be all anyone points to when reducing the show to its basic
merits. The show has always been brilliantly about life. Yes, sex
plays a major part. But how these four women look at love, being
friends and surviving day-to-day has always been the heart of the
show.
</P>
<P>
   That and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   We welcome these four cool women back into our living rooms for
season three. And it doesn't matter now that everybody's on the
``Sex and the City'' bandwagon. It'll just make the water cooler
more crowded on Mondays.

&HT;     THE SLOW BOAT TO NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last weekend, my wife and I were riding the
Larkspur Ferry, a $9.50 round trip (not counting Bloody Marys) that
beats anything offered by the grand old trans-Atlantic ocean
liners.
</P>
<P>
   The Cunard Line used to say that getting there is half the fun.
On the Golden Gate ferries, getting nowhere is all the fun.
</P>
<P>
   So there we were sitting in the sun on the fantail enjoying the
view of Gatsby-esque homes on the back side of Tiburon. Suddenly
the bow of a giant tanker loomed over us. On the side of the bow
was the tanker's name, the Condoleezza Rice.
</P>
<P>
   That's the name of the former provost of Stanford, and foreign
policy adviser to both President George Bush and his son, the
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's her name doing on a tanker?'' asked my wife, who added
``Gross.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice is on the board of directors of the Chevron Corp. Sure
enough, as the tanker passed, we saw it had the Chevron emblem on
its funnel.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of honor is this to give a distinguished member of
your board of directors? They're putting the name of this highly
intelligent, uncommonly beautiful woman on a smelly tub of a
tanker, and not even a supertanker.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron didn't think this one through. If the tanker Condoleezza
Rice runs aground on Angel Island and spills oil all over the San
Francisco Bay, it will forever be known as ``the Condoleezza Rice
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of oily ducks, and her boss George W. Bush is one dead
duck.
</P>
<P>
   That same ferry ride can offer more uplifting moments, such as
the sight of people enjoying some happy mission on the old Liberty
ship Jeremiah O'Brien, and the view of the towers of the Golden
Gate Bridge poking above the fog like giant crowns fit for the
split-personality egos of San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But this sight beat all. As we made the slow passage past San
Quentin, the inmates were in the yard getting some midday sun and
shooting hoops.
</P>
<P>
   They turned and started waving to the ferry. The passengers all
waved back. It was a great human moment, one best savored without
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   We tried analyzing it, but it led us to stupid talk about crime
and punishment and whether the cons were conning the yokels on the
boat. Sometimes a wave means exactly what it means.
</P>
<P>
   Other nice moments, walking down the spiffed-up waterfront of
San Francisco to the new ballpark:
</P>
<P>
   Rollerbladers were rolling along Herb Caen Way, talking about
Chris Isaak. You don't get that in Cleveland, not even near the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The Boondocks, the Java House and Red's Java House are
surrounded by acres of new plaza, and yet they're still there, fine
waterfront dives that somehow survived the great uplift.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting Japanese training ship Kojima, complete with a
forward 3-inch gun, was docked in the city that once sent hundreds
of ships across the Pacific to fight the Japanese. San Franciscans
of all ethnic backgrounds, including Japanese-American, were
walking down the pier to view the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Again, these are moments to appreciate, no analysis necessary.

CLINTON URGES INTEGRATION OF RUSSIA INTO EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the eve of his arrival in Moscow, President Clinton on Friday
urged European countries to do more to make Russia ``fully part of
Europe'' by encouraging its stability and democracy and promoting
its integration into international institutions like the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doors can be sealed shut to Russia, not NATO's, not the
EU's,'' Clinton said in a speech on the fifth day of his weeklong
trip to Europe. ``The alternative would be a future of harmful
competition between Russia and the West and the end of our vision
of an undivided continent.''
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke in Aachen, Germany, where he was awarded the
International Charlemagne Prize for contributing to peace and
European unity. Clinton is the first U.S. president and the third
American to receive the 50-year-old award, after former secretaries
of state George Marshall and Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the prestigious gold medal on a yellow ribbon placed
around his neck, the president addressed an admiring audience in a
sunny courtyard outside the cathedral where the body of
Charlemagne, the eighth-century ruler of the Holy Roman Empire, is
interred.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointed out that Europe has become ``more united, more
successful and more peaceful than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president said, ``The job of building a united Europe is
certainly not finished, and it is important not to take all of this
self-congratulation too far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must work to build a partnership with Russia that
encourages stability, democracy and cooperative engagements with
the West and full integration with global institutions,'' Clinton
told his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not yet know if Russia's hard-won democratic freedoms
will endure,'' he said. ``We don't know yet whether it will define
its greatness in yesterday's terms or tomorrow's.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton criticized Russia's ongoing war in Chechnya as a
self-defeating tragedy that has caused heavy loss of civilian
lives, he also stressed that Russians were hewing to the democratic
path despite severe economic hardship and political and criminal
violence.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Though Russia's transformation is incomplete, there clearly is
reason for hope in Russia's remarkable journey over these last few
years,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his week-long trip to Europe, the last scheduled
for his presidency, in Portugal, where his schedule included a
meeting with EU officials. He flew Thursday to Berlin, where he
discussed Russia and the issue of anti-missile defense as well as
some bilateral child custody cases with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the president will travel to Moscow, where he is
expected to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and
visit the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's interest in building a new anti-missile shield to
protect the United States from attacks by rogue states could
dominate the meeting with Putin, who adamantly opposes changing the
missile defense treaty that Moscow and Washington signed in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the president will fly home via Ukraine, where he is
scheduled to meet its president, Leonid Kuchma.

<P>
   Sometimes you can't hear the boy band for the squealing.
</P>
<P>
   While you know about the record-breaking album sales, the
millions in concert grosses, the court cases and dating gossip, it
might come as a surprise that there could be genuine talent in the
teen-pop phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people get a bad rap but these kids can really
sing,'' says songwriter Diane Warren, who has penned hits for
Christina Aguilera, 'N Sync and Britney Spears. ``I was in the
studio with 'N Sync and they sing their (heads) off. I was there
for every second of the process and there's no endless fine-tuning
and retakes. And Christina sings as good as anybody. These are
really professional artists who work really hard and they've been
working that hard since they were even smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about teens having hits and chalking up mad
airplay. You can trace the craze back to the early '50s when
13-year-old Frankie Lymon stood on street corners, harmonizing
``Why Do Fools Fall in Love?'' with friends. A little later came
the Monkees, Debbie Gibson and New Kids on the Block. Today's
mega-selling teens who rule the charts and your preteen's bedroom
walls include Spears, Aguilera, 'N Sync, Westlife, Jessica Simpson,
the Backstreet Boys, ATeens, Five, LFO, 98 Degrees and Youngstown.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not going away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone's taking the whole thing a little wrong,'' 'N
Sync's Lance Bass, 22, said. ``As much as there are teen bands,
there's the same amount of rock bands, r&AMP;b groups, solo acts. A lot
of older people in the music industry are a little jealous it's
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Working isn't the half of it. Since its release, 'N Sync's
sophomore effort, ``No Strings Attached,'' clung onto the No. 1
spot in the albums chart for more than two months only to be
knocked off by Spears' just-issued second album, ``Oops!...I Did It
Again,'' which recently broke all records for the largest
first-week sales of a female solo album at 1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   In its first week, ``No Strings Attached'' sold more than 2.4
million copies, the strongest week of sales by any artist in
history _ almost double the total of the previous record holder
(Backstreet Boys).
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync appears Friday at the Rose Bowl with Sisqo (``Thong
Song'') and Pink (``There You Go''). More than 1 million tickets
worth about $40 million were sold across the country the day tour
dates went on sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't dream of having a goal like that,'' 'N Sync's Joey
Fatone, 23, said. ``The fans broke the record. A lot of people are
interested because of what we're about and the music we stand for.
It's not like we're just trying to throw something together to sell
the album. We really do put our blood, sweat and tears into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest differences between the likes of Lymon and
today's teen stars, apparently, is control. 'N Sync, at least,
claims to have it. Lymon clearly did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know who controls your business and that's you,'' Bass said.
``And we didn't realize that until this last year _ that we are in
control. And without us five guys, nothing could happen. We finally
realized that and took control of our own business.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. 'N Sync fought a messy legal battle to extricate
themselves from a record contract designed by the quintet's former
promoter, Lou Pearlman, that was settled late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pearlman, incidentally, could be seen in action as he tries to
create another teen sensation on the recently canceled ABC-TV
series, ``Making the Band.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of 'N Sync were not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it was made by one of the guys that put money behind us
in the beginning, you know, they flip it around and make it look
like he's out there, he's the one that's putting the group
together,'' 'N Sync's Chris Kirkpatrick, 28, said. ``He's the one
sitting in choreography rehearsals, putting in his input. He's the
one in vocal rehearsals when, in actuality, we didn't talk to him
for months at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all those sales, older pop fans often grumble that
teen-pop is a manufactured phenomenon where moderately talented but
good-looking singers have little say in the final product. The word
on 'N Sync, for example, is they're merely clones of the Backstreet
Boys, who themselves are copies of late '80s/early '90s boy act New
Kids on the Block.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not true,'' insists Warren, who wrote Aguilera's
latest smash, ``I Turn to You,'' as well as tracks on the new 'N
Sync and Spears albums, adding that pure pop has always been
popular and will continue that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always want to write off pop music,'' she said. ``But
it always survives. You can't kill it. Girls will always want cute
boys singing romantic songs to them _ and there's nothing wrong
with that. For a long time you had this anti-rock star thing with
sloppy clothes and this attitude of, `I don't want to be famous.'
Then, why don't you just quit your major label deal and give tapes
to your friends? That attitude got tiresome. The new singers really
want to do it and be stars. And why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync got started in the teen-pop
factory town of Orlando, Fla., where they shared the same manager
as Backstreet. Sound fishy?
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't go through a boot camp or audition,'' Bass says,
arguing that 'N Sync wasn't assembled in the same way as some other
boy groups. ``Nobody trained us. You can't put a group together
like that from scratch and expect it to last.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was, the group grew out of Joshua ``JC'' Chasez
and 19-year-old Justin Timberlake's work on TV's ``Mickey Mouse
Club,'' where they appeared at the same time as Spears. The two 'N
Syncs tried to make it in Nashville, failed, and returned to
Orlando where they hooked up with the three other members _
Kirkpatrick, Fatone and Bass.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, they were gigantic in Europe and thanks to a Disney
Channel special, found a home on the U.S. charts. It didn't hurt
that there were now nearly 22 million American aged 13 to 19 with a
reported disposable income of $140 billion a year waiting to
pounce.
</P>
<P>
   Bass, however, believes 'N Sync's massive first-week sales were
due to a heavy promotion schedule. ''We did, like, 50 million
television appearances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, the sophomore disc was delayed; the group's
self-titled debut came out in 1998. ``The fans were so hungry for
something out there,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chasez contributed four songs on the new album, ``No
Strings Attached'' follows a tried-and-true boy-group formula of
light r&AMP;b grooves and romantic ballads. The first single, ``Bye Bye
Bye,'' rivaled Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On'' for
wall-to-wall airplay earlier this year, especially on such
syndicated outlets as Radio Disney, which targets preteens and
broadcasts a steady diet of teen acts in 46 cities.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just radio. MTV's ``Total Request Live'' and music
shows on the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and HBO also support the
teen pop scene.
</P>
<P>
   But just when it seems like the kiddie-pop field is overflowing
and there are no more records to be broken, a new crop of stars
from all over the world is heading down the pike. Britain's Five,
Ireland's Westlife and Sweden's ATeens, for example, are beginning
to see chart action.
</P>
<P>
   The squealing has only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of only one possible period where you didn't have
teen acts and that was the mid-'80s,'' said Rob Durkee, author of
``American Top 40: The Countdown of the Century,'' a book about the
the pop charts and radio. ``Record labels just weren't in the mood
to take chances. Then, a couple years later, Debbie Gibson and New
Kids on the Block came along. So, you'll always have these acts.
The name of the game now is to get a vocal harmony sound and the
songwriting and production will take care of itself. The question I
always ask is, are they writing their own material? Because the
ones that sound good and can write will stick around into their 20s
and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I'm asked how a young singer can break into the
business, I always say, `Get yourself a killer ballad preferably by
Diane Warren and get it into a movie.' ''

EDUCATING RANDY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If some cash-strapped Midwestern university ever decides to
offer a course in ``Randy Newman 101,'' its syllabus would be
fairly straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 1, our hero is ``born right here'' in Los Angeles,
``November '43'', as one of Newman's self-ruminative songs puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 2, he moves with his mom to New Orleans, where the hot,
sticky musical culture of the Deep South brushes up against cold,
implacable racism.
</P>
<P>
   In chapters 3 through whatever, Newman starts taking piano
lessons (at age 6), moves back to L.A., grows up, marries twice and
raises five kids.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, incidentally, he also becomes one of the most successful
singer- songwriters of the pop-rock era, cutting a distinctive
swathe through music (``Sail Away,'' ``I Love L.A.''), movies
(``Avalon,'' ``Toy Story'') and even musical theater (``Faust'').
</P>
<P>
   Randy Newman, this is your life _ or at least it's the abridged,
somewhat sanitized version that will be put forth this summer in
``The Education of Randy Newman,'' the world premiere musical play
that opens Saturday at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far from a literal documentation of my life, which would
have been boring beyond belief,'' Newman says one recent morning
after schlepping from his hilltop Westside home to an SCR rehearsal
room. ``It's my life, and yet it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   That description encapsulates a project whose authors, Michael
Roth and Jerry Patch, wanted to create something with more
emotional heft and bite than the typical Broadway-style ``greatest
hits'' revue.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing its title from ``The Education of Henry Adams,'' the
1907 autobiographical masterpiece by the renowned New England man
of letters, ``The Education of Randy Newman'' recreates the life of
a middle-aged musician who bears a striking resemblance to its
namesake _ with some details changed to protect the guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But the show also aims to tell a bigger story about postwar
America's growing pains, through the prism of Newman's radically
skeptical, mordantly humorous worldview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that Randy writes about the world and the people he sees
in it and how he feels in it, we decided to write the story of a
man who lived through the last half of the 20th century,'' says
Patch, SCR's resident dramaturg.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was something that interested me because I found
myself relating to all the things this man went through,'' Patch
continues, ticking off the Civil Rights movement, the sexual
revolution, the rise and fall of the 1960s counter-culture and the
uneasy boom years of the '80s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going back through a photo album and seeing all of
our lives recapitulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a gray-haired pop elder statesman still given to Hawaiian
shirts and blue jeans, Newman says that Patch and Roth approached
him with idea of fashioning a show from his prodigious songbook
about a year ago. He'd worked with Roth previously on the La Jolla
Playhouse's 1995 world premiere of ``Faust,'' Newman's updating of
the enduring legend about a man who sells his soul to the devil.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Faust,'' which was composed of all-new material,
``Education'' includes only a couple of previously unreleased tunes
from Newman's vast 300-song catalog. The rest, spanning his
30-plus-year recording career, are a mix of familiar and
less-familiar numbers sung by a cast of seven and backed by a
seven-piece band. Scott Waara, a Tony Award winner for the Broadway
revival of ``The Most Happy Fella,'' portrays the Newman character.
</P>
<P>
   For Newman, the rehearsal process has been, well, educational.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's been basically a good experience,'' he says.
``They (the songs) benefit by having a theatrical context
sometimes. You know, I always understand what I'm talking about,
but other people don't. And when it's clear, or it's someone with a
traditional good voice, who can hold a note, it's got a different
thing to it. And they (the songs) are easier to understand. You
know, irony in pop music, coming out of a radio, as you're driving
down the freeway.... I mean, I don't know that I get it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironic self-deprecation comes naturally to Newman, as it did for
Adams. It's part of a dualistic personality capable of penning the
warm and fuzzy ``You've Got a Friend in Me'' (from ``Toy Story''),
then turning around and writing ``Life Isn't Fair,'' a trenchant
2-minute parable about tarnished ideals from Newman's 1999 studio
release ``Bad Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman admits that some of his purportedly autobiographical
songs like ``Dixie Flyer'' (included in the show) are partly
apocryphal, and that his songs' first-person narrators, despite
their apparent candor, are notoriously untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also exposes himself and his shortcomings mercilessly
through song. The Newman narrative persona may be shifty, but the
sentiments behind it tend toward the painful truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing about my life that I wouldn't expose to get a
song out of it,'' he asserts. ``There isn't anything more important
to me. Well, almost nothing. I wrote a love song to my first wife
on my last record, while I'm married to my second wife. Not
without, you know, some repercussions. And I'm not saying this like
`Oh, what a ruthless writer, he must be good!' I'm saying it
because it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman's only other foray into musical theater besides ``Faust''
was the 1981 revue ``Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong.'' Though he has
learned to like the genre, he admits to walking out on both ``Les
Miserables'' and ``Cats,'' ``which may be just California
vulgarity, but I think we were right.''
</P>
<P>
   Patch credits Newman's ability to write in many musical idioms
to his protean, ``suburban blueslinger'' personality. Despite
growing up in a privileged environment _ the son of a doctor and,
more significantly, the nephew of legendary Hollywood film
composers Alfred Newman and Lionel Newman _ Randy Newman's
anti-romantic songs often adopt the perspective of misfits and
losers, characters with distinct voices and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   And his conceptual albums ``Land of Dreams'' (1988) and ``Bad
Love'' possess strong narrative through-lines, playing almost like
mini musicals.
</P>
<P>
   `I think most pop songs are written with a lack of specificity,
even good pop songs,'' Patch says. ``If you take Beatles songs like
`I Want to Hold Your Hand,' that's the sentiment and anybody can
sing it. Not everybody can sing `Rednecks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Newman's stage alter-ego finally learn?
</P>
<P>
   ``He decides that life is all right,'' Newman says. ``Which I
do, simplistic and stupid as it seems. For me to think that is not
a small thing. It's comin' a little way to think that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought that life is like a (Charles) Bukowski
novel,'' he continues, referring to the down-and-dirty L.A. author
of ``Barfly.'' ``I never believed in `the world is a cesspool'
theory of art, and `you're just alone and it's a gutter' kind of
thinking. I always felt that people are pretty decent one on one.
You sit next to somebody on a plane, and usually they're all
right....''
</P>
<P>
   Newman hesitates a beat, a smile stealing over his face.

   CLINTON-CAREER (Washington) _ Senator Bill Clinton? There's a
lot of speculation about what the president will do when he leaves
office next January as one of the youngest former chief executives
in U.S. history. Former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., a longtime
acquaintance of Clinton and one of his chief defenders during the
impeachment trial, thinks he might run for the Senate from
Arkansas. By AUSTIN ZALKIN. (Story, which is for Sunday release,

<P>
   FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE _ Unnoticed amid the turmoil of events in
Freetown, the world has lost one of its most supremely seedy
literary landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   As the pride of the British fleet sailed into view of Graham
Greene's ``world of tin roofs, of vultures clanging down,'' the
cockroaches of The Bedford Hotel _ immortalized in ``The Heart of
the Matter'' _ were frying alive.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tragedy for Shaika Kabie, who sells secondhand socks
for 500 Leones outside the burned-out building on Lightfoot Boston
Street. In common with most people in Sierra Leone, he has never
heard of Greene. But Kabie lost his entire business.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my socks were burned. It happened in the early hours of
May 2, but the fire kept on for several days. I stored about 500
pairs in the basement of the hotel,'' said the 18-year-old, as he
carefully hung out his colorful new stock, sock by sock, over a
pole.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Rahim, 31, a stationery seller who is Kabie's pavement
neighbor, said he is ashamed of his current selection _ a pot of
blue Bic pens and a dozen notebooks laid out on a rickety wooden
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be a really big stationery stall. I had millions
of Leones worth of stock in that cellar. Now, this does not even
look like a serious business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as anyone knows, the fire earlier this month at the City
Hotel (its real name) was unrelated to Sierra Leone's nine years of
war and butchery or to the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
whose captive leader, Foday Sankoh, wants to run the country. The
blaze was started by a paraffin lamp or an electrical failure,
police believe.
</P>
<P>
   But the seedy hotel with its $3.50 room price was the reminder _
for those who knew _ of the Freetown that Greene knew when he
served here as a Colonial Officer in the early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The capital is still ``an impression of heat and damp'' where
``nature, conventionally grand, rises in tree-covered hills above
the sea, powerless to carry off the shabby town.''
</P>
<P>
   And Freetown's Anglican cathedral, ``laterite bricks and tin
with a square tower,'' its Norman Church, ``sticking up out of the
early morning fog'' are still, as Greene wrote, a reminder that
``one was back in home waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Brigadier David Richards, heading the current British operation
to secure Freetown, the airport at Lungi and to aid the
pro-government offensive against the RUF, says he has never before
so often been asked to recolonize a place.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Parkinson, a customer at the sock stand, was 12 years old
when the Queen of England came here on April 27, 1961, to declare
Sierra Leone independent after 153 years of British rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great day,'' he said. ``We had parades all over town
and a great celebration at the `Recre' (sports field). We had a man
we called Father Christmas who gave us all presents that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we want our colonial masters to come back. They gave
us back our country but we mismanaged it because of envy and greed
for material things.
</P>
<P>
   ``After independence, the ruling elite _ the Krios who came back
from slavery when British philanthropists established this Free
Town _ wanted to be like the white man. Our leaders have not
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be superior, they want to have all the wealth
like the white man and to send their children to schools overseas.
If we get rid of Sankoh, another one like him will come along and
want all the diamond wealth,'' said Parkinson, 51.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was critical of the colonizers because ``everything ugly
in Freetown was European.'' He said: ``England had planted this
town, the tin shacks and the Remembrance Day posters and then
withdrawn up the hillside to smart bungalows with wide windows and
electric fans and perfect service.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, from Hill Station, where the Presidential Lodge is now
situated, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah looks down on a town in the
throes of recolonization.
</P>
<P>
   The police chief, Keith Biddall, is British. The finance
ministry is run by the British and the armed forces are about to
be, thanks to a (pounds sterling)20 million ($35 million)
``training program.''
</P>
<P>
   The favorite football team in this city, which Leo Blair
(British Prime Minister Tony Blair's father) visited as a law
examiner, is Manchester United. The mobile phone company and the
ferry to Lungi are run by Britons.
</P>
<P>
   So popular is the presence of the Royal Marines, who man the
roadblock leading to the British operations center at Aberdeen
Point, that the locals joke: ``You are now entering London,
England.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the good feeling towards Britain was consolidated by
Peter Penfold, the popular former British High Commissioner, who
when he left Freetown for the last time in April was treated to an
impromptu motorcade through the capital.
</P>
<P>
   His successor, Alan Jones, has not had time to grow into the
role yet. But he will, said Rahim: ``Britain is our friend. We want
the British soldiers to stay for as long as possible. It is so
important for us to know that they care.'' &QL;

   SCHAGHTICOKE, N.Y. _ Sebastian Meier dug his fingers into the
dirt in a field on the banks of the Hudson River. He tugged out a
weed. ``Goldenrod,'' he said, holding up the offending clump.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Shanti Nagel knelt down to eyeball her organic kale.
Clean and green, with no trace of flea beetles.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, that's beautiful!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is their first field. Most days, they can't wait to get to
it. Before Nagel and Meier came along, it lay fallow for 30 years.
Tilling it required hand-to-hand combat with sapling roots, poison
ivy and battalions of baseballs and golf balls thwacked skyward
from neighbors' back yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a bit of a challenge,'' said Meier, 25, who has not
slept much this spring. ``It's a short, intense season where you
just work yourself to the bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, he swore he would never be a vegetable farmer. Then he met
Nagel, 20, a vegetarian, fell in love and joined the grass-roots
revolution in the food industry. Now he plants tray after tray of
vegetables, which is fun for the first couple of flats. ``Then I
get really cramped shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   So go the days at Mantis Organic Farm in the eastern New York
village of Schaghticoke. Like many other new young farmers, Nagel
and Meier are fighting back against agribusiness with organics and
kinship.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just about food. They want to preserve the land. Like
the mantis, a beneficial insect known in some cultures as the god
of little people, they are doing one small thing to make the world
a better place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a million causes out there in the world that you can
get involved with,'' Nagel said. ``But this is a really important
one. We have to bring food production back to being local, and not
this multinational scariness.''
</P>
<P>
   Farm life has changed. Rookie farmers need to incorporate
marketing, work second jobs and be really good at saving money. To
survive, Nagel and Meier rented a small Mechanicville apartment and
cultivated 3 1/2 acres of a nearby family farm. For $10 a year, the
farmer threw in the use of his tractor and a shed. They borrowed a
seeder from another farmer.
</P>
<P>
   First year goal: break even. Their start-up costs to date are
$12,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's our babies,'' Nagel said at their greenhouse, pointing
to trays of lettuce, radicchio and other plants seeded in organic
soil and ready to plant. On deck are basil, peppers, fennel,
scallions, leeks, sorrel, snapdragons and black-eyed Susans.
</P>
<P>
   More and more consumers are buying organic produce, and many
look for fresh, local produce grown by someone they know and trust.
Nagel and Meier sell vegetables at the Troy Waterfront Farmers
Market on Saturday mornings and wholesales them to restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   They also have lined up 10 subscribers for a 30-member
community-supported agriculture project. Members pay $350 at the
start of the growing season in exchange for weekly bags of fresh
vegetables from June 1 through October.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, as children of aging farmers leave the industry,
the number of U.S. farms has dropped from 6.4 million in 1910 to
2.2 million in 1999, according to the state Department of
Agriculture and Markets. Statewide, the number of farms shrunk from
218,000 to 39,000 during that time.
</P>
<P>
   But new, nonfarmers are turning to agriculture with fresh
enthusiasm and deeply held values for motivation, said Tracy Frisch
of the Regional Farm &AMP; Food Project in Albany, a clearinghouse for
community-supported agriculture. And the number of New York farmers
selling more than $1,000 a year rose from 36,000 in 1997 to 39,000
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the beauty and the miracle of life every year. There
are spiritual aspects. There's a real sense of completion and
accomplishment,'' Frisch said.
</P>
<P>
   Nagel's parents weren't farmers. ``My parents had a garden and I
used to weed. One day the weeding went from a chore to something I
really looked forward to doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Emma Willard girls' school in Troy, she
took an apprenticeship on Roxbury Biodynamic Farm in Claverack,
which sells to soap opera stars on Manhattan's Upper West Side as
well as poor rural and inner-city residents in the Albany area.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian, however, is the son of Christoph Meier, an esteemed
Swiss dairy farmer and former manager of the 400-acre biodynamic
Hawthorne Valley Farm in Ghent who currently operates a biodynamic
banana farm in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Biodynamic farms predate organics and are pesticide-free and
self-sufficient, relying on their own feeds, manure and compost.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Meier studied farming in Switzerland, apprenticed on
Fred Kirschenmann's 3,000-acre biodynamic grain farm in North
Dakota and worked as a dairy herd manager in Pennsylvania before
returning to Ghent as a much-in-demand equipment mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   One day, while servicing tractors at Roxbury Farm, he met a
young apprentice whose name means peace in Sanskrit. Shanti. Last
winter, as the two searched for a farm they could work on together,
it hit them. Why not start our own?
</P>
<P>
   Most days, though ``it feels like going from one catastrophe to
the next,'' Meier said as he pulled out a sapling root near yet
another baseball in their newly plowed field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the broccoli is buttoning, I think,'' Nagel called out
from the next row. Premature blooms could scotch their broccoli
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they want a farm productive enough to supply an
entire community _ ``their whole food source, you know, their dairy
and grains and vegetables,'' Nagel said. ``And to find a community
that's willing to learn to eat locally.''

   Meier thinks of his North Dakota friend, Kirschenmann, who is in
his 60s and has no one to take over his farm. ``That's the big
dilemma out there, how to pass the farm on to someone,'' he said.
``His kids aren't really interested in it. They've chosen different
paths.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone needs to step in, Meier said. He quoted a popular
statistic: The average age of the American farmer is now 57 and
rising.

   Nagel smiled back. ``We bring that down, don't we?'' she said.

   LOS ANGELES _ There's a scare going around the San Fernando
Valley in Los Angeles. In this tract of suburban communities laid
out between the mountains and the desert, the authorities are so
short of water _ or so the breathless rumor goes _ that they are
seriously considering recycling human excrement and plunging it
straight back into the drinking supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toilet to tap'' is what the scheme is being called. The local
newspaper, the Los Angeles Daily News, is up in arms already (``Can
Valley overcome `yuck' factor?'' it asked in a headline), as are
quite a few residents worried about their property values and the
mutterings of unkind neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   So-called experts have been brought in from the other side of
the country to drown the health assurances of public authorities in
a cold shower of skepticism. Both the Department of Water and Power
and the Los Angeles City Council have called special sessions to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Could the rumors possibly be true? At least on the surface, it
certainly seems that way.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities are enacting something called the East Valley
Water Recycling Project, which will take waste water, purify it,
reintroduce it into the ground and let it seep back into the
household supply over a five-year cycle. Some of this waste water
will indeed come from toilets.
</P>
<P>
   But is this any cause for alarm? This is where things _ pardon
the expression _ become somewhat murkier. The Daily News reported
excitedly how the scheme risked exposing tens of thousands of
households to chemicals whose long-term effects and detectability
were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is human waste,'' the Daily News quoted Lori Dinkin,
president of the Valley Village Homeowners Association, as
exclaiming. ``I'm very uneasy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a similar scheme was proposed in San Diego, 120
miles south of Los Angeles, but was scrapped last year after
protests from residents.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a tussle in the San Gabriel Mountains in 1995
when the Miller brewing company worried that a recycling scheme
upriver from the source of its beer water would give its products a
bad name. The yuck factor thus appears to be genuine.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, every water expert in Los Angeles swears that
the process is safe. All water is recycled eventually, they argue;
this is merely a scientific method for speeding up the process and
sparing precious groundwater resources into the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really toilet to tap, anyway, it's more like washing
machine to tap. There's nothing unusual about it,'' said Lynne
Plambeck, a former water official and environmental activist in
north Los Angeles county. ``When you build houses all over
everywhere, as they have in this city, then you have to recycle
water. There is no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Recycling has, in fact, gone on at two locations in Southern
California since the 1960s, and there has not been a single health
problem reported.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, plenty of other communities treat sewage water and
then dump it in river beds, where it eventually seeps into aquifers
feeding into households. Again, there seem to be no ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the San Fernando Valley getting so upset? Could it be
something to do with the area's peculiar historical dependence on
water (the Valley was only built thanks to a giant scam by the Los
Angeles city fathers, who drained a whole farming valley in the
Sierra Nevada foothills and pumped the water 250 miles south)?
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled historical scores might have something to do with it,
since the recycling scheme has virtually been forced onto Los
Angeles as a result of a court settlement with the descendants of
those unlucky farmers who saw their livelihoods sucked away at the
beginning of the twentieth century.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also another sneaky agenda at work.
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando Valley is lobbying to secede from Los Angeles,
arguing that the only things the city authorities ever bring are
urban blight, crime and mismanaged schools. The Daily News, in
particular, has been in the forefront of efforts to denigrate the
city of Los Angeles at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that, without Los Angeles, the Valley would have
almost no water at all. What better way to lobby for independence
than to tell prospective voters that L.A.'s Department of Water and
Power is trying to poison them with recycled excrement from someone
else's toilet? &QL;

<P>
   Astronomers and telescope builders have come up with a plan to
give the aging Hubble Space Telescope a new lease on life. Instead
of building an entirely new space telescope, they propose sending
up just huge mirrors, and then letting Hubble look through them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jim Crocker of Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, a feasibility study has shown that it is possible to
turn the 2.4-meter Hubble into a giant 8-meter space observatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost will be some $250 million,'' Crocker says, ``less
than half the cost of building a new space telescope.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was proposed by Bob Woodruff of Ball Aerospace and
Roger Angel of the University of Arizona in Tucson. At first,
Crocker recalls, it sounded ``ridiculous.'' But a study group of
more than 20 engineers, set up by Crocker, found no obvious
show-stoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have a lot of experience with Hubble,'' Crocker
says. ``If they say it can be done, you can't dismiss that
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   An upgraded Hubble would be able to see planets orbiting nearby
stars _ currently these can only be detected indirectly _ and
search for signs of oxygen in their atmospheres. Also, with 10
times as much sensitivity and a fourfold improvement in resolution,
the new Hubble could peer back in space and time to the era before
the first galaxies were born.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science case is pretty compelling,'' Crocker says.
</P>
<P>
   To build the 8-meter telescope, the team proposes using a spare
mirror ``blank'' leftover from building the European Southern
Observatory's four-mirror Very Large Telescope. After polishing the
parabolic surface, the back would be ground away to leave a
meniscus-shaped mirror only 2 millimeters thick and weighing less
than 1 ton.
</P>
<P>
   Five thousand actuators on its back would control the shape of
the ultra-thin mirror. For launch, it would be cut in three, stowed
in the cargo bay of the space shuttle, and installed during a
number of spacewalks. Astronaut consultants say the job is
feasible, and the mirror could be launched as early as 2006.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent report from the U.S. National Research Council
on astronomy priorities for the next decade, a review committee led
by Joe Taylor of Princeton University, N.J., and Chris McKee of the
University of California in Berkeley says it has ``not recommended
any new moderate or major missions for space-based ultraviolet or
optical astronomy for the coming decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason is that infrared wavelengths offer greater
research opportunities and these wavelengths will be well covered
by the Next Generation Space Telescope, a $500 million observatory
with an 8-meter mirror due for launch in 2009 or 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is very smart and the team that proposes it has to be
taken seriously,'' says Piero Benvenuti, director of the Space
Telescope European Coordiating Facility in Garching, Germany.
``But given the current budget situation, both in the United States
and Europe, I think it will remain an excellent and technically
extremely interesting academic exercise.'' &QL;

<P>
   Cash cuts and a lack of clean disposal technology look likely to
prevent Russia and the United States from keeping promises to
destroy their chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Countries signed up to the Chemical Weapons Convention are meant
to destroy their chemical weapons arsenals by April 29, 2007. But
officials from Russia and the United States told delegates in The
Hague that they will not make the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Russia simply hasn't enough cash for the task, says Valery Semin
of the Russian foreign ministry. Money has become even tighter
since the United States stopped funding Russia's chemical weapons
destruction program last year after Russia failed to fund its share
of the work.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, weapons destruction has been stymied by
local opposition to incinerators. The U.S. Army insists it can burn
its 32,000 tons of nerve agents and mustard gas safely, and on
time. But environmentalists in the towns of Pueblo, Colo., and Blue
Grass, Ky., where 3,130 tons of mustard and nerve gas are stored,
have convinced Congress to halt incinerator construction and look
for alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Braun, head of military technology at the National
Research Council, told the conference that no alternative is likely
to be available for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to working toward the 2007 deadline,'' says
Gloria Patten, deputy assistant secretary of the army, in charge of
chemical demilitarization. ``That's not saying we're going to make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Army officials say it is riskier to store the chemical weapons
than burn them. But objectors point to two releases in May of the
nerve gas sarin at the army's incinerator in Tooele, Utah _
apparently after some weapons got stuck in the plant's input
chutes.
</P>
<P>
   The two most promising alternatives to incineration start by
cutting the weapons up and stewing them in water at 40 degrees
Celsius until most of the chemicals decompose. This is effective
for mustard and nerve agents, but tricky for the propellants and
explosives in the weapons, says Braun, some of which can recombine
and explode.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical agents themselves are broken down into chemicals
which could be used to make more chemical weapons, and under the
convention, these too must be destroyed. One promising treatment is
to use soil bacteria immobilized in a foam. Astonishingly, these
bacteria, which come from soil near army chemical testing ranges,
thrive on mustard gas. These are partnered with nematode worms that
eat surplus bacteria, reducing waste.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the technique works better for mustard than for nerve
gas. But Johnson says that with the right bugs, it could work for
nerve gas, and for PCBs and pesticides too. &QL;

   One of the Caribbean's last jungles could soon echo to the sound
of rocket launches. Guyana has agreed to sell a large tract of
pristine swampy rainforest to a Texan rocket-launch company, Beal
Aerospace, for just $7.50 a hectare (which is equal to 2.47 acres).
</P>
<P>
   The deal, signed last month, replaces Beal's original plan to
build its $250 million launch pad on the Caribbean island of
Sombrero in Anguilla, which angered environmental scientists.
Guyanese Prime Minister Samuel Hinds hailed the project _ which
could see more than 20 commercial satellite launches a year _ as
``a quantum leap for Guyana into the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the country will gain little economically, while
rainforest dwellers will be thrown out of their homes, swamps
drained, forests cut down and ancient archaeological remains
trashed.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Beal Aerospace is testing 70-meter rockets
fueled with a mix of aviation fuel and hydrogen peroxide, which
will carry 5-ton payloads. The vice-president of Beal, David
Spoede, says the company hopes to be launching from the site in
Guyana in three to four years' time.
</P>
<P>
   Guyana is close to the equator, which is the best place to
launch satellites into geostationary orbit above the equator. The
European Space Agency's spaceport is in nearby French Guiana. From
Guyana, the launch route eastwards will be over open ocean in case
of mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   Beal plans to buy, then partially drain, 100 square kilometers
of swamp on the north bank of the River Waini and lease from Guyana
a buffer zone three times as large.
</P>
<P>
   Hinds calls the site ``generally unproductive land never before
commercially utilized.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deal documents acknowledge that up to 54 families living
there would have to be moved. Sharon Atkinson of the Amerindian
Peoples' Association in Guyana says many others will lose their
right to hunt, fish and gather thatch and timber.
</P>
<P>
   The launch area is part of the homeland of the Warao people,
whose settlements date back 7,000 years and are only now being
excavated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a rocket launch site will very probably destroy the
archaeological record here before it has been fully explored,''
says Terry Roopnaraine, a Guyanese anthropologist at the University
of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The World Monuments Fund in New York recently placed the area on
its list of the hundred most endangered archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   The large exclusion zone around the launch site would also
disrupt harvesting of the Waini basin's rich supplies of manicole _
heart of palm. Amerindians harvest more than 2 million palm stems
from the basin annually and sell them to a French canning company
for sale in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Spoede responds to these concerns by saying that the project
will only go ahead if an environmental impact assessment, which is
about to start, proves acceptable to both sides. But he adds that
drainage work would probably begin in six months, before completion
of the assessment. Many Amerindians have backed the scheme, Spoede
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want job opportunities for themselves and their
children,'' he told New Scientist. &QL;

   Doctors may eventually use sound waves to halt hemorrhages deep
within the body without having to slice into a patient.
</P>
<P>
   There is no widespread method for stopping internal bleeding
without surgery, which is risky. As an alternative, some
researchers are hoping to use ultrasound to pinpoint, heat and
cauterize internal wounds. But cooking tissue in that way is
dangerous if bleeding occurs in areas such as the brain, or if the
problem is hard to pinpoint and doctors need to treat a large area
of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Now a team from the University of Washington in Seattle has
discovered that high-intensity focused ultrasound beams can
accelerate natural clotting, and stop bleeding without heating up
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Sound waves make blood move around more than usual. This
activates platelets by tricking them into thinking they are flowing
through an open wound. In lab experiments, the new method activated
platelets, causing them to stick to membranes and each other, both
necessary steps for clots to form.
</P>
<P>
   Such a technique could be a welcome or even lifesaving option
when cauterizing is too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenon we are really excited about,'' says team
member Lawrence Crum.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have also found that clotting occurs more
rapidly if gas-filled microbubbles called ultrasound contrast
agents are present. The bubbles are often injected into tissue as
an aid for ultrasound imaging.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, according to team member Wayne Chandler, will be
to learn how to optimize the technique before moving on to animal
then human tests, which could take place in the next few years. &QL;

   PARIS _ The Canal Saint-Martin is a time machine and not just
because it ends in Stalingrad. If you walk the three miles of the
canal (from the Place de la Republique to the Place de la Bataille
de Stalingrad), you abandon the wealthy, homogenized, well-scrubbed
grandeur of 21st-century Paris.
</P>
<P>
   You infiltrate a meaner, tougher, more picturesque, almost
vanished city: the Paris of black-and-white movies and the
Inspector Maigret novels.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycles bump along cobbled quais; workmen in bright blue
overalls gesticulate outside small bars; racks full of brown and
black jackets are heaped furtively into yellow vans; a saxophone
plays from an upstairs window; children sit on the canal bank and
swap cards. (They are, admittedly, Pokemon cards, not collections
of prewar cyclists or footballers in brylcream and thick sweaters.)
</P>
<P>
   At the end of May, the Paris city council planned to consider an
ambitious $95 million (Pounds 60 million) plan to revive the city's
neglected canal system.
</P>
<P>
   The investment is, in some respects, long overdue. A canal basin
collapsed near Stalingrad last year, with almost disastrous
results.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some of the people who already use and
appreciate the canals fear the worst: a dagger of gentrification
plunged into the heart of one of the last remaining, pleasant,
working-class areas of the French capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris waterways were built, by decree of Napoleon Bonaparte,
in the early 1800s to bring fresh water into the city and to divert
barges from the overcrowded Seine.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years later, another small, pugnacious,
controversial Corsican, Jean Tiberi, the mayor of Paris, wants to
use them to pump fresh life into the capital's more run-down
quarters and divert the flow of visitors from the standard tourist
sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make the landscape around the canals more
attractive for leisure activities and walks,'' Tiberi said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is renovating, and in some places rebuilding the
canal banks; banning cars from the quays on Sundays; turning old
warehouses into cafes and restaurants; and fitting rainbow-colored
illuminations to the long tunnel section of the canal to allow
tourists to sail up and down in electrically-powered boats.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these ideas make sense. The canals _ the Canal de
L'Ourcq and the Canal St-Denis, as well as the Canal Saint-Martin,
perhaps six miles in all, linking the Seine to the Seine, through
northern Paris _ are dangerously run-down.
</P>
<P>
   They almost disappeared in the 1960s. There was a plan to turn
them into a highway, which was defeated by public outcry and lack
of cash.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, some money was spent on renovation, allowing
barges to bring bulk building materials into the center of the
capital once again, and permitting slow boat trips between the
Seine and the huge, oblong, urban lake, the Bassin de la Villette,
just north of Stalingrad in the 19th arrondissement.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened in 1808, the Bassin was briefly one of the most
fashionable places in Paris, a rival to the Venice Lido: a place
for strolling, swimming and boating in summer and skating in
winter. Its popularity declined after the city's main
slaughterhouses congregated on its banks in the late 19th century.
Tiberi now hopes that it can reclaim some of its former grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   The people who live beside the canal have mixed feelings about
the mayor's plans. Strolling up the Saint-Martin canal last week, I
discovered Jean-Louis Roubier, 74, fishing in a scruffy stretch,
just south of Stalingrad, which is due for ``upgrading'' with
restaurants and cafes and a new marina.
</P>
<P>
   A tangle of busy roads and open air metro line passed just above
his head but he was as absorbed by the behavior of his line and
float as if he was in the deepest countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Are there fish in the Paris canals? ``Like that,'' he said,
spreading his arms in the classic fisherman's gesture. ``Pike,
perch, bream, all kinds. But none today.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he welcome the plan to revitalize the canals? He growled.
``First they want to turn them into motorways. Then they ignore
them so they fall apart. Then they decide they should become a
luxury, something for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I would be happy if they spent just a little money
maintaining them as they should. I come here everyday. The canal is
the only place left where you can be quiet. What do we want cafes
and restaurants. Haven't they got those on the Champs Elysees?'' &QL;

&HT;     VIAGRA SEEN AS POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR VISION PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     By CINDY TUMIEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Viagra has become firmly imbedded in the American
vocabulary since the drug debuted two years ago as a treatment for
men with sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   But debate continues among doctors and researchers, who have
cautioned that not much is known about its effect on other systems
in the body. Eye specialists, in particular, have warned high doses
of Viagra can affect the delicate chemistry of the eye in some
patients and cause temporary visual problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers from the University of Texas Health Science
Center say their work suggests Viagra, or sildenafil, should be
studied as a potential treatment for patients with macular
degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in older individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts warned it is far too soon to make even that
qualified suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go, but so far we have nothing but good
cause for guarded optimism,'' said Dr. William Sponsel, an
associate professor of ophthalmology and lead author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Health science center researchers found a low dose of sildenafil
improved the blood flow to the eye and increased contrast
sensitivity in 12 middle-aged adults who had no eye disease.
</P>
<P>
   Diminished blood flow is a culprit in macular degeneration, an
untreatable condition that is slowly deteriorating vision in some
13 million Americans, most of them over age 55.
</P>
<P>
   Macular degeneration causes blurry or fuzzy vision, distortions
and dark spots in the center of the field of vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're most excited here about the prospects for the biggest
class of disorders that we currently can't treat,'' Sponsel said.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the study, which was not funded by Viagra
manufacturer Pfizer Inc., were published Wednesday in the
correspondence section of the New England Journal of Medicine, in
which doctors exchange brief reports on topics of interests.
</P>
<P>
   Other ophthalmologists, however, expressed reservations about
the findings, noting that the San Antonio study was small and
involved healthy patients who were younger than those typically
afflicted with macular degeneration.
</P>
<P>
   The study also did not have a control, or a comparison group
that did not take the drug, noted Dr. Michael Marmor, a professor
of ophthalmology at the Stanford University School of Medicine in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a preliminary study ... using a low dose, without any
controls, that really makes it difficult to draw any firm
conclusions,'' Marmor said, adding: ``I think it is premature'' to
conclude that Viagra could help older patients with deteriorating
eyesight.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Marmor published research indicating high doses
of Viagra temporarily increased light sensitivity and altered color
perception in some patients.
</P>
<P>
   He said patients who take the drug should be made aware of this
and understand that doctors do not know much about the long-term
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Juan E. Grunwald, a professor of ophthalmology at the
University of Pennsylvania, said the study builds on a finding that
blood flow is diminished to the choroid, a tissue that nourishes
the retina.

 &HT;    Letter of the law often needs a lick of common sense
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Georgia _ Charles Stith, U.S. ambassador to
Tanzania recently chronicled the story of his son's arrest by the
Atlanta subway police.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the young man, a star student at Morehouse
College, after buying a token, got on a train with his bicycle.
Maneuvering his bike through the gate with help from an elderly
passenger, he forgot to drop the token.
</P>
<P>
   After boarding the train, he was approached by a transit
policeman who inquired why he hadn't paid his fare. The young man
apologized and offered the token to the officer. Rather than
accept, the officer took him off the train at the next stop. He was
handcuffed and carried to jail, where he was booked and put through
the criminal routine. His personal belongings were confiscated, and
his mug shot taken in the eight hours he was incarcerated. His
father suspects racism was involved.
</P>
<P>
   It may be of little comfort to the Stiths, but occasional cop
stupidity isn't totally confined to citizens of color, or even
young black men.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Massengale, organist at Fayetteville's First Methodist
Church, is a native-born lifelong resident of Fayette County,
middle-age, white. He plays piano at a popular Italian restaurant.
He cheerfully lends his musical talents to charitable and civic
events.
</P>
<P>
   This was a busy day for Rick. He had to go to the church to
practice a piece the choir was doing on Sunday. He was doing dinner
music at Baci's and before that, playing for the christening of a
new grand piano at the Fayetteville library.
</P>
<P>
   He happened to be driving his wife's car instead of his own. He
parked it on the curb next to church, across from the courthouse.
It was about 3 in the afternoon when he finished practicing on the
church organ and began to load the instruments he would use that
evening at the restaurant _ an electronic keyboard and all the
paraphernalia that goes with modern music-making.
</P>
<P>
   While loading the car, he noticed a city police cruiser parked
behind him. He wondered why a cop would be sitting in his car on a
side street next to the church on such a hot afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The police cruiser followed as he drove away from the church and
turned left on Ga. 54. Just after he crossed Ga. 85 at the
courthouse intersection, the cruiser turned on the blue lights.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled, Rick pulled into the driveway of the former Farmer's
and Merchant's bank. When he started to get out of his car, the
policeman made a motion toward his gun and instructed him to stay
in the car. Rick produced his driver's license and proof of
insurance, and then asked the officer what it was all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're driving with an expired tag,'' he was informed. He was
surprised. He had purchased a tag for his own car about two weeks
earlier. ``I guess my wife thought I had taken care of her tag, and
I thought she had,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tag office is right across the street,'' he said to the
officer. ``I can go over there and get the tag right now.'' He was
unlikely to become a fugitive from justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' replied the officer. ``I've got to impound your car.
I've already called a tow truck.'' By this time, a second police
cruiser had arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Rick asked the officer to cancel the tow truck, offering to pay
whatever the wrecker company might have charged. He really needed
to be on his way. He explained his tight schedule, including
playing at the fund-raiser for the city library. He asked to drive
his instruments to the restaurant before the tow truck took his
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said the officer. ``We'll take care of that.'' So right
there in the middle of Fayetteville, in sight of the tag office,
they loaded Rick's keyboard and other stuff into the two police
cruisers. Off went his wife's car to the pound, at a fee of 80
bucks. Patrice, Baci's proprietor, was stunned to see her piano
player arrive with a two-cruiser police escort.
</P>
<P>
   After calling his wife for a ride, Rick barely managed to get
home for supper, make it to the library, and back to Baci's for his
dinner performance. Now all he has to do is go to court and see how
much he owes for the crime of forgetting to buy a tag for his
wife's car.
</P>
<P>
   I sympathize. I forget things. About two years ago, late at
night, my wife and I encountered a road-block license check in the
little town of Gray. To my surprise, my license was three-months
expired. I figured I was in for a hard time from a small town cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better let your wife drive until you get a new license,'' said
the young officer, and we were on our way. I'm glad I wasn't
apprehended in Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   We have the case of the 20-year-old bride headed for a honeymoon
in Cancun being taken into custody at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport
after discovering and reporting a .22-caliber pistol in a carry-on
bag borrowed from her mother.
</P>
<P>
   One Atlanta police officer is in trouble for ignoring an order
to arrest the young lady. Clayton County Magistrate Judge John
Campbell had the good sense to refuse a warrant that would have
sent her to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a dab of common sense beats the letter of the law.

 &HT;    Clinton's $20 mil obesity study a prime example of fiscal
gluttony
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to spend $20 million on a study to find
out why so many Americans eat food that makes them fat.
</P>
<P>
   That's a waste of tax dollars. Americans are fat, not stupid.
</P>
<P>
   A group of nutritionists and dietary nannies at a White House
conference on nutrition want to raise taxes to fund new government
programs that will brainwash Americans into eating broccoli, tofu
and bulgur wheat chaff.
</P>
<P>
   The last White House Conference on Food Nutrition and Health
called for new taxes and government programs to combat hunger. That
was 31 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Professional worriers at the 1969 nutrition conference must have
done a good job. Today, 55 percent of adult Americans are fat or
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of U.S. children are overweight. Another 25
percent of American youngsters are likely to become fatties when
they grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government began issuing dietary guidelines 20 years
ago, the number of overweight Americans has ballooned 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two decades of government dietary warnings, officials at
the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate that only 12 percent of
Americans follow their dietary advice to eat balanced diets with
plenty of fruits, veggies and grains.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 25 percent of Americans know the government's ``five
a day'' slogan, agonize our tax-paid protectors.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know the ``five a day'' slogan, but I know about Wendy's
new steak sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem, according to government nutrition officials.
The Ag Department spends a mere $350 million tax dollars every year
to nag citizens about their ``five a day'' nutrition needs compared
to $7 billion spent each year on advertising by Wendy's and the
rest of the food industry.
</P>
<P>
   If the government tries to outspend the food industry in an
attempt to get citizens to eat their peas, Americans will lose
weight from being overtaxed. No one could afford an order of super
fries, much less a Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   A White House conference nutritionist called for a new tax on
candy bars and other food products with high sugar content. He said
the taxes could be used to convince Americans to eat healthier
food.
</P>
<P>
   Bless his heart, the man simply doesn't understand how
Washington works, much less why so many Americans choose to eat
junk food.
</P>
<P>
   A raw deal for consumers
</P>
<P>
   Despite congressional chest thumping about the glories of free
trade, Congress gives U.S. sugar producers a $1.6 billion annual
gift in the form of a federal sugar program. Subsidies for the U.S.
sugar industry come out of the pockets of American consumers. To
keep sugar prices propped artificially high, the government buys
and stores sugar with no plans to ever use the stored commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar industry officials turn around and give big contributions
out of their guaranteed profits back to Congress. It's a sweet deal
for everyone except American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Nutrition bureaucrats should not count on a tax on candy bars to
fund their ``five a day'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the argument that Americans should have the right to
choose to get fat, government nutritionists say overweight people
are at greater risk to be afflicted with diabetes, high blood
pressure, strokes, heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Health problems can end up costing the taxpayers, which is why
government nutritionists need to raise taxes and spend more money
to convince Americans to heed the warnings in their ``five a day''
campaign, whatever that is.

&HT;     CONSERVATIVE PARTY POISED TO ENDORSE LAZIO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMARONECK, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick Lazio has moved away from key
right-of-center stands on abortion and education even as the state
Conservative Party prepares to endorse his bid for the U.S. Senate
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is positioning himself as a mainstream Republican in hopes
of capturing bipartisan support in his race against First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate. They are dueling
to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was the beneficiary of a Conservative-sponsored television
advertisement touting his candidacy that began airing Thursday in
New York City and Albany. The party hopes to raise $1 million over
the next five months for Lazio's campaign and ``party building.''
</P>
<P>
   At a ``Mainstream Express'' campaign bus stop outside Mamaroneck
Avenue Elementary in this leafy Westchester County town, Lazio
indicated he is uneasy about the blanket use of vouchers and said
he has ``yet to see a plan'' for teachers' merit pay ``that I am
really comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   He also defended his abortion platform after criticism Wednesday
from anti-abortion activists at a rally in Binghamton. He generally
favors abortion rights, but opposes late-term abortions and federal
funding for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people on the far end with both sides of the issue
who only define your position if you're 100 percent with them,'' he
said Thursday. ``I just don't think that's where New Yorkers are. I
try to make these decisions and respect both sides of the argument
without necessarily having to agree with both sides of the
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   On private school vouchers, Lazio said he favors them in cases
of ``schools that are failing, and there's no opportunity for
children to learn, or if they're not safe.'' On merit pay, Lazio
said he would need to ``make sure there is objective criteria, not
subjective criteria. ... I am concerned about that part of merit
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lazio has all but officially accepted the Conservative
endorsement, expected to come Saturday at the party's convention in
Albany. Party Chairman Mike Long suggested that Lazio may be more
open to those core conservative issues later in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we don't have the whole loaf, we have a pretty good
slice here in Rick Lazio,'' Long said. ``He's more open to more of
those key issues than Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton favors abortion rights unconditionally and would reject
proposals for school vouchers and merit pay for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Conservative Party should tell New Yorkers why they are
really endorsing Rick Lazio this weekend _ he supports restrictions
on a woman's right to choose and opposes common-sense gun control
measures,'' said Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson.

Clinton paid tribute Friday to his own country's roots, casting the

is, since Europe is an idea as much as a place, America also is a

Citing the New World explorations of Portuguese, Spanish, French,
British and others, Clinton said, ``without the longing for a new

&HT;     `BIG MOMMA' IS HEAVY WITH STEREOTYPES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lest you make the same mistake I did: ``Big Momma's House'' is
not the name of the Shelley Winters comeback vehicle. Nor is it the
sequel to ``Soul Food'' (1997), although it co-stars Nia Long,
features a spread of good eats that strikes the mother lode of
fingerlickingoodness and provides ample time to get acquainted with
a plus-size woman. No, ``Big Momma's House'' is a high-spirited,
big-bottomed Polaroid of the comedian in a fat suit.
</P>
<P>
   The clown in question happens to be Martin Lawrence. So it's no
wonder that when his FBI agent goes undercover donning what we're
to believe is a homemade get-up, ``Big Momma's'' feels like a
slap-happy throwback to the salad days of Lawrence's Fox sitcom.
Ahh, the days when the ghost of Flip Wilson seemed to come over
Lawrence and inspire him to lose himself inside an variety pack of
African-American grotesques. Shanaynay would be Wilson's Geraldine.
And when ``Martin's'' Tichina Arnold shows up to have Lawrence's
Big Momma deliver her baby, it's a bit too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Also too close for comfort is the film's naive courtship of dumb
black stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence plays Malcolm, the agent trying to catch an escaped
robber and murderer named Trent (a dangerous Terrence Howard, who
appears to have strolled off the set of the new ``Shaft'' movie),
who is looking for the $20 million left in the possession of his
ex-girlfriend Sherry (Long). Expecting Sherry, who's on the lam
from her ex-con ex-man, to unwittingly lead the feds to her man,
they stake out the most remote place possible the California girl
could flee: the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm is sent to a small town in Georgia where Sherry will
probably look up Hattie Mae Pierce, a k a Big Momma (Ella
Mitchell), that neighborhood force with girth that merely indicates
the size of her love. Before Sherry even arrives, Hattie Mae leaves
town to care for an ill friend, and to keep Sherry around long
enough to lure Trent, Malcolm becomes Big Momma.
</P>
<P>
   He builds a fat suit and rubber masks, presumably using the
``M:I-2,'' at-home kit, with the help of his partner, John, played
by Paul Giamatti, whose hangdog face and gruffly congested manner
of speaking evoke an entire bygone era of black-and-white
television sitcoms. When the mayhem, which includes a rump-shake
with the real Big Momma to Rick James' ``Give It to Me, Baby,''
comes his way, Giamatti faces it like an exemplary good sport. If
he's on the receiving end of the shenanigans, Lawrence, of course,
is doing the giving.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Big Momma'' doesn't get turned out until the home stretch.
Before that, the film is just a vulgar-looking shot at ``Mrs.
Doubtfire.'' Though with Lawrence impersonating an ersatz domestic,
Momma often seems like an invocation of real dignified big mommas
like Esther Rolle and Mabel King.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about a man in a muumuu _ and it's not good.
The same can also be said for the costumes and makeup techniques
used on both Lawrence's Big Momma and Mitchell's. It usually looks
like an eclair went off on someone in a housecoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma'' is at its most unimpeachable when it just lets
Lawrence rip in the costume, which must be made of down. He goes
ballistic in a game of roughhouse. He gets his karate on in a
self-defense class. He brings down the tabernacle when he testifies
in church. He speaks in hip-hop terms, at some point using ``wobble
wobble'' to the delight of many a No Limit Records fan.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Raja Gosnell, a guy who showed a gift for
featherweight screwball last spring in ``Never Been Kissed.'' He's
clearly more content supervising one-man shows the way he did with
Drew Barrymore in that film and with Lawrence here, just grabbing
reaction shots to the implausible bits.
</P>
<P>
   But when is the last time anybody ever went to a Martin Lawrence
movie for the realism. Good God, you go to see him keep it real,
and he does. Even so, ``Big Momma'' plays like a lower-budget
warmup for Eddie Murphy's eminent ``Nutty Professor'' sequel, which
begs the question of whether summer is big enough for two black
comedians in obese drag?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Lawrence isn't the artist Murphy is. He's funny here only
because it's an exercise in breaking character. And to put it
politely, this is not a phatic movie, just big-boned.
</P>

<P>
   Editors, managing editors, wire editors:
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times will publish a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race
still ignites political debates _ over Civil War flags, for
example, or police profiling. But the wider public discussion of
race relations seems muted by a full-employment economy and by a
sense, particularly among many whites, that the time of large
social remedies is past. Race relations are being defined less by
political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports
arenas, in pop culture and at worship, and especially in the
workplace. These encounters _ relations in the most literal,
everyday sense _ make up this series of reports.
</P>
<P>
   The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a team of
Times reporters to capture some of the troubling issues that
Americans continue to face and the voices of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   These articles, two or three each week, are long, at 6,000 words
and up. They will move on the News Service wire a day or more in
advance of publication _ where possible _ and will carry a slug of
the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. In addition, the News Service will file
an abridged version of each article, approximately half the length
of the original. All of the articles will be accompanied by photos
for photo clients and be available for separate purchase by other
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief description of the first three articles.
</P>

   For release Sunday, June 4:

   RACE-CHURCH (Decatur, Ga.) _ Nearly 50 years after the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. scolded Christians for making 11 a.m. Sunday
the most segregated hour of the week, the Assembly of God
Tabernacle here is the rarest of religious institutions: a truly
integrated church in the heart of the South. And yet, the
Tabernacle is deeply conservative, socially and theologically. What
draws its members is the intensity of their Pentacostal faith,
which teaches that the Holy Spirit can move in the lives of all
believers, regardless of background. By Kevin Sack.

   RACE-IMMIGRANTS (Miami) _ Before they left Cuba for America in
1994 Joel Ruiz, who is black, and Achmed Valdes, who is white, were
the best of friends. Today, in Miami, the two men live only four
miles apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by
a far greater distance, one they say they never envisioned back in
Cuba. In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to
the white one, they have grown apart in the U.S. because of race.
For the first time, they inhabit a place where the color of their
skin defines the outlines of their lives _ where they live, the
friends they make, how they speak, what they wear, even what they
eat. By Mirta Ojito.
</P>
<P>
   For release Wednesday, June 7:
</P>
<P>
   RACE-MILITARY (Fort Knox, Ky.) _ On a chill December morning,
two soldiers _ one black, one white, both part of an institution
portrayed as a model of race relations _ stood only yards apart in
the middle of this sprawling base, each believing himself the
victim of racism; one because of an award, the other because of a
transfer. The Army is not supposed to harbor racial resentment
anymore. Its work force is integrated. The Army is one of the few
institutions in America in which blacks routinely boss around
whites, and supposedly no one gives it a second thought. But that
is an idealized image. The Pentagon has found that two-thirds of
its men and women had experienced a racially offensive encounter in
the previous 12 months. And those findings are more or less
mirrored here at Fort Knox. By Steven A. Holmes.

HOPES RISE FOR PALESTINIANS CAUGHT IN BORDER LIMBO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOHEIRA, Lebanon _ At the fence that marks the border with
Israel, two Palestinian sisters reached hands leathered by age
through coils of barbed wire and across decades of war and exile to
touch each other for the first time in 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   One sister was among thousands of Palestinian refugees in
Lebanon who crowded the border this week to see the land and the
families she left behind after Israel's triumph in the 1948 war.
Until Israel abruptly withdrew its troops and ended its occupation
in south Lebanon 10 days ago, the sisters had been unable to get
even this close for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   By the United Nations' count, there are 360,000 Palestinians in
Lebanon, and most still live in the squalor of refugee camps. For
more than a half century, they have been caught between Lebanon,
which does not want them, and Israel, which refuses to allow their
return.
</P>
<P>
   With the dramatic Israeli pullback from south Lebanon, hope for
Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homeland has been
rekindled. But so have fears that Palestinian frustrations will
reignite in the refugee camps and result in the kind of
Syrian-backed, cross-border attacks that first prompted the Jewish
state to invade Lebanon in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Up a steep cliff along the border fence, Miriam Mousa, 65, stood
on a narrow gravel strip Tuesday and came agonizingly close to her
sister, Dania, and other family members torn from her after she
fled her Palestinian village at the age of 13 during the 1948 war.
She ended up in Lebanon, but the rest of her family remained in the
former Palestine, most of which became the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was alone here for all this time. All my family was in
Palestine. Look. Look at them. This is my sister, this is my
brother,'' she said, wiping away tears. ``My God, I have been
praying to see them for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   She was among roughly 100 Palestinian refugees standing on the
Lebanon side of the fence while her family and about 100 other
Palestinians who live in what is now Israel gathered on the Israeli
side. All were shouting and some wept as they tried to find
relatives and friends separated during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The men shook hands and the women embraced through the
barbed-wire fence. Israeli soldiers eventually began separating
them, uncoiling a new roll of barbed wire to secure the border. But
the families continued shouting messages even as they were pushed
back from the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Itaf, the daughter of Rigan,'' an elderly woman yelled
from the Israeli side. ``Who are you? Do you know me?''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, there came a scream from the other side. It was a
cousin whom she had not seen since they were children.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did this happen to us?'' the elderly woman cried out.
</P>
<P>
   She turned away, crying and repeating the phrase: ``How did this
happen to us?''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's 22 years of occupation in south Lebanon kept the pair
from reuniting at the border. And for the 30 years before that,
Lebanon's restrictions on Palestinian refugees kept most
Palestinians from being able to travel to the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the border area open to them, the older Palestinians
stand heartbreakingly close to the land where they were born. And
for the younger generation, it is a first chance to see the land of
family lore.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of anger and yearning is powerfully felt in Ain el
Hilwe, the largest of 12 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. The
refugees in the teeming UN camp direct their anger not only at
Israel, but also at Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who they
say has not applied enough pressure on the issue of ``right of
return'' for refugees in the final phase of a six-year peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 3.5 million Palestinians registered as
refugees by the UN Relief and Works Agency. Most live along
Israel's borders in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. One-third, or about 1.2 million, still live in a
string of 59 ramshackle refugee camps in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our own leaders have forgotten us,'' said Abed Makdah, 56, who
said he was 4 years old when his family fled the village of El
Ghabbisiya near the coastal town of Akko and came to Lebanon, where
he lives in Ain el Hilwe.
</P>
<P>
   Makdah, secretary general of the camp's Popular Committee, a
form of self-rule, adds, ``They speak only of the refugees' right
of return in words, not deeds. Where do they think we are supposed
to go at the end of the peace process? Do they think we can just
disappear?''
</P>
<P>
   The heavily armed Palestinian factions in the refugee camps see
the Shiite Muslim militia's guerrilla war against Israeli
occupation as proof that military resistance is the only way to
achieve their goals. At a massive rally celebrating Israel's
pullout, Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Islamic Hezbollah
organization that fought the guerrilla war against Israeli troops,
encouraged the Palestinians to model fighting units on Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Such calls to arms by dozens of factions and splinter groups in
camps like Ain el Hilwe deeply trouble analysts here, who fear that
neighboring Syria, with 30,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, could
help arm the guerrillas in order to put pressure on Israel to
return the Golan Heights. Israel's negotiations with Syria broke
down six months ago, and Israel's proposals to withdraw from Golan,
which it captured from Syria in 1967, are considered to have been
shelved for the forseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Rearming the Palestinian militias is also a scenario that
troubles the Lebanese, many of whom believe that the Palestinian
fighters dragged their country into a 15-year civil war that killed
70,000 people by the time it ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have no civil rights in Lebanon. They live in the
camps, where unemployment soars up to 70 percent. Young people,
some of whom are fourth-generation refugees, know nothing but
despair and dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lebanon cannot keep the refugees for a set of reasons that are
both political and economic,'' said Simon Karam, Lebanon's
ambassador to Washington in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, keeping the refugees is impossible because
naturalizing them would do great harm to the demographic balance of
Muslims and Christians in Lebanon,'' he said. ``And economically,
it can't afford to shut down these refugee camps. Where would these
people be housed, where would they work? It is an untenable
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance to the teeming city of about 65,000 refugees who
live in the Ain el Heliwe refugee camp, a Palestinian teenager with
a machine gun was waiting to take a reporter to the ``colonel,'' a
longtime Palestinian resistance fighter named Mounir Moqdah.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the maze of litter-strewn alleys of the camp, the young
man ducked into a small metal door that led to a courtyard where
Moqdah, a fugitive from Lebanese and Israeli intelligence agencies,
has his headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded, 40-year-old, self-proclaimed ``colonel'' of Fatah,
the largest political faction within the Palestine Liberation
Organization, was dressed in a camouflage uniform and leather
sandals, lounging on a couch. A rocket-propelled antitank grenade
launcher rested against a wall mural of the Jerusalem skyline and
the Muslim shrine of the Dome of the Rock mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis only understand force,'' he said, blowing smoke
from a Rothman cigarette. ``We will have to force them to comply
with UN Resolution 194, just as they were forced to comply with
425.''
</P>
<P>
   UN Resolution 194 granted the right of return and compensation
to Palestinian refugees who fled or were forced to flee during the
1948 war. UN Resolution 425, passed in 1978, demanded that the
Israeli military completely withdraw from Lebanon. The UN is
expected this week to make its determination that Israel has
complied with the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah's victory has shown us that these long, drawn-out
negotiations are not what works,'' Moqdah said.

&HT;     DOCUMENTARY FOCUSES ON ROMANY CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a girl living in Britain, filmmaker Jasmine Dellal was told
that if she misbehaved, Gypsies would take her away. Haunted, in
part, by that bizarre attempt to straighten her out, Dellal set out
to shoot a documentary about Gypsy _ or, more correctly, Romany _
culture.
</P>
<P>
   She made telephone calls all over the United States looking for
Gypsy immigrants to share with her details about their heritage for
her film. Jimmy Marks was the only man who called back, telling her
a story ripe for a movie.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how the result, ``American Gypsy: A Stranger in
Everybody's Land,'' manages to be something more than self
indulgent, you'd have to meet Marks first. He is a rotund
loudmouth, running a used-car business in Spokane, Wash. Then you'd
have to meet his kin, a warm, volatile extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Marks entered the public eye after he went on campaign to clear
his family's _ and by extension, his people's _ name after the
police descended upon his home 10 years ago looking to confiscate
what they wrongly believed was a slew of stolen property. He
returned Dellal's call, presumably to try, after a insidiously
judgmental piece on ``Eye to Eye,'' the defunct Connie Chung news
mag, to find a more sympathetic eye. And unquestionably, Dellal's
is it.
</P>
<P>
   After a cursory, but enlightening overview of Romany life,
Dellal shows her five-year immersion in the substantial Marks
household, practically disappearing into the ruins of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Her many months with the Markses are distilled into 80 fraught
minutes, and what must have been hours of Jimmy talking to her
answering machine form a journal that provides the film with the
hearty relationship at the film's core. The salesman in him lies to
her. She calls him on it. For her, Marks completes a perfect,
eloquent circle: Maybe a Gypsy walked off with a little piece of
her soul.

MISSILE PLAN IS CALLED UNLIKELY IN CLINTON TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Technical problems and political opposition make it
unlikely that President Clinton will decide on a national defense
system before his term expires, US officials and defense analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Even inside the Pentagon, which is overseeing the tests,
ballistic-missile specialists have expressed strong doubts in
meetings that they will have enough information to recommend
whether a system is technologically feasible, two senior Defense
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and top Pentagon officials had vowed to decide late this
summer whether to start building a national missile defense, a
costly and controversial system that would theoretically safeguard
the United States against a limited attack by long-range ballistic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to Moscow this weekend, Clinton will try to
sell the idea of a US missile shield to Russian President Vladimir
V. Putin, who has objected to any such broad defense because it
could further shift the balance of power away from Russia as well
as break the terms of the countries' key nuclear arms treaty.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin continues to voice strong objections, say
administration officials, Clinton could very well eventually decide
that is reason enough not to proceed now.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton were to persuade Putin to renegotiate the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty _ which White House aides admit is
unlikely _ he would face a growing array of obstacles back home.
Many legislators, both Democrats and Republicans, have threatened
in recent weeks to reject the Clinton plan, variously calling it
too far-reaching or too narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Two former Clinton aides, Deputy Defense secretaries John Deutch
and John P. White, are now criticizing the administration plan as
diplomatically unwise, in an article to be published next week in
Foreign Policy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, prominent scientists are increasingly
skeptical that the technology for such a system is ready to move to
the next phase, in which the military would begin building a
missile defense center in Alaska. One senior Pentagon official said
Thursday the project's viability still ``looks very iffy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has little evidence to the contrary: Of
the two missile tests it has conducted, only one successfully
intercepted a decoy in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   A third test, which was supposed to take place this spring and
could have bolstered the Defense Department's case, has been
postponed at least twice because of technical problems. Now
scheduled for the first week in July, the test may not satisfy
military officials even if it succeeds. According to the Pentagon
official, ``the feeling is there isn't enough time to make a good
recommendation'' to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And many in the nuclear weapons control community _ both doves
and hawks _ agree. ``What you now have is the increasing likelihood
that the decision won't be this year,'' said Joseph Cirincione,
director of the non-proliferation project at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace. ``Political doubts are rising. I wouldn't say they're
determinate yet, but they are on the rise. The winds have shifted
on missile defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, nothing has changed. Clinton, in both public and
private, has said he still plans to make a determination before his
term ends next January, and he is proceeding apace. He spent the
last few days trying to soothe fears of European leaders who worry
that a US missile system might prompt a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen expects to make his
recommendation to the White House in August, when he hopes the
``technology has matured to the point'' where he could comfortably
advise the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't reached that point yet,'' Cohen said in an interview
Thursday. ``That's why I'm going to be looking very carefully at
the next test. I still have to take into account, not only the
technology, but the implications for the arms control
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But timing alone is raising doubts about reaching a decision
soon. Only a 10-day window exists in July for the military to
conduct the tests, in which an interceptor rocket is launched from
a test facility in the Pacific Ocean and tries to intercept a dummy
warhead mid-air. After July 10, the Pentagon cannot start up again
until mid-August, because of environmental agreements. Any further
delay could push Cohen's review back as far as September, forcing
Clinton to make an announcement in the heat of the presidential
campaign, muddying the project with politics further still.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are plenty of critics who already see Clinton's
determination as wholly political. Many Democrats believe he
pursued the missile-defense project simply to steal the issue from
Republicans (``a classic Clintonian triangulation,'' said one
missile specialist).
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, on the other hand, say he is pretending to
favor the missile shield to help Vice President Al Gore, but that
Clinton never intended to implement the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an administration that hasn't wanted anything to do
with missile defense from the day it took office. . . And they
certainly don't have any intention of having a missile defense
before Clinton leaves,'' said Frank Gaffney, director of the
conservative Center for Security Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by all appearances, the decision may be largely out of
Clinton's hands. Even though there is tremendous political will to
build a US missile defense of some sort, there appears to be
virtually none for getting it done according to Clinton
administration plans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton can give his blessing to the project at any
time, setting in motion the building of the Alaska site sometime
next year, he has virtually no support in Congress, where any
alterations to the 1972 ABM treaty would have to be ratified.
Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the
Foreign Relations Committee, has already promised to reject any
Clinton treaty deal.
</P>
<P>
   And although Clinton could proceed singlehandedly, with neither
the backing of Congress nor an ABM agreement with Russia, George
Shultz, a former US secretary of state and an adviser to Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush, offered this cautionary
note: ``I don't think he could make an effective decision. . .
because in order to spend money, you have to get it authorized and
appropriated.''
</P>
<P>
   In this election year, more than two dozen Republican senators
have said they would rather wait to approve an ABM treaty
alteration until after November, in the hope that a Republican
committed to a more robust missile defense would win the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, meanwhile, are fearful of any steps that would
undermine the ABM treaty. Others, such as Senator John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, have expressed concerns about the technology, and
hope the administration would consider other proposals _ such as
one that intercepts enemy rockets when they are launched, instead
of as they near their targets _ before carving the current one into
stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that few people consider this the optimum approach,''
said former Defense Secretary Harold Brown, who worked in the
Carter administration. ``It really strikes most people, I think, as
a compromise that will satisfy neither the arms controllers nor the
defense hawkers. Now clearly, the Pentagon is at least going along,
and the State Department is going along. But I doubt this is the
preferred solution of anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Brown added: ``That is often the case in the US
government.''

BAN THOSE BLOODY FLIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Million Mom Marchers want something concrete to do, I
have a suggestion. Get airlines to ban gun movies.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, I wrote about how one of my sons, then 9, and I
were subjected on a Sunday morning Northwest Airlines flight to
``True Lies,'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Northwest's idea of
family entertainment was seeing 85 people killed or wounded, many
with visible bullet holes and blood.
</P>
<P>
   Little has changed. In March I flew American Airlines from San
Juan to Boston. The route is often packed with children. The movie
was the James Bond thriller, ``The World is Not Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   This movie had a PG-13 rating. A quarter of the movie, 42
minutes, was devoted to scenes of deadly mayhem in which the gun is
the star and corpses are the supporting cast. Since James Bond has
two separate body counts, one for his copulations and one for his
corpses, Bond's allotted time to rack up corpses is not the same as
Schwarzenegger's. Still, Bond is quite a terminator in his own
right. By the time the movie was over, there were between 30 and 35
people killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The movie opens with three bad guys shot (one with a visible
bullet hole) or knifed to death. In the next violent scene, a man
is blown up by a bomb. A female assassin fails to kill Bond with
machine gun fire, then commits suicide by blowing up her hot air
balloon. Four assassins on snowmobiles not only fail to get Bond,
they crash and explode. Then Bond kills someone and throws him into
a garbage hopper.
</P>
<P>
   When he is not actually killing people, Bond negotiates with the
forces of evil by sticking guns in the backs of henchmen or
thrusting the barrel at their heads. Of all the killings, none was
more sick than when Bond shoots at point-blank range the villainess
with whom he had sex earlier in the film.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of violence and misogyny is not only twisted in its
own right, it shows how numb America is to guns compared to other
outrages. A few weeks after that flight, our family went to see
``Erin Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, we did not know whether to take our other son, now 9,
with us. The movie was rated R. As it turned out, ``Erin
Brockovich,'' a movie about a nearly destitute heroine who fights
against corporate greed, was rated R because of Brockovich's
profanity, words you can hear at Fenway Park. Deciding the message
was more important than some of the words from the messenger, we
took our son and had no second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, many children, especially girls, have missed out on
``Erin Brockovich'' because parents were scared off by the R rating
(there was only one other child in the theater the Friday evening
we went). But it apparently is just fine to subject children and
teens on an airplane to two hours of gun glorification, dead
bodies, and disposable sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   When ``The World is Not Enough'' opened last November, it was
No. 1 its first weekend, grossing $37.2 million. It was the best
opening in the history of MGM. It currently is at the top of the
home video charts.
</P>
<P>
   A huge reason for the movie's success was the PG-13 rating,
which, unlike R-rated films, allows adolescents to go without their
parents. The PG-13, instead of R, allowed MGM to heavily advertise
the Bond movie on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there ever was a statement on the strength of PG-13, it is
this movie,'' said Larry Gleason, the president of worldwide
distribution for MGM. ``Sixty percent of our male audience was
under 25. We are getting a very young audience. (They) have to be
credited for our increased business.''
</P>
<P>
   What people do for the personal entertainment is their business.
But this is also the post-Columbine age where we are urgently
telling children not to solve their problems _ as Bond does _ with
guns. We are suspending children in schools for even making the
motion of a gun with their fingers. Thus, the glorification of
guns, with the attendant blood splatter and perforated bodies,
should no longer be allowed in airplanes, where people have to
endure the visual carnage whether or not they choose to wear
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence to suggest that if people do not want these
kind of movies on flights, they do not have to have them. A few
months ago United Airlines dumped ``The General's Daughter'' after
customer complaints (it was rated R due to a graphic images
relating to sexual violence, including rape).
</P>
<P>
   That is a beginning. Much of last month's Million Mom March
rightfully focused on political pressure for gun restrictions. Just
as important is the cultural war, persuading Hollywood that guns
can no longer be thrust at the viewer's head. If we can create
smoke-free flights, we can work toward gun-free flights. American
Airlines obviously thought it was fine to show ``The World is Not
Enough.'' The message it should be hearing is ``enough is enough.''

WHEN AT WORK, IT MAKES SENSE TO ... WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Recently, my company installed Websense. Now,
whenever I go to a site that is not work-related, I get a message
saying, ``Access to the desired Web page is not permitted.'' So, is
there any way around this?
</P>
<P>
   _ Senseless
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SENSELESS: I suppose you could go to work for some company
that actually trusts its employees not to spend all day booking
flights or downloading pictures of Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   Websense is a commercial package that monitors what employees
are doing on the Internet and blocks certain activity. There are
only two reasons why a company would install it: Either the boss is
a killjoy and doesn't want you to have any fun, or there's been
some sort of abuse of Internet privileges.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe Websense's advertising, during a regular workday,
70 percent of all Internet porn traffic occurs, 30 percent to 40
percent of surfing is non-business-related and 60 percent of online
purchases are made.
</P>
<P>
   So, no, I'm not going to tell you how to beat Websense. You can
play when you're not at work.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did I mention that Websense logs all your attempts to get to
those off-limits sites? Think about that the next time the boss
calls you in for your performance review.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: How do you type those Spanish letters like the
letter ``n'' with the tilde on top or the upside-down question
mark?
</P>
<P>
   _ Multilingual
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MULTI: It really depends on the word processor you use. In
DOS, you've got more than 200 characters available to you.
Obviously, that's a lot more than can fit on the standard English
keyboard, so programmers came up with a way to insert special
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, that involves pressing Alt and Shift while keying in
a character's value on the numeric keypad. For instance, that ``n''
with a tilde is 164 and the Spanish question mark is 168. Find
yourself an ASCII chart to get the rest. And don't worry about what
``ASCII'' stands for. You've got enough to worry about already.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a Windows word processor, there are even more
special characters available. Most of the programs have some sort
of ``insert'' function that let you pick the character from an
on-screen chart. Good programs even have shortcut keys, although
they tend to be real finger-benders. In Word, for example, that
tilde thing is done by first pressing Control, Shift and the tilde
key simultaneously, then pressing the ``n'' key. The question mark
is done with Alt, Control, Shift and ? all at once. It takes some
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever program you have, all the info you need is tucked
somewhere deep within its help file.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is it possible to put Windows 95 on my
computer? It's an IBM PS/1 (486SX, 50-megabyte hard drive, four
megabytes of memory).
</P>
<P>
   _ Upgrader:
</P>
<P>
   DEAR UPGRADER: Well, I suppose anything is possible, as long as
you don't mind having a computer that has no storage space left and
runs slower than my two-buck Rolex knockoff.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Microsoft says you meet the minimum requirements,
here in the real world you need at least 16 megabytes of memory _
no, make that 32 _ and at least 55 megabytes of disk space. Unless
you want to do a major upgrade on a relatively obsolete machine,
avoid the headache.
</P>
<P>

all of his components need to be replaced. Write him at

REAL ESTATE RIFT SPILLS OVER INTO RELIGION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is true, as historian Eugene Taylor says, that any educated
man or woman of the 19th century knew the teachings of Emanuel
Swedenborg. The Swedish mystic profoundly influenced Henry Thoreau,
Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the James gang: father Henry Sr., and his
two sons, Henry, the novelist, and William, the
philosopher/psychologist. Helen Keller's book ``My Religion''
describes her commitment to Swedenborgianism. In his history of
spirituality in America, ``Shadow Culture,'' Taylor calls
Swedenborg ``one of the most widely read authors of the nineteenth
century in American popular culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedenborg never intended to found a religion. Nonetheless, the
Church of the New Jerusalem sprang up over 200 years ago and took
root in North America. The General Convention, with about 2,000
members, is headquartered in Newton (a larger, rival denomination
works out of Philadelphia). Although its communicants, like
Swedenborg, may have found peace in the natural universe, they have
not found peace among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started about a year ago when the Convention's only
seminary, the Swedenborgian School of Religion, tried to sell its
church on Quincy Street, smack in the middle of the Harvard
University campus. It is possibly the most beautiful piece of real
estate in the city, and the pocket-size Gothic church is famous
throughout Cambridge, Mass., for its well-attended Christmas
candlelight services. When the SSR tried to sell the parcel out
from under the 50-member congregation, to a developer who planned
to build an 11-story office building there _ all hell broke loose.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation filed a restraining order against the sale, and
quickly convinced the Cambridge Historical Commission to grant the
building landmark status. That put the kibosh on the office deal.
Then a judge ordered the two parties to mediate their differences,
but this hasn't worked out. The congregation has offered $630,000
for the plot. The SSR wants $2 million. It is possible that church
members may iron out their differences at this month's annual
meeting in Illinois, but no one is counting on it. ``Their attorney
is pressing for a trial,'' says Cambridge church president
Lars-Erik Wiberg.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the school is planning to leave the Boston area
altogether. Earlier this year, it sold its small Newton campus for
$2.7 million, and is hoping to merge its program with the
University of California,Berkeley's Pacific School of Religion.
``We're so small that we need to be part of a larger seminary,''
says school chair Jane Siebert. ``We're changing our philosophy
from tying up our money in buildings to putting it to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Pshaw! says historian Taylor, who is a member of the Cambridge
congregation. In a lengthy and spirited ``Open Letter to
Swedenborgians'' written earlier this year, he charges that the
school has been hijacked by non-Swedenborgians ``advocating a mail
order church devoted to New Age teachings . . . (and) the
perception of Swedenborgianism as a cult is being reinforced by the
constant comparison of Swedenborg's ideas to the New Age.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the SSR will soon offer its first course on its
Web site (swedenborg.org), but generally speaking, Siebert _
herself a church member in Kansas _ calls Taylor's charges ``off
the wall.'' In a lengthy rebuttal, she says the school ``has been
trying to work out an equitable arrangement with the Cambridge
Society for over 10 years,'' so far in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Subscription toothbrush
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I am obsessed with dental hygiene, which is why I keep some
rather handsome digital X-rays on permanent display on my office
door. So it was only natural that Somerville-based Recycline Inc.
would ask me to hype their recyclable, subscription toothbrush.
</P>
<P>
   I like the idea. Remember how your dentist is always telling you
to buy a new toothbrush, because the old one is worn out and full
of grot? For $17.50 a year, Recycline will send you a spanking new
Preserve toothbrush (eight colors, three textures to choose from!)
every three months. You toss your old brush into their prepaid
mailer, and they will recycle it. ``The used Preserves make an
excellent source material for recycled plastic lumber which is
great for outdoor products such as park benches and porch decks,''
says company president Eric Hudson, without apparent irony.
</P>
<P>
   But. The backward-sloping brush handle is curved like a sickle
blade, with the bristles facing outward. This is to facilitate the
so-called ``Bass technique'' of brushing, named for a Bay State
dentist, which aligns the brush at a 45-degree angle to the gums.
But I have some recession and inflammation on some lower, inside
gums (lingual 27 and 28, for those of you following at home) and
this brush can't reach them! Hudson sent me an e-mail trying to
help, to no avail. I've gone back to my grotty old Colgate Total.
</P>
<P>

A BOOST FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Franklin Raines came east from Seattle as a teenage Harvard
freshman, he navigated around Boston on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   When he came back to the law school, he had a car. But he tried
to drive routes he had learned on the subway _ heading into Park
Street before taking a left or a right _ big mistake. Wednesday
morning he didn't have to drive himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was driven through Roxbury and Mission Hill in a big black
van filled with people who work for him, the chairman-CEO of the
world's largest financial company that isn't a bank _ Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the nation's prime money men _ Raines ran the federal
budget for President Clinton as head of Office of Management and
Budget _ and now as boss of Fannie Mae, Raines literally moves
billions with a flick of a finger.
</P>
<P>
   He rode past Mission Main, a new low-rise development springing
up behind the Mission Church, with 535 new apartments up or coming,
thanks to $20 million from Raines. There are similar stories behind
Orchard Commons (76 units), Urban Edge (200), and Academy Homes I
(202).
</P>
<P>
   Alighting at Faneuil Hall for a ceremony that drew Senator
Edward Kennedy, US Representatives Joseph Moakley and Michael
Capuano, and Mayor Thomas Menino, Raines announced a new $15
billion expansion of a plan to put 115,000 more Massachusetts
families in affordable homes or rental units.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae has financed housing for 35,000 families in Boston
over the past five years with $1.7 billion from the outfit that
guarantees or otherwise makes happen one-fourth of all the home
mortages in the United States. With 4,000 employees and 365,000
shareholders (FNM on the New York Stock Exchange), Fannie Mae buys
mortgage bundles from lenders and issues securities to guarantee
the financial underpinning of more than 11 million mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stage at Faneuil Hall, on boards trod by ``patriots,
abolitionists, suffragists,'' Raines linked the principle of home
ownership to those other epochal causes. He challenged
Massachusetts, home of the first public school, university, public
library, and the computer, to set the standard for home ownership
and the family stability it confers: ``Our goal is to make
Massachusetts first in the nation in home ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking up the challenge, Kennedy said that for all of its
leadership in high-tech, medicine, education, and financial
services, ``Boston will not be Boston unless we have affordable
housing.'' Moakley ticked off the infrastructure improvements _
federal courthouse, Big Dig, convention center, harbor cleanup _
then placed affordable housing as the newest target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said for years that people form their world view by
looking out their kitchen window,'' said Moakley. And he wants more
kitchens, more windows.
</P>
<P>
   Menino put his stamp of approval on affordable housing as the
single most important need here. ``Housing is probably the No. 1
issue in our city,'' he told the 150 bankers, developers, and
housing advocates. Boston had more than 2,000 housing starts last
year, not bad for a city of less than 600,000 population, but ``we
don't want Boston to be a city only of the very rich and the very
poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino said the Fannie Mae mortgage aid rollout means ``other
cities and towns across the state can start building their share of
affordable housing. We'll show you how to do it _ maybe you don't
want to do it _ but we'll show you how.''
</P>
<P>
   Capuano hailed bankers such as Larry Fish of Citizens Bank for
``not looking to make a hit'' on every housing initiative. And
without Fannie Mae's muscle, said the rookie congressman from
Somerville, ``then virtually no project in the Boston area would
have been built.''
</P>
<P>
   Capuano complained that ``a lot of people in Washington don't
know what a three-decker is.'' He added, ``I live in a two-family;
my brother lives in a three-family; my mother's in senior housing _
anybody who gets in the way of affordable housing will be run
over!''
</P>
<P>
   Fish emphasized his bank's commitment to underserved markets.
Citizens and Fleet are major partners of Fannie Mae. Dick DeWolfe,
a realtor and developer, pointed to the gap ``between the haves and
have-nots'' in housing.
</P>
<P>
   Noting political declarations of war on drugs, war on crime, war
on poverty, DeWolfe said that all those efforts targeted inner
cities. ``We need to declare peace, not war,'' he said, and peace
for a family comes through home ownership, stability, neighborhood.
``Home ownership is the defining difference in America,'' he said,
and no one seemed to disagree.

`SEX AND THE CITY' IS BACK WITH WIT AND POIGNANCY

   SEX AND THE CITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Catrall, Kristin Davis,
Cynthia Nixon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On: HBO &QL;

<P>
   Time: Sunday at 9 &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``Sex and the City'' is one of the few half-hour comedies
on TV that wasn't assembled at the punch-line factory.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than an incessant series of one-off jokes, punctuated by
the tin hysterics of a laugh track, it deals in the larger comic
ironies of single life and the quirky redemptions of friendship
among women. Sure, the ``Sex'' scripts can be laugh-out-loud funny,
as they pursue ripe topics like ``dating feng shui'' or as they
uncover the sexual fetishes of an army of Barney's-wearing
bachelors. But the show is also a more bittersweet study of
romantic yearning and straight female identity. One of the savviest
and sauciest comedies on TV right now, it returns for its third
season Sunday night at 9.

   As with ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and ``Seinfeld,'' the best part of
``Sex and the City'' is its four delightfully drawn characters _
five, if you include Manhattan. After a promising first season, the
series came into its own last year by turning the women into more
than just fashion-plate vehicles for sexual puns and dirty talk.
Charlotte (Kristin Davis), naive on the surface, turned out to be a
shark prowling cocktail parties for a wealthy man with a
circumcised penis. Brainy redhead Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) wanted to
fall in love, but her terror at the thought of losing
self-sufficiency always kept her at arm's length from her
boyfriends. Samantha (Kim Cattrall), with her tiger prints and her
fabulous beauty mark, was forever looking for sex, more sex, and
sex with men who have money, despite our persistent wish that she
would aim higher. And Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), the
chain-smoking journalist whose column forms the focus of the show,
became a sweet amalgamation of her three buddies _ searching for a
balance of security, independence, and uncomplicated sex. Her near
miss last year with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), which was steeped in
``The Way We Were'' allusions, was heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   This season opens with the four women resuming their mating
games aboard a ferry to Staten Island, where Carrie will judge men
for inclusion in a fire department calendar. It doesn't take long
to guess that water-hose quips will ensue and that Samantha will
make it with one of the firefighters. But, typical of the series,
the episode veers into a deeper, more provocative query about
Charlotte's hungover realization: ``Women really want to be
rescued.'' Do they? It's not the show's tightest half-hour, but by
next week ``Sex and the City'' is back in full force as Carrie, now
dating a politician, wonders, ``Can there be sex without
politics?''
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers have been offended by the show's bawdiness, and
others have frowned on the women's obsession with men. Like Elaine
Benes on ``Seinfeld,'' the ``Sex and the City'' women are
tough-minded and professionally empowered, but they are nonetheless
fixated on finding a member of the opposite sex to make them happy.
I can't say whether they should be looking elsewhere for the
meaning of life, just as I wouldn't want to warn Carrie about her
fashion sense, which, next week, brings her to ``a spin on Jackie
Kennedy, the early years.'' But until they turn their attentions to
trout fishing, or game shows, I will watch them, amused, touched,
cynical, and hopeful.

`BIG MOMMA'S' PACKS THE LATEX LAUGHS

<P>
   BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by: Raja Gosnell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Screenplay by: Darryl Quarles &AMP; Don Rhymer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Martin Lawrence, Nia Long, Paul Giamatti, Jascha
Washington, Terrence Howard, Anthony Anderson, Ella Mitchell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 98 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rated: PG-13 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's shaping up as a body-latex kind of summer. Next month Eddie
Murphy will return as the entire overstuffed Klump family in
``Nutty Professor II.'' Meanwhile, Martin Lawrence has beaten
Murphy to the fat suit in ``Big Momma's House.'' To the question of
whether ``Big Momma's House'' is a good film, the answer is that
it's good enough. It keeps its promise to throw an hour and a half
of lively entertainment at audiences. It's never slowed down by its
pseudo-poundage, and it manages a level of warmth that most of the
summer's other manufactures won't likely match.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence stars as an FBI agent and master of disguise, a talent
established in a prologue that shows him as an Asian man pretending
to be a bettor inside an illegal dogfight haven. His next
assignment sends him into silicone overdrive. When he and his nerdy
partner (Paul Giamatti) are sent to stake out a rural Georgia house
to nab a vicious escaped bank robber and his girlfriend, a single
mom played by Nia Long, Lawrence has to suit up fast when the
girlfriend's grandmother is called away to care for a sick friend.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bank robber's terrified ex-girlfriend hasn't seen
her grandmother for years, the agent is able to pull the latex over
her eyes and pass himself off as the corpulent septuagenarian, even
when his kitchen technique gives rise to a cloud of suspicion, not
to mention a cloud of smoke, when he tries to heat up a pork chop
in a sea of lard. Underneath all the rubber, his heart starts
beating faster as he predictably falls for the lovely woman he'd
like to believe is innocent and starts wooing whenever he can slip
out of the fat suit undetected.
</P>
<P>
   The plot line is pretty predictable, and so are the
complications. As the romance deepens, the young woman thinks she's
renewing what had been an estranged relationship with her
no-nonsense grandmother. Her young son sentimentally begins to bond
with the new guy in her mom's life and with the figure he thinks is
his grandmother, especially when he/she walks the boy back to a
playground where he had been humiliated and teaches his tormentors
a lesson. And of course we also know that the bank robber is going
to appear sooner or later, gun in hand, to say nothing of the real
Big Momma.
</P>
<P>
   Barely skirting offensiveness with its stereotypes, the film is
politically incorrect on a few counts. But the comedy and the sunny
tone sell it. ``Big Momma's House'' is action-packed without being
truly wild. It even puts a lid on its flatulence jokes. Actually,
it's more of a successful juggling act than it may seem, given its
prefab nature. More than a few movies have been sucked into their
own body makeup as if by quicksand. But farcical adroitness and
Martin's ablity to turn on the charm keep ``Big Momma's House''
perking along. It'll keep more than a few seats warm at the
multiplexes until the next blockbuster comes along.

TRIMMING FIVE LITTLE WORDS MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While declarations against homosexuality and women as pastors
have gotten the headlines, other expected changes in a Baptist
statement of faith are causing more of a furor among some members
of the giant denomination.
</P>
<P>
   For example, no explicit mention is made of the bedrock Baptist
tenet of ``the priesthood of the believer'' in the revised Baptist
Faith and Message Statement expected to be adopted this month at
the Southern Baptist Convention in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Revisers of the statement removed the words ``Baptists emphasize
the soul's competency before God, freedom in religion and the
priesthood of the believer'' from the document's preamble.
</P>
<P>
   It is a shocking omission.
</P>
<P>
   The individualistic principle that every Baptist is his or her
own ``priest'' goes back to 17th-century England when dissenters _
forerunners of modern Baptists _ risked prison and death by
rejecting the established church's practice of infant baptism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priesthood of the believer'' is a dangerous concept. It
means Baptists are competent through their own souls to decide
matters of faith for themselves without going through a priest or
pastor.
</P>
<P>
   The ``priesthood of the believer'' stance was adopted by Roger
Williams, who founded the first Baptist Church in America in
Providence, R.I., in 1639.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Baptists can believe anything they want. They
are bound by certain basic doctrines _ like the virgin birth of
Jesus, his sacrificial death on the cross to redeem sinners and his
bodily resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   But after much prayer and Bible study, all Baptists are supposed
to be free to decide for themselves _ based on their own
consciences _ most matters of faith. What's hazardous about that is
that it leaves a lot of room for disagreement. For example, women
who believe God has called them to be pastors might go against the
views of the denomination's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative committee members who revised the document issued a
news release this week declaring that the concept of the priesthood
of the believer is a ``cherished principle'' and is assured in
other sections of the faith document. It is included, they say, in
the sixth article of the report which says ``each member is
responsible and accountable to Christ as Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   But taking out any explicit reference to the priesthood of the
believer is pretty extreme. Even some conservatives might insist
that it be put back in.
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, though.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Baptist conservatives who took control of the nation's
largest Protestant group in the 1980s seem a little nervous about
the priesthood of the believer concept, even though they voice
support for it.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives believe some fellow Baptists have
misinterpreted the idea to mean that people may interpret the Bible
in any way they like.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives believed moderates, who formerly controlled the
15.7 million-member denomination, were drifting toward a liberal
interpretation of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   When conservatives gained power, they insisted that their
seminary presidents and professors affirm a more literal and
historical interpretation of the Scriptures. Also, some
conservative seminary presidents reject faculty who believe that
women should be allowed to serve as pastors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Baptist Faith and Message Statement _ first adopted
in 1925 _ is supposed to be used as a guideline and not as a creed,
it has teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty at all six Southern Baptist seminaries, including
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, are
required to affirm the Baptist Faith and Message Statement.
</P>
<P>
   When a controversial phrase was added to the faith statement in
1998 saying wives should submit to the servant leadership of their
husbands, some Southwestern Seminary professors refused to sign it
and left their teaching positions.
</P>
<P>
   With new changes coming up in the Baptist document, seminary
professors who disagree will have another hard decision to make.
And if they exert that old-time ``priesthood of the believer''
principle, they might be fired.

`8 1/2' ISN'T ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; 8 1/2 WOMEN &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Written and directed by: Peter Greenaway &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Starring: Polly Walker, Amanda Plummer, Toni Collette, Vivian Wu,
John Standing, Matthew Delamere, Shizuka Inoh, Barbara Sarafian,
Kirina Mano, Natacha Amal, Manna Fujiwara &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Running time: 120 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rated: Unrated &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The earth moves for Peter Greenaway in his new film, ``8 1/2
Women.'' How many others it will move for is seriously open to
question.
</P>
<P>
   As its title implies, the new film is indebted to Fellini's ``8
1/2,'' but the late Italian director liked women and was a little
afraid of them. Greenaway seems only afraid of them. Fellini's
films worked because his alter ego, Marcello Mastroianni, enjoyed
playing weakness and confusion when confronted with this or that
fantasized harem. With Greenaway, the harem situation is more
problematical. It arises when a Swiss banker played by John
Standing finds himself widowed, calls his grown son in Japan and,
bereft, goes about purging his grief.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding to thumb their noses at death with a burst of shared
lust, they assemble a harem of consenting women, some brought back
from Osaka, in the family's Geneva mansion. Father and son take
turns bedding the women, or most of them. In Osaka, they experience
a few real earthquakes. Back in Geneva, the earthquakes are
figurative, jolting their egos. The reason, predictably, is that
they had fleetingly thought themselves in control. But of course
they learn they're not.
</P>
<P>
   Eight times over, they find themselves no more in charge of
their respective fates than the steel pachinko balls cascading
through the popular Japanese pinball-like machines in a chain of
arcades the banker owns.
</P>
<P>
   The pachinko addiction of one woman puts her in hock to the
banker and has led to her installment in the upmarket bordello,
which in any case is stuffed not with real women but with
stereotypical male fantasy projections. The Scandinavian nun (Toni
Collette), the adoring servant (Barbara Sarafian), the Madame
Butterfly figure (Kirina Mano), the pregnant woman (Natacha Amal),
the woman who not only loves to ride her horse but loves the horse
(Amanda Plummer), and a prostitute with the proverbial heart of
gold (Polly Walker) eager to play earth mother to the aging banker,
mark the film as an old man's dream world, dragged from the dusty
shelves of the most venerable of Soho sex shops.
</P>
<P>
   Standing has panache to go with his plummy voice, and he turns
``8 1/2 Women'' into Greenaway's most warm-blooded film, but he has
his work cut out for him, especially once the seraglio situation is
set up. At first, there's an interesting tension between wit and
uncertainty. Once the pieces are in place, however, Greenaway
starts spinning his wheels. The ensuing irony and turnabouts, and
sexual politics aren't enough to conceal the fact that the film
seems to decline into a series of noodlings and doodlings, many of
which recycle previous Greenaway preoccupations with nudity,
numbers, human destruction, and his favorite standby, architecture.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the exterior and interior shots of the banker's
Swiss mansion seem more lovingly photographed than the women. As
mere projections of male fantasies, they have little dimension or
character. They simply become soft sculpture, artfully arranged. As
usual, Greenaway deploys tableaux in lieu of narrative, but this
time they don't have the associative zing they had in ``Drowning by
Numbers'' or even ``The Pillow Book,'' which was a much more
densely and intriguingly loaded screenful of collisions between
East and West. (Vivian Wu, who plays a repressed secretary here,
starred in the earlier film.) There just isn't enough subterranean
energy in ``8 1/2 Women,'' libidinous or otherwise. The problem
with ``8 1/2 Women'' isn't that what you see is what you get; it's
that what you see is all you get.

 &HT;    Even in death, `El Rey' will keep audiences dancing
 &HT;    By Michael Point
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He really wanted to be a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   He had to settle for being ``King of the Mambo.'' For a half
century Tito Puente, who died Wednesday at age 77, personified the
universal appeal of Latin jazz in its vast and varied dance-music
disguises. His cunningly crafted tunes and stylish showmanship
repeatedly ushered in new music crazes that reconfigured popular
entertainment. The timeless nature of those creations keeps them in
circulation today, as telling a tribute as any to a musician whose
exuberant embrace of his own culture expanded the parameters of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Puente didn't intend to be ``El Rey'' of the bandstand. He would
have preferred to have been on the dance floor practicing Fred
Astaire moves, but an ankle injury curtailed that career plan. So,
he decided to be the one who puts the dancers in motion. His
success in doing so spanned generations and cultures, uniting all
in joyous service to rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   The celebratory physicality of Puente's supple music meant it
was best experienced live. But Puente was, nevertheless,
prodigiously prolific in the recording studio. When his 100th album
was released in 1991, he undermined the promotional campaign by
stating it was no big thing; he could almost make them in his
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   He probably could have, but his approach to making music,
whether in the studio or on stage, was neither casual nor
unschooled. Puente, who studied composing and orchestration at
Juilliard, worked diligently to keep his sound fresh and
unexpected, while retaining its traditional roots. He incorporated
ideas from the big bands of Tommy Dorsey and Count Basie and kept
his ears open for what was happening on the street as well. His
orchestra was stocked with the best and brightest young talents on
the scene. His legacy has been established for decades through the
accomplishments of the illustrious alumni _ Mongo Santamaria,
Willie Bobo and Ray Barretto _ of his big band turned Latin jazz
academy.
</P>
<P>
   Puente loved the excitement of the big stage shows he had seen
in New York nightclubs and was determined to reproduce the
atmosphere of fun and wonder no matter where he played.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to give them something to see or they can just stay
home and listen to the records,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Puente dancing around his timbales while hammering
home rhythms in front of his razor-sharp orchestra is a lasting
one. His shows were uniformly upbeat affairs, full of finely
focused energy and sophisticated rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   I last talked with Puente before his performance at Bass Concert
Hall last year. He was calling even though it was too late to use
the interview to advance the concert, so things were unusually
relaxed. I told him I'd seen him play here 15 years before at Sixth
Street Live and was looking forward to the show. ``I don't know
why,'' he joked. ``You've already seen the show, because I still do
the same one now.''
</P>
<P>
   That was, quite happily, somewhat true, because Puente felt
compelled to perform his hits in live action. He always played the
classic version of ``Oye Como Va'' and he always prefaced it with a
humorous thank you to Santana for bringing his original back into
the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   And, as usual, his humor disguised a significant insight. Puente
said, that to his ``poor, old ears,'' Santana's band was just ``too
loud, with too much guitar.'' Then he added with a satisfied
chuckle, ``But he's got people dancing again, so I guess we just do
the same thing in different ways.''

 &HT;    Texans hear fightin' words from Bush critics
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because ``proud Texan'' is redundant, and because Texans get
their chaps in a knot when outsiders bad-mouth the state, this kind
of thing became inevitable when George W. Bush painted a target on
his beloved homeland by deciding he should be president.
</P>
<P>
   The war of words between Texans and outsiders who dare criticize
the state is underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Texan whose family settled in Texas in 1859,'' Austinite
Bill Hale said in a letter this week to a California politico who
demeaned Texas, ``I deeply resent your editorial commentary quoted
in the Austin American-Statesman on Sunday, May 21, 2000. At best,
your statement is totally void of enlightened facts and at worst a
belief grounded in the fictional fantasies of Hollywood `B'
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The target of Hale's statetriotic venom was Garry South, top
political adviser to California Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. South's
offending comments, as quoted in a story about the presidential
race in California: ``I'm sure in Texas (Bush) looks like a
compassionate conservative because Texas is so far to the right. In
that landscape he really does seem like a sensible moderate. In
California, the guy looks like a right-wing wacko.''
</P>
<P>
   To Hale, executive director of the Texas Human Rights
Commission, those are fightin' words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear you have zero comprehension of Texas history or
our way of life,'' he told South. ``It is beyond this short epistle
to give you any substantive lesson on Texas history and culture.
But, in brief, Texas was founded in revolution based on the
principles of equality, justice and fair dealing.'' ``The next time
you have the urge to make slanderous editorial comments about Texas
and its governor, get your facts straight. You owe Texas a public
apology,'' Hale concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, California boy. And there's plenty more where that
came from, ready to be dished out to anyone else _ be it probable
Democratic nominee Al Gore or his surrogates _ who dares to
implicate that the Great State of Texas is anything less than a
great state.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented way, Bush's race for the White House has put
the spotlight on Texas and Texans. Though Texans have been involved
in presidential politics in the past, Bush is the first contender
whose record rests solely within the state. Lyndon B. Johnson built
his career and reputation in Washington. The elder Bush never held
state office. Ex-Gov. John Connally had been out of office for 11
years when he made his unsuccessful 1980 bid for the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Gore is putting Texas on trial. Though he doesn't mind
dipping into Texas to dip into Texans' pockets, Gore has called
Texas ``the most polluted state in America.'' He also has
criticized the state's low rankings, by some measures, in education
and social services.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that could explain why Gore is so cranky about Texas:
His 1988 presidential campaign ended here, days after a major loss
in the New York primary, when he was in Austin for a fund-raising
event.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family is intimately acquainted with the ins and outs
of running against a governor. Then-Vice President George Bush did
it successfully in 1988 when he defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis,
self-anointed architect of the ``Massachusetts miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the elder Bush was ousted by Bill Clinton,
governor of a state that ranked near the top only when you list the
states alphabetically. In that race, the Bush campaign _ in a
technique now echoed by the Gore campaign _ tried to show that a
governor's home state offered little evidence in support of a
promotion to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republic of Texas Museum in North Austin, museum
assistant Audrey Tyler doesn't cotton to Gore's criticism of her
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Texan from way back,'' she said. ``And it does upset me.
I do think that Texas is great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the desert. We have the trees and we have the lakes.
We have it all in Texas,'' said Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   In San Angelo, House Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell, a
Democrat who backs Bush, said the Gore theme has a familiar ring to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't President Bush say all that about Arkansas?'' said
Junell, who says he is a Texas Democrat, not a Democrat from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Texan way before I'm a Democrat,'' he said. ``I think
people believe Texas is the place to be, that we have less
government regulation, that we have good schools and that we have a
spirit of entrepreneurship other states wish they had.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Capitol this week, tourist Bill Craft of Cleburne said
he, too, doesn't appreciate campaign stump bad-mouthing of Texas,
but he has figured out how to handle it: he ignores it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just negative politics. It's just throwing mud, as far
as I'm concerned,'' he said. ``If you look at Al Gore you're gong
to find stuff wrong with Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Molly Beth Malcolm, chair of the Texas Democratic Party and a
high-volume Bush critic, understands why Texans don't appreciate
Gore's criticism of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans are just like a big family,'' she said. ``We are loyal
to our state and we are sensitive when outsiders talk about it. I
can talk about my brothers and sisters or mama and daddy, but I
don't want somebody else doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm is confident that the Democratic National Convention
this summer in Los Angeles will not turn into a four-day Texas
bash-a-thon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not Bush-bashing if you are telling the truth about
some of the rankings. They are the truth. We just don't like to
hear someone else talk about them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texans are willing to talk about them. At the Center for
Public Policy Priorities in Austin, a non-profit policy research
organization that keeps an eye out for the less privileged, senior
fiscal analyst Dick Lavine says the presidential race is putting
needed focus on some of the state's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to keep people's attention on what could be better,''
said Lavine, a 20-year Texan. ``I'm not aware that Al Gore is
exaggerating any of these facts. They are facts that people
sometimes don't like to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are periodic reminders of how Texas can be heaven
to some and hell to others. This week, 17 years after he went to
prison for a rape he said he did not commit, A.B. Butler Jr. of
Tyler received a gubernatorial pardon after DNA evidence cleared
him.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Randy Shaeffer of Houston, said Texas is not a good
place for people who find themselves in Butler's predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a controversial situation like a black man given
the maximum sentence for savagely raping a white woman you don't
find people running up to the front of the line to set aside the
conviction and let him go. This is still Texas,'' said Shaeffer.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism from outside the state sometimes hangs on isolated
statistics and facts. In a recent letter to the editor of The New
York Times, New Yorker John Guthrow noted that corporal punishment
remains legal in Texas public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cruel form of child abuse has now been banned in most of
the civilized world,'' Guthrow wrote. ``The fact that George W.
Bush governs a state in which schoolchildren are still beaten every
day is something that voters should be aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sliver of a mega-state that tests the extremes. Texas is
both the unspoiled grandeur of Palo Duro Canyon and the industrial
grit of the Houston Ship Channel. It's www.zillionaires thriving on
free enterprise and people enduring persistent poverty in a state
whose idea of welfare is get a job.
</P>
<P>
   It's good schools and bad schools, wide-open spaces and almost
round-the-clock traffic. When it comes to a current stereotype,
it's downright confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any longer the cowboy image is the dominant
one,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a 25-year Texan who teaches politics at
the University of Texas. ``The mega-state image is coming to the
fore, coupled with attitude. The part of the old image that
survives is the attitude: We're tougher. We're bigger. We're
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it hurts George W. Bush at all,'' said Buchanan.
``And it clearly helps him that Texas is a long way from Washington
D.C.''

VON TRIER'S `THE IDIOTS' IS BOTH LIVELY AND JUVENILE

   THE IDIOTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by: Lars von Trier &QL;

   Starring: Bodil Jorgensen, Jens Albinus, Louise Hassing, Troels

<P>
   ``The Idiots'' is a sometimes infuriating film that comes close
to being Lars von Trier's first real flub. But there's also a
genuine provocativeness about it that charges it with vitality and
outruns its sometimes fascist juvenilia.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense it lives up to the ideal of renewal animating von
Trier and his fun-loving Dogme 95 filmmaking colleagues from
Denmark. Be prepared to hang on for a while, however, until its
virtues emerge from beneath what for a long time seems a replay of
'60s indulgence. It's offensive in several ways, starting with the
discovery by a sad, timid woman in a restaurant that some fellow
diners who have been causing pervasive uneasiness are not the
mentally challenged individuals they appear to be. They're a band
of so-called normal people who, they assure her once off the
premises, are trying to make contact with their inner idiots.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing loftily Dostoyevskyan about their search. They
spout off a lot about how superior they are to bourgeois culture
while having it both ways, behaving selfishly and squatting in the
comfortable house belonging to the uncle of the ringleader, Jens
Albinus's Stoffer. He's supposed to be selling the place for his
uncle, but he scares away potential buyers by telling them the
house is next door to an institution. He's arrogant, and something
of a fascist, bullying the others in the name of liberating them
from their hangups. Karin, the newcomer from the restaurant, who
certainly looks as if she's shouldering more than her share of
troubles, seems to need the collective support they offer. But you
can't help feeling she's on target when she asks Stoffer why
there's so much getting at people.
</P>
<P>
   The smugness and self-righteousness pervading the quasi-commune
at times grows insufferable, and the talk about transcending
barriers gets pretty fuzzy and self-justifying. When the group
indulges itself, it's with champagne and caviar, bought with a
credit card that one of the women shames out of one of the men _
the one who briefly returns to his job in an ad agency. Some of the
men seem benign and most of the women seem pleasant and
good-natured. But their submerged personalities make the film seem
short on content, much less the genuine idealism that would have
been a much more effective motor. Better, certainly, than Stoffer's
admission that there's no real justification for the group
play-acting at being retarded and that they may in fact be
inexcusably patronizing to those they are impersonating. They even
flaunt a callous name for their pastime _ ``spassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Their gratifications seldom exceed the level of the most
rudimentary creature comforts, including a group sex scene in which
male genitalia are concealed with black opaque rectangles
strategically placed. The self-styled idiots, playing at their
version of the noble savage fallacy, which holds that that which is
simple is morally pure and that the way to spiritually cleanse
yourself is to pretend to be simple, deliberately live in a
provisional moment-to-moment world ideally suited to von Trier's
anarchic hand-held camera. The inhibition-shedding is too
self-servingly mindless to be taken seriously. Certainly none of
this film's airing of the idea of abandoning control is on the
level of tightrope-walking undertaken by Emily Watson's character
in ``Breaking the Waves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Idiots'' is as kinetic as that other deliberately
disruptive Dogme 95 film, Thomas Vinterberg's ``The Celebration.''
It has an improvised feel, especially as conflicts surface and the
group dynamic undergoes a seismic shift. There's more than one
section where von Trier's claim to have written ``The Idiots'' in
four days makes you wish there had been time for a rewrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Idiots'' is messy and miles too uncritical of itself. It
wears sanctimoniousness like a halo. But there's also no question
that its rampant ids fly off the screen and engage us. ``The
Idiots'' isn't easy to take. It doesn't succeed in achieving Dogme
95's Holy Grail _ the recapturing of lost innocence. What could? It
plays more like the recapture of Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   But like it or not, it does shake some of the dust off
filmmaking in its slapdash rambunctiousness. For better or worse _
and it does give us both _ it's always alive.

TELLING TALES OF FEAR TO A WARY AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The creased and sweaty figure of a Chinese poet named
Huang Xiang appears on the screen halfway through the new
documentary ``Well-Founded ear.'' Seated in a drab and spartan
apartment, his wife beside him, he begins to recall a recent
medical examination. The physician had noticed a number of curious
scars, evidence of the poet's plight during the Cultural
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   With a quaking finger, Huang traces the line of a wound across
his chest. He speaks of bones shattered in his hands, palms torn
apart. ``My feet,'' he continues, pulling up a trouser leg. ``The
veins were broken and never stitched back.'' As he indicates his
teeth, his voice breaks into wordless moans. When his wife reaches
to comfort him, he shakes off her touch, covers his face with his
forearms, and cries, ``I do not dare to remember my past. I do not
dare!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Huang must remember, and remember in accurate and compelling
detail, in order to gain asylum in the United States as a political
refugee. The story he tells the camera is the same story he will
imminently tell a bespectacled and bow-tied immigration officer
named Gerald Brown, on whom the dissident's destiny rests. In their
encounter, and 10 others like it captured on camera, lies the
dramatic force of the documentary directed by Michael Camerini and
Shari Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well-Founded Fear'' penetrates the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's confidential system of granting or denying
asylum to tens of thousands of refugees each year. (It will be
broadcast at 9 p.m. Monday on PBS in its ``P.O.V.'' series and will
be screened tonight at 9:15 in the New York International
Documentary Festival at the Directors Guild of America Theater at
110 West 57th St.) The film's title refers to the requirement that
an applicant prove a ``well-founded fear of persecution based on
race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social
group or political opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two-hour documentary makes evident, what is at issue in
the asylum hearings is less the objective reality of an applicant's
experience than his or her ability to express it, often in
imperfect English or through the imprecise channels of an
interpreter or attorney.
</P>
<P>
   On the receiving end, the asylum officer has roughly 90 minutes
per case to separate truth from falsehood, to parse all the
increments of exaggeration and emphasis in between, and thus to
determine which refugee receives sanctuary and which is rejected
and left to fight deportation before an immigration judge. In the
fiscal year that ended last September, asylum officers heard 41,377
cases, approving 13,220. The political theater surrounding the
Elian Gonzalez case could hardly be more of an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   ``People judge each other by how they seem,'' Robertson said
during a recent interview at the office she and Camerini share in
the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, ``and that's based on
appearance and performance and the luck of which officer hears your
case. It's about how well you say things, how winning you can be.
One sentence can make the difference in your case.'' Or as one
applicant puts it: ``How can you express a life experience in a few
minutes? It's one thing to tell a story about something. It's a
completely different thing to live it.''
</P>
<P>
   The supplicants in ``Well-Founded Fear'' range from a Romanian
woman claiming she was persecuted as an Anglican to a Nigerian man
citing multiple arrests for opposing the military regime to a
Salvadoran woman who fled after the murder of two relatives more
than a decade ago to a Chinese man who says he was forcibly
sterilized _ and adds inexplicably that he will be sterilized again
if he is returned.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing those stories are a spectrum of officers, from a former
immigration lawyer to a military veteran, from the solicitous to
the skeptical. ``Well-Founded Fear'' offers as much empathy for the
asylum officers as for the applicants, capturing their private
discussions and doubts about the life-changing judgments they make
daily. In one moment, Brown expresses awe at Huang's suffering,
granting his application; in another, several colleagues crack wise
about how many petitioners claim to have toppled the statue of the
dictator in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get a case where the person has pictures of dead
bodies,'' says one officer, Charlene Claxton. ``And that's of
course the last thing you want to look at. And they just give them
to you.'' She continues: ``And we're not permitted to cry, we can't
cry during interviews, it's not a good thing. You want to come up
sometimes and give them a hug, but you can't, you can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another officer, Kevin Love, instead emphasizes how guarded he
has grown over the years. ``Maybe at first I was more gullible, I
was more naive,'' he says. ``I felt like I wasn't a detective. And
now, after seeing so many people who come in and have an identical
story. They're so boilerplate, there's not even anything unique
about the claims. It makes you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   For the filmmakers, the asylum system provided not only dramatic
material but a vehicle for fulfilling their journalistic ambitions.
``We had been struggling with how to get Americans to think about
the world,'' Camerini said. ``And suddenly it was clear that here,
in the asylum officers, were the Americans who dealt with the
world. Here was the place where the world collided with America.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Camerini, who is 50, and Robertson, 46, had worked abroad
extensively before embarking on this project. Their separate
documentaries had covered such topics as the Khmer Rouge
guerrillas, the drug war in Peru, social change in India and the
Mexican artist Diego Rivera, and they began collaborating in the
early 1990s with a film about girls in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   What ultimately became ``Well-Founded Fear'' had its genesis as
a proposed multi-part series on immigrants and refugees in the
post-cold war world. Camerini and Robertson did not even intend to
focus on the American asylum system, dismissing it as too small a
part of the subject. But the filmmakers were never able to raise
more than a fraction of their $3 million budget, and they came to
doubt the interest of domestic audiences in six hours of
programming on an international topic.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied, they went to dinner one night in January 1996 with a
member of their advisory board, Estelle Strizhak. A former
specialist in refugee resettlement, Strizhak had recently been
recruited to join the INS as an asylum officer. Having known
Strizhak in her prior life as ``someone good at guerrilla warfare
against the INS,'' as Camerini put it, the filmmakers were
surprised and intrigued to hear her speak admiringly of her current
colleagues in the agency. The problem, however, was the service's
policy of confidentiality for all asylum cases. Even over a
friendly meal, Strizhak would not divulge the name of a single
officer or applicant.
</P>
<P>
   So the filmmakers relied on another advisory-board member,
Demetrio Papademetriou, of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace. He had previously worked in the Labor Department with Doris
Meissner, who was by this time the INS commissioner, and he
delivered to her a one-page proposal from Camerini and Robertson to
film hearings inside any of the agency's nine asylum centers. In
October 1996, Meissner essentially ordered her subordinates to
cooperate with the documentary, and that same month the filmmakers
became fixtures in the asylum offices in Queens, N.Y., and
Lyndhurst, N.J.

<P>
   QUITTING THE NAIROBI TRIO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Knipfel &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy R. Tarcher/Putnam, 285 pp., $23.95 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When readers last encountered Jim Knipfel, he was giving up a
life of petty crime, punk rock, and paranoia for a career as a
writer. (Well, maybe not the paranoia.) He was also coming to terms
with retinitis pigmentosa, an eye disease that left him in a world
of dimming light and terrifying stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   His first book, ``Slackjaw,'' was a jaggedly charming collection
of essays that documented his progress from graduate school in the
Midwest to a job as columnist for The New York Press, an
alternative weekly in New York City. His new work, ``Quitting the
Nairobi Trio,'' probes more deeply into one stop on that trip, a
suicide attempt that landed him in a locked psych ward in
Minneapolis. It is also a masterful leap forward in style and
control. While some of the searing heat of ``Slackjaw'' is missing,
Knipfel introduces more nuance and continuity. He seems to be
trying to get some distance, to mediate his own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people get creepy and nervous when I offhandedly mention
that I've spent a goodly amount of time in the bughouse,'' Knipfel
offers at the outset. But the food was OK, the bed was comfortable,
and the world was muted.
</P>
<P>
   The suicide attempt that landed him in the locked ward _ done
with a rainbow overdose of over-the-counter pills _ wasn't his
first. In fact, he writes, he had been trying to kill himself since
he was 14. ``No matter how I had tried, nothing worked. I threw
myself down flights of stairs, drank bleach, cut my wrists, stepped
in front of buses, all to no avail.'' If Nietzsche were having a
really bad day, he'd be Jim Knipfel.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't too many clues as to cause in this book. He
provides a glimpse of his childhood in Green Bay, where he tried to
dream an adventurous life for himself. His description of scuba
lessons at a local pool is as telling an anecdote as any about his
shamefaced struggle for independence. Knipfel seems to come from a
stolid, Sears-catalogue type of Midwestern family, but his life
devolves into throttled anger and self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   When the doors slide shut in the psych ward, Knipfel takes stock
of his fellow heretics in the Dante-esque environment. This is
where his storytelling instincts take hold: there's Cartwright, the
social worker with the sclerotic soul of a bureaucrat; Gus, the
manic bicyclist; the TV room, where patients watch the Ernie Kovacs
reruns that give the book its title; and Joey, the erstwhile
roommate who is whisked away one night, leaving a welter of blood
and a mystery that pervades the rest of the story.
</P>
<P>
   The ward teaches him lessons about lying in wait. And watching.
Attendants take his shoelaces and belt. The stuff of daily life
gets doled out in dribs: psychotropic drugs, cigarettes, meals,
information. Knipfel cracks his only book _ ``Ecrits,'' by French
psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, and offers ``A Half-Assed Guide'' for
the uninitiated. Lacan makes as much sense to Knipfel as his
10-minute weekly visits with Dr. Spellman, his assigned
psychiatrist. Soon, the patients begin making more sense than the
paid professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clearer the hopelessness of my situation with Spellman,
the clearer it was that I really was on my own here, almost to the
point that I could be my own therapist. I guess I had Lacan with me
_ however ludicrous he could be at times _ and thought I had some
simple common sense. That was a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Knipfel later obtained his medical records, and found that he
had been diagnosed with a mixed personality disorder: ``an enduring
pattern of inner experience and behavior which persists over
several years and deviates markedly from the expectations of one's
home culture.'' Like many perfectly sane people, he finds some
comfort in not fitting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nairobi Trio'' takes one structural leap that falls flat,
however. The book alternates descriptions of real events with
descriptions of hallucinations, presumably brought on by Knipfel's
overdose. Personal hallucinations, like dreams, are difficult to
pass judgment on: They're important to the beholder but don't
always translate in the wider world. These chapters never resonate.
</P>
<P>
   Knipfel doesn't need hallucinations. He is inventive and
outrageous enough to make the mundane details of his real life
weirdly compelling (just check out his disquisition on cat sputum
on the Web). But this is only his second book, and sophomore
efforts are just that. If Knipfel is willing to let readers
continue to devour the details of his life, there's room for a
third.

<P>
   Before even starting to shoot, they attended 50 hearings and
interviewed all 116 officers and supervisors; they parked
themselves in a conference room to read volumes of INS regulations;
they screened their earlier documentaries for the staff members.
The efforts were enough to persuade 81 employees to agree to be
filmed. The applicants proved even more amenable, hoping that a
camera and sound man in the hearing room might somehow help their
chances. From July 1997 to May 1998, Camerini and Robertson
collected 85 hours of video and another 15 of audio tape. Of the 50
asylum cases they filmed, 11 made the final cut (material omitted
from the film can be found on the documentary's Web site, www.pbs
.org/pov/wellfoundedfear).
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the pair watched their $500,000 budget double and
their debts mount. They were $40,000 in arrears and paying their
studio rent with cash advances from a credit card by the time their
first large grants _ from the Ford Foundation and the Open Society
Institute, among others _ arrived early in 1997. Even after that,
the filmmakers had to resort to credit-card advances for the
$80,000 cost of enlarging their 16-millimeter print to
35-millimeter for film festivals. A showing at Sundance last
January gave ``Well-Founded Fear'' its first burst of exposure and
critical acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   For Camerini and Robertson, though, an earlier indicator of
success came when they feuded with their own editors. ``When you
edit, you're working with a new person who's never seen the footage
and they have this tendency to simplify the characters and the
issues _ `Oh, that person is ridiculous, that person is awful,'''
Camerini said. ``Both Shari and I were terribly defensive of all
the people in the film. To run into that instinct to make
archetypes sharpened our sense of goal. Which was to identify with
and really like pretty much everyone in the movie. It's easier for
people to fall in love with the poet than with the officers. But
the officers are us.'' &QL;

 &HT;    All CNN imitators, all the time
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an insatiable national craving for news that comes like
lobsters _ live and ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Car chases in California, trial verdicts, hostage standoffs and
army invasions _ it is imperative that we see the pictures as they
happen. Later may be too late. Information is delivered with the
thrill of an electronic high-wire act. At any second, the speeding
car may crash, the building may explode, the defendant may crack
and the army may do battle. To wait is to run the unbearable risk
of not being there.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner gave us CNN two decades ago, and a passion for
immediacy was ignited. We could watch live as bombing was shaking
downtown Baghdad or the people in Oklahoma City. We could mark the
exact moment and place we were when O.J. got off the hook. At its
best, CNN took us to Berlin as the Wall was being torn down, a
moment of pure history. At its worst, CNN wallowed in the tragedy
of fallen celebrity as the network did last year in its continuous
coverage _ what network news president Richard Kaplan proudly
termed ``wall-to-wall coverage'' _ of the plane crash of John F.
Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall how the poor anchors were sentenced to provide
dialogue for the wall-to-wall coverage when there was nothing to
cover. From the Atlanta studio, they watched live aerial video as
the Coast Guard cutter made its long journey, its very, very long
journey, to the crash site. They had to fill the air with words
during this interminable voyage. They were live. So they discussed
depths of Atlantic waters, how choppy the seas were, how Mr.
Kennedy had a father who had been president, how he was Irish, how
the Coast Guard was founded in 1790, etc. The walls were way too
far apart.
</P>
<P>
   CNN feeds our national obsession for live news, and it also
inspires followers at the local level. All stations must have at
least a remote van, if not a remote truck, equipped with a huge
logo and a satellite tower to go live from anywhere. Because live
is what we all want.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday afternoon, when a teacher was shot dead in Lake
Worth, the mobile TV towers went up outside the middle school
campus, and three West Palm Beach stations battled each other for
the first details of the killing. WPTV-Channel 5 was first to
report the name of the teacher, Barry Grunow.
</P>
<P>
   The station got the identity by interviewing 12- and 13-year-old
students live on the air _ kids the reporter sometimes addressed as
``sweetie.'' Two of them mentioned Mr. Grunow's name. Neither
police nor school officials released or confirmed the name. But
Channel 5 was live, and this was what was said, and so this is what
was broadcast. Never mind that the kids, young and shaken, might
have been wrong, or that the victim's family might be getting the
horrible news by television. Being live and first, being there and
linked to the instant. That's what mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind, too, that a reporter sought to allay fears of a
wider tragedy by telling viewers ``just a teacher'' had been shot.
Live TV is a messy business, the station says, and it is essential
to beat all comers on the story. Channel 5 was first, Channel 5 was
right, and Channel 5 thanks you for watching.
</P>
<P>
   Editing has become the most prominent casualty of live TV's rush
to transmit. Considering content and context of information takes
time. How much easier it is to vomit words and images through a
screen and take your chances. Sources don't need to be reliable
because the medium is live, and the message is whatever comes out.
The lowest standard applies because of how very difficult it is
just to get there, put the tower up and pull anything at all from
the chaotic scene. Stick a microphone in a kid's face and maybe
what comes out will be _ news.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 5 might have chosen to interview students off-camera.
The station might have videotaped interviews, listened, edited them
and aired them a few minutes later. Only a few minutes. But, then,
that would have been responsible, but it wouldn't have been live.
That would only be almost live. Getting it live is what matters.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it?

BON JOVI STILL ROCKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jon Bon Jovi was the ultimate arena-rock star of the 1980s,
belting out guilty-pleasure hits ``You Give Love a Bad Name'' and
``Living on a Prayer.'' Today, however, Bon Jovi may indeed be
living on a prayer, since he's an outsider in a fiercer, more
alternative, youth-oriented rock scene. Yet Bon Jovi is not going
down without a struggle. As he sings in the new song, ``The Next
100 Years'': ``If it should all end tonight, I'll know it will have
been worth the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bon Jovi and his group of the same name issue ``Crush,'' the
band's first CD in five years, on June 13, and play Saturday in
Mansfield, Mass..
</P>
<P>
   These days, Bon Jovi is known more for his movies than his music
_ exemplified by roles in the new submarine film, ``U-571'' and six
previous flicks, including ``Moonlight and Valentino,'' ``No
Looking Back,'' and ``Row Your Boat.'' He will also appear in ``Pay
It Forward'' with Helen Hunt and Kevin Spacey, due in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Crush,'' Bon Jovi and his reunited mates, including Richie
Sambora and Tico Torres, crank out a ``classic'' Bon Jovi sound of
big guitars, big backbeats, gushy love songs, and uncomplicated,
working-class anthems.
</P>
<P>
   The album doesn't hop on any bandwagons _ don't look for any
hip-hop/rock crossovers here _ but Bon Jovi deserves credit for
writing honest, adult lyrics that reflect where he is today.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey rocker, who has been called a poor man's Bruce
Springsteen, gets right to the task with ``Older,'' a virtual
position paper of Bon Jovi 2000: ``All these years of memories, I'm
still chasing dreams, but I'm not looking over my shoulder . . .
Like a favorite pair of torn bluejeans, the skin I'm in is all
right with me/ I like the bed I'm sleeping in/ It's just like me,
it's broken in/ It's not old, just older.''
</P>
<P>
   The new single, ``It's My Life,'' should score on Top 40 radio,
even if rock radio shuns it. Although the band has become a bit of
an anachronism, it's still a guilty pleasure.

   Walden Woods update: Eagles singer/solo act Don Henley headlines
FleetBoston Pavilion on Monday. It's a benefit for the Walden Woods
Project, which Henley has championed for 10 years, as he's helped
keep Henry David Thoreau's Walden Pond retreat out of the hands of
developers.
</P>
<P>
   So what's up with the project on its 10th anniversary?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trucking along,'' says Henley. ``Our Web site is up
and running at www.walden.org. We are still struggling to get
funding to refurbish the building that houses the institute. We're
still struggling to raise a $15 million endowment so that the
project and the institute can survive after I'm gone. And we have
some wonderful education programs out there for schoolchildren of
all ages. We have seminars and lectures. We have visiting scholars
from all over the world. We're still cataloging our Thoreau
collections and digitizing those collections.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton, U.S. Senator from Arkansas?
</P>
<P>
   Some people who know President Clinton think that's the next job
for him after he leaves the White House in January.
</P>
<P>
   At age 54, Clinton will be the youngest former U.S. president
since Teddy Roosevelt in 1915. Given his life-long career in
politics, a run for the seat now held by Sen. Tim Hutchinson,
R-Ark., could be in Clinton's future, according to these Clinton
watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., a long-time acquaintance of
Clinton's who served as one of his chief defenders during the
president's impeachment trial, thinks a Senate seat would be the
logical continuation of Clinton's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that's an option for him,'' Bumpers said in a recent
interview. ``He's not constrained by age and I think there's plenty
of time (for him) to serve in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   David Maraniss, who wrote the best-selling Clinton biography
``First in His Class,'' noted that Clinton has long been interested
in a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the time he was governor of Arkansas he wanted to be
senator,'' Maraniss said, referring to Clinton's 10_year occupancy
of the governor's mansion in Little Rock. ``He always wanted to run
for Bumper's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   But the senator was popular and a member of Clinton's party. The
other Senate seat was held by another Clinton ally, Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers' seat opened up in 1998 when the four-term senator
retired and was succeeded by Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, a first-term senator who voted last year to convict
Clinton in his impeachment trial, is up for re-election in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While the Constitution bars Clinton from seeking a third term in
the White House, there's no similar obstacle to a run for the
Senate. And he would be following the precedent set by former
President Andrew Johnson, the only other president besides Clinton
to be impeached, who joined the Senate after leaving the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   John Quincy Adams had a long career in the House of
Representatives after he left the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, ``I would eliminate the House,'' Bumpers
said. He said Clinton would prefer to be a senator or secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become very good with foreign affairs,'' Bumpers
explained of Clinton's qualifications for the Cabinet position.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn McQuary, chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party, said
Clinton would ``be welcome back here He certainly has an open
invitation from me as chairman to act (in Arkansas politics) in any
way he feels comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the president's future career has been renewed by
the move to disbar him from practicing law because he gave
misleading testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
That issue will be decided soon by a judge in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, Clinton's former top political adviser, thinks the
president should skip law practice anyway and set up his own think
tank to study public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leading a think tank that would probe new ideas would be good
for him (and) it would give him some visibility,'' said Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Other Clinton watchers expect him to work in the private sector,
taking time to help raise money for Democrats or to serve as an
international peacekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think
tank in Washington, predicts Clinton will ``go back to making some
real money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess said Clinton, like most other modern presidents, could earn
a large sum writing his memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing every ex-president does is write his
memoirs,'' Hess said. ``For a president who has cared so much about
his legacy, he'll want to tell it as he remembers it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some top corporate headhunters agree Clinton's business
opportunities are vast.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Pfieffer, a partner in the Washington office of the
executive search firm of Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, said Clinton comes
across as ``an extremely smart, personable executive I see him as a
deal-doer, but not just a glad-hander.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ryan, a consultant at the outplacement firm of Drake Beam
Morin, said Clinton could become a corporate CEO if he chose to
work only with one company. But Ryan said Clinton is ``more likely
to serve on many'' boards because he would then collect several
director's fees and could work in different fields.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could also make large amounts of money quickly by making
speeches to corporate executives, like George Bush and Ronald
Reagan did when they left office.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Morris, Reagan's official biographer and author of
``Dutch,'' recalled that Reagan made ``extremely lucrative public
speeches for fat-cat corporations'' after leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   He said the speech circuit is an option for any ex-president.
</P>
<P>
   John Challenger, chief executive officer of the international
outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas said, ``I don't
think he'll go back and practice law'' regardless of the outcome of
the disbarment proceedings. ``He'll do something more
presidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenger suggested Clinton might end up secretary-general of
the United Nations or as the head of the Americorps volunteer
program that he established.
</P>
<P>
   Challenger said Clinton might go ``out and work in the
non-profit arena like Jimmy Carter with Habitat for Humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Kranz, an American historian specializing in the
presidency at the Library of Congress, said Clinton could follow in
the footsteps of Harry Truman, who spoke on numerous college
campuses about the presidency after he left office. Kranz also
suggested that future presidents take advantage of Clinton's
speaking skills and ask him to speak at funerals for foreign
dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one better at delivering eulogies,'' Kranz said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute think tank in Washington, suggested Clinton ``will
develop a relationship with some kind of investment house for a day
or two a week.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Washington fundraiser, Clinton said he would like to
teach at least a semester a year. Clinton last taught at the
University of Arkansas law school in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Mort Gitelman, a fellow law school faculty member, recalls that
Clinton was ``a very engaging instructor'' who had ``lively
conversations with the students.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has told reporters on several occasions that he plans to
spend time in Arkansas working on his $80-million-$125 million
presidential library in Little Rock. He said he would live with
mother-in-law Dorothy Rodham until his planned apartment at the
library is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Another option for Clinton is to join his many friends in
California and go into show business.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent White House Correspondents Dinner, Clinton starred
in a short spoof video about being a lame-duck president. Many said
he performed better than the evening's featured entertainer,
``Tonight Show'' Host Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   While Ronald Reagan went from acting to politics, Clinton could
do the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be at all surprised if (Clinton) went into the
movie business,'' said Morris, the Reagan biographer. Reagan didn't
return to acting because he was too old when he left office, Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party, said he
hopes Clinton will come to his state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so loved out here,'' Torres said.

 WEB PORN BUSINESS FINDS NICHE IN SUBURBIA

   The four-bedroom brick colonial seems to be the very model of
mainstream suburbia: two cars in the driveway, friendly dogs at the
door, a pool in the backyard, a grand piano in the
climate-controlled library. The owners are Internet entrepreneurs.
In their spare time, they like to garden, rock climb, and sail.
</P>
<P>
   And down in the basement, they run a profitable online
pornography business that specializes in bondage and domination.
</P>
<P>
   When the neighbors ask what they do, the owners say, ``We're in
e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Located in southern New Hampshire, the Phoenix Group (no
relation to the Boston Phoenix) is a multimillion-dollar operation
that employs a staff of seven, including a former middle school
teacher. ``We're not doing as well as Bill Gates, but we have a
nice nest egg,'' says Phoenix Group founder Colin Daniels (a
pseudonym), 45, a former professional musician. Daniels says his
business, which includes a flagship site, boasts a cumulative total
of 150,000 customers a year; he points out that many of these
customers sign on for the service for short periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when venture capitalists and business leaders are
falling all over themselves trying to figure out how to make money
on the Web, entrepreneurs in the online adult entertainment
industry are floating in profits. With its global reach, instant
accessibility, and anonymity, the Internet has brought pornography
into the mainstream, taking it out of the penthouses and mansions
of porn kings and placing it smack in the basements and garages of
middle America.
</P>
<P>
   Since virtually all of the companies are private and many of the
merchants tend to be cagey and circumspect, it's hard to determine
the exact size of the industry. Most analysts steer clear of the
trade, and ratings services like Media Metrix don't track adult
sites as a separate category. But according to a 1999 study by the
New York-based research firm Datamonitor, adult content accounts
for 69 percent of the $1.4 billion market for online services;
other estimates put the online porn business at between $1 billion
and $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In April, some 17.6 million users, or 22 percent of all Internet
users, visited an adult site, according to Nielsen/Net Ratings. And
the top-rated porn site in April received more traffic than such
popular mainstream sites as AskJeeves.com, Priceline.com, and
BarnesandNoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wide-ranging content
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources estimate that there are tens of thousands of
porn sites on the Internet, offering everything from still
photographs to live Webcams and streaming video. The content is all
over the map; virtual sex shops sport names like Lust Highway, Sex
on the Strip, Busty Amateurs, and Granny Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Run by amateurs and semi-pros all over the country, many of
these sites are turning a handsome profit. While the top few sites
are run by a handful of old-fashioned porn purveyors, there is a
brand-new group of proprietors that includes slick young computer
wizards, former porn stars, and suburban swingers. Young and old,
male and female, they pioneer new technologies and marketing
methods years before they are adopted by the mainstream corporate
world. Almost all of them use pseudonyms, and many of them defy
stereotypes, like the Cambridge programmer who runs a paid porn
site so he can afford to run free support groups for people with
HIV and other chronic disorders. ``A lot of these people are geeks
who obsess about code, not content,'' says Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the adult entertainment industry exists in its own
alternative universe on the Internet, independent of the vagaries
of venture capitalists and the Nasdaq market. It has its own
villains and heroines, ts own search engines and service
organizations, its own award ceremonies and trade shows. It has a
fair share of hucksters and rip-off artists, but it also has its
own self-appointed consumer watchdog, a former advertising
saleswoman named Jane Duvall who runs Jane's Guide, a popular Web
site that monitors industry fraud. And now it's part of a college
curriculum: Last month, San Francisco State University launched a
course that studies the online skin scene.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is: Sex sells.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Danni Ashe, a former centerfold who has become a sort
of poster girl for the flourishing industry. She started her
soft-core site, Danni's Hard Drive, for $8,000 in 1995; her
business now employs 38 people and grossed $5.2 million last year,
with projected earnings of $7 million this year. ``Obviously, we
are all genetically programmed to want to have sex and talk about
sex and look at sex,'' says Ashe, 32.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated technology
</P>
<P>
   But the success of the industry doesn't ride on hormonal
instinct alone. Porn has always driven the development of media
technology, from nickelodeon peep shows to videocassettes to
Webcams to live, streaming video. The next generation of Internet
add-ons is already in development; one company is marketing a line
of tactile devices called ``cyberdildonics,'' and Vivid
Entertainment Inc. invented a neoprene cybersex bodysuit with 36
built-in sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware manufacturers often test new high-end systems on porn
sites, which generate heavy traffic and require high bandwidth.
``It's all very confidential, but the major vendors do it all the
time,'' says Chris Buerger, manager of networking for Datamonitor.
</P>
<P>
   The online pornographers also pioneered marketing techniques
that have been adopted by mainstream merchants and publishers all
over the Internet. They were early adapters of pop-up windows and
exit consoles that invite users to visit affiliated Web sites; the
referring site gets a cut of any business conducted at the next
site. Amazon.com and other e-merchants now have similar referring
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The free porn sites, or ``farm'' sites, make decent money this
way; many of them are run by the same folks who operate the
subscription sites, which charge up to $25 a month. Cooperation is
the name of the game in the industry: Large or small, providers are
all involved in a complex web of partnerships and profit-sharing
deals.
</P>
<P>
   The adult sites also expertly monitor and filter traffic,
building demographic profiles of customers to target ads
specifically to users. ``You don't try to sell a lawnmower during
`Oprah,' '' explains Andrew Edmond, chief executive officer of
SexTracker, a Seattle-based service company that hosts porn sites
and markets statistical analysis tools.
</P>
<P>
   The porn industry has always been a few steps ahead of the
mainstream entertainment industry, which is embroiled in lawsuits
involving Internet piracy and hasn't figured out how to make money
of its own online. Likewise, none of the mega-hyped start-ups
offering mainstream online entertainment have been able to develop
a following, sustain a profit, or pay back their investors. Two
high-profile Net entertainment start-ups, DEN and Pixelon, are both
mired in scandal and headed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream attention
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Hollywood executives are watching the adult world,
but they're doing it quietly. ``It's not like they have big board
meetings and trot out the porn and say, `Get me some of that,' ''
says Mark Hardie, a former analyst with Forrester Research. ``But
they are looking at areas where money is being made and asking, `If
they're making money, why can't we?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, the question of the moment on Wall Street
and Main Street alike. But even the porn sites are seeing a drop in
profits these days, in part because the credit card companies are
putting the squeeze on shady operators, instituting higher fees and
penalties for merchant accounts. American Express recently
announced it was dropping all merchant accounts for online porn
sites. And the scams in the industry are notorious. Some sites are
rigged so that users trying to exit are bombarded by page after
page of smut; other sites offer ``free trial'' periods and then
bill customers before they can cancel. Late last year, Seth
Warshavsky, the Seattle wheeler-dealer infamous for selling the
Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson Lee sex video online, was accused by
his employees of double-billing thousands of customers. And in
April, a scam artist duped Web users out of thousands of dollars by
using software that reset their modems to dial the African nation
of Chad.
</P>
<P>
   Some adult entertainment moguls turn a blind eye to such fraud,
but others in the business are trying to force the industry to
police itself. ``There is an attitude in the adult industry of
`Rah, rah, we're all in this together,' '' says Duvall of Jane's
Guide. ``But my big thing is that people should know what they're
getting and they shouldn't get ripped off.'' Her site crusades
against scams and evaluates porn sites on such consumer issues as
customer service and user agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has taken steps to clean up its business practices,
says Craig Tant of CCBill Inc., a third-party billing company in
Phoenix that handles merchant accounts for more than 10,000 porn
sites. He notes that about 95 percent of his customers run an
honest business. But, he admits, ``we have seen scams that are
outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Service companies like CCBill and SexTracker are reaping huge
profits, although their founders won't say exactly how much. The
real money in Internet pornography, some say, is being made by the
business-to-business companies that provide hardware and services
to Webmasters. ``The people who made the money in the gold rush
were the people selling the stuff to the miners, not the miners
themselves,'' says Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Edmond of SexTracker is riding high in Seattle these
days. At 26, he oversees a company with 100 employees and more than
29,000 clients. He fashions himself as a kind of sheriff bringing
order to the Wild, Wild West of the adult Internet. ``We take
professionalism very seriously,'' he says. ``This is not a
fly-by-night operation where there are a bunch of guys with
strippers sitting on their laps.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many virtual porn shops are run in makeshift home
offices where computer programmers type at keyboards and
customer-service operators take technical questions and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   At the offices of the New Hampshire Phoenix Group, for instance,
three women smoke cigarettes and field phone calls in a relaxed
suburban setting.
</P>
<P>
   Customer-service representative Mercedes Taylor (a pseudonym)
says she was attracted to the job because smoking is permitted and
casual dress is encouraged. A single mother, she makes more money
now than she did as a teacher. ``I'm not the morality police,'' she
says. ``This is not my lifestyle, but I love my job. It's creative.
It's cutting-edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would Daniels, a classically trained musician who still
conducts a local chorus, turn his basement into a porn shop as
opposed to, say, a Web business that sells sheet music? ``This
business makes money,'' he says simply. ``Others don't.''

   It should not be a great surprise that George W. Bush has

Poor's 500 index, has returned an average of 18 percent for the
past 18 years. If you had invested a dollar in stocks when the bull
market began in 1982, it would be worth slightly more than $20
today. What's not to like?
</P>
<P>
   But imagine, hard as it is may be, that the party is over.
Imagine that we are entering a period where the stock market goes
into an extended funk, where every dip is not followed by an
immediate rebound (like Thursday's), where returns are mediocre,
rather than spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   In that kind of world, would we all be so enthusiastic about
taking risks and managing our own financial futures?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shiller probably doesn't think so. In his gloomy new
book, ``Irrational Exuberance,'' the Yale economist points out some
unpleasant historical realities. He notes that every time the
market has had a long runup, and price/earnings ratios have reached
new highs as they have recently, the subsequent 20-year period has
been characterized by miserable stock-market performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bad times followed good at the beginning of the century, after
the Crash of 1929 and after 1966, another high-water mark for
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with Barron's, Shiller said: ``It is
certainly plausible to me that the Dow could be trading at the
current level of 10,000 to 11,000 20 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wyss is nowhere near that gloomy. But the chief economist
at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI is forecasting a period of below average
stock-market returns for the next 10 years. Wyss's argument is
based largely on economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   He reasons that much of the bull market can be explained by the
gradual decline in interest rates and inflation over the past 20
years. That decline made stocks more attractive than other
investments and allowed price/earnings ratios to climb
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``That process is over,'' said Wyss. ``We have gone about as low
on rates and inflation as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Others make the case that high stock prices sow the seeds of
their own destruction. The logic goes something like this: When
stock prices are high, investors are already making the assumption
that there will be plenty of good news _ and good earnings _ in the
days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   If the news is merely as good as forecast, stocks will just
maintain their levels. If the news is worse than expected, stocks
will fall.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a few numbers: When stocks are appreciating 18 percent
a year, an investor doubles his money every four years. If stocks
rise 6 percent a year _ an arbitary but not ridiculous number _
that same investor would double his money every 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In an 18 percent environment, a $20,000 investment turns into
$160,000 after 12 years. In a 6 percent environment that $20,000
investment would be worth only $40,000 after 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   All of us have become accustomed to living in the 18 percent
world and we have made our decisions accordingly. We have embraced
401(k) plans enthusiastically, prefering to trust our fate to the
market, rather than a paternalistic employer. We have barely
complained or seemed to notice that traditional defined-benefit
retirement plans cover a smaller percentage of the work force every
year.
</P>
<P>
   We have put our children's college money in the market. Some of
us have jumped to new jobs on the expectation that our stock
options will soar in value. And now as a nation we are at least
considering the possibility of putting a portion of our Social
Security money in the same pot.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is we have fallen in love with investing in the
greatest period of stock-market performance in history. We are like
people who fall in love with New England on gorgeous days in the
fall when the leaves are changing color.
</P>
<P>
   Will we feel the same if the weather turns rotten and the winter
lasts a long time?

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Jerry Rice will remain with the San
Francisco 49ers for the next two seasons under an agreement between
the team and the wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The deal restructures the 2000 and 2001 seasons of Rice's
existing contract, which runs through the 2004 season, and will
save the 49ers ``a significant amount'' against the salary cap,
general manager Bill Walsh said Thursday. By significant he meant
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Until the deal is approved by the NFL, Rice is on the books for
$5,490,423 in salary cap money this season. The 49ers and Rice's
agent, Jim Steiner, were in agreement on salary but were not able
to sign off on two incentive clauses in the new contract until late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league helped us with wording for two specific clauses in
the contract,'' Walsh said. ``That wording must go to the agent and
be OK'd. Then it's up for Jerry to sign it.''

BIRD STEPPED HERE: CELTIC PARQUET TO BE AUCTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On Monday morning, segments of the original Boston
Celtics' parquet floor will be auctioned, many of them bearing the
signature of the player whose most legendary move came on that
particular panel of varnished wood.
</P>
<P>
   Decades from now, when bits of the floor hang on the walls of
important places, a number of people can justly take credit for
assuring long life to 21 squares of Tennessee Red Oak.
</P>
<P>
   They will be men with names such as Cousy and Bird, Havlicek and
Russell, Cowens, Heinsohn and Mann.
</P>
<P>
   Mann?
</P>
<P>
   That would be Jeffrey Mann, 28, the guy who spent eight weeks
studying videos, films and photographs to figure out where
everyone's feet were planted when they performed heroic deeds with
a basketball. He's also the guy who has traveled some 12,000 miles
in the past few weeks for autographs of men who have moved far from
Boston, his carry-on baggage consisting of 25-pound, 2x2-foot
square slats and a box of Sharpie pens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I got tired, I kept reminding myself: This is a piece
of sports history you're responsible for,'' said Mann. He took no
chances when he was on the road. At a Holiday Inn on a dark stretch
of Pennsylvania highway, Mann slept with the wood within arm's
reach. He said that often people asked: What's in those carpet
sample boxes that look so heavy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pieces of flooring,'' he preferred to answer, figuring that
what they didn't know, wouldn't tempt them.
</P>
<P>
   For owners of famous basketball courts that need to be sliced,
diced, autographed and auctioned, Jeffrey Mann is probably the man
for the job.
</P>
<P>
   A recent graduate of Springfield College's master's program in
sports management, Mann went to work last fall for the FleetCenter
as a sales director. His first project: Sell the 54-year-old floor
of the Boston Garden. It comprises 264 panels, each 1 1/2 inches
thick and 5 feet square.
</P>
<P>
   When the Garden was razed, the flooring was moved to the new
FleetCenter for the 1995-96 basketball season. On Dec. 22 of last
year, the floor was retired with much fanfare and a few tears by
some of the greats who had played on it. All 16 Celtics titles were
won on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   A new floor was laid down for the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The auction, conducted online by Sotheby's
(www.sothebys.amazon.com), will run from June 5 to 15. The proceeds
will go to the FleetCenter, the Celtics and charity, though Mann
wouldn't specify who will get what.
</P>
<P>
   For most Celtic fans, the attachment to the floor is strong, a
reminder of a time when the team could be relied on to be a winner
every season. ``The secret of the parquet has always been the great
players who stood on it,'' Tom Heinsohn said at the floor's
retirement party. ``That's what made it so special.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the auction is the 20x20-foot leprechaun logo
that had been center court. Most other items are 24-inch squares of
flooring (cut down from the 5-foot panels so they would be suitable
for framing) where famous players performed famous feats.
</P>
<P>
   The squares carry the National Basketball Association's stamp of
authenticity because, as Mann put it, ``the last thing we wanted to
be selling something that claimed: `This is where we think John
Havlicek stole the ball,' '' in game 7 of the 1965 East Conference
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining panels will stay in storage. Some are slated to be
given away to longtime Celtics supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mann spoke from a seat in the otherwise empty FleetCenter arena,
recalling some of the challenges of his research to match famous
plays with the appropriate slice of parquet. In the old Garden, the
television cameras (and earlier movie cameras) were located on the
opposite side of the arena from where they were located in the
FleetCenter. The team benches were also flopped, as was the center
court leprechaun.
</P>
<P>
   ``So left was right, right was left, and it all got kind of
complicated,'' Mann recalled. Early films of the pivotal moments
old-timers recalled were hard to find, in one case the saving
factor was an arcane collection of Sports Illustrated photos. The
photographs helped Mann pinpoint the square from which Bill Russell
leaped to block a St. Louis Hawks' shot in 1957. The play won the
Celtics their first NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   He said it wasn't that hard to locate the players _ sometimes a
few years, sometimes decades _ after their plays made them legends.
Many are still in basketball, working in youth leagues. Hauling the
wood around to get their signatures, however, was another matter.
The trunks of rental cars sometimes weighed down to the point they
were almost scraping the road.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting his boyhood heroes also proved disappointing at times.
For example, he stood in awkward silence while Larry Bird, the
coach today of the Indiana Pacers, was signing autographs in
Indianapolis's new Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice fieldhouse,'' he told Bird, who looked up at him with a
``do-you-really-think-that's-relevant?'' expression. The session
concluded in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Mann is pretty sure he was able to canvass the country with his
squares without anyone noticing what he was doing. The exception
was a ticket saleswoman at Los Angeles International Airport. She
had asked, as many did, what was in the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pieces of flooring,'' he responded as usual.
</P>
<P>
   She looked at his office address written on a corner of the box.
It said FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness!'' she said. ``That must be part of the old
parquet floor!''

CARLY SIMON FINDS TIME FOR THE PAIN _ AND LEARNS FROM IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, Carly Simon was sitting in a bar in Woods
Hole, waiting for the ferry to Martha's Vineyard. She was immersed
in a book, Sartre's ``Nausea,'' about a man who becomes ill
searching for the meaning of life. Simon herself had recently been
diagnosed with breast cancer. That night she was lost in thought _
dark, painful thoughts _ about the possibility that she would never
write music again.
</P>
<P>
   Just then a song came on the jukebox. As ``Embraceable You''
played, something in Simon snapped. She had a vision of George
Gershwin toiling at his piano, grappling with his muse, struggling
to write his song. At that moment she felt something she hadn't
felt in a long time: inspired. Later that night she came up with
the first piece of original music she had liked in five years and
wrote a letter to the late composer that would eventually become
``In Honor of You (George),'' one of 11 songs on Simon's new album,
``The Bedroom Tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All things conspired and came together in a moment that made
me feel as if I could go back again,'' says Simon, recalling that
transformational night during a phone interview from her business
office in New York. ``Even if I would feel tortured.'' As it turns
out, the process of writing and recording ``The Bedroom Tapes,''
Simon's first album of original music in half a decade, was
anything but torturous. Without a record label to suggest
directions, a manager pulling strings, or a producer to feed her
ideas, Simon _ at 54 _ had the freedom to find her way back to
music on her own terms.
</P>
<P>
   She taught herself how to operate the simplest equipment and
recorded songs on an eight-track console in her daughter Sally's
old bedroom (hence the album title) in her house on Martha's
Vineyard. Sometimes, Simon says, she would pick up an instrument
randomly to test a microphone and end up just leaving the cymbal
crash, or the tambourine shake, on the track.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of writing and recording that produced 20 songs, a
handful of musicians added additional parts. But much of Simon's
original, spontaneous work was left intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about choruses, or making them three minutes to
get on the radio,`` Simon says. ``It was so simple, because it was
the truth I wanted to express, via the medium of music, in as
unself-conscious a way as I could deliver it. I'm not a great
guitarist or pianist. I can't do anything fancy. I have always
relied on people who knew more than me. So it was all very new. But
there's something about relying on yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bedroom Tapes'' emerged on the heels of a long creative
slump for Simon. ``Letter Never Sent,'' from 1994, was her last
album of originals (``Film Noir,'' released in 1997, was a
collection of classics), and her experience supporting that record
jump-started a major crisis of confidence. ``The album didn't quite
hang together. The label expected ``Like a River'' to be an
important single, and it didn't perform. It was my first tour in 14
years,'' says the famously performance-shy Simon, ``and it felt as
if there wasn't really a machinery that was properly operating.
Also, none of my albums were in stores. I felt a lack of belief in
me by the people who were supposed to sell my records. And I lost
faith in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Simon's two children, Sally and Ben, were both
preparing to leave home. ``I got into this feeling, this downward
spiral, when you start questioning _ especially as you start
getting older _ your validity as an artist. With the kids getting
ready to leave, the identity I'd been hanging on to for many years
was leaving me. So I was lost. I was alone. My husband (businessman
Jim Hart) was there, and was wonderful, but I was alone in a very
deep way. And scared.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, after being diagnosed with breast cancer, Simon
underwent a mastectomy and several rounds of chemotherapy. She says
that fighting cancer was the key to reclaiming her musical voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way you battle a life-threatening illness is with
life. The thing that had always been there in my life was music.
Even if I didn't have an audience for it, and maybe I never would
have an audience, at that point I thought, `it's up to me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bedroom Tapes'' finds Simon candid as ever. On the song
``Scar,'' she examines her surgery in a poetic light: ``It's after
the knives and the sutures and needles/I'm left with an arrow that
points at my heart/I call it the seat of my sentimental sorrow/Gone
seems to be one of the sum of my parts.'' The album is a literate
and lovely return to contemporary confessional pop _ aptly
described by one of the singer's friends as the most Carly Simon of
Carly Simon albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I reconnected with that thing we call the stream, the
flow, the creative spirit. I guess I call it my art.'' However,
Fans shouldn't expect a tour any time soon. ``I would rather fast
for 150 days in the desert than tour,'' says Simon. ``I'm not that
comfortable in front of a lot of people. But I'll play a concert in
your town; I'll stop and stay for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Our town was, in fact, supposed to be her town. In 1998, Simon
bought a four-story townhouse on Beacon Hill, but after a more than
a year of renovations, she decided to sell it _ two weeks after
moving in. ``I wanted to live there so badly,'' says Simon. ``But I
also wanted to be anonymous, and found out that I wasn't. Some
neighbors didn't want me to live there. It started with a roof
deck, and then the acoustics, that's the words they used, weren't
worked out. I do play music, and the first night I was there the
neighbors wrote a letter saying `we're having a problem with your
acoustics.' I didn't need to live in a place that has ill will
toward me.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon had already given up her apartment on New York's Upper
West Side, and last year she moved lock, stock, and barrel to her
longtime second home on Martha's Vineyard. For the first time in
decades, Simon has consolidated under one roof, and she's happily
nesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know just where my nasal spray and cotton sheets are,'' she
marvels.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the future is concerned, Simon only will say, ``I have
so many things planned. A lot of it involves travel and playing
music in exotic places.'' And, yes, making another album of Carly
Simon songs.
</P>
<P>
   From her vantage point, Simon is sage about the trials and
tribulations she's endured. ``You don't get to grow older and not
have a little something happen to you. You have problems in
relationships, people lose faith in you, you get sick. It happens
to everybody. I don't feel singular. But I did feel I could tap
into the experience for other people. I realized, `Hey, I can put
notes together.' ''

WEATHER OR NOT, THE ACTION IS HOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last weekend was not exactly high summer on the Atlantic, with
high winds and low temperatures well below the traditional season
kickoff norm.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the weather, the fish are in. The spring mix
combines ground fish such as cod and tautog with market-sized
haddock, wolffish, plenty of mackerel, and striped bass in nearly
every area along the coast. Bluefish have been filling steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Area A: In the far north, from Saco River to Kittery, the
schoolie stripers are everywhere, with larger fish in the mix.
Herring in Great and Little Bay are forage, and live-lined herring
is the best bait. Plenty of stripers from Adams Point in Great Bay
downriver to the mouth of Little Harbor in Newcastle. Mackerel also
draw in the big stripers along these haunts. Plenty of striped bass
at Plum Island both along the oceanfront and well up the river, the
largest fish at Lawrence at the dam.
</P>
<P>
   Area B: Danvers River is full of schoolies and the waters of
Salem and Beverly. Saturday Night Ledge was the site of some good
striper catches, along with Newcombs and Kettle Ledge. Jeffries and
Tillies Ledge is still good cod water, while schools of mackerel
keep the stripers feeding around the waters of Gloucester and down
along the Marblehead rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Harbor is still ablaze with stripers, especially the
outer islands, according to Pete Santini of Fishing FINatics in
Everett. Lots of bass at Green Island, Brewster, and Deer Island.
Best bait is live mackerel and herring, but tube and worm rigs are
also working well with a slow retrieve through the watering tubes.
There are some flounder at Peddocks and Georges, with some cod
close to shore from 12-15 pounds. A 20-pounder was caught last
weekend at the B-Jigs with clams and worms. A couple of haddock are
rumored inside the B buoy.
</P>
<P>
   Area C: Plenty of cod and striper action along the South Shore,
from the rocks around North Cohasset to Minots, 3d and 4th Cliffs
at Scituate, and the North and South rivers. Lots of mackerel
busting in schools around Minots down to Green Harbor, and the
pollock that show up in spring along this shore are here in good
numbers. Some mackerel being jigged off the Gurnet with keeper cod
and pollock, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Area D: Both sides of the Canal are hot with bass and bluefish,
with leadheads taking big bass in the Canal. At the west end,
plenty of bluefish have been hitting top and midwater plugs, and
down into Buzzards Bay the scup fishing is in season. Cleveland
Ledge to the Falmouth side is where the action congregates. Also,
tautog over the Mattapoisett Rocks, and fluke moving into the
Mashnee area.
</P>
<P>
   Area E: The bass are small along the south Cape beaches, but the
bluefish are schooling in good numbers and size throughout Vineyard
Sound, including the regular Vineyard haunts _ South Beach, Wasque,
and all around the north side waters. Good bass around both
islands, with plenty of keepers at Sconset Surfside on Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Area F: Good-size bass at Provincetown, with plenty of blues in
the mix. Sand eels and mackerel are the bait of choice. Bluefish
are hitting the north side outer beaches, with some very good size
near shore. A few large bass in the mix, but most fish down around
Pleasant Bay are smallish.

   DECATUR, Ga. _ Howard Pugh, head usher, is on patrol. May the
good Lord have mercy on any child, or adult for that matter, who
dares to tread across the lobby of the Assembly of God Tabernacle
with so much as an open Coca-Cola in his hand. Because first he
will get the look, the alert glare of a hunting dog catching its
first scent of game. Then he will get the wag, the slightly palsied
shake of the left index finger. And then the voice, serious as a
heart attack and dripping with Pensacola pinesap: ``Son, this is
the Lord's house. And they just shampooed that carpet last week.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that Howard Pugh knows what is going on
in his lobby. So when Pugh, a 65-year-old white man with a bulbous
pink nose, spots 81-year-old Roy Denson slipping out of the
sanctuary, he doesn't even have to ask. He just knows. He knows
because he has seen Denson flee the 10:30 service time and again,
and it is always when one of the choir's black soloists moves to
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   This time it is Robert Lawson, a soulful tenor with a fondness
for canary-yellow suits. As he begins to sing, the Pentecostal
faithful gradually rise. First a few black members clap and sway.
Then more join in. Finally, the white members are moved to stand,
and before long the 2,000-seat sanctuary is washed over with
harmony. Stretching their arms toward the heavens, the congregants
weave a tapestry of pinks and tans and browns.
</P>
<P>
   But to Denson's ears, Lawson's improvisational riffs sound like
so much screeching and hollering. And so he sits there seething,
thinking about how he joined this church 56 years ago, how he
followed it from downtown Atlanta to the suburbs, how he hung the
Sheetrock with his own hands, and how the blacks are taking over
and the whites are just letting it happen.
</P>
<P>
   He gets angrier and angrier, listening to these boisterous black
folks desecrate his music, until he simply cannot bear it. ``I
ain't sitting there and listening to that,'' he mutters on his way
out. ``They're not going to take over my church.''
</P>
<P>
   And there waiting for him is Pugh, always with the same
smart-alecky question. Never mind that Pugh and his wife, Janice,
have themselves become uneasy about the direction of their church,
that they have been quietly contemplating a walk of their own.
``Now, Roy,'' Pugh begins, stroking his seafarer's beard, ``what
are you going to do when you get to heaven? Walk out of there,
too?''
</P>
<P>
   Back inside, the ecstatic singing has ended, the speaking in
tongues has melted into a chorus of hypnotic whispers and the
members of the Tabernacle have been invited to roam the sea-foam
carpet, welcoming visitors and greeting one another.
</P>
<P>
   They embrace, the white people and the black people, with long,
earnest hugs. Eletia Frasier, a Guyanese immigrant, kisses all who
come her way, whether she knows them or not. Brad Jackson wraps his
thick white arms around Eugene Glenn, a slender black man, and
jerks him cleanly off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Burch, a 6-foot-7 black man whose blue usher's blazer is a
tad short in the sleeves, saunters down the aisle with an
irrepressible grin. During the Sunday fellowship, Burch makes a
point of approaching older whites to gauge acceptance. Will they
offer hugs, or merely handshakes? Will they linger, or recoil?
</P>
<P>
   Halfway down the aisle, he encounters Madge Mayo, the spry
85-year-old widow of a pastor from the Tabernacle's segregated
days. She stands 4-foot-9 and keeps her luminescent white hair in a
tight bun.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Mayo could never have imagined hugging a
black man, and even now she is not sure she approves of the
integration of her church. But she has been touched by the
bigheartedness of the Tabernacle's black members. And like so many
of the whites who have stayed, she reasons that all believers are
going to the same heaven, so they might as well get used to one
another right here on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Mayo sees Burch heading her way and trots a few steps toward him
in her shiny black pumps. They smile fondly, and he bends at the
waist to embrace her. She pats Burch on the back and presses her
cheek against his, passing his test.
</P>
<P>
   It is a moment that would probably chafe some of his relatives,
who feel that he and his wife, Vanessa, are compromising their
blackness by attending ``the white church.'' But the Burches feel
blessed by the blendedness of the Tabernacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man,'' Ruben Burch reflects later about his encounter with
Mayo, ``30 or 40 years ago I would have been hung for just touching
this lady.''
</P>
<P>
   PRAYING SIDE BY SIDE
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen miles east of downtown Atlanta, a vast granite monolith
known as Stone Mountain looms over the flatness of DeKalb County.
Up on that mountain in 1915, the 20th-century Ku Klux Klan was
born. And virtually in its shadow, the Tabernacle, all brick and
glass and sharp angles, sits along Interstate 285 in the thick of
the Atlanta sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 years after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
scolded Christians for making 11 a.m. Sunday the most segregated
hour of the week, the Tabernacle is the rarest of religious
institutions in a nation where 90 percent of all congregations are
at least 80 percent one race. It is, to many of its 800 members, a
slice of heaven on earth, a church whose spirituality is magnified
by its multiracial character. What better evidence of God's
presence, they reason, than whites and blacks praying side by side?
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Tabernacle is not some liberal, integrated church
like the one nearby that took down its white stained-glass Jesus
and replaced him with a black one. It is deeply conservative,
socially and theologically. What draws the Pughs and the Burches
and so many others is the intensity of their Pentecostal faith,
which teaches that the Holy Spirit can move in the lives of all
believers, regardless of background.

FORMER CBS EXEC STILL PASSING THE PUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neal Pilson is a self-proclaimed hockey guy. He played in high
school, coached a minor league team in suburban New York and, not
too long ago, was playing in an over-30 league.
</P>
<P>
   He is a fan to say the least, and can recall dressing his son in
a hockey uniform the night before an early-morning practice to
ensure ease of transport. ``I wouldn't even wake him up,'' Pilson
said. ``I'd just put him on my shoulder, carry him to the car, and
by the time he woke up, we were at practice.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many like Pilson. He played the game, understands
the game, and remains one of its ardent supporters. ``Most
television viewers don't appreciate the difficulties of the
sport,'' Pilson said. ``Most people see a guy flip the puck to a
linesman. They make it look easy. But try it sometime. Very few
have actually tried to skate, stick handle, shoot, and avoid some
guy trying to knock your socks off.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilson also knows how hard it is to sell hockey in this country.
He was the president of CBS Sports for 14 years and was never able
to convince the network bean counters to acquire the rights to NHL
games. CBS was flush with sports deals at the time, including the
NFL, the NBA, and Major League Baseball. ``The perception about the
NHL was that it didn't generate an economic model that worked for
CBS,'' said Pilson, who started his own media consulting business
after he left CBS in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   CBS did but one NHL telecast during his tenure _ a game between
the New York Islanders and Philadelphia Flyers. The NHL didn't have
a network home in the mid-1970s. ``Unfortunately, CBS never put the
NHL on its radar screen,'' said Pilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking smaller ratings numbers, but (hockey) remains a
secure, exciting national sport. They must make sure that their
level of expectation doesn't exceed reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' in this case means ESPN and ABC, the NHL's two main
television partners. The first Stanley Cup championship game on
ESPN earned just a 1.9 rating. By comparison, the Red Sox-Yankees
game last Sunday night drew a 14.4.
</P>
<P>
   While the ratings have not grown significantly in the first year
of ESPN's six-year, $600-million-a-year deal with NHL, the network
points out that the key advertising demographic _ males 18-34 _ has
increased as much as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN and ABC have made the most of their cross-promotional
platforms. Last Saturday, Peter Jennings did a historical report on
the Stanley Cup trophy. Last month, ABC news reporter Brian Rooney
also did a report on the trophy. And while the reports appear to
blur the lines between journalism and self-promotion, Pilson said
the public doesn't seem to care about separation of journalism's
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``An argument could be made that their numbers would not be as
good as they are without all of the cross-promotion,'' Pilson said.
``Promotion doesn't hurt, but it doesn't guarantee ratings
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilson said the numbers are determined by the matchups, quality
of play, time of day, and competition on the other networks.
Another important element is star power. Michael Jordan, Tiger
Woods, Muhammad Ali _ they had the ability to draw viewers. Wayne
Gretzky didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The quality and creativity of television coverage is not the
problem. Most everything has been tried, from Fox's blue puck to
ice-level cameras to enhanced audio. Both ESPN and ABC have great
access to players during intermissions, and they have installed
cameras in the goals and high above center ice.
</P>
<P>
   What television can't do is give viewers the understanding of
actually playing hockey.
</P>
<P>
   As Pilson explains, most people have shot a free throw or thrown
a football or hit a tennis ball. Not so for shooting a hockey puck.
``Almost by definition, hockey is a unique sport,'' Pilson said.
``You need a rink. You need equipment. It's limited by its very
nature. Yes, there are a lot of rinks around the country. But they
are not as numerous as soccer fields or basketball courts.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pilson said, most Americans ``just don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hockey will always have that fundamental handicap,'' Pilson
said. ``But it's all about positioning. As long as the NHL doesn't
anticipate ratings in the same neighborhood as baseball or the NBA,
then the networks will be all right. It's a breakthrough that the
games are even on network television.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pastor Roger W. Brumbalow's mission statement, displayed
prominently in the lobby, challenges the congregation ``to be a
multiracial, multicultural maturing body of believers,'' and,
indeed, the church is blended in almost every way. Fifty-five
percent of the members are white, 43 percent are black and the rest
are Asian or racially mixed. Perhaps a third of the blacks are
foreign born, and the church flies 36 flags to honor their
homelands.
</P>
<P>
   The Tabernacle has had trouble integrating its eight-member
pastoral staff, a legacy of the Assemblies of God's history as a
white denomination. Its first black associate pastor resigned last
fall after two years. Over the last 13 months, Brumbalow, who is
white, filled two openings with white associate pastors before
finally hiring a black youth pastor in May. The board of deacons,
by contrast, has been integrated since 1994 and acquired a black
majority after elections in March.
</P>
<P>
   The choir is thoroughly mixed, and its praise-and-worship-style
music falls comfortably between the traditional country hymns of
white Pentecostalism and the thumping gospel funk of the modern
black church. Pastor Gary Smith, the music minister, jokes that his
choir would be faultless ``if we could just get the whites to clap
on time and just get the blacks to be on time.''
</P>
<P>
   The congregation does not mix only in the pews. Blacks and
whites visit each other in the hospital, share motel rooms at
retreats and attend potluck dinners at one another's homes. They
come together in kitchens and living rooms, forming circles of
prayer around an ailing old man or a hopeful young couple, then
laying hands on the supplicants' foreheads and shoulders. Visiting
one another's suburban homes, with their manicured lawns and
large-screen TVs, these accountants and teachers, nurses and
software consultants discover the common threads of their
middle-class lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the utopian imagery, for all the hope and faith that
the congregation has moved beyond race, the life of the church is
still driven by race in countless ways.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone has made accommodations of some kind. The whites,
mostly native Southerners, have been forced to confront their
racial assumptions and cede some control over church governance and
liturgy. The blacks have ventured from the safe harbor of the
African-American church and, in many cases, have suppressed
lifetimes of racial resentment and distrust.
</P>
<P>
   The little compromises can be detected any Sunday. They show in
the frustration of some black members with the regimentation of the
morning service, which opens with exactly 30 minutes of singing and
usually lasts precisely two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when we're praising God and then they just cut
it off,'' complains Robert Lawson. ``You can't do that. You can't
put God in a box.''
</P>
<P>
   Some whites, meanwhile, dart glances at black churchgoers who
they feel may be worshiping too exuberantly. They search for
delicate words to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of cases, the blacks are really more committed,''
says John F. Kellerman, a former deacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``More outgoing,'' agrees his wife, Grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the whites are more reserved, you know,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Behind such concerns, though, is the question at the heart of
the Tabernacle's future: Is the church simply enjoying a fleeting
moment of integration on the way to becoming predominantly black?
With the church growing rapidly and blacks joining at twice the
rate of whites, the Tabernacle could tip, like those neighborhoods
where blacks move in and whites eventually flee.
</P>
<P>
   The Tabernacle is a work in progress. But how far is it willing
to go? And how much are the Burches, the Pughs and the others
willing to concede in order to realize St. Paul's declaration that
``you are all one in Christ Jesus''?
</P>
<P>
   MAKING `COLORED' FRIENDS
</P>
<P>
   On a chilly Saturday afternoon in January, a racially mixed
crowd gathers at Howard and Janice Pugh's house for a catfish
feast. They segregate quickly, of course. The men decamp to the
garage, handicapping the Super Bowl and admiring Pugh's skill with
the deep-fat fryer. The women settle in the sun room, swapping
tales about the cold snap and the flu bug.
</P>
<P>
   When the group comes together for dinner, everyone laughs
knowingly at Eugene Glenn's stories about his 16-year-old
daughter's interest in buying a car and lack of interest in finding
a job. Before long, the joshing turns to the male love affair with
the channel changer and, eventually, to Pugh's vigilance in the
church lobby. The guests tease their host about how he was spotted
letting the youth pastor's wife cross the carpet with an open can
of soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're slipping, Howard,'' taunts William Turner, a black
deacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he chuckles, ``I'm getting soft.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as anyone, the Pughs have been transformed by the
church's integration. Having lived most of their lives with little
exposure to blacks, and little interest in gaining any, they now
count blacks from the church among their closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling before I got to know them was that there really
wasn't that many good blacks out there,'' Howard Pugh explains.
``After being around them and working with them, shoot, I don't
even think about them as colored anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Pugh's ``colored'' friends would prefer he use a
synonym. But in his mind, his choice of words marks some progress.
``Hey, I've come a long way,'' he says. ``I don't say nigger
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' his wife chimes in, ``they should see where
you've come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Where they both came from were country churches in the piney
woods of northwest Florida. When Howard was an infant, his mother
would slide him under the bench so he wouldn't get trampled while
they danced in the spirit. Janice was abandoned by her parents and
raised by a grandmother who enforced a strict Pentecostal code: no
smoking, no drinking, no dancing, no makeup, no short pants.

<P>
   They found each other 21 years ago via CB radio and began
courting over a cup of truck-stop coffee. Pugh, a widower, could be
gruff as an Alabama trooper. But he was also giving and
good-hearted and a fine provider. She was pretty and sweet and
recently divorced. She kept a Christian household and had no
problem letting her husband be head of it. Even today, she cooks
and cleans and lays out his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he has to do is put them on,'' she says, rolling her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he grins, sunk into his recliner, his toy poodle,
Pepe, in his lap, ``all them guys at the church comes up to me and
says, `Boy, your wife dresses you nice.'''
</P>
<P>
   After working for years in pulp mills, Pugh brought his bride to
Atlanta 19 years ago and started a lucrative business pouring
concrete in the ever-expanding suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   With its sizable black middle class and political structure, the
city was a shock. The Pughs had come up in a strictly segregated
culture. Howard Pugh remembers having little childhood exposure to
blacks, and during the civil rights movement he couldn't figure out
what all the fuss was about. As far as he could tell, blacks had
the same opportunities as he and other poor whites, even if they
did have their own neighborhoods and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to stay on my side of the fence and for them to
stay on theirs,'' he says. ``I never abused them. But they pretty
much knew that I was white and they were niggers and we just ran
our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Pugh, 46, says she was never taught prejudice but recalls
her grandmother's warning to avoid the black side of town. Her view
of black men, she says, came from movies that portrayed them
``raping a white woman or something.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, she had to confront her fears. ``You'd turn the TV
on and it's a black mayor and a black city council,'' she says.
``I'd say, `Howard, where did you bring me? Are there any white
people here?'''
</P>
<P>
   When the Pughs joined in 1992, the Tabernacle was perhaps 10
percent black. They had never worshiped with blacks before. But the
black folks tended to sit on the right side of the sanctuary,
separated from the whites by a demilitarized zone of empty pews.
``We came at a good time,'' Janice Pugh recalls. ``There weren't so
many of them that it was overwhelming. We could adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BURDEN OF BLENDING IN
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ruben and Vanessa Burch moved into a new house with
an orange-brick facade in a subdivision that is perhaps a third
white. Determined to raise their two daughters in an integrated
setting, the Burches had been impressed while house hunting that
white neighbors had waved to them, a black couple, from their
lawns.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the Pughs' fish fry, many of the same couples
gathered for a house-blessing dinner at the Burches'. To the
strumming of a guitar, the crowd welcomed the Holy Spirit into the
airy two-story home. ``Come in today, come in to stay,'' they
harmonized, ``come into my house, Lord Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Burch, tall, slender and poised, handed out cups of
olive oil, and the blacks and whites anointed doorknobs, bedposts
and televisions with slick smudges of oil. The ceremony ended when
the Burch family _ Ruben, Vanessa, 12-year-old Jessica and
7-year-old Gabrielle _ huddled in the center of the living room and
surrendered to the prayers of their friends. The guests gave them a
wall plaque, and little Gabby haltingly read, ``May the Lord bless
this home and keep you in the company of angels.'' Then spaghetti
was served.
</P>
<P>
   Like most black Southerners of their generation, the Burches
have experienced their share of racism. Ruben Burch, 46, grew up in
Albany, Ga., a stronghold of resistance to the civil rights
movement. His wife, 40, grew up in Blakely, a south Georgia town
whose high school still has separate homecoming queens and class
reunions.
</P>
<P>
   Both remember ``colored only'' water fountains and parental
warnings not to be caught on the white side of town after dark.
Vanessa Burch still recalls the indignity of hearing white children
call her mother by her first name. And then there was the day,
perhaps 15 years ago, when her white boss in a South Carolina bank
informed her that the one thing he hated was an ``uppity, educated
nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost knocked me to my knees,'' says Vanessa Burch, then a
teller at the bank. ``I walked off and went into the restroom and
cried because it hurt me so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burches reacted to all this in different ways. Ruben Burch,
happy-go-lucky and confident to a fault, says he never grew deeply
bitter. His mother shielded him from the worst affronts, and when
his high school integrated, he saw it as an opportunity to date
white girls, discreetly. ``You knew how far to take it,'' he says.
``I mean, you wouldn't walk down Broadway holding somebody's
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa was more defiant. When her school desegregated, her
white classmates learned that anyone who tossed a racial epithet
her way was liable to go home with bruises. At age 12, she dressed
down a white woman who had scolded her sick mother for sitting in
the white section of a doctor's waiting room. ``After that,'' she
says, ``Mama didn't take me too many times to the doctor's
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Their experiences left both Burches, though, with a strong
understanding that their world would be multiracial, and that
schooling, diction and personality would be important tools in
getting ahead. Those lessons were reinforced in the Navy, where
Ruben Burch spent 22 years as a medic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 they moved to Atlanta, where he found work inspecting
commercial waste-water systems. They looked for an Assemblies of
God church and found the Tabernacle, then about 30 percent black.
Before long they were fully involved, he as an usher, she as a
Sunday school teacher and both as scout leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the diversity,'' says Vanessa Burch, an administrative
assistant for a computer company. ``I wanted my children to grow up
with differences in a church so they could see that whenever they
went to heaven it wasn't going to be all black and it wasn't going
to be all white. It was going to be mixed.''

   A `WALK WITH THE LORD'  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Tabernacle was founded, in 1916, it was most definitely
not mixed. And it remained that way through most of its history,
moving twice to escape the migration of blacks into its
neighborhood. In the 1940s it affiliated with the Assemblies of
God, a historically segregationist Pentecostal denomination. But
ultimately, the church could outrun neither the changing
demographics of postsegregation Atlanta nor some stark fiscal
realities.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the Pughs arrived, an unmanageable mortgage put
the congregation in debt. To dig out, the church called as its
senior pastor Coy Barker, a onetime rodeo rider, and agreed to pay
him 25 percent of tithes and offerings. With a financial incentive
to fill the pews, Barker tapped the most readily available market _
the middle-class blacks flocking into the area.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, when the church's current building was completed, the
surrounding suburbs were in the midst of a stunning transformation.
In 1970 there was one black among the 11,000 residents in the
church's census tract. Twenty years later, two-thirds of the
residents were black.
</P>
<P>
   Barker, a typecast televangelist with silver hair, flashy
jewelry and a black Lincoln Town Car, had a high-stepping style
that mimicked the traditional black preacher. By the time he was
forced out in 1993, in the throes of a messy divorce, the church
was perhaps 20 percent black and on the road to financial recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, some whites left. Susan Carithers, a member since
birth, could never quite accept integration as God's will. Her
husband grew agitated, she says, because ``he just didn't want
black boys sniffing up to his daughter.'' They left in 1996,
shortly after a black man gave Susan Carithers a big hug during a
Sunday service.
</P>
<P>
   The Pughs could also have left, but they liked Brumbalow's
preaching and their son's participation in the youth group. And as
they got to know black members, they found they liked them, too. A
lot.
</P>
<P>
   The black churchgoers did not fit the Pughs' stereotypes. Howard
Pugh noticed that they did not loll around or always have their
hands out like the black men who smooth his concrete, the ones he
calls ``the boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today he draws distinctions between his black employees and
his black church friends. Sometimes he cannot recall his workers'
last names, though they have been with him for years. He says that
he occasionally has to bail one out of jail, and that if he drives
around a corner fast enough he will catch some lounging.
</P>
<P>
   But he admires the blacks at the Tabernacle. They work hard and
dress well, often better than the whites, and live in two-story
houses on well-tended lanes. ``As I began to be around them a lot
more,'' he says, ``I saw that there was a lot more of them trying
to benefit themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pughs held cookouts and invited mixed crowds, disregarding,
even slightly savoring, their white neighbors' stares. On Saturday
mornings Howard Pugh would round up a crew of church men, white and
black, to go paint a widow's house or serve soup to the homeless.
One Easter the Pughs took their black friends Paul and Rudine Hardy
to an all-white club for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, it was so funny,'' Mrs. Hardy says. ``I said:
`Janice, Janice. These people are all just looking.' They had all
this fancy food, and every time I chewed they was just looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Pugh sometimes gets weepy talking about her deep kinship
with Mrs. Hardy and other black women from church. She feels
connected to them spiritually and turns to them when she needs
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   As she has learned about the bigotry they face, she has come to
empathize. It isn't guilt exactly. She doesn't feel she owes black
people anything. After all, her life hasn't been so easy, either.
But she understands, and that is something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved to Atlanta,'' she says, ``I had never had any
occasion to know what these people were going through. I'd never
had anyone come up to me and say, `I was treated this way because I
was black.' When you hear someone say that, with tears in their
eyes, you know they just want to be loved. And I guess I connected
with them because I was the same way when I was a little girl. All
I wanted was to be loved.''
</P>
<P>
   As she sees it, God is using the Tabernacle's integration to
test ``whether you move on in your walk with the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's walk has been less steady. He remains capable of
offending black friends even as he beckons them into his life. They
recognize that he has come a long way, that he has a good heart.
But they also suspect that he continues to use the word
``colored,'' often to their faces, to make it clear that he, not
they, will define the terms of their relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a control thing,'' Janice Pugh says. ``He wants people to
know that he still knows the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, one of Howard Pugh's black friends decided to
confront him, fearing newcomers might be put off by his ways as
head usher. But the man later backed down. Don't major in minor,
his wife had advised him. ``I do value my friendship with Howard
and Janice,'' the man reasoned, ``and if it's my friendship with
them versus this, it's really very insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   Burch reacted much the same way at a retreat last year, when
Pugh told him a joke, the one about the black guy who moved next
door to the white guy:
</P>
<P>
   The white man was leaning over his fence as his new neighbor
mowed the yard. With each pass, the black neighbor taunted the
white man: ``I'm better than you are, I'm better than you are.''
Exasperated, the white man finally asked, ``What makes you so much
better than me?'' And the black man replied, ``I don't have a
nigger living next to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Ruben just about fell out,'' Pugh remembers. ``He didn't
have a problem with it.'' And, in fact, Burch says he didn't have
much of a problem with it, though he was surprised Pugh felt
comfortable enough to tell him the joke. ``That's just Howard,'' he
told himself. He let the moment pass, thinking that Pugh was like
an old car, sputtering down the highway: ``You just say, `Well,
this is just an old car smoking and we'll go ahead and pass it and
one day it'll give out and be gone.'''

   WHAT THE RELATIVES SAY
</P>
<P>
   The Burches may want to make sure, as Vanessa Burch puts it,
that their girls don't grow up ``in an all one-race anything.'' But
when it comes to their choice of church, they have been wounded by
second-guessing from their relatives, particularly Ruben Burch's
sister Jacalyn Ray. It has become personal, and at times ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wannabe thing,'' says Mrs. Ray, who attends a black
church. Her sister-in-law, she thinks, is too eager to make white
friends and entertain them in her home. ``Some people don't know
who they are and have to go somewhere to validate themselves. She
doesn't feel comfortable being black.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Burch cannot figure out what she did to provoke Ray,
other than marry her brother. But other family members, while more
tactful, do not fully reject Ray's assessment. Ruben Burch's
half-brother Frederick Caldwell has long noticed that Burch feels
most comfortable in interracial settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of Rick as my white brother,'' he laughs, using a
nickname. ``He has Caucasian features. Not facial features, but he
has a white body type. He can't dance. He'll wear plaid pants. He
played on the tennis team in school. He's a Newt Gingrich fan. I
wouldn't necessarily say he wants to be white, but he has opinions
not normally associated with a black man in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatives say they are also concerned that the Burches may
be sending their daughters mixed signals. ``I do know with Jessica
there's kind of a working out of who she is,'' says Caldwell. ``My
concern for Gabrielle and Jessica is that they have a healthy
respect for who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Burch concedes some concern that his daughters may be too
color-blind, that a life without overt discrimination has left them
with little racial identity. Someday, he fears, an act of bigotry
will shatter their naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he resents the suggestion that he and his family prefer
integration because they want to be white. He is comfortable with
who he is. ``I enjoy me,'' he says. ``And I feel if you don't know
me you're missing out.'' As for his sister, he says: ``She's not in
touch with reality. I mean, how do we want to be white? Because we
want different things, want to live in different neighborhoods? No,
she's totally wrong. I think it's a chemical imbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica, tall and outgoing like her parents and engagingly
mature for her age, acknowledges inner conflict over racial
identity. But it is not that she rejects her blackness or wants to
be white. Rather, it is that she feels torn between her parents'
insistence on living an integrated life and her black peers'
suspicion of anyone who does.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents insist that she and her sister speak ``proper
English'' and scold them gently if they slip into black slang. But
her classmates tease her relentlessly for her speech and for having
white friends, and sometimes she cannot resist the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do talk improper English, or ebonics, with black friends,''
she admits. ``Maybe I think they'll pick on me if I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she decided to drop her white friends to placate
the black ones. But she felt distracted, her grades suffered and
she concluded that God was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally told myself that it doesn't matter what they think
about me, it doesn't matter what color I hang out with,'' she says.
``I have too much respect for who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Vanessa Burch is annoyed by her daughter's
problems and her in-laws' carping. But it has all made her think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think long and hard about it to see, you know, could this
really be true,'' she says. ``And then I go and ask other people,
`Do you think I try to be white?' And they're like: `What? No. You
couldn't be if you wanted to.' It used to really weigh on me and I
used to pray about it. `Lord, what is it? Show me. If I'm doing
something to make people see me like this, show me.'''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't come. People just don't understand, she says, that she
is motivated by pragmatism, not racial treason. The reality is that
her daughter will face a white world, with certain rules for
getting ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that being black is one strike against us,'' she says
``and in the business world, where she's going to have to compete,
being a woman is two against her. So I want her to have enough
education that they can't resist her. I want her, when she gets up
to speak, that they're like, `Wow, who is that?' And believe me,
voice and articulation get attention.''
</P>
<P>
   She is trying, she says, to help her daughters realize that
there are no limits, that the restraints and prejudices of her own
youth have been lifted. They can do anything, live anywhere, even
someplace more extravagant than their new three-bedroom house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to live in that house on the hill over there,'' she
challenges them, ``you can live there. You have the same rights as
the next person before you, beside you, behind you, around you. All
of you can do the same thing. Once upon a time we couldn't. But now
we can.''
</P>
<P>
   A COLOR-BLINDNESS TEST
</P>
<P>
   There was little chance that the Burches and Pughs would miss
the wedding of Dorothea Lemon and Curtis Lockridge last June. It
was to be the Tabernacle's first big interracial ceremony, and as
Madge Mayo explained it, ``Something is about to happen that we
haven't all fully digested.''
</P>
<P>
   The bride, 43 and black, and the groom, 58 and white, had both
recently been widowed. The two couples had been friendly at church,
and Lockridge and Lemon comforted each other through their grief.
Before long, they were holding hands through the Sunday service and
scribbling notes on the church bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I luv you, Curtis,'' she would write.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad,'' he would respond.
</P>
<P>
   It raised some eyebrows when Brumbalow announced their
engagement. One elderly white lady asked if Scripture permitted
mixed marriages, and he told her there was no prohibition. Blacks
and whites asked if it was wrong to want their children to marry
within their races. He said it wasn't, and made a point of telling
the men's group that he was not encouraging interracial dating.

 DECATUR: interracial dating.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon of the wedding, Vanessa Burch slid into a pew
toward the back. ``What are these people thinking?'' she remembered
wondering. ``How many are going to be in an uproar, and how many
aren't going to be back?''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Pugh recognized that the couple were grownups and could
do as they pleased. But interracial relationships just went against
his upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Lord,'' he thought as the bride walked down the aisle. But
by the end of the afternoon, Pugh could not help smiling. The
couple looked awfully cute, and very much in love. The ceremony had
been elegant, the reception lavish. ``I'll tell you the truth,'' he
says. ``I haven't seen many white folks' weddings put on like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some remained uneasy. ``The thing that worries me most,''
says Madge Mayo, ``is that this is going to turn things loose for
the young people and it's going to get, I shouldn't say entangled,
but I'd just say more mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   SENSE AND SENSITIVITY
</P>
<P>
   What Janice Pugh cannot understand, despite her newfound
empathy, is why black folks remain obsessed with race, why they
can't just let it all go. She and Rudine Hardy talk about it from
time to time, sitting on a green leather couch outside the
sanctuary. Hardy will wonder why the pastoral staff is so white,
and Pugh will bristle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to stop being so sensitive about all this,'' she will
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand,'' Hardy will respond. ``You're not
black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not black, and I never will be black,'' she will answer.
``I just think there are other issues out there that you have to be
concerned about that have nothing to do with race.''
</P>
<P>
   She thinks about it often. The church should be about love, and
love should know no color. ``If I were in their shoes,'' she says,
``I would take the attitude that the past is past. You have to go
on, and the blacks now, this is the time for them. They're more
accepted now.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Tabernacle is an island, and a refuge, it is often
hard to accept the fact that racial tensions lie just beneath the
surface, vulnerable to exposure from the slightest scratch. But the
island is within the world, and in the world there is no refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Watson, a children's pastor, learned that lesson when she
was rebuked by a black parent for referring affectionately to her
toddlers as ``monkeys.'' Another youth pastor got an earful about a
Bible lesson that equated the color black with sin.
</P>
<P>
   But those flare-ups do not rival what happened last summer with
the Homebuilders, a Sunday school class for couples. Until two
years ago it was led by a white couple, and attendance was
predominantly white. Then Enefiok Umana, a deacon from Nigeria, and
his wife, Eno, assumed the leadership, and the class became
overwhelmingly black.
</P>
<P>
   Many blacks concluded that whites were simply unwilling to
submit to black leadership. And their suspicions were stoked one
August morning when two associate pastors interrupted class to
introduce a white couple as leaders of a Bible study being started
for younger couples. One pastor, Ray Martin, added that the
Homebuilders would come under the new class' ``umbrella.''
</P>
<P>
   After church, the blacks huddled in the parking lot and burned
up the phone lines. Some wrote letters of protest. The implication
was clear, they felt. The church was starting a white class for
those unwilling to attend the black-led class. And the bit about
the umbrella really set them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a kick in the behind to me,'' says Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Brumbalow ate lunch at William and Lula Turner's house
that day. And as they told him of the discontent they and other
blacks were feeling, the pastor started to weep and vowed that the
Enemy _ meaning the Devil _ would not divide his flock. But he had
to leave town the next day, and without his intervention the flames
raged on.
</P>
<P>
   The associate pastors were flabbergasted by the reaction and
wounded that the blacks could think there was racial intent. ``I
really thought they were a little further down the healing curve,''
Martin says. ``It let me know that we're dealing with people that
still have some wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with class members, Martin acknowledged that
the word ``umbrella'' had left the wrong impression. What he had
meant, he says, was simply that the two classes would be parallel
ministries that would occasionally come together for functions.
</P>
<P>
   When Brumbalow returned, he took charge of damage control,
delaying the new class to let emotions calm. The next night, though
exhausted from his trip, he made a point of attending a
Homebuilders potluck dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the new class finally began, it was attended mostly
by whites. And when the new group held a retreat, only one
Homebuilders couple chose to attend.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO PREACH ON RACE
</P>
<P>
   Two Sundays after the Homebuilders incident, Brumbalow did
something he had hardly ever done. He preached about race. ``I
don't normally get this blunt,'' he began, slapping his hands for
punctuation, ``but I will get this blunt this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say to you of color and you that are white'' _ he
was screeching like the brakes on a train _ ``that if you look at a
person based on the color of their skin and you evaluate them right
then and there, then, my friend, you have missed the purpose of the
love of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he says, it takes a while to catch on _ to comprehend
that God is working a miracle at the Tabernacle so people might
have a glimpse of heaven. ``When I look across this congregation,''
he says, ``I understand what God is doing. I understand the eternal
kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Brumbalow recognizes that not everyone was brought up that way.
In fact, he wasn't brought up that way. Growing up near Atlanta, he
didn't really know any blacks, and he wasn't particularly godly. It
was only after some wild days as a rock guitarist with a band
called Completely Souled Out that he found God and his future wife,
Becky, at a Pentecostal revival. A short time later, he left for
Vietnam, where he won decorations for heroism.

<P>
   Carjackers forced Peter Behr to strip to his underpants. One
kicked him in the face. Another shoved a pistol in his mouth. A
third put a hunting knife to the throat of his 15-year-old son.
After commandeering his Mazda outside a shopping complex in
Nairobi, the carjackers became annoyed. Their hearts had been set
on a Toyota. When they discovered their mistake, they drove it and
its occupants to the outskirts of Kenya's capital and
pistol-whipped Behr and his son, Glen. The robbers then walked
away, leaving the car keys.
</P>
<P>
   The Behrs drove straight to a police station. When the Kenyan
police found out that the Mazda had not been stolen and that its
owner and his son were neither dead nor dying, they said, in
effect, no harm, no foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to know,'' whispered Behr, 47, a
third-generation Kenyan who retired as a white hunter when going
after big game was banned 23 years ago and is now a safari guide.
``I have been jumped by a leopard, but nothing was as scary as that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   He whispered his hijack story as we were sitting together in his
Land Rover in the middle of a herd of about 60 elephants grazing in
the Masai Mara game reserve. It was dawn. The only noise they made
was when they wrapped their trunks around clumps of dew-drenched
grass, ripping them from the earth. This was background music to
the white hunter's sotto voce story about his adventures with the
Nairobi criminals four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When I visited Peter Behr and his wife, Louise, at Masai Mara
early this year, it seemed as if the animals had come together on
the mile-high equatorial plain and decided to throw a party. Soft
rains had delayed the coming of the dry season. Gazelles chased
each other on the plain. Fat lions slept in the wondrously green
grass. The reserve, just a half hour by air from Nairobi, was all
dressed up for what should have been prime time in the tourist
season. But there was hardly a human around.
</P>
<P>
   During the two nights I spent at Behr's small but splendid camp
beside the Mara River, called Olonana, there were just two tourists
_ and they were there by sheer chance. A tour operator had sent
them to there after their walking safari in another Kenyan game
reserve had been canceled for lack of people.
</P>
<P>
   There is a link, of course, between the lack of paying customers
in paradise and the carjacking that haunts Behr. It's a
canary-in-the-coal-mine connection. The decline of tourism tracks
the decline of nearly everything in Kenya. Kenya was once a
celebrated exception to the rule of misrule in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   When I lived in Nairobi and traveled across the continent as a
reporter in the second half of the 1980s, it was always a relief to
come home. Kenya simply worked better than the rest of black-ruled
Africa. When I returned to Kenya this year after an 11-year
absence, the change was staggering. Roads were in ruins, telephones
barely worked during business hours and the school system was on
the verge of collapse. As a result, Western governments and
investors had turned their backs on the country.
</P>
<P>
   After years of daily flights, Lufthansa and Air France had
halted passenger service. In the 1990s foreign investment fell to a
fifth of previous levels. Major donors, including the United
States, had all but ended aid to the government. The coffee and tea
industries were in decline because of corrupt management that
allowed the state to bleed profits from farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, earnings from tourism, a cornerstone of the
economy and a key source of foreign currency, had slid nearly 40
percent in five years. Half the country's tourist beds had gone
empty since 1997. Kenya lost its dominance in the African safari
trade, according to American travel agents, as many travelers opted
for game-drive vacations in Botswana, South Africa and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? It is one of Africa's most familiar _ and saddest
_ stories since self-rule spread across the continent in the 1960s.
A one-man regime ruined the country to preserve itself. President
Daniel arap Moi, who is in his mid-70s and has been in office for
22 years, ran his country into the ground so that he might have a
few more years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's fall is especially disturbing because it could easily
have been averted. Moi's government strangled an economy that was
vibrantly alive. It fomented ethnic violence where there was none,
triggering tribal bloodshed during election years. Displaced
Kenyans didn't vote, and Moi won disputed elections in 1992 and
1997. In the process, he crippled a tourist industry that thrived
on the passion of travelers who were enchanted by Kenya and who
went home to spread the word about an African paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Crime, which has been scaring off foreign tourists for years,
has reached a level that alarms many Kenyans. The Standard, a
Kenyan daily, wrote in an editorial this year that residents of
Nairobi ``yearn for the days when they only dreaded nightfall.
These days women are raped in broad daylight, muggings pass
unnoticed, murders are committed with relative impunity, while
carjackings are now the rule rather than the exception.''
</P>
<P>
   When I read that editorial, it struck me as a bit over the top.
But when I walked across Nairobi on a Saturday morning to pick up
an airplane ticket, I wandered into a shootout. That afternoon,
students at the University of Nairobi rioted for the third day
running. What got them started was an attack by ruling-party thugs
on opposition members of Parliament. Kenyan policemen had stood by
and allowed the thugs to beat up the opposition lawmakers. Then the
policemen arrested the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent students from busting up the Norfolk Hotel, which
abuts the university and is the oldest tourist establishment in
Nairobi, security guards with clubs took up positions in front of
the hotel's Lord Delamere Veranda. White tourists retreated to the
hotel bar, where some of them drank tea and tried to concentrate on
books about a gracious Kenya that used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Their preferred diversion was ``Out of Africa,'' Karen Blixen's
memoir of a coffee farm she owned in the 1920s at the foot of the
Ngong Hills. When I moved to Nairobi in 1985, the film version of
``Out of Africa,'' which starred Meryl Streep and won the Oscar for
best movie, had just been shot on location in Kenya. When I
returned this year, another big-budget movie, ``I Dreamed of
Africa,'' starring Kim Basinger, had also just been filmed. It,
too, was based on a memoir about living on a farm in Kenya. But for
security reasons it could not be shot inside the country.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers, most of them white and many with money to burn, have
been part of the economic backbone of Kenya since the turn of the
century. The Swahili word ``safari'' entered popular American usage
after Theodore Roosevelt arrived in 1909 and hired 500 porters to
follow him into the bush with everything from collapsible bathtubs
to cases of Champagne. Soon thereafter, socialites, plutocrats,
maharajas, royalty and movie stars began to parade across Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to understand why. ``You emerged into thousands of
acres of rolling English parkland, a haze of blue lawn rising and
falling to the horizon, untouched by the plow and apparently
uninhabited,'' wrote James Fox in ``White Mischief,'' an account of
upper-class British shenanigans in highland Kenya in the 1920s and
'30s.
</P>
<P>
   In one highland enclave called Happy Valley, not far from
Nairobi, more than a few white settlers succumbed to what became
known as ``the three A's'' _ altitude, alcohol and adultery. By the
1980s, Kenyan entrepreneurs had perfected the high-end safari. They
were helped along by ``Out of Africa,'' which transformed the
upper-crust safari into a booming business that, at its height in
the late '80s and early '90s, brought in about a third of Kenya's
hard-currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The ``product,'' as tourist operators call Kenya's natural
offerings, had become an expensive fantasy that was part Happy
Valley, part Hollywood and part Ralph Lauren: balloon rides at dawn
over the wildebeest migration, followed by a Champagne breakfast,
followed by a nap in a tent with a hot shower and flush toilet.
Bush boutiques selling crisp cotton outfits of the sort that Meryl
Streep/Karen Blixen wore when she had a farm in Africa. Nouvelle
cuisine dinners served in candlelit mess tents by Masai waiters
with impossibly high cheekbones. The smell of wood smoke, the
perfume of frangipani and somewhere in the near distance _ the
chance of white mischief.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of fantasy that Peter and Louise Behr were
selling _ or trying to sell _ when I visited them at their camp.
Even though the place was nearly empty, they maintained five-star
standards in the bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is your shampoo, your conditioner and your shower gel,''
said Maurice Tissah, the steward who showed me to my tent on a high
bank above the Mara River. The tent was the size of a pricey hotel
suite in Paris and was done up 1920s style, with new but
old-looking steamer trunks, brass lanterns, a pasha-style pull rope
that turned on the lights and diaphanous folds of mosquito netting
encircling two king-size beds. After I showered with hot water
(using the gel), I sat out on the porch of my tent, watching hippos
gambol in the river.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, during our game drive, Behr told me that the
safari trade was unlikely to survive. He said insecurity had taken
too firm a hold in Kenya for tourism to recover.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when state-sponsored, election-year tribal violence
exploded along the Kenyan coast, the International Monetary Fund
got fed up with Moi. Citing corruption and poor governance, the IMF
suspended its $220 million aid program. Nearly all donor money to
the government has since dried up. Without aid or tourism, Kenya's
economy went dead in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to get the money flowing again, Moi appointed a sworn
enemy, Richard E. Leakey, the famous paleoanthropologist and
conservationist, to head the civil service and clean up corruption
in Kenya. Five years ago, Moi accused Leakey of being a racist, a
colonialist and a foreigner. (Leakey is a third-generation Kenyan.)
Thugs from Moi's ruling party attacked and flogged Leakey, who had
founded an opposition party and was considering a run for the
presidency. And yet last July Moi made Leakey the second most
powerful man in the country. If nothing else, Moi's choice of
Leakey as a corruption-buster was a masterstroke of public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   It intrigued donors, giving Moi's government more credibility
than it has had in a decade. Western diplomats regarded Leakey as
the Kenyan least likely to be played by Moi for a fool. And since
he took over the civil service, there have been impressive
improvements in the way the government keeps track of money and in
the quality of people appointed to run key government agencies,
like the port of Mombasa. Moi also got serious as never before
about luring back tourists.
</P>
<P>
   He named his closest adviser and longtime business associate,
Nicholas Biwott, as minister of tourism, trade and industry. Biwott
is no Leakey. He is tainted by allegations of corruption and has
been accused of involvement in the murder of a rival who, at the
time of his death, happened to be Kenya's foreign minister.
Biwott's appointment suggests that while Moi is more interested
than ever before in reviving tourism, he is not all that keen on
fundamental change in the way his regime does business.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived in Nairobi, I asked to see Biwott and was ushered
into his office less than 12 hours later. This was a shock. When I
was writing critical stories about Kenya in the late '80s, Biwott
stood on the floor of Parliament and denounced me by name as ``the
well-known girlfriend'' of South African spies. When I telephoned
him then to explain that I was a man, he paused for a long time,
chuckled and said we must get together soon, but refused ever to
see me _ until tourism took a nose dive and Moi told him to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   During more than two hours of conversation, Biwott, a short,
gray, gimlet-eyed man in a bright blue suit, was invariably polite,
even a bit wistful. I didn't have the heart to bring up the
business about the South African spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we squandered quite a bit,'' he said, referring to
Kenya's lost reputation. ``We need to work with the international
press. It is that negative publicity that has killed us. That is
why I am very, very pleased to receive you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Biwott is the best minister of tourism in 25 years,'' says
Mahmud Jan Mohamed, chairman of the Kenya Tourism Federation and
managing director of Serena Hotels, the largest chain of safari
lodges in East Africa. Still, Biwott has an international
reputation as one of Kenya's most corrupt ministers.
</P>
<P>
   During his 10 years as minister of energy, Biwott was linked in
the Kenyan press with a number of kickback schemes and
noncompetitive contracts awarded to companies in which he had an
interest. Even worse, he became a prime suspect in the 1990 murder
of the Kenyan foreign minister, Robert Ouko. As a result, Moi fired
Biwott and later ordered him arrested. But after a short stint in
jail and a slightly longer stay in the political doghouse, Biwott
returned to the good graces of the president, a fellow member of
the Kalenjin tribe. The murder remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   To help Moi win re-election in 1992, Biwott paid Kalenjin youths
to start ethnic clashes with rival tribes, according to testimony
given at a parliamentary inquiry into the violence. The violence
has continued off and on ever since and is a major reason why
tourists have been scared away from Kenya. As Biwott smiled wanly,
I asked him about the charges of corruption, murder and fomenting
violence that terrified tourists. Who was he, I asked, to put a
welcoming face on Kenya?
</P>
<P>
   ``All these perceptions are false,'' he said, without raising
his voice or seeming annoyed. ``I am neither powerful nor corrupt.
I do my work diligently, according to rules and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked about the apparent conflict of interest involved in his
being in charge of tourism. He owns Air Kenya, an airline that with
the collapse of the road system has become the lifeline of the
safari industry. He also has major interests in a number of tourist
hotels and lodges. ``When we are in government, we don't get
involved in private business,'' he said, his smile tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Although numbers are down, wealthy tourists continue to travel
to Masai Mara. Almost none of them, though, go by car. They fly out
from Nairobi, usually on Biwott's Air Kenya planes, skipping six
spine-crunching hours on bad roads. But they also miss a journey I
regard as one of the marvels of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   From Nairobi, the road climbs 2,000 feet up the Kikuyu
escarpment to where the air has the bracing purity of the Scottish
highlands. The rolling hills are covered with the unearthly Day-Glo
green of ripening tea. Then, quite suddenly, the road comes to what
seems to be the edge of the earth _ the eastern wall of the Great
Rift Valley. Far below, down through the heat rising from the floor
of the valley, dormant volcanoes march off into an impossibly
distant horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Having been away from Kenya for so long, I had forgotten the
country's capacity to inspire wonder. During the long, dusty drive,
I found myself making plans to return to Kenya for a vacation. I
wanted to believe that Biwott and Moi and maybe even Leakey could
somehow work together to reverse Kenya's decline, revive living
standards and make the country safe for tourists. When I got out of
the sun, I got over it.

 DIANE WARREN: THE LOVE MACHINE OF POPULAR MUSIC

 c.2000 Rob Tannenbaum  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you own a radio, you know her songs. In the lucrative field
of Top 40 songwriting, Diane Warren is like Michael Jordan, the New
York Yankees or Wal-Mart. One of the summer's most expensive
movies, ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' which opens Friday, features a new
Warren song, ``Painted on My Heart,'' recorded by the Cult.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, 43, is arguably the most successful songwriter in music:
three of her songs, Toni Braxton's ``Un-Break My Heart,'' Celine
Dion's ``Because You Loved Me'' and Aerosmith's ``I Don't Want to
Miss a Thing,'' were among the biggest hits of the '90s. Other
writers have had equal success for a year, or a few. But no one can
match Warren's sustained highs. Since the mid-1980s, she has
written more pop hits than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, pop music mostly maintained the Broadway division
of labor: writers wrote; singers sang. Then came Bob Dylan, whom
the great Brill Building songwriter Doc Pomus once called ``the
worst thing that ever happened'' to the trade because he inspired
mediocre talents to write, which put the veterans out of business.
Now, deep into the MTV era, labels favor artists who look good over
those who write, which has put songwriters back in business, and in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Songwriters usually remain anonymous, but as with all dynasties,
Warren's success has inspired hatred. A writer for an alternative
paper in Seattle called her ``the execrable Diane Warren.'' Even
artists who benefit from her songs express ambivalence; Aerosmith's
singer, Steven Tyler, has called Warren ``a genius,'' then moments
later said that a lot of her songs are ``'expletive' see-through.''
A deal with the group to record ``Painted on My Heart'' fell
through shortly before the final deadline, which Warren calls ``a
bit of a slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   The company she owns, Realsongs, grossed $25 million from her
copyrights last year, according to an executive there. Warren has
even become a force in Hollywood; she wrote the title song for
``Music of the Heart,'' which earned an Oscar nomination for
original song, her fourth consecutive nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``sync fee'' for use of a song in a film is among the
highest in the business, according to an executive who has worked
with her, at $150,000 to $175,000. The songs ``are worth every
penny,'' says Kathy Nelson, president of music at Buena Vista
Motion Picture Group, who hired Warren to customize songs for
``Armageddon'' and ``Con Air'' _ which, respectively, grossed $554
million and $224 million worldwide, the latter helped immeasurably
by Warren's smash ``How Do I Live,'' which was a simultaneous hit
for both LeAnn Rimes and Trisha Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   Having a movie theme on the radio and MTV provides ``a constant
advertisement for the film,'' says Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced
both movies. Bruckheimer sends scripts to Warren before filming
starts ``to get her involved as soon as I can.'' She has become his
unofficial in-house writer; aside from her single for ``Gone in 60
Seconds,'' she wrote four songs for ``Coyote Ugly,'' about an
aspiring songwriter who works in a rowdy bar, to be released in
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give people a hit, and they want to work with you,''
Warren says.
</P>
<P>
   In music and words, Warren's songs express epic sentiments with
unabashed fervor and describe the intense passions many people feel
but can't freely express. Yet the songwriter _ a funny, informal
woman who lives with two cats and four birds (including a cherished
parrot named Buttwings) _ is far more sarcastic than sentimental.
``People who know me well say, 'I can't believe you write these
songs,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She has a reputation, even in the music business, for being
vulgar. Her sense of humor, which she terms ``pretty twisted,''
focuses on body parts and body noises, and she swears like a
teen-ager in detention. She dislikes travel, has no hobbies and
rarely takes time out from a seven-day workweek, except for what
she laughingly calls ``much-needed therapy.'' And most
surprisingly, she hasn't had a relationship in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Even extremely successful people, accustomed to sacrifice and
ambition, worry about Warren's monomaniacal commitment. ``I urged
Diane a number of years ago to get into therapy,'' says her friend
David Geffen, ``because I think it's important to have balance in
life, and she did not have it. Diane simply works.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren once asked her therapist, ``Why am I in therapy?'' The
therapist, she says, answered: ``You're successful, you're
attractive, you're smart and your best friend's a parrot. That's
why you belong in therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren works in the established language of pop songwriting: she
rhymes ``heart'' with ``apart,'' ``pain'' with ``rain,'' ``baby''
with ``crazy.'' Her songs use elemental imagery: more rain than
Portland in April, more stars than a planetarium and frequent
references to fire, sun, rivers, tears and other cinematic cues.
The sentiments are broad enough to permit a wide appeal. This
vocabulary is unpremeditated, she says, the inevitable result of
her first and most enduring romance: the radio.
</P>
<P>
   She describes herself, with the relish of the vindicated, as the
worst music student in history. Diane Eve Warren grew up in Van
Nuys, Calif., ``beyond fanatical'' about songs even in adolescence.
A guitar teacher ``told my parents I had no future in music'' and
requested she not return. Her first professional income was
accompanied by an ignominious bruise: at 14, she was hired to sing
at a Venice restaurant, but after one song, the owner paid her $25
to stop. (Almost 30 years later, she still has crippling stage
fright. ``Even if I'm getting an award, I can't even breathe.'')
</P>
<P>
   Her two sisters are 11 and 14 years older, and partly as a
result, Warren spent much of her time alone. Her solace was the
radio, and extended listening infused her with a populist
aesthetic: the best songs are the ones people like. The writers she
grew up hearing _ Carole King and Gerry Goffin, Jerry Leiber and
Mike Stoller, Burt Bacharach and Hal David, Stevie Wonder, John
Lennon and Paul McCartney _ are still her favorites. The heyday of
pop, she says, was the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is good stuff now _ my stuff.'' She laughs. ``That's a
joke.'' Even at 15, she thought she was great. ``No one else did.
Except my dad.'' Her father, David Wolfberg, sold insurance and
``changed his name to make it more palatable to anti-Semitic
people,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Although her mother ``would always yell at my dad and say, 'Why
did you get her that guitar?' '' he promised to support her writing
efforts as long as she stayed in college. She was indifferent to
the classes she took and plotted every action toward the goal of
writing hit songs. She briefly worked as a messenger but was fired
for giving tapes of her songs to music executives.
</P>
<P>
   By her early 20s, she was depressed and angry that she hadn't
yet written a hit, she says. Warren tells these stories while
sitting in a lounge off her writing office, nicknamed the Cave, a
small, claustrophobic pen, maybe 10 by 12 feet, with ``only room
for me and the cockroaches.'' Cassette tapes are stacked in towers
and piled precariously on every flat surface. A framed copy of her
first million-dollar check sits on the grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   It is said the room hasn't been cleaned in 15 years, and the
legend is believable. It is ``the most intimate place'' in her
life, Warren says, and company isn't welcome. When I trespass
inside to note the room's contents, she turns visibly anxious. She
sticks to sets of habits: she has pairs of lucky socks, and she
gets to the office at a certain time each day. Her therapist has
diagnosed a slight case of obsessive-compulsive disorder, she says.
``But whatever. Whatever gets the work done.''
</P>
<P>
   After Warren wrote her first hits in the mid-'80s, including
Laura Branigan's ``Solitaire'' and DeBarge's ``Rhythm of the
Night,'' she sued the publisher she worked for, charging nonpayment
of royalties. While the lawsuit was pending, no other publisher
would sign her, so she published her own songs, an incalculably
important factor in her success.
</P>
<P>
   Though its rules sometimes seem as secret as Masonry, song
publishing is a $6 billion annual business. A No. 1 single can
gross anywhere from $250,000 to $4 million. Not all of this money
goes to the songwriter. Publishers typically take 25 percent of
mechanical royalties, the money generated by albums sales; at the
current mechanical rate of 7.55 cents, one song on a record that
sells six million copies yields about $450,000. And performance
royalties, earned each time a song is heard on radio or TV, are
usually split equally between publishers and writers. Warren almost
never writes with anyone else, so publishing her own songs has
literally saved her millions of dollars in shared earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is renowned for her tenacity in ``plugging'' songs. When
Cher didn't want to record ``If I Could Turn Back Time,'' a song
that revived her career, Warren dropped to her knees and begged.
She calls programmers at key radio stations and asks them to play
her singles. And she regularly phones a small circle of top
executives, producers and artists, sings them a song that's only
half-finished and asks, ``Do you want to record it?'' _ a practice
one executive calls ``very unusual.'' Her doggedness is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call and say you're gonna record one of her songs, she
says, 'Why not record two?''' says Nancy Russell, Trisha Yearwood's
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Where other top writers specialize in one genre, Warren has had
hits on the pop, R&AMP;B, Latin, dance, country and even Christian
charts. (She occasionally withholds songs from people she doesn't
like; although, she says with a laugh, ``If they sell 10 million
records, I might change my mind.'') Her songs have been recorded by
Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey,
Tina Turner, Patti LaBelle, Gloria Estefan, Reba McEntire, Whitney
Houston, Ricky Martin, 'N Sync, Christina Aguilera and Britney
Spears. All that success has had an effect on Warren. ``Maybe I'm
not as angry as I was before,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Warren paid close to $3 million to buy from
David Geffen a villa in the Hollywood Hills. An ascetic in a
hedonistic industry, Warren doesn't seem to own anything expensive,
aside from her house and a two-seat Aston Martin convertible, or to
enjoy her money. Her single-minded goal is validation, through
getting her songs on the radio. In her living room, which has a
view of Los Angeles from downtown to the mountains, hangs a signed
photograph of Irving Berlin, whom she calls ``kind of a hero of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   There are striking similarities between Warren and Berlin, a
hard-driving immigrant Jew who owned a publishing company and
rarely wrote personal songs. As Laurence Bergreen wrote in his
biography of the composer, Berlin ``was driven by the sublimation
of his erotic impulses. While his friends frolicked in bed, Irving
remained at his piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren says: ``I can relate to that. It's ironic that people are
falling in love to my songs, and maybe somewhere out there, the
person of my dreams is hearing it but can't really get to me.'' Her
last relationship was with Guy Roche, who is the producer and
co-writer of Aguilera's recent ``What a Girl Wants.''
</P>
<P>
   She likens the writing process to Method acting: she imagines a
character, in love or in misery, and then, ``For the whole week, or
however long I'm writing that song, I'm that person.'' Although she
has been single for a long time, she says, ``I know what it's like
to have a broken heart,'' even if the experiences she names are all
related to music: being turned down by publishers when she was 15,
or having record labels mishandle songs. ``I know what it's like to
love _ not that I do, much,'' she adds with a knowing laugh. ``I
love my parrots. There are some people I actually love, real
humans, believe it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ``Because You Loved Me'' _ a tributary ballad she
wrote for the Michelle Pfeiffer-Robert Redford film ``Up Close and
Personal'' _ was inspired by thinking about her devoted father, who
died of heart failure in 1987. When Jerry Bruckheimer commissioned
her to write a ``Con Air'' theme, Warren watched the film and
decided to write a song in the voice of Nicolas Cage missing his
wife. Searching for a parallel in her life, she imagined how she
might feel if she couldn't write songs and wrote ``How Do I Live,''
which stuck on the charts for a record 69 weeks. She calls it ``my
love song to music,'' though most listeners never spot this
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Song ideas and titles occur to her constantly _ she writes them
on her hand and sings them into her answering machine or a Walkman
she keeps in the front seat of her car. She even thinks of songs
during therapy: ``I'll say, 'Wait, stop, I've got to write this
title down!''' During one session, Warren said, ``I don't really
get what you're talking about.'' Her therapist replied, ``One day
you will.'' Warren liked the phrase so much, she used it for a
song. (Deborah Cox recorded it.)
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday night, Warren was scheduled to meet with Les
Nubians, a pair of French-African sisters from Bordeaux whose last
album sold unremarkably in the United States. Some top writers
wouldn't deign to meet a struggling group, but Realsongs will be
the sisters' first stop; they will fly in from Paris, drop their
bags at a hotel, put on some lipstick (they are, after all, French)
and come straight to see Warren. But their flight is delayed, and
rain and lightning light up the L.A. sky as in one of Warren's
songs. Les Nubians' manager calls to say they will be late.
</P>
<P>
   As the rest of the Realsongs staff members leave to start their
weekends, Warren waits around the office. She says contentedly,
``I've got nothing else to do.''

 LINDY BOGGS IS HAVING HER SAY AT THE SEE

 By MICHAEL LEWIS  
 c.2000 Michael Lewis  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a man with a gift for charming others meets a woman with a
gift for making others feel charming, there is no telling how it
will end. Sometime around Easter of 1997, Bill Clinton called Lindy
Boggs, whom he had known since he was a college student, and asked
her, somewhat improbably, to become his ambassador to the Holy See.
(She ``is maybe the only person on the earth who could convince the
pope that I am worth dealing with,'' Clinton has joked to his
friends.)
</P>
<P>
   Lindy told Clinton she would think about it, but she was only
being polite. Almost as soon as he had made the offer, she had made
up her mind to decline it. She was 82 years old, spoke no Italian
and knew no one in Rome. She intended to end her days as she had
begun them, in private life, in New Orleans. Then she changed her
mind.
</P>
<P>
   As she tells it, she was standing one Sunday morning at the back
of St. Louis Cathedral (which is just down the street from her
home) in front of the chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Prompt
Succor. Our Lady of Prompt Succor is the saint to whom the local
Ursuline nuns prayed on behalf of Andrew Jackson before the Battle
of New Orleans. (After the battle, Jackson went immediately to the
nuns to thank them for the saint's intercession.) Standing before
Our Lady of Prompt Succor, Lindy recalls: ``I thought: Lindy Boggs,
you are a big sissy. If the president asks you to do a job, you
could at least give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rome these days, you hear so many anecdotes about Boggs that
you have to remind yourself how little time she has had to generate
them. The morning after she arrived to take up the ambassador's
post, she was informed that she was to be seated that night at a
table filled with nothing but cardinals; she mulled that over, then
said, ``I think I'll wear red.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the time Lindy exchanged three phone calls in one day
with an Italian archbishop on some minor piece of Vatican
diplomacy. Picking up the receiver the last time, she said,
``Dahlin', does this mean we're going steady?''
</P>
<P>
   And there was the trip to the hospital after Lindy had fallen in
her driveway and broken her knee. As she was wheeled in, her eyes
lit on a tall, dark Italian surgeon. ``Tell me, doctor,'' she said,
``is it a prerequisite in Italy that all doctors have to be
handsome?''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who passed along this last anecdote happened to work
at the American Embassy at the Holy See. She suggested that if I
wanted to hear more of this sort of thing, I had come to the right
place. Whatever else our ambassador had absorbed in her two and a
half years on the job, she had clearly learned that a woman in her
mid-80s surrounded by men in dresses sworn to vows of celibacy can
say whatever she pleases. ``Is it true that she calls the pope
'Dahlin''?'' I asked. ``You'll have to ask the ambassador that.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time I had seen Lindy Boggs, she was making a
less-than-convincing attempt to leave politics. Her career as an
elected official had just ended, as it began, with a death in her
family. She was elected to Congress in 1973 _ to the seat left
vacant when her husband, Hale Boggs, was lost in a plane crash in
Alaska _ and decided to get out in 1990 to help one of her
daughters, Barbara Sigmund, who was then mayor of Princeton, N.J.,
fight cancer. (Lindy has two other well-known children: Cokie
Roberts, the Washington journalist, and Tommy Boggs, the Washington
lobbyist.)
</P>
<P>
   After the cancer won, Lindy moved back home to the French
Quarter of New Orleans, claimed to be retired, then promptly joined
the boards of just about 600 local charities. At the time, I was
living just around the corner from her on Bourbon Street and
stopped in a few times. One of these visits came the same evening
that a presidential candidate named Bill Clinton was scheduled to
pay Lindy a call. As it happened, it was also the same time the
Gennifer Flowers story was breaking.
</P>
<P>
   The party that night at Lindy's house was a fund-raiser dressed
up as an intimate gathering for a few old friends who might like to
meet an attractive young politician. The decorous hum of a handful
of New Orleans Democrats milling about Lindy's upstairs living room
was punctuated by a riot in the downstairs hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had burst into the house in a blaze of television lights
and a crush of reporters, all of whom wanted to confirm the precise
details of his extramarital sex life. The reporters bayed for
graphic details; Clinton, huge and pink, tried to shove past them
to the party. The situation had spun out of control, when Lindy
appeared at Clinton's side and took him by the arm.
</P>
<P>
   The mob went quiet: it takes some nerve to holler ``oral sex''
in the presence of a septuagenarian. Then Lindy did her usual
trick. She told the reporters how happy she was that they had come
to see her. She offered them refreshments. Refreshments! She might
as well have tried to distract a pack of hounds with a cheese dip _
or so I thought. But suddenly, and inexplicably, the mood in that
hallway changed. The hounds lost the scent, the baying ceased, the
fox grinned and strolled on by.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of those people who seem to have been put on this
earth to undermine attempts to generalize about politicians. During
her two decades as a member of Congress, she was the one person in
Washington it was against the rules not to like and who seemed, for
her part, incapable of disliking others. Richard Nixon and George
McGovern: both dear friends. She adored Jack Kennedy, and he, of
course, adored her. She also adored Lyndon Johnson, and he, of
course, adored her.
</P>
<P>
   When she ceased to be a congressional wife and became a
congresswoman, she said there was only one thing that bothered her
about the new job: she would be forced to vote. How could you vote
without voting against something? In most people, this approach to
public life would seem spineless. In Lindy, it came across like a
glimpse of an alternative, enchanted universe. And as political
strategy it was just plain shrewd.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindy effect seems to be working in Rome, too. For instance,
this year Pope John Paul II has beatified one New Orleanean, the
Rev. Francis Xavier Seelos, and will canonize another, Mother
Katharine Drexel. Up until now, outside of its professional
football team, New Orleans has not been long on saints. In nearly
300 years it has manufactured exactly one.
</P>
<P>
   In this jubilee year, the pope will miraculously increase the
number of sacred people for Lindy's former constituents to pray to.
Perhaps not entirely by coincidence, Lindy, for many years, was on
a church committee in New Orleans that was trying to persuade the
Vatican to beatify Seelos. But when I asked her if her presence had
anything to do with his beatification, she just said: ``Oh,
dahlin', the Vatican makes all those decisions in private. And
Father Seelos was such an easy choice.''
</P>
<P>
   When she said this, we were sitting in her office at the
American Embassy at the Holy See, with its view of the Palatine
Hill. She had spent nearly two hours avoiding an explanation of her
job. It is a strange fact about Lindy Boggs that the two things she
spends most of her time on _ politics and praying _ are the two
things she least cares to discuss. (``Lindy's really from the old
school that has pious faith,'' says the Rev. Christopher Nalty, a
young priest studying at the Vatican who often appears on the
ambassador's arm. ``You didn't really question it, or talk about
it. You just had it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Still, I couldn't help wondering, What does an ambassador to the
Vatican do all day? Actually, that was the wrong question. What
Lindy did with most of her days in Rome had already become clear.
She went to the endless parties and meetings of cardinals and
archbishops and the other ambassadors and invited all the same
people to her own parties and meetings. Wherever she went, five
Italian policemen with machine guns followed.
</P>
<P>
   Her schedule was as merciless as a New Orleans debutante's. Each
day between 10 in the morning and midnight she seemed to pause only
once, briefly, to send a cable or two back to the State Department
in Washington, where it was read by a foreign-service officer whom
Lindy had never met. But how did she fill up all those cables? It
was this that she did not care to discuss. And there is not an
intrusive question in the world for which Lindy Boggs does not have
a charming anecdote with which to defuse it.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her, say, about the jockeying among cardinals to see who
gets to be the next pope, and she'll reply with a funny story of a
lunch she had with Ronald Reagan. ``My mother is uncharmingly
discreet,'' Cokie Roberts says. ``All those years I was a reporter
on Capitol Hill, and she never told me a damn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, after a few hours of listening to delightful and
charming stories about former heads of state, it dawned on me.
``The whole point of your job here,'' I said, ``is to avoid
controversy.'' ``Which I have been doing my whole life!''
</P>
<P>
   The Embassy at the Holy See, which Reagan established in 1983,
would seem at first glance to be a textbook case of the Pointless
Embassy. There is almost nothing the United States can do to shape
Vatican policy. Vatican theology, on which much Vatican policy
rests, is officially off limits to the U.S. ambassador. Moreover,
the Vatican may be the least concerned of all nations about what
the United States wants it to do.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope decides to air his opinion that cancer can be
caused by ``certain sexual behavior,'' as he did last year, the
United States does not even bother to try to stop him. To do so
would be worse than pointless. It would risk incurring the wrath of
the one man outside the United States who, with a flick of his
wrist, could wreak havoc with U.S. public opinion. As a result,
much of what constitutes Vatican diplomacy is actually appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the job,'' admits one official at the United States
Embassy at the Vatican, ``is to put the best possible face on the
inevitable.'' But there is something else, too, and it is peculiar
to the Embassy at the Holy See. The information that flows into the
Vatican from missionaries and churches _ perhaps the world's most
elaborate news-gathering network _ is information the State
Department would like to possess. In the darkest days of the
Bosnian war, for example, the Vatican had an intimate view of
affairs in the Balkans. Now it has perhaps the closest thing
available outside Congo and East Timor to the ear-to-the-ground
story on the conflicts inside.
</P>
<P>
   And so the question for the American ambassador becomes: How do
you get people inside the Vatican to tell you things? ``The Vatican
operates much like the U.S. government did right after World War
II,'' Lindy says. ``The difference is that you can't override the
pope's veto.'' What she means by this is that in both places the
protocol is so arcane as to constitute a subject unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Protocol is the Esperanto of Vatican social life. It operates as
a substitute to local custom and tends to be more elaborate in
places where people have the least culturally in common. Vatican
protocol is by itself of little interest. What is interesting is
the way it is used to mask Vatican politics or, rather, to keep
people out who don't belong. As one well-placed monsignor put it to
me: ``How you communicate here is as important as what you
communicate. Ambassador Boggs seems to know this instinctively.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't until you stop thinking of Lindy as an emissary and
start thinking of her as a seeker of Vatican secrets that you can
see the sense in her social life. Perhaps coincidentally, perhaps
not, she has befriended not merely the upper echelon of Vatican
officials but also other ambassadors. One of her new dear friends
is the Spanish ambassador, who, as the representative of the oldest
embassy at the Vatican, enjoys a privileged access; another is the
German ambassador, who, as it happens, is also privy to a lot of
Vatican gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising fact about Lindy Boggs is that she
can't sleep at night. She spends all day sincerely looking for
little ways to make the world a better place and then spends all
night staring at her ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was in Congress, she was always tired,'' recalls her
former legislative aide, Jan Schoonmaker. ``I used to schedule
downtime for her because I knew she hadn't slept the night before.
I'd ask her why, and she'd say that she was worrying. Or some
constituent had called at 2 a.m. to ask why he hadn't got his
Social Security check. I'd say, 'Lindy, you need an unlisted phone
number.' And she'd say, 'But dahlin', then people wouldn't know how
to find me at night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a habit with her still. Our last meeting in Rome coincided
with one of her many dinner parties. The last archbishop had gone,
and she was running a fever, yet she insisted that I hang around.
She had something to show me.
</P>
<P>
   She's worried _ though, of course, she does not come right out
and say it _ that I'm going to depict her as a sweet old lady who
makes a lot of people happy but doesn't really serve any greater
purpose. She handed me a yellow Post-It on which she had scribbled
what she called ``my political interests.'' The list read:
Preservation, National Archives, Holocaust museum, Smithsonian,
Children and Families, NASA. It may be the least controversial list
of political interests ever created, offering only the tiniest
sliver of her view of the world. I asked her about her long record
of voting against abortion rights. ``Oh,'' she said, ``I've always
been for life. But I never would have raised it as a political
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   She still had an expectant air about her; the list wasn't the
thing that she wanted to show me. She grabbed me by the arm and led
me out to the bottom of her marble staircase. There on the banister
rested a plain manila folder. She had placed it there before the
dinner so that it would be at hand afterward. She opened it and
extracted a stack of photographs. The pictures of her first meeting
with the pope, when she presented him with her credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are with the Holy Father,'' she said, as she paged
through them, lovingly, ``you feel you are in the presence of
something. He's just pure ... goodness.'' It was an extraordinarily
detailed sequence. Every move seemed to have been documented.
</P>
<P>
   As I paged through the photographs, Lindy described the ritual
leading up to the papal encounter. When she finished, I realized
she had once again spoken at great length, and had told me
everything but what I wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Lindy,'' I asked, ``what did you and the pope talk
about?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dahlin', that's private!''

   His previous pulpit, in suburban New Orleans, had few blacks.
And yet, at 50, he has managed and accelerated the Tabernacle's
integration with considerable skill. Both races trust him like a
parent and admire his evenhandedness, political instincts and
common touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll drink out of the same glass,'' Ruben Burch says.
``That's the kind of feeling I get from him, you know, that I'm not
higher than you.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a gifted preacher, fashioning sermons that are neither
inaccessibly erudite nor insultingly shallow. But he prefers, he
says, not to preach about race. He would rather lead by example,
embracing each in his flock with the same tenderness, blessing each
with the same prayers, accepting dinner invitations from all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pitfall of having a blended church is when you
make race the issue,'' he says. ``What we're doing here as a church
is not about race, and if we make that the emphasis then we miss
the bigger picture. Our main goal is to reconcile people to God.''
</P>
<P>
   He would never say it, and maybe doesn't even let himself think
it, but there is another reason not to make race the issue. To
preserve the Tabernacle's fragile balance, he must reach out to
newcomers without alienating old-timers like the Pughs.
</P>
<P>
   The blacks at the Tabernacle were jubilant about the pastor's
race sermon. And the Pughs, like many of the whites, had no real
problem with its content. But that he delivered the sermon at all
rubbed them the wrong way. He was playing to the crowd, they felt,
or at least to part of it.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, the Pughs had discussed looking at other
churches. The Tabernacle was a long drive from home. Now they
shared this gnawing sense that race was beginning to supplant God's
love as its driving force.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would cause me to leave,'' Janice Pugh says. ``is for
them to constantly have a platform on the black issue, to always
talk about race, and not let the Holy Spirit lead us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, Brumbalow says, God just lays a message on
his heart and he can't shake it loose. It happened again in
February, when, voice quavering, he read King's ``I Have a Dream''
speech and prophesied that the Tabernacle would become a beacon for
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is saying, `I am going to prepare you to be a light, to be
an example to the city of Atlanta and to the state of Georgia,'''
he says. ``I want to tell you, God has a dream and his dream is
being fulfilled in this house this morning in the name of the Lord.
Hallelujah!''
</P>
<P>
   The Pughs would have preferred a different topic. ``He keeps
bringing it up and bringing it up,'' Howard Pugh says. ``With this
race deal, once a year is adequate, not every other Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, the Pughs visited another church.
</P>
<P>
   A DELICATE BALANCE
</P>
<P>
   If the Burches and other black leaders at the Tabernacle have a
complaint, it is with the level of diversity in the staff. They do
not always protest publicly, fearing they might break the spell of
racial goodwill. But they are always watching and counting. All you
have to do, they say, is look at last year's Christmas card
photograph of ``the Tabernacle team,'' 19 red-sweatered staffers,
every last one of them white.
</P>
<P>
   And yet when positions have opened, black deacons have chosen
not to lobby Brumbalow to fill them with blacks. They recognize,
they say, that the task is not easy. The Assemblies of God is still
virtually all white, with fewer than 400 blacks among its 32,000
licensed ministers. And because Brumbalow holds a statewide
leadership position with the Assemblies, it might be considered bad
form to hire from outside the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the success in May, he had searched assiduously for
black prospects, knowing that ``it would certainly speak volumes
that I pretty much practice what I preach.'' In several instances
he let the congregation know that he had offered jobs to black
prospects, only to be rebuffed. That seemed to satisfy his black
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He interviewed black people and they turned it down, so what
can you do?'' Ruben Burch says after one such search.
</P>
<P>
   In general, black members suspect that it may not take much to
upset the racial equilibrium of the church. Ultimately, they
assume, it will come down to power. If black numbers increase to
where whites feel disenfranchised, whites will leave, they predict.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the pastors feel they must move incrementally.
That was never clearer than in the planning of last year's
Christmas pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Like other blacks, Ruben Burch had long noticed that blacks had
never been cast as Joseph, Mary or Jesus. The whites, he assumed,
would have a fit. ``Boy, if they figure out there was a black
Jesus, they probably wouldn't want to go to heaven,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Smith, the music minister, badly wanted to break that
color barrier. He knew that Scripture was largely silent about
Jesus' appearance and that various cultures portrayed him in their
own images. But he, too, was unsure if the older whites were ready
for an ebony Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   So he devised a scheme to soft-pedal the racial transformation
of Christ. He selected for the lead roles Stephen and Sobrina
Smith, a light-skinned multiracial couple who happened to have a
newborn son, Joshua. Sobrina Smith, born in Trinidad, is part
African, Chinese, East Indian, Hispanic and South American Indian.
Her husband, a New Yorker, is part Italian, Polish, black, Jewish
and Native American.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor theorized that if he could sell the Smiths, he could
cast darker-skinned blacks in future years. ``The first time it
shouldn't be such a shock,'' he says. ``They're not as dark.
They're sort of a medium.''
</P>
<P>
   The pageant went off without a hitch, down to the triumphant
finale, when an adult Christ figure, adorned with a crown and
scarlet cloak, rode into the sanctuary on a stocky white horse.
Sobrina Smith was fetching as Mary, dressed in a blue satin robe
and a white shawl, cradling Joshua as her husband knelt nearby.
Burch, playing a wise man, watched on bended knee.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Smith could not have been more pleased. He received lots
of compliments and not a single comment about the racial makeup of
the cast, which was how he wanted it. Most white members, if they
noticed at all, reacted about the way the Pughs did, with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the white people have been shocked so many times that
it doesn't make any difference anymore,'' Janice Pugh says. ``They
just say, `Well, that's the way it is now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Smiths, told later that they had been selected for
their complexion, says they didn't mind too much, so long as it
helped move the church forward. And yet the whole experience made
them wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are an integrated church, as we claim to be,'' Sobrina
Smith asked, ``why do we still have to go through hoops and loops
to make a point and get a message across and pacify certain people
and keep waves from starting? If we're still playing around with
this, then maybe we're not really who we say we are.''

 (ATTN: Ga.)   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
(EDS: Beginning Sunday, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times will be publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived
in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary

face. These stories, two or three each week, will be approximately
6,000 words. The News Service will move each story in advance, and
an abridged version will also move, at approximately 3,000 words.
They will move in the ``a'' news category and will carry a slug of
the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are organized into
chapters, papers with severe space restraints may choose to spread
a single article over several days. Please see

   DECATUR, Ga. _ Howard Pugh, head usher, is on patrol. May the
good Lord have mercy on anyone who dares to tread across the lobby
of the Assembly of God Tabernacle with so much as an open Coca-Cola
in his hand. Because first he will get the look, the glare of a
hunting dog catching its first scent of game. Then he will get the
wag, the shake of the left index finger. And then the voice,
serious as a heart attack and dripping with Pensacola pinesap:
``Son, this is the Lord's house. And they just shampooed that
carpet last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Pugh knows what is going on in his lobby. So when Pugh, a
65-year-old white man with a bulbous pink nose, spots 81-year-old
Roy Denson slipping out, he doesn't even have to ask. He knows,
because he has seen Denson flee the 10:30 service time and again,
and it is always when one of the choir's black soloists takes
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   As he begins to sing, the Pentecostal faithful gradually rise.
First a few black members clap and sway. Then more join in.
Finally, the white members stand, and soon the 2,000-seat sanctuary
is washed over with harmony. Stretching their arms toward the
heavens, the congregants weave a tapestry of pinks and tans and
browns.
</P>
<P>
   But to Denson, the black soloist's improvisational riffs sound
like screeching and hollering. So he sits there seething, thinking
about how he joined this church 56 years ago, how he followed it
from downtown Atlanta to the suburbs, how he hung the Sheetrock
with his own hands, and how the blacks are taking over and the
whites are just letting it happen.
</P>
<P>
   He gets angrier and angrier, listening to these boisterous black
folks desecrate his music, until he simply cannot bear it. ``I
ain't sitting there and listening to that,'' he mutters on his way
out. ``They're not going to take over my church.''
</P>
<P>
   And there waiting for him is Pugh, always with the same
question. Never mind that Pugh and his wife, Janice, have
themselves become uneasy about the direction of their church, that
they have been quietly contemplating a walk of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Roy,'' Pugh begins, ``what are you going to do when you
get to heaven? Walk out of there, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Back inside, the ecstatic singing has ended, the speaking in
tongues has melted into a chorus of hypnotic whispers and the
members of the Tabernacle have been invited to roam the sea-foam
carpet, welcoming visitors and greeting one another. They embrace,
the white people and the black people, with long, earnest hugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Burch, a 6-foot-7 black man, saunters down the aisle
grinning. During the Sunday fellowship, Burch makes a point of
approaching older whites to gauge acceptance. Will they offer hugs,
or merely handshakes? Will they linger, or recoil?
</P>
<P>
   In the aisle, he encounters Madge Mayo, the spry 85-year-old
widow of a pastor from the Tabernacle's segregated days. She stands
4-foot-9 and keeps her luminescent white hair in a bun.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Mayo could never have imagined hugging a
black man, and even now she is not sure she approves of the
integration of her church. But she has been touched by the
bigheartedness of the Tabernacle's black members. And like many of
the whites who have stayed, she reasons that all believers are
going to the same heaven, so they might as well get used to one
another right here on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Mayo sees Burch heading her way and trots a few steps toward
him. They smile fondly, and he bends at the waist to embrace her.
She pats Burch on the back and presses her cheek against his,
passing his test.
</P>
<P>
   It is a moment that would probably chafe some of his relatives,
who feel that he and his wife, Vanessa, are compromising their
blackness by attending ``the white church.'' But the Burches feel
blessed by the blendedness of the Tabernacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man,'' Ruben Burch reflects later on his encounter with Mayo,
``30 or 40 years ago I would have been hung for just touching this
lady.''
</P>
<P>
   PRAYING SIDE BY SIDE
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen miles east of downtown Atlanta, a vast granite monolith
known as Stone Mountain looms over the flatness of DeKalb County.
Up on that mountain in 1915, the 20th-century Ku Klux Klan was
born. And virtually in its shadow, the Tabernacle, all brick and
glass and sharp angles, sits along Interstate 285 amid the Atlanta
sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 years after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
scolded Christians for making 11 a.m. Sunday the most segregated
hour of the week, the Tabernacle is the rarest of religious
institutions in a nation where 90 percent of all congregations are
at least 80 percent one race. It is, to many of its 800 members, a
slice of heaven on earth, a church whose spirituality is magnified
by its multiracial character. What better evidence of God's
presence, they reason, than whites and blacks praying side by side?
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Tabernacle is deeply conservative, socially and
theologically. What draws the Pughs and the Burches and many others
is the intensity of their Pentecostal faith, which teaches that the
Holy Spirit can move in the lives of all believers, regardless of
background.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Roger Brumbalow's mission statement, displayed in the
lobby, challenges the congregation ``to be a multiracial,
multicultural maturing body of believers.'' Fifty-five percent of
the members are white, 43 percent are black and the rest are Asian
or racially mixed. Perhaps a third of the blacks are foreign born.
</P>
<P>
   The Tabernacle has had trouble integrating its eight-member
pastoral staff, a legacy of the Assemblies of God's history as a
white denomination. Over the last 13 months, Brumbalow, who is
white, filled two openings with white associate pastors before
finally hiring a black youth pastor in May. The board of deacons,
by contrast, has been integrated since 1994 and acquired a black
majority after elections in March.
</P>
<P>
   The choir is thoroughly mixed, and its praise-and-worship-style
music falls comfortably between the traditional country hymns of
white Pentecostalism and the thumping gospel funk of the modern
black church.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation does not mix only in the pews. Blacks and
whites visit each other in the hospital, share motel rooms at
retreats and attend potluck dinners at one another's homes. They
come together in kitchens and living rooms, forming circles of
prayer around an ailing old man or a hopeful young couple, then
laying hands on the supplicants' foreheads and shoulders. Visiting
one another's suburban homes, these accountants and teachers,
nurses and software consultants discover the common threads of
their middle-class lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the utopian imagery, for all the hope and faith that
the congregation has moved beyond race, the life of the church is
still driven by race.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone has made accommodations of some kind. The whites,
mostly native Southerners, have been forced to confront their
racial assumptions and cede some control over church governance and
liturgy. The blacks have ventured from the safe harbor of the
African-American church and, in many cases, have suppressed
lifetimes of racial resentment and distrust.
</P>
<P>
   The little compromises can be detected any Sunday. They show in
the frustration of some black members with the regimentation of the
morning service, which opens with exactly 30 minutes of singing and
usually lasts precisely two hours. Some whites, meanwhile, glance
at black churchgoers who they feel may be worshiping too
exuberantly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behind such concerns, though, is the question at the heart of
the Tabernacle's future: Is the church simply enjoying a fleeting
moment of integration on the way to becoming predominantly black?
With the church growing rapidly and blacks joining at twice the
rate of whites, the Tabernacle could tip, like those neighborhoods
where blacks move in and whites eventually flee.
</P>
<P>
   And how much are the Burches, the Pughs and the others willing
to concede in order to realize St. Paul's declaration that ``you
are all one in Christ Jesus''?
</P>
<P>
   MAKING `COLORED' FRIENDS
</P>
<P>
   The Pughs have been transformed by the church's integration.
Having lived most of their lives with little exposure to blacks,
and little interest in gaining any, they now count blacks from the
church among their closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling before I got to know them was that there really
wasn't that many good blacks out there,'' Howard Pugh explains.
``After being around them and working with them, shoot, I don't
even think about them as colored anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Howard's ``colored'' friends would prefer he use a
synonym. But in his mind, his choice of words marks some progress.
``Hey, I've come a long way,'' he said. ``I don't say nigger
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' his wife chimes in, ``they should see where
you've come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Where they both came from were country churches in the piney
woods of northwest Florida. They found each other 21 years ago via
CB radio and began courting over a cup of truck-stop coffee. He was
a widower, she recently divorced. Pugh brought his bride to Atlanta
19 years ago and started a lucrative business pouring concrete in
the ever-expanding suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   With its sizable black middle class and political structure, the
city was a shock. The Pughs had come up in a strictly segregated
culture. Pugh remembers having little childhood exposure to blacks,
and during the civil rights movement he couldn't figure out what
all the fuss was about. As far as he could tell, blacks had the
same opportunities as he and other poor whites, even if they did
have their own neighborhoods and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to stay on my side of the fence and for them to
stay on theirs,'' he said. ``I never abused them. But they pretty
much knew that I was white and they were niggers and we just ran
our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Pugh, 46, says she was never taught prejudice but recalls
her grandmother's warning to avoid the black side of town. Her view
of black men, she says, came from movies that portrayed them
``raping a white woman or something.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, she had to confront her fears. ``You'd turn the TV
on and it's a black mayor and a black city council,'' she said.
``I'd say, `Howard, where did you bring me? Are there any white
people here?'''
</P>
<P>
   When the Pughs joined in 1992, the Tabernacle was perhaps 10
percent black. They had never worshiped with blacks before. But the
black folks tended to sit on the right side of the sanctuary,
separated from the whites by a demilitarized zone of empty pews.
``We came at a good time,'' Janice Pugh recalls. ``There weren't so
many of them that it was overwhelming. We could adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BURDEN OF BLENDING IN
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ruben and Vanessa Burch moved into a house in a
subdivision that is perhaps a third white. Determined to raise
their two daughters in an integrated setting, they had been
impressed while house hunting that white neighbors had waved to
them, a black couple, from their lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Many couples from the church gathered for a house-blessing
dinner at the Burches'. To the strumming of a guitar, the crowd
welcomed the Holy Spirit into the airy two-story home. Come into my
house, Lord Jesus,'' they harmonized.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Burch handed out cups of olive oil, and the blacks and
whites anointed doorknobs, bedposts and televisions with smudges of
oil. The ceremony ended when the Burch family _ Ruben, Vanessa,
12-year-old Jessica and 7-year-old Gabrielle _ huddled in the
living room and surrendered to the prayers of their friends. The
guests gave them a wall plaque, and little Gabby haltingly read,
``May the Lord bless this home and keep you in the company of
angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most black Southerners of their generation, the Burches
have experienced racism. Ruben, 46, grew up in Albany, , a
stronghold of resistance to the civil rights movement. Vanessa, 40,
grew up in Blakely, whose high school still has separate homecoming
queens and class reunions.
</P>
<P>
   Both remember ``colored only'' water fountains and parental
warnings not to be caught on the white side of town after dark.
Vanessa still recalls the indignity of hearing white children call
her mother by her first name. And then there was the day, perhaps
15 years ago, when her white boss in a bank informed her that one
thing he hated was an ``uppity, educated nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burches reacted to all this in different ways. Ruben,
happy-go-lucky and confident, says he never grew deeply bitter. His
mother shielded him from the worst affronts, and when his high
school integrated, he saw it as an opportunity to date white girls,
discreetly.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa was more defiant. When her school desegregated, her
white classmates learned that anyone who tossed a racial epithet
her way was liable to go home with bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Their experiences left both Burches, though, with a strong
understanding that their world would be multiracial, and that
schooling, diction and personality would be important tools in
getting ahead. Those lessons were reinforced in the Navy, where
Ruben Burch spent 22 years as a medic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 they moved to Atlanta, where Ruben found work inspecting
commercial waste-water systems. They looked for an Assemblies of
God church and found the Tabernacle, then about 30 percent black.
Before long they were fully involved, he as an usher, she as a
Sunday school teacher and both as scout leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the diversity,'' said Vanessa Burch, an administrative
assistant for a computer company. ``I wanted my children to grow up
with differences in a church so they could see that whenever they
went to heaven it wasn't going to be all black and it wasn't going
to be all white. It was going to be mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   A `WALK WITH THE LORD'  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Tabernacle was founded in 1916, it was most definitely
not mixed. And it remained that way through most of its history,
moving twice to escape the migration of blacks into its
neighborhood. In the 1940s it affiliated with the Assemblies of
God, a historically segregationist Pentecostal denomination.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, the church could outrun neither the changing
demographics of postsegregation Atlanta. By around 1993, the church
was about 20 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, some whites left. The Pughs could have, but they
liked Pastor Brumbalow's preaching and their son's participation in
the youth group. And as they got to know black members, they found
they liked them, too. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   The black churchgoers did not fit the Pughs' stereotypes. Howard
Pugh noticed that they did not loll around or always have their
hands out like the black men who smooth his concrete.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He draws distinctions between his black employees and his black
church friends. Sometimes he cannot recall his workers' last names,
though they have been with him for years. He says he occasionally
must bail one out of jail, and that he occasionally catches some
loafing.
</P>
<P>
   But he admires the blacks at the Tabernacle. They work hard and
dress well, often better than the whites, and live in two-story
houses on well-tended lanes. ``As I began to be around them a lot
more,'' he said, ``I saw that there was a lot more of them trying
to benefit themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Pugh sometimes gets weepy talking about her deep kinship
with black women from church. She feels connected to them
spiritually and turns to them when she needs prayer.
</P>
<P>
   As she has learned about the bigotry they face, she has come to
empathize. It isn't guilt exactly. She doesn't feel she owes black
people anything. But she understands, and that is something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved to Atlanta,'' she said, ``I had never had any
occasion to know what these people were going through.'' As she
sees it, God is using the Tabernacle's integration to test
``whether you move on in your walk with the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's walk has been less steady. He remains capable of
offending black friends even as he beckons them into his life. They
recognize that he has come a long way, that he has a good heart.
But they also suspect that he continues to use the word
``colored,'' often to their faces, to make it clear that he, not
they, will define the terms of their relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a control thing,'' Janice Pugh says. ``He wants people to
know that he still knows the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THE RELATIVES SAY
</P>
<P>
   The Burches may want to make sure, as Vanessa Burch puts it,
that their girls don't grow up ``in an all one-race anything.'' But
when it comes to their choice of church, they have been wounded by
second-guessing from their relatives, particularly Ruben Burch's
sister Jacalyn Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wannabe thing,'' said Mrs. Ray, who attends a black
church. Her sister-in-law, she thinks, is too eager to make white
friends and entertain them in her home. ``Some people don't know
who they are and have to go somewhere to validate themselves. She
doesn't feel comfortable being black.''
</P>
<P>
   Other family members, while more tactful, do not fully reject
Ray's assessment. Ruben's half-brother Frederick Caldwell has long
noticed that Burch feels most comfortable in interracial settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of Rick as my white brother,'' he laughs, using a
nickname. ``He has Caucasian features. Not facial features, but he
has a white body type. He can't dance. He'll wear plaid pants. He
played on the tennis team in school. He's a Newt Gingrich fan. I
wouldn't necessarily say he wants to be white, but he has opinions
not normally associated with a black man in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Burch concedes some concern that his daughters may be too
color-blind, that a life without overt discrimination has left them
with little racial identity. Someday, he fears, an act of bigotry
will shatter their naivete. Still, he resents the suggestion that
he and his family prefer integration because they want to be white.
``I mean, Jessica acknowledges inner conflict over racial identity.
But it is not that she rejects her blackness or wants to be white.
Rather, it is that she feels torn between her parents' insistence
on living an integrated life and her black peers' suspicion of
anyone who does.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents insist that she and her sister speak ``proper
English'' and scold them gently if they slip into black slang. But
her classmates tease her relentlessly for her speech and for having
white friends, and sometimes she cannot resist the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do talk improper English, or ebonics, with black friends,''
she admits. Two years ago, she decided to dump her white friends in
order to placate the black ones. But she felt distracted, her
grades began to fall and she concluded that God was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally told myself that it doesn't matter what they think
about me, it doesn't matter what color I hang out with,'' she said.
``I have too much respect for who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   SENSE AND SENSITIVITY
</P>
<P>
   Because the Tabernacle is an island, and a refuge, it is often
hard to accept the fact that racial tensions lie just beneath the
surface, vulnerable to exposure from the slightest scratch. But the
island is within the world, and in the world there is no refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Watson, a children's pastor, learned that lesson when she
was rebuked by a black parent for referring affectionately to her
toddlers as ``monkeys.'' Another youth pastor got an earful about a
Bible lesson that equated the color black with sin.
</P>
<P>
   Although he says he tries to preach on race infrequently,
Brumbalow sermonized last year that God was working a miracle at
the Tabernacle so people might have a glimpse of heaven. ``When I
look across this congregation,'' he said, ``I understand what God
is doing. I understand the eternal kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say to you of color and you that are white'' _ he
was screeching like the brakes on a train _ ``that if you look at a
person based on the color of their skin and you evaluate them right
then and there, then, my friend, you have missed the purpose of the
love of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The blacks at the Tabernacle were jubilant about the pastor's
race sermon. And the Pughs, like many of the whites, had no real
problem with its content. But that he delivered the sermon at all
rubbed them the wrong way. He was playing to the crowd, they felt,
or at least to part of it.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, the Pughs had discussed looking at other
churches. The Tabernacle was a long drive from home. Now they
shared this gnawing sense that race was beginning to supplant God's
love as its driving force.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would cause me to leave,'' Janice Pugh explained, ``is
for them to constantly have a platform on the black issue, to
always talk about race, and not let the Holy Spirit lead us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, Brumbalow said, God just lays a message on
his heart and he can't shake it loose. It happened again in late
February, when, his voice quavering, he read King's ``I Have a
Dream'' speech and prophesied that the Tabernacle would become a
beacon for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is saying, `I am going to prepare you to be a light, to be
an example to the city of Atlanta and to the state of Georgia,'''
he said. ``I want to tell you, God has a dream and his dream is
being fulfilled in this house this morning in the name of the Lord.
Hallelujah!''
</P>
<P>
   The Pughs would have preferred a different topic. ``He keeps
bringing it up and bringing it up,'' Howard Pugh said. ``With this
race deal, once a year is adequate, not every other Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, the Pughs visited another church.

&HT;     FORMER MAYORAL CANDIDATE SAYS HE TURNED DOWN HEARST SETTLEMENT
OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Former mayoral candidate Clint Reilly says he
has spent close to $1 million so far on his legal attempt to stop
the Hearst Corp. from buying the San Francisco Chronicle, and he
claims he turned down a multimillion-dollar offer to settle the
antitrust lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   His comments Thursday came a day after the end of the trial on
the lawsuit, which will determine the future of daily newspapers in
San Francisco. U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker said he will
issue his ruling as quickly as possible, but did not say when.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Corp. attorney Gary Halling said Reilly's statement about
the settlement offer was ``off base,'' declining to comment further
on the settlement negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in the Reilly-owned Merchants Exchange
Building in San Francisco, the former candidate said the Hearst
Corp. was trying to reap profits at the expense of readers, who
would not have the benefit of other ``political viewpoints'' if the
deals were allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I have spent nearly a million dollars of my own
money on this public interest lawsuit and refused to settle for
many millions more,'' said Reilly, who spent almost $4 million last
year on his fourth-place finish in the mayor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly declined to say how much he had been offered to settle
his lawsuit, which was filed Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his office, Halling said Reilly's statement was
wrong. ``As usual, the plaintiff is off base,'' Halling said. ``And
that applies to everything he's saying.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial ended Wednesday after Walker listened to nearly five
hours of closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The judge asked pointed questions about both the proposed $660
million sale of the Chronicle to the Hearst Corp. and Hearst's plan
to hand the Examiner, along with a $66 million subsidy, over to the
Fang family, which now publishes a three-times-a-week newspaper
here.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly claims both deals are shams. His lawsuit sought a court
order blocking the sale of the Chronicle. Later, after Reilly lost
out to the Fang family in his bid to buy the Examiner, his
attorneys sought to stop that sale as well, claiming the Examiner
could never succeed with the subsidy Hearst offered over three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said the lawsuit had cost more than $900,000 with
attorneys, witness and transcript fees among the largest costs.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a three-page statement, Reilly echoed several arguments
his lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto, made during trial, including claims
that other Hearst executives knew about alleged ``horse trading''
between Examiner Publisher Timothy O. White and Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   White testified on the first day of the trial last month that he
had offered Brown favorable editorials in exchange for Brown's
support of the Chronicle purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Corp. placed White on an indefinite leave of absence,
then hired retired federal judge Charles Renfrew to lead an
internal investigation to determine whether journalistic ethics had
been violated.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst released a statement in which White said he had been
``tired and confused'' while testifying. White has said he expects
to be cleared of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly asserted that the investigation was being paid for by
Hearst, and would not restore credibility to the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The editorial fairness of The Examiner's news coverage will
not be restored without a thorough housecleaning at the highest
levels of the paper,'' Reilly said. ``And since the Hearst
leadership in New York, including (Hearst Newspapers President)
George Irish himself, clearly participated in blatant violations of
journalistic ethics, that housecleaning should extend from San
Francisco to the boardrooms of the Hearst Corporation in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Bronstein, executive editor of the Examiner, said the
integrity of the paper's news pages, editors and reporters remained
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein said: ``The judge will decide the merits of the
lawsuit, but as far as Mr. Reilly's comments at the press
conference _ he knows very well that the editorial integrity of our
news coverage has never been questioned in this case. Not in Tim
White's testimony or anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish testified during trial that he had not known of the offer,
although he acknowledged that White had briefed him on at least two
meetings where the publisher sought the mayor's support for
Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Frank A. Bennack Jr., Hearst's president and chief executive
officer, testified that he had been horrified when he learned about
White's testimony, and hadn't heard about the offer until after the
publisher made the statements on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly also responded to criticism that he had filed the lawsuit
as revenge against his political enemies, claiming he had done it
for readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, owning a newspaper did hold some appeal to me
when that option was presented,'' he said. ``And obtaining a choice
piece of real estate is always enticing. And yes, they say revenge
is as sweet as hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no, for those who assume these have been my motives, I'll
have to disappoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein disagreed, saying, ``His statements are not about
public good or even personal grudges. They are about
manipulation.''

 &HT;    CLINTON SUGGESTS NATO, EU MAY EMBRACE RUSSIA AS PARTNER
 &HT;    (900&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AACHEN, Germany _ Reaching out to Moscow on the eve of his first
summit with the new Russian leader, President Clinton suggested
Friday that Russia might one day become part of both NATO and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were part of a larger call for the United States and
Europe to step up efforts to fold Russia into the global mainstream
as a way to help advance the uneven pace of democratic and economic
reforms in the former Communist superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must work to build a partnership with Russia that
encourages stability, democracy and cooperative engagement with the
West, and full integration with global institutions,'' said
Clinton, who travels to Moscow on Saturday for a weekend summit
with newly elected President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means no doors can be sealed shut to Russia _ not NATO's,
not the (European Union's),'' Clinton said. ``The alternative would
be a future of harmful competition between Russia and the rest, and
the end of our vision of an undivided continent.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has had an observation and consultative role within NATO
since 1994, and Russian troops have participated with NATO forces
in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. Russia hasn't
sought full membership in the alliance that stood sentry against
Soviet divisions throughout the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed, though, since the Soviet Union's collapse in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borders built to stop tanks now manage invasions of tourists
and trucks,'' said Clinton, adding that the prospect of a fuller
embrace between Russia, and NATO and the EU _ the security and
economic institutions that bore the Western alliance through
decades of Cold War against the former Soviet Union _ should not be
ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to fly to Moscow Saturday night, local
time, after participating in a day-long conference on 21st Century
governance in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin plans to host Clinton for a working dinner at the Kremlin,
setting up a day of summitry and a joint press conference on
Sunday. On Monday, Clinton will become the first U.S. president to
address the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting between the two leaders since Putin's election
in March, the summit is expected to focus on a high stakes set of
nuclear arms and missile defense talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger,
has repeatedly cautioned reporters to expect no immediate
breakthroughs on those fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin are already scheduled to meet three more times
this year, and the two leaders are far apart over nuclear arms
reductions and the question of whether the United States should
deploy a national missile defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said, though, that the two men will likely ink an accord
calling for each side to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade
plutonium, enough to produce thousands of nuclear warheads, over an
agreed upon period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the agenda will be Putin's plans for shoring up the
Russian economy, improving but still beleaguered by high inflation,
rampant corruption, criminal activity and capital flight. Putin
needs to present a credible plan for addressing those ills before
American and other foreign investors will find Russia attractive,
and the United States and multinational banks will step up badly
needed aid.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton journeyed to here to Aachen, regarded by many
as the cradle of Europe, where he was awarded the prestigious
Charlemagne Prize, named for the conqueror who placed most of
present-day Europe under his rule 1,200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the occasion to try to allay concerns across Europe
about the growing dominance of U.S. might, paying tribute to his
own country's roots and casting the United States as a product of
European vision and drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had our differences,'' Clinton said. ``But the
simple fact is, since Europe is an idea as much as a place, America
also is a part of Europe, bound by ties of family, history and
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the New World explorations of Portuguese, Spanish,
French, British and others, Clinton said, ``without the longing for
a new Europe, there never would have been an America in the first
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed, though, that European security remains
integral to U.S. strategic policy, vowing that there would be no
diminution in the American role as leader of the NATO alliance at
the core of Europe's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe's security remains tied to America's security,''
Clinton said. ``When it is threatened, as it has in Bosnia and
Kosovo, we, too, will respond. When it is being built, we, too,
will always take part.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as he re-asserted U.S. strategic interests in the
continent, Clinton sought to assuage growing concerns in some
quarters of Europe over the growing influence the United States
enjoys as the world's last remaining economic and military
superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns have been rekindled by a proposal Clinton is
weighing to build a missile defense system to protect the United
States from the threat of a inter-continental ballistic attack by a
rouge state, such as North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Russia opposes the project, saying it would upset the balance of
power between the world's two largest possessors of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered earlier this week to share information about the
system, and perhaps even some of its technology with Russia. In an
interview Thursday night on NBC-TV, Putin said that he would be
open to such discussions, but the White House has not made clear
what might be entailed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leaders in France, Germany and elsewhere across the
continent have echoed Russia's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who raised the fear
Thursday that a U.S. missile defense shield could trigger a renewed
U.S.-Russian arms race, reiterated those concerns during Friday's
award ceremony. He added, further, that such a system could
threaten the U.S.-European unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You, Bill, have always sought to bring about progress in
disarmament,'' said Schroeder. ``It is therefore good that you have
said that, in making a decision, when the time comes, the relevant
security and disarmament aspects in particular will be weighed.''
</P>
<P>
   Continued Schroeder, ``this includes considering the impact on
other important states, as well as possible consequences for the
cohesion of the Atlantic alliance. Our overriding objective must
remain to guarantee durable security and to carefully choose the
best means to this end in any given situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is weighing whether to build a limited NMD system that,
proponents claim, would be able to intercept and destroy one or a
few ballistic missiles fired at the United States from across the
Pacific ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon plans to test the system in July then advise
Clinton on its projected cost _ now between $26 billion and $60
billion _ and effectiveness. It would take four or five years to
put into place.
</P>
<P>
   A decision from Clinton isn't expected until the fall.

 &HT;    CLINTON SUGGESTS NATO, EU MAY EMBRACE RUSSIA AS PARTNER
 &HT;    (900&AMP;ADD)

<TEXT>
<P>
   AACHEN, Germany _ Reaching out to Moscow on the eve of his first
summit with the new Russian leader, President Clinton suggested
Friday that Russia might one day become part of both NATO and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were part of a larger call for the United States and
Europe to step up efforts to fold Russia into the global mainstream
as a way to help advance the uneven pace of democratic and economic
reforms in the former Communist superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must work to build a partnership with Russia that
encourages stability, democracy and cooperative engagement with the
West, and full integration with global institutions,'' said
Clinton, who travels to Moscow on Saturday for a weekend summit
with newly elected President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means no doors can be sealed shut to Russia _ not NATO's,
not the (European Union's),'' Clinton said. ``The alternative would
be a future of harmful competition between Russia and the rest, and
the end of our vision of an undivided continent.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has had an observation and consultative role within NATO
since 1994, and Russian troops have participated with NATO forces
in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. Russia hasn't
sought full membership in the alliance that stood sentry against
Soviet divisions throughout the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed, though, since the Soviet Union's collapse in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borders built to stop tanks now manage invasions of tourists
and trucks,'' said Clinton, adding that the prospect of a fuller
embrace between Russia, and NATO and the EU _ the security and
economic institutions that bore the Western alliance through
decades of Cold War against the former Soviet Union _ should not be
ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to fly to Moscow Saturday night, local
time, after participating in a day-long conference on 21st Century
governance in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin plans to host Clinton for a working dinner at the Kremlin,
setting up a day of summitry and a joint press conference on
Sunday. On Monday, Clinton will become the first U.S. president to
address the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting between the two leaders since Putin's election
in March, the summit is expected to focus on a high stakes set of
nuclear arms and missile defense talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger,
has repeatedly cautioned reporters to expect no immediate
breakthroughs on those fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin are already scheduled to meet three more times
this year, and the two leaders are far apart over nuclear arms
reductions and the question of whether the United States should
deploy a national missile defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said, though, that the two men will likely ink an accord
calling for each side to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade
plutonium, enough to produce thousands of nuclear warheads, over an
agreed upon period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the agenda will be Putin's plans for shoring up the
Russian economy, improving but still beleaguered by high inflation,
rampant corruption, criminal activity and capital flight. Putin
needs to present a credible plan for addressing those ills before
American and other foreign investors will find Russia attractive,
and the United States and multinational banks will step up badly
needed aid.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton journeyed to here to Aachen, regarded by many
as the cradle of Europe, where he was awarded the prestigious
Charlemagne Prize, named for the conqueror who placed most of
present-day Europe under his rule 1,200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the occasion to try to allay concerns across Europe
about the growing dominance of U.S. might, paying tribute to his
own country's roots and casting the United States as a product of
European vision and drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had our differences,'' Clinton said. ``But the
simple fact is, since Europe is an idea as much as a place, America
also is a part of Europe, bound by ties of family, history and
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the New World explorations of Portuguese, Spanish,
French, British and others, Clinton said, ``without the longing for
a new Europe, there never would have been an America in the first
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed, though, that European security remains
integral to U.S. strategic policy, vowing that there would be no

the core of Europe's defense.

<P>
   It is a truism of the investing world: Over the long term stocks
grow at an annualized rate of 10 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, equities may do better in some decades, as they did in the
1980s and 1990s, just as they may do worse in others, say, the
1930s and 1960s. But, eventually, their long-term growth rate will
level out within this range _ a rate economists know as the stock
market's ``expected return.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the rate investors require to compensate them for the
risk in equity investments, and it should remain relatively
constant over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   But what if it turns out that we've all been too optimistic
about the expected return of stocks? Then asset allocation models
would have to be recalculated to cut their equity weightings.
Indeed, huge swaths of capital would need to be shifted into
nonequity asset classes. Certainly investing the Social Security
Trust Fund in stocks, as George W. Bush and many others have
proposed, would suddenly make a lot less sense.
</P>
<P>
   Well, two of this country's most influential finance professors,
Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago and Ken French of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have just completed research
showing that the expected return from stocks is more than five
percentage points a year lower than previously thought. Though this
research has not yet been published, word of it is beginning to
spread.
</P>
<P>
   Determining stocks' expected return isn't easy, since it
requires viewing the markets over extremely long periods. Fama and
French focused on U.S. stocks over the last 130 or so years. In
particular, they observed that the stock market's average annual
return from 1950 through 1999, at 14.8 percent, was about 6
percentage points higher than it was from 1872 through 1949, when
it was 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The key question: Which period represents the rule and which the
exception?
</P>
<P>
   The professors are confident that the last 50 years constitute
the exception. That means we're on shaky ground if we extrapolate
recent decades' stellar returns into the future.
</P>
<P>
   One of their more compelling points is based on the fact that
corporate America's average annual return on equity over the last
50 years has been 11.9 percent, nearly three percentage points
lower than the stock market's average return over that period.
</P>
<P>
   This, the professors say, all but proves that stocks' expected
return should be below what their historical return has been over
the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
   Why is that? If the market's expected return is greater than a
company's return on equity, the rational thing for the company to
do is close up shop and invest its assets in the stock market.
Alert balance sheet readers will note that, because the market's
expected return is also the rate at which a company's future income
stream is discounted for valuation purposes, the present value of
such a company's future earnings would be negative.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you believe that stocks' historical return
over the last 50 years reflects their genuine expected return,
then, in effect, you must also believe that corporate America on
balance has been unprofitable on a discounted valuation basis over
the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The professors' point is that corporate America's returns on
equity, on average, cannot have trailed the market's true expected
return for five full decades.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been overestimating the expected return from
stocks: It should be no higher than their underlying companies'
returns on equity, or three percentage points a year less than the
equity market's annual return over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, returns on equity are widely assumed to be upwardly
biased because they are based on artificially low book values. So
even this overstates expected return.
</P>
<P>
   Why then have stocks bested what might be called their true
expected return for 50 years? Likely, it is because they have
benefited from some unexpected good news. The professors don't
discuss what that good news was, but it undoubtedly includes
America's emergence after World War II as an economic and political
superpower and its winning of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The professors note that unexpected good news is just that _
unexpected _ and its salutary effect on past returns should not be
extrapolated into the future. They do not predict a bear market,
but argue that we need to cut our expectations of future stock
market performance, not just for the next few years but in
perpetuity. &QL;

AMERICANS AREN'T IN THE MARKET FOR FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everywhere you turn nowadays, somebody is trying to sell you
something. Why not? The American economy is churning out
unprecedented prosperity, and consumers (the creatures formerly
known as ``people'') are snapping up vacation houses, fancy cars
and other nifty appurtenances of the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Folks are entitled to enjoy their earnings, after all. And why
should anyone attend social critics who, from their tasteful
vacation houses in Amagansett, berate the masses for buying
his-and-hers Barcaloungers?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the one thing nobody is insisting you rush out
and buy is freedom. Ever hear of it? I don't mean freedom of speech
or religion, which we enjoy in spades. I mean the freedom to do
what you want _ including, if necessary, telling your boss to drop
dead. For non-lottery winners, it's the kind of freedom that comes
of thrift, and maybe also self-knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm suggesting, in other words, is to forget that big new
professional-quality range or $40,000 sport utility vehicle and buy
yourself some freedom; you really can, because it's a commodity
just like any other.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-earner household, for instance, maybe one of you can
quit and go back to school, or even see the kids once in awhile.
Save enough and perhaps live a little more modestly, and you might
be able to ditch that lucrative but unworthy gig you've been
slaving at all these years and do something you believe in _ teach
school, start a business, move to the country, join the Elks. Read
a book, for Pete's sake.
</P>
<P>
   The current boom comes at a steep price. Cell phones, pagers,
e-mail and other technological tethers keep us on our toes at all
hours. Those who hand out Internet freebies insist that you pay
with your privacy. Even the dot-com elite find themselves bound by
so-called golden handcuffs: They can't leave until their options
vest, and now that investors are showing signs of coming to their
senses about Internet valuations, it may all be for naught anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when more people than ever have the opportunity to do
what they want in life, many lack the imagination to do anything
but accumulate possessions. Freedom is losing market share to
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Why? One possibility is that freedom has a marketing problem.
All the other stuff is hawked day and night in commercials
suggesting that a product will somehow make you more free rather
than less. Yet freedom itself goes unpromoted.
</P>
<P>
   This woeful lack of advertising for America's very best product
means relatively few people know about it, at least judging by
consumer behavior. Easy credit and record-high personal
indebtedness mean that, despite rising affluence, lots of people
still owe their souls to what amounts to the company store. ``Money
is coined liberty,'' Dostoyevski rightly observed long ago. People
who make pronouncements like that are usually well-fixed in the
things department; the poor regrettably don't have the option of
blithely giving up some of their income to change their lives.
Besides, Americans really like all the stuff they buy, even
deriving a sense of identity from it. Yet many of us are so rich
that we need not give up much material well-being to become a whole
lot freer to do what we want to do.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Americans aren't in the market for more freedom because
they already enjoy an extraordinary degree of personal liberty, by
global and historical standards. It's odd that we aren't any
happier, though. Maybe we have too much of some kinds of freedom
and too little of others.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that money buys freedom (if not love) might change
the way you look at all you make and spend. If you're smart, it
will induce you to save more. It might also challenge you to think
about what you're doing with your life. Then again, money has
always heavily taxed the imagination. In this day of unbacked
currency and electronic balances, the whole concept requires a leap
of collective faith.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the reason there's so little call for more material
freedom in this country. More than anything else you buy, freedom
demands that you do something with it. It's not something to tuck
away in the garage or unload a few years later on eBay. When
someone asks, ``Free to do what?'' the answer doesn't always come
easily. But when you're lucky enough to live in a time and place
like this one, perhaps that's your  &UR; real &LR;  job _ not making the
money, but figuring out what you ought to achieve with it. &QL;

DRIVER BEWARE, WHEN REFINANCING A CAR LOAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By STACY KRAVETZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gerald Jutting drove his 1997 Oldsmobile Bravada home from
the dealership, he thought he had found a good deal. The interest
rate on the loan the dealer secured for him from a local bank was
8.75 percent, better even than the employee rate at the bank where
he works.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, he began seeing even more attractive rates
advertised on the Internet. One Saturday Jutting, 51, typed in an
online application at the PeopleFirst.com Web site, and was
approved almost instantly. He refinanced his car.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking of every twitch in interest rates has been
developing into a bit of a national obsession for a while, and
consumers have become quite willing to refinance home mortgages
when rates bounce favorably. Playing hopscotch with car loans is a
newer phenomenon, fraught with pitfalls for the incautious.
</P>
<P>
   Jutting's case illustrates the kind of situation where
refinancing makes sense. His new loan, for the $20,000 balance he
owed on his car, is at 7.49 percent for five years. His original
note was for six years, so his new monthly payment is actually $25
larger, but he will make fewer payments; all told, he will save
$800.
</P>
<P>
   But many auto refinancings do the opposite, lowering monthly
payments by stretching the term, and thus greatly increasing the
total to be repaid. Some refinance lenders will let consumers
borrow more than they owe on their old loan, or even more than the
car is worth _ giving borrowers extra cash to use as they wish, but
leaving them deeper in debt than before.
</P>
<P>
   Refinancing of car loans is growing rapidly, with much of the
action online, and lenders are stepping up marketing efforts.
Reasons for the tactic's rising popularity can be found at both
ends of the consumer sophistication spectrum. Relatively savvy car
buyers like Jutting who for one reason or another have gotten stuck
with high-rate loans are eager to replace them with lower rates,
while others with less financial acumen may respond to the siren
song of lenders' advertising, and mistake lower payments for less
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Having the consumer money is the heart of the lender's pitch, of
course, a pitch often directed to the names in commercial databases
of recent car loan borrowers. One recent mailing from Auto-refi
Financial Services says ``save up to $40+ per month'' in
eye-catching type. A company spokesman said its officials were not
ready to discuss its offer, which he called a prototype, with a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   In general, auto refinancings work the way home refinancings do.
The new lender pays off an existing loan in full and replaces it
with a new loan on different terms _ a longer or shorter term, a
higher or lower interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a crucial difference. Homes tend to rise in value
over time, or at least hold their value. But new cars depreciate
sharply, especially in the early going, when they are often worth
far less than what is owed on them. That condition is called being
upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you paid sticker price with a low down payment, you're
upside down in your loan when you drive off the lot,'' said Tamela
Rich, director of auto development at LendingTree, a loan-arranging
Web site .
</P>
<P>
   Consider a year-old BMW 528i sedan that sold new for $40,000. If
the owner put down $2,000 and borrowed at 10 percent for five
years, the $11,684 paid so far still leaves a balance of $38,736 on
the loan, because, like a home mortgage, a car loan's early
payments are mostly interest, not principal. But the Kelley Blue
Book trade-in value of the car has fallen by now to $33,005.
</P>
<P>
   This is a financially dangerous time for the car owner; neither
a sale nor an accident that totals the car will yield enough to
repay the loan. A refinancing that extends the term or increases
the amount borrowed, as many do, will make matters worse and
prolong the upside-down period.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, a refinancing is just what is needed to
correct a borrowing mistake. ``So many customers go into the
dealership and haggle over the price of the car until they get to
where they can see the light at the end of the tunnel _ and then
lose their guard a bit when it comes to financing,'' said Bob
Ferber, an auto finance executive at eloan.com, an Internet-based
lender. About one-quarter of visitors to the Web site want to
refinance car loans.
</P>
<P>
   The very low promotional interest rates automakers have long
offered on some models are beginning to dry up _ DaimlerChrysler
said last week it would almost entirely stop offering them _ and
the run-of-the-mill loan rates available through dealers are
usually a bit higher than can be obtained directly from banks or
credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers with stained or strained credit can also benefit.
Making even a few timely payments on the kind of high-interest loan
offered to a ``subprime'' borrower may qualify the borrower for a
refinancing at a much lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Federal Reserve's recent efforts to head off incipient
inflation by increasing interest rates, general declines in
consumer rates are probably not in the immediate offing, and if
they were, they would be more likely to show up in mortgage rates,
which are more volatile than auto loan rates. But auto rates do
sometimes fall, making refinancing at a lower rate attractive to
many borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   There are many loan provisions to pay attention to besides the
rate and term. The old loan agreement may have features like gap
insurance, warranties, and credit life and disability insurance
that may be missing from a refinance offer.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is important. Lenders prefer to refinance vehicles that
are less than six months old, when they still may be worth 80
percent or more of the purchase price. Cars much more than a year
old may be rejected as having too little collateral value. Lenders
rarely advance more than 130 percent of the car's value.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the annual percentage rate is ``the one number a customer
should focus on,'' said Doug Lebda, chief executive officer of
LendingTree.com, because lenders are required by law to calculate
it in a way that allows apples-to-apples comparisons.  &QL;

A GUIDE TO READING C.S LEWIS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies LEWIS-PILGRIMS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interested in investigating some of C.S. Lewis' writings? Here's
a review of a new guide to his work, plus a list of some of his
best-known books.
</P>
<P>
   _Colin Duriez's ``The C.S. Lewis Encyclopedia'' (Crossway,
$17.99) is subtitled ``A Complete Guide to His Life, Thought, and
Writings.'' Well, all right _ for a really complete guide to
``probably the greatest popularizer of the Christian faith in
recent times,'' you'd need a tome at least three or four times this
size. But you might be surprised at what Duriez is able to do in
240 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The entries include material on Lewis' books, background,
relatives, friends and philosophies. Distinguishing this volume
from Zondervan's ``The C.S. Lewis Reader's Encyclopedia'' (which is
otherwise more exhaustive _ and expensive) is Duriez's extensive
cataloging of Lewis' fictional characters and sites, although those
entries are rather abbreviated.
</P>
<P>
   Duriez, an editor with InterVarsity Press in the United Kingdom,
tends to write informally, although ordinary readers may find the
material on academic subjects a bit rarefied. ``The C.S. Lewis
Encyclopedia'' will be a handy reference work for those interested
in a long-popular writer.
</P>
<P>
   _''The Chronicles of Narnia,'' a seven-volume fantasy series for
children beginning with ``The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.'' A
lion named Aslan is a Christlike figure.
</P>
<P>
   _''Mere Christianity,'' a classic discourse on Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   _''The Screwtape Letters,'' a satirical work about a devil's
advice to an apprentice demon.
</P>
<P>
   _''Surprised by Joy,'' Lewis' autobiography describing his
spiritual journey from atheist to thoughtful Christian.
</P>

OXFORD, England: by collectors. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tour buses have been banned from Lewis Close, the tree-lined
street leading to The Kilns, but small vans and taxis frequently
unload tourists who shoot pictures of The Kilns and wander in a
nearby forest that was owned by Lewis and his late brother, Warren
``Warnie'' Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The forest _ with a small lake and strangely shaped rocks and
tree trunks that sometimes resemble monsters _ is said to have
inspired many of Lewis' children's stories.
</P>
<P>
   At Magdalen College, where many famous people taught, there is
little information about Lewis. But many visitors gravitate toward
the chapel where Lewis often worshipped.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis frequently walked in the deer park and other wooded areas
behind Magdalen College. On a path called Addison's Walk is a
plaque displaying one of his last poems. Some believe that the
poem, ``What the Birds Said Earlier This Year,'' was a premonition
of his death. It includes the words:
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, this year, as all the flowers foretell,
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall escape the circle and undo the spell.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, an unlikely blend of tweedy intellectual and ardent
Christian who embraced the supernatural, was a gifted lecturer and
writer on many subjects _
</P>
<P>
   moral, philosophical and theological.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that one of the 20th century's greatest expounders of
the Christian faith is identified with a pub is only one of many
unexpected twists in the life of this brilliant Oxford don.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more popular now than when he died,'' said Walter Hooper,
a kindly North Carolina native who was Lewis' secretary when he
died. ``He still has a lot to say to a confused and complicated
world. He could take the great wisdom of the ages and make it
understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a member of the Church of England, died Nov. 22, 1963,
the same day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.
Few took note of Lewis' death then, but his fame has endured.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by reading Celtic and Norse mythology as a
14-year-old, Lewis was an atheist much of his adult life. His
conversion to Christianity in 1931 was heavily influenced by his
friend Tolkien. Lewis became convinced of the supernatural
existence of good and evil and believed Jesus was God's way of
rescuing humankind from sinfulness.
</P>
<P>
   He had a gift for explaining complex theological matters in
simple terms, demonstrated when he went on BBC radio during World
War II with comforting talks about his faith. Some of his major
Christian works include ``Miracles'' and ``Mere Christianity,'' a
remarkably down-to-earth account of how a skeptic came to embrace
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a splendid popularizer of the faith,'' said Barrington
White, well-known British church historian and retired principal,
or president, of Oxford's Regents Park College. ``I can remember
during World War II how much he did for the generation of my
parents. He won many of them back to faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' religious allegories, such as the ``The Screwtape
Letters'' _ fictional correspondence between a senior and junior
devil _ have been compared to those of John Bunyan, author of ``The
Pilgrim's Progress.''
</P>
<P>
   His children's stories are equally popular, including the
imaginative ``The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,'' the first of
his chronicles of the fictional Land of Narnia.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper _ who has lived in Oxford most of his adult life and has
been named by Lewis' estate to edit his letters and other papers _
scoffs at critics who say Lewis oversimplified theological
concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is part of his brilliance,'' Hooper said. ``He
has a double gift. He can be both profound and clear.''
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of C.S. Lewis Societies in the United States
and around the world. How would C.S. Lewis feel about his
continuing popularity?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Lewis doesn't hear any of this,'' Hooper said.
``I think he is in purgatory, where he hoped and prayed he would be
after his death, so he could make up for some of his sins.''

SCHOLAR'S SPIRIT STILL LIVES IN WOODS, COUNTRY LANES AND PUBS OF
OXFORD
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by LEWIS-GUIDE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England _ One of the best places to find out about
atheist-turned-devout-Christian C.S. Lewis is in a pub.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the surprising things the droves of Lewis pilgrims
discover in Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Lewis' books are in print, and he has a cultlike
following. He accumulated more fans with the 1994 release of the
critically acclaimed movie ``Shadowlands,'' starring Anthony
Hopkins and Debra Winger, about Lewis' love for an American, Joy
Gresham.
</P>
<P>
   The fans of the scholar with the deep faith and the wonderful
way with words are so many that directing Lewis pilgrims is a minor
industry in this part of England.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Oxford visitors who are curious about Lewis are
directed to his favorite pub, the Eagle and the Child, nicknamed
the Bird and the Baby by Lewis and his literary cronies, including
fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors treat the pub on St. Giles Street like a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Even on Friday nights, when students loudly revel on an outdoor
patio until after midnight, Lewis aficionados can be seen squinting
at plaques and pictures and discussing Lewis and his comrades, The
Inklings.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the many sites in Oxford connected with Lewis can be
challenging. But aids abound.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a hand-drawn map showing Lewis sites can be
obtained for a few pence at the old Registry Office where Lewis and
Gresham were married in a civil ceremony. The building is now the
Quaker Center, also on St. Giles, just two doors down from the
Eagle and the Child.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a recent development, the Oxford Information
Centre near the bus station distributes a commendable summary of
Lewis' life, with helpful information on how to reach sites
connected to Lewis. Local tour guides take groups on walks to the
Lewis sites for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   But zealous Lewis pilgrims can explore on their own, using the
map from the Quaker Center. The tireless can even tramp the five
miles or so to Lewis' home in Headington, The Kilns, following the
route often taken by the professor.
</P>
<P>
   Near his home is Holy Trinity Church, which he attended, and the
church cemetery where he is buried. The church has a stained-glass
window honoring him.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites to visit include University College, where Lewis
studied and received his degrees; University Church of St. Mary the
Virgin, where Lewis preached his first sermon in October 1939; and
10 Old High Street, where Joy lived with her two sons.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewis pilgrim can also take a taxi. Peter Cousins, a taxi
driver recommended by Lewis scholars, has been conducting Lewis
tours for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   He not only shows visitors the sites but also offers anecdotes
that he has gleaned from interviews and biographies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got involved with C.S. Lewis quite by accident,'' Cousins
said. ``A woman hailed my cab outside Magdalen College and wanted
to visit Lewis' home. We couldn't find it, so I began learning all
I could about C.S. Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousins, treasurer of Oxford's C.S. Lewis Society, drove a
visitor by Parsons' Pleasure, a pond where Lewis was fond of
swimming nude. He stopped at Lewis' first home, at No. 1 Mansfield
Drive, and pointed out a house with a red door as the place Gresham
lived before marrying Lewis. Cousins wended through heavy traffic
to the Eastgate Hotel near Magdalen College, where the couple met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadowlands,'' the movie, ``had so many errors,'' Cousins
said. ``It had Lewis and Joy being wed at the Registry Office in
London. But it happened right here in Oxford.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was a professor of literature at Oxford's Magdalen College
for 29 years. When he took a distinguished professor position at a
rival institution, Cambridge University, late in his career, he
maintained his residence in Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Now the red brick house, surrounded by plush gardens, is owned
by the C.S. Lewis Foundation of Redlands, Calif., and is being
developed as a study center. Volunteers from around the world live
for a time at the home, repair it, answer visitors'questions and
participate in conferences. A major symposium was held there in
1998 on the 100th anniversary of Lewis' birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about living in this house, it is very
humbling,'' said Ryan Hawkins of Arkadelphia, Ark., who is spending
a year as chief resident, or caretaker, of The Kilns. ``We have
about six people staying here now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins and his wife, Meredith, showed a visitor around the home
and even opened the attic, which may have inspired Lewis' ``The
Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Gilnett of Seattle, who has been volunteering at The Kilns
since 1993, said that Gresham was responsible for remodeling the
home in the late 1950s. Much of the original furniture is gone,
including old wardrobes bought by collectors.

LUSTY COMEDY AROUSES PASSIONATE FEELINGS IN BOTH FANS AND FOES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by TV-SEX-WOMEN) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ongoing quarrel over how trampy or edgy, cheap or deep,
artificial or genuine ``Sex and the City'' is broke out into a
range war along the sexual divide earlier this year. With the
show's unexpected Golden Globes win as best comedy producing both
cheers and jeers, the already-heated debate over the show's merits
(or lack thereof) leaped out of control, setting things up quite
nicely, as it turns out, for the show's third, friskier-than-ever
season.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the first of 18 new episodes Sunday on HBO, ``Sex
and the City,'' about four single women (Sarah Jessica Parker,
Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis and Kim Cattrall) navigating love,
lust and sexual liability in Manhattan, has now reached the point
where success definitely breeds contempt, which has girded the
show's passionate fans to take up arms to defend their show (and
usually, in the process, their gender as well).
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City'' scores such a deep response from its fans
because its endlessly chatty observations on sex of all kinds, sex
toys, wrinkled bottoms, flat chests, large chests, spanking, boy
toys, bisexuality and other such subjects are used as bridges to
serious and very real emotional issues. And while mining emotional
terrain that's familiar to anyone who's lived _ willfully or not _
the single life, it toys with and confounds its audience's
expectations in a way that no TV show has since ``Ally McBeal's''
first season, and does so with considerably more amusement and
poignancy _ and without any dancing babies.
</P>
<P>
   For insiders, that ``Sex and the City'' comes from
producer-writer Darren Star only adds to the unexpectedness of the
show's success. Star was creator of ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' and
``Melrose Place,'' two series that, over the years, ground their
audiences to dust by elevating tales of shallow young
pretty-somethings to high drama. True to form, their recent demises
(''Melrose Place'' last season, ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' last
month) weren't graceful exits so much as mercy killings.
</P>
<P>
   Star vacated network television in disgust after his ``Central
Park West'' went belly up a couple years back, and it appeared his
reputation was headed the same way. You could say ``Sex''
represents the producer's sweet revenge, particularly now that the
broadcast networks have summoned him to duplicate ``Sex's'' success
with a drama about men working on Wall Street. (Good luck, pal.)
</P>
<P>
   Cattrall, whose performance as the cynical, sex-hungry Samantha
has revived her struggling career, has said Star's no-holds-barred
scripts have given her, finally, creative liberation.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Sex'' can be appreciated for its fearless,
dare-to-be-different writing, it is also easy to love because it's
eons removed from the typical sitcom format. In just about every
episode, a subject (usually about dating) is raised and debated
heatedly, usually over a meal or a drink at a nightclub. Adjustment
follows debate until the climax (often literally), after which the
women cut their losses and get together again to figure out just
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   What has made ``Sex'' so watchable is that the women, unlike
characters in most sitcoms, actually learn from their mistakes
sometimes, and in the process they have matured from stereotypes to
characters with hearts and real vulnerabilities. For example: The
way Parker's Carrie sets herself up for failure with Chris Noth's
Mr. Big, the quintessential ``Man Who Can't Commit,'' could not
have happened in the show's first year, but it's just right for
where her character is at in the second season.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Parker has been able to create a kinder, gentler
Carrie without losing the edge of the more morose, cynical
character in Candace Bushnell's book, on which ``Sex'' is loosely
based.
</P>
<P>
   None of which diminishes what I consider to be the truly
subversive part of the show. A number of women I know are already
so devoted to this show it's a little frightening, but the fact is
that these characters they relate to so passionately are no more
real than the tooth fairy. I can't help but wonder if these female
characters that women love so much are actually designed for men to
love, or at least for men to love to hate. I often wonder if the
tight-lipped pessimism of Nixon's Miranda, for example, is the
result of the show's male writers (most of the writing staff is
male, by the way) using a character to explain their own bitterness
toward women. And I wonder if the odd situations Davis' mousy
Charlotte always seems to get herself into result, again, from male
writers working out their own feelings toward a tease masquerading
as a good girl.
</P>
<P>
   And while I've found the foursome's coarse euphemisms for men's
body parts hilarious, a number of men have found it offensive and
shallow, which once again suggests the show has been designed as
much to salve male viewers' wounds as those of females.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte are, let's face it,
elitist snobs who care little about needs other than their own. Men
with money and standing and fame attract them, yet they whine when
the rich lugs turn out to be soulless jerks. (Did Carrie really
think she could change Mr. Big?)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's a testament to Star's talent that he's able to make
us feel for these woman, how, for instance, Miranda can seem like
such a, well, shallow witch, and yet pull us back on her side in a
subsequent episode in which she shows a warm heart.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, if the show's female fans have no problem with
the characters' superficial musings, who am I to suggest the show
strays far from the truth?
</P>
<P>
   As for future adventures, Sunday's premiere finds Carrie
attracted to a politician played by John Slattery while Samantha
has meaningless but, as she notes, ``pretty exquisite,'' sex with a
fireman up against his truck. Miranda gets laser eye surgery and
has to be led home by that ever-compromising Steve, played by David
Eigenberg, in the clingy role reserved for women on most shows.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent episodes include ``Politically Erect,'' which begs
the question, ``Can there be sex without politics?'' And, in ``Boy,
Girl, Boy, Girl ...'' Carrie is faced with the question, ``Does
gender really exist?''
</P>
<P>
   Although there's always the chance that the women could become
as peevishly insufferable as the squabbling malcontents of
``Melrose,'' right now the playful atmosphere of ``Sex'' provides a
joyful romp that is unlike anything else in prime time.

SEX AND MY CITY: SINGLE WOMEN WHO KNOW WHAT THEY WANT
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies TV-SEX) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I hate that show.''
</P>
<P>
   Curious about how any twentysomething guy could not
automatically give his approval to something so obviously heavy on
the sex quotient, I turned my attention from the Dallas Stars
post-game wrap-up to his attractive young face and asked him to
explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's written for men,'' he said. ``The women on `Sex and the
City' aren't real. They act like sexual predators. Women aren't
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   As a thirtysomething single woman, I think I know exactly what
women are like _ certainly more so than this freshly minted man.
But never one to ruin a Memorial Day party with debate about the
politics of sex, I decided instead to agree with his next point: It
was definitely time to gather a group and head to a local bar for
some beer and darts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I give you a ride?'' he asked me, heading for a tiny,
black sports car. Climbing in, I couldn't help but wonder when I
had last been in a car with just two seats. Ten years ago? Fifteen?
There was no room for kids. No room for groceries. Barely room for
two shopping bags full of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And then it hit me. There's no way this Generation Next guy _
who spent his time in the company of twentysomething girls guilty
of faux pas involving tanning salons, fake nails and embarrassing
errors in fashion judgment _ could relate to my favorite show about
four single, independent women in their 30s. He was used to being
around twentysomething girls _ our youthful doppelgangers, as the
HBO show's heroine, Carrie Bradshaw, described them in one episode.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know anything about single, independent women in their
30s like me.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The first time I saw Carrie Bradshaw and her friends Miranda,
Samantha and Charlotte, I fell completely in love.
</P>
<P>
   It was last December, the end of the show's second season, and a
friend taped the finale for me. I watched it three times in two
days.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Carrie mustered up the courage to ask a newly engaged
Mr. Big _ her on again/off again boyfriend for two years _ why it
wasn't her he was marrying, I tried to answer the same question for
myself. I had an ex-boyfriend, too, who three or four nanoseconds
after our breakup decided commitment was OK after all _ so long as
it wasn't to me.
</P>
<P>
   As Carrie and her girlfriends, swilling cosmopolitans, analyzed
the Big situation, concluding that Big didn't have the capacity to
understand complicated Carrie and instead had settled for someone
simpler, Carrie felt better, stronger, wilder.
</P>
<P>
   I turned off the TV, drove directly to the headquarters of my
cable company and agreed to pay $18 more each month to add Home Box
Office to my viewing package.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Predators'' is a strong word. Predators steal. They plunder.
</P>
<P>
   When you're thirtysomething, and you're a single, independent
woman, it's not so much that you think of men as sexual remora,
it's just that you know more about what you want _ and don't want
ever again under any circumstances whatsoever _ in a relationship.
And you're not afraid to talk _ and laugh _ about it.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, as I watched Sunday night reruns of the second
``Sex'' season, often swilling wine with my girlfriends, I wondered
along with Carrie and her friends about a number of quirky,
quixotic but somehow essential relationship questions that are the
comedic foundations of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Can you be friends with an ex? My real-life friend Carrie
answered with an emphatic no, agreeing with the show's Miranda that
the best philosophy is ``we didn't work out as a couple; you need
to not exist'' and proving it by hiding behind a counter in Whole
Foods when her ex waltzed through the glass doors.
</P>
<P>
   Have we evolved past relationships? My personal example was a
clueless guy named Tony who called me back a full four weeks after
our wild first date and had the nerve to think I might like to go
out that very evening _ could we meet in an hour?
</P>
<P>
   And this one, a personal favorite: Are all men freaks? My
girlfriends' list of inexplicable behavior from men was longer than
the lists of what we bought each week at Target.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It's the age-old question. Which came first: women talking
openly about sex _ or ``Sex in the City,'' which encourages a
no-secrets dialogue among friends, pondering those questions that
single, independent women in their 30s are never supposed to think,
let alone say out loud (like this season's debut dilemma: ``Do
women just really want to be rescued?'').
</P>
<P>
   What I'm sure of is that lately I've been framing my own musings
about men into the kinds of questions Carrie punches into her
laptop each episode in her work as a columnist for a New York
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   _Voice mails, e-mails and Caller ID _ is electronic technology
heating up or destroying modern romance?
</P>
<P>
   _How can you tell if ``no'' really means ``maybe'' or ``yes''?
</P>
<P>
   _Does a guy deserve an official breakup after only one date?
</P>
<P>
   _And can a thirtysomething woman find any sort of happiness with
a twentysomething man?
</P>
<P>
   This last one came to mind after two games of darts, one game of
pool and several pitchers full of bad, bad beer when the
twentysomething guy asked for my phone number with all the
confidence of someone who has yet to have his dreams dashed and his
illusions shattered.
</P>
<P>
   So, I gave him my number.
</P>
<P>
   And I even let him think, for a while, that it was all his idea.
</P>

 &HT;    EDs: reworks 24th graf to clarify both Clinton, Putin statements
on sharing NMD information
 &HT;    CLINTON SUGGESTS NATO, EU MAY EMBRACE RUSSIA AS PARTNER

<P>
   AACHEN, Germany _ Reaching out to Moscow on the eve of his first
summit with the new Russian leader, President Clinton suggested
Friday that Russia might one day become part of both NATO and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were part of a larger call for the United States and
Europe to step up efforts to fold Russia into the global mainstream
as a way to help advance the uneven pace of democratic and economic
reforms in the former Communist superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must work to build a partnership with Russia that
encourages stability, democracy and cooperative engagement with the
West, and full integration with global institutions,'' said
Clinton, who travels to Moscow on Saturday for a weekend summit
with newly elected President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means no doors can be sealed shut to Russia _ not NATO's,
not the (European Union's),'' Clinton said. ``The alternative would
be a future of harmful competition between Russia and the rest, and
the end of our vision of an undivided continent.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has had an observation and consultative role within NATO
since 1994, and Russian troops have participated with NATO forces
in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. Russia hasn't
sought full membership in the alliance that stood sentry against
Soviet divisions throughout the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed, though, since the Soviet Union's collapse in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borders built to stop tanks now manage invasions of tourists
and trucks,'' said Clinton, adding that the prospect of a fuller
embrace between Russia, and NATO and the EU _ the security and
economic institutions that bore the Western alliance through
decades of Cold War against the former Soviet Union _ should not be
ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to fly to Moscow Saturday night, local
time, after participating in a day-long conference on 21st Century
governance in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin plans to host Clinton for a working dinner at the Kremlin,
setting up a day of summitry and a joint press conference on
Sunday. On Monday, Clinton will become the first U.S. president to
address the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting between the two leaders since Putin's election
in March, the summit is expected to focus on a high stakes set of
nuclear arms and missile defense talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger,
has repeatedly cautioned reporters to expect no immediate
breakthroughs on those fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin are already scheduled to meet three more times
this year, and the two leaders are far apart over nuclear arms
reductions and the question of whether the United States should
deploy a national missile defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said, though, that the two men will likely ink an accord
calling for each side to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade
plutonium, enough to produce thousands of nuclear warheads, over an
agreed upon period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the agenda will be Putin's plans for shoring up the
Russian economy, improving but still beleaguered by high inflation,
rampant corruption, criminal activity and capital flight. Putin
needs to present a credible plan for addressing those ills before
American and other foreign investors will find Russia attractive,
and the United States and multinational banks will step up badly
needed aid.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton journeyed to here to Aachen, regarded by many
as the cradle of Europe, where he was awarded the prestigious
Charlemagne Prize, named for the conqueror who placed most of
present-day Europe under his rule 1,200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the occasion to try to allay concerns across Europe
about the growing dominance of U.S. might, paying tribute to his
own country's roots and casting the United States as a product of
European vision and drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had our differences,'' Clinton said. ``But the
simple fact is, since Europe is an idea as much as a place, America
also is a part of Europe, bound by ties of family, history and
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the New World explorations of Portuguese, Spanish,
French, British and others, Clinton said, ``without the longing for
a new Europe, there never would have been an America in the first
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed, though, that European security remains
integral to U.S. strategic policy, vowing that there would be no
diminution in the American role as leader of the NATO alliance at
the core of Europe's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe's security remains tied to America's security,''
Clinton said. ``When it is threatened, as it has in Bosnia and
Kosovo, we, too, will respond. When it is being built, we, too,
will always take part.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as he re-asserted U.S. strategic interests in the
continent, Clinton sought to assuage growing concerns in some
quarters of Europe over the growing influence the United States
enjoys as the world's last remaining economic and military
superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns have been rekindled by a proposal Clinton is
weighing to build a missile defense system to protect the United
States from the threat of a inter-continental ballistic attack by a
rouge state, such as North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Russia opposes the project, saying it would upset the balance of
power between the world's two largest possessors of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered earlier this week to share information with the
Russians about how to prevent such rogue attacks. In an interview
Thursday night on NBC-TV, Putin said that he would be receptive to
such talks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leaders in France, Germany and elsewhere across the
continent have echoed Russia's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who raised the fear
Thursday that a U.S. missile defense shield could trigger a renewed
U.S.-Russian arms race, reiterated those concerns during Friday's
award ceremony. He added, further, that such a system could
threaten the U.S.-European unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You, Bill, have always sought to bring about progress in
disarmament,'' said Schroeder. ``It is therefore good that you have
said that, in making a decision, when the time comes, the relevant
security and disarmament aspects in particular will be weighed.''
</P>
<P>
   Continued Schroeder, ``this includes considering the impact on
other important states, as well as possible consequences for the
cohesion of the Atlantic alliance. Our overriding objective must
remain to guarantee durable security and to carefully choose the
best means to this end in any given situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is weighing whether to build a limited NMD system that,
proponents claim, would be able to intercept and destroy one or a
few ballistic missiles fired at the United States from across the
Pacific ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon plans to test the system in July then advise
Clinton on its projected cost _ now between $26 billion and $60
billion _ and effectiveness. It would take four or five years to
put into place.
</P>
<P>
   A decision from Clinton isn't expected until the fall.

&HT;     LAW GRADS FIND CLERKING HAS APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By L.M. SIXEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Frenzied competition for lawyers from Internet
start-ups and investment banking companies have pushed first-year
associate salaries at Houston's blue chip firms to $115,000.
</P>
<P>
   In other cities such as Chicago and New York, starting salaries
are closer to $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   So how can federal judges find newly minted lawyers who graduate
at the top of their class who are willing to spend a year or two as
a clerk at an annual salary of $42,000?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, the relatively low salaries don't appear to
be much of a problem in attracting top graduates. Which goes to
show money isn't everything.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Circuit Judge Jerry Smith of the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals in Houston said he hasn't noticed any falloff in
top-quality applications for the four, one-year clerkship positions
he offers each year. But, he added, the run-up in law firm salaries
is fairly recent so it could depress the next crop of applications.
</P>
<P>
   Other judges aren't seeing a decline in the number or quality of
the hundreds of applications they receive each year either.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that applications would dip but a clerkship is a
prestigious appointment, said U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore,
who has two clerks at a time on two-year appointments.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, having a federal clerkship _ especially at the U.S.
Supreme Court _ is a real plum in any lawyer's rsum. It's so great
that many new lawyers are willing to accept the feudal lordship
system and work for the equivalent of slave wages.
</P>
<P>
   To make it work financially, Gilmore finds that many of the
clerks who come to work for her live at home with their parents to
save money.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Maya Raghu did to put a dent into her $55,000 of law
school loans. Raghu, who called her two years with Gilmore an
``absolutely amazing'' experience, said she doesn't regret the
sacrifice one bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the best legal job I will ever have,'' she said,
waxing on about her close-up view of the controversies in front of
the court.
</P>
<P>
   But the Georgetown University Law Center graduate is heading to
a law firm in New York this fall in which she'll start at $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty common phenomenon for Gilmore, who routinely
sees her clerks going into jobs that pay more than her $141,300
annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   Sorcha Landau has it better than most clerks. She worked for a
New York firm for a year before she arrived in Houston to clerk for
Gilmore and consequently received a special bump in pay that works
out to an extra $25,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her $67,000 pay packet is less than the $135,000 she'd be
earning if she were still in New York. However, it's enough to pay
the rent and her $700 a month in student loans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Landau said, her parents have a hard time with the fact
she accepted a lower-paying, two-year clerkship instead of taking
the big bucks at the law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand the honor _ in the abstract _ but they can't
wait for me to finish and get on with my career,'' she said. ``They
see me getting waylaid here in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   While many new lawyers can make the financial sacrifice, Gilmore
said she doesn't get enough minority applicants, especially from
students who are the first person in their family to go to college.
They can't afford to take a clerkship because of their heavy load
of student debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine taking a clerkship for $42,000 when you can get
$142,000 and have $70,000 in debt?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore said she set up an interview with a minority candidate
but before she could interview him, another judge hired him.
</P>
<P>
   To make it easier for students it has recruited to accept
clerkships before coming to work for the firm, Vinson &AMP; Elkins just
boosted its sign-on bonus to clerks from $10,000 to $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Reeder, the hiring partner at Vinson &AMP; Elkins, said the firm
wanted to encourage its lawyers to get what he calls a marvelous
up-close experience of how the judicial process works. He said the
firm also wanted to support what it sees as a good public service.
</P>
<P>
   Reeder said there was some concern at the firm that new lawyers
couldn't afford to take the clerkships without some special
financial help.
</P>
<P>
   It was all great news for Garrett Wotkyns, a first-year
associate, who is heading out for a one-year clerkship with a
federal appeals court judge in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Wotkyns said the money will come in handy so he can pay off a
chunk of his $100,000 in student loans.

PORTRAIT OF A DIRTY LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By now, many fashion photographers have had an
exhibition mounted or a book published to inform the world of their
artistic intentions. On Thursday, it was Juergen Teller's turn to
be an artist in New York. The German-born Londoner was in town for
his show at the Lehmann Maupin Gallery in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Teller is best known for discovering Kate Moss, and his images
of strung-out-looking models in unappealing settings (described as
everything from dirty realism to heroin chic) have helped to lower
the traditional standards of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't done much for the dress code at parties, either. For
his big night, the laid-back Teller, 36, was wearing ripped Levi's
with one button of his fly undone, a washed-out beige T-shirt and
canvas sneakers. In one pocket, he had stuffed a camera, in the
other, a pack of Marlboros. Never mind that the T-shirt was given
to him by Marc Jacobs and the camera was a limited-edition Olympus.
The effect was an oh-so-casual nonchalance that makes fashionable
people doubt themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about fashion at all,'' the unshaven Teller said
in his German accent, as he walked from the Mercer Hotel to his
opening. ``And I know it's kind of a dodgy thing to be a fashion
photographer, a kind of pathetic occupation, but I like it, even
though I question it.''
</P>
<P>
   SoHo's streets were glamour glutted with fashion statements,
from dirty denim to Sabrina heels. ``You can't get away from
fashion,'' said Teller, who had a hangover and whose hangdog hair
was greasy, not wet and squeaky-clean, he pointed out. ``The whole
beauty thing is everywhere. It's just really weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the gallery, fashion followers were flocking to celebrate
the pleasant and approachable Teller, and every one of them was far
better dressed than he was. Sofia Coppola, the director, for
instance, was in a flouncy denim skirt, and Dan Peres, the new
young editor of Details, wore a crisp white shirt and grown-up
slacks. The model Stephanie Seymour was in a pretty sundress, and
nearby, 5-year-old Troy Baker was drinking a Snapple in a
super-dapper blue suit.
</P>
<P>
   Even the usually low-key and pared-down Helmut Lang wore a natty
blazer, despite the oppressive heat. ``I wanted to make an effort
out of respect for the artist,'' he said, adding that he and Teller
share an interest in restraint. ``It's important to know when not
to do things.'' Like not dressing up for a fashionable,
high-profile party given in your honor? ``Juergen has to stay with
his trademark look,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   As the opening continued to open, questions rose in the air with
the heat. Were Teller's Polaroid shots of aspiring supermodels in
one room and giant portraits of smiling Miss Universe contestants
in another raw or facile? Did Jackson Pollack permanently alter the
dress code for all artistic geniuses? Do Marc Jacobs (who designs
beautiful clothes but never dresses in them) and Teller trade
T-shirts sometimes?
</P>
<P>
   As the evening wound down, so did Teller's pants, which had
dropped just low enough to reveal a bit of his behind and his boxer
shorts. ``He's got a timeless grunge look,'' observed Stefano
Tonchi, the creative fashion director of Esquire, who was wearing a
Jil Sander suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's all about unfashion,'' said Cary Leitzes, the photography
director of Harper's Bazaar. ``These days, the more powerful you
are, the schlumpier you are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless,'' added Stefan Campbell, a stylist, ``you're Anna
Wintour.''
</P>
<P>
   On his way out, someone asked the chain-smoking Teller how he
felt after his big evening. He shrugged. ``Not horrible,'' he said.

&HT;     POINTERS ON BUYING NEW GRAPHICS CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just because you're not a hard-core game player, don't think
your computing experience won't benefit from a better graphics
card. You don't have to be a Quake III junkie to discover the joy
of state-of-the-art 3-D acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't have to pay a fortune, either. One of the benefits
of the torrid pace of development in the graphics card business is
that yesterday's top-of-the-line board is now a bargain. Cards
introduced just nine to 12 months ago have more than enough power
to run today's games comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   My father is an example of those who switch cards. At 70, he's a
big fan of flight simulators, and he was happy with the look he got
on his relatively new IBM Aptiva, which comes with a generic,
built-in graphics chip.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until he saw Microsoft's Flight Simulator 2000 running
on an Elsa Gladiac card, which uses nVidia's new GeForce 2 GTS
processor.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he became interested in fill rates, gigatexels and
bump-mapping.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't need a Gladiac, though, which would cost him about
$350. He would be happy with a 3dfx Voodoo3, or a card that uses
nVidia's older TNT2 chip, or ATI Technology's Rage 128 card. He
could find all of these in the $100 to $200 range.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for a video card can be confusing for many reasons.
There are multiple generations of cards on store shelves, so
picking the right one based on budget and needs is not easy. You
also need to know something about your PC, and the games or
graphics applications you plan to run.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote a guide to the basics of video card shopping in May
1999, which you can read at www.chron.com/content/
chronicle/tech/99/05/14/compute.html. But there are now more
aspects to consider:
</P>
<P>
   The drop in PC prices means more people can afford a new
computer. But low-cost systems often have a serious graphics
drawback. Rather than using a replaceable video card for displays,
their displays are generated by a chip that's fixed to the main
system board. In modern PCs, the chip still communicates with the
rest of the computer though an Accelerated Graphics Port, or AGP,
connection, but there is no separate AGP slot.
</P>
<P>
   That means if you want to add a better card, you'll have to use
a PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) slot, which is a slower
connection.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the latest generation of cards is not available
in the older PCI format, though that may change. But older cards
unveiled in the last year should still provide enough speed and a
great look for most uses.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest trend in graphics card design is moving functions
that previously were handled by the computer's main processor to
the graphics card itself. This allows the PC's chip to do other
work, which speeds both graphics and other functions.
</P>
<P>
   Different card manufacturers take different approaches to this.
For example, cards that use nVidia's GeForce 256 and GeForce 2 GTS
chips, as well as ATI's upcoming Radeon 256 card, handle transform
and lighting _ the way objects are drawn and then lit in a 3-D
world _ on the graphics card itself.
</P>
<P>
   3dfx has not included this feature. Instead, its pitch is that
its new Voodoo4 and Voodoo5 cards are better at smoothing out edges
in 3-D scenes, a process known as full-scene anti-aliasing. (The
nVidia chip does this as well.) It's difficult to cut through the
marketing hype on these features. Some features, such as transform
and lighting, require developers to write software that takes
advantage of them. Others, such as anti-aliasing, work
automatically with any game.
</P>
<P>
   Look for features that are supported by more than one
manufacturer. Both 3dfx and nVidia offer anti-aliasing; ATI and
nVidia support transform and lighting. You'll find that developers
are more prone to take advantage of features if more than one
graphics company supports them.
</P>
<P>
   A graphics card is only as good as its drivers, the software
that lets the hardware talk to the computer's operating system.
Graphic card drivers are notoriously buggy _ in fact, many problems
in Windows can be traced to this problem.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, older cards may actually be more stable and
work with more applications and games than newer cards. Most of the
graphics card vendors are good about releasing new drivers on a
regular basis, so many bugs get worked out in the first three to
six months of a card's life.
</P>
<P>
   State of the art graphics cards are so powerful that other
facets of a PC can become a performance bottleneck. If you've got
an older PC with a paltry amount of memory, a next-generation video
card may be unable to strut its stuff in your system. In this case,
an older card that's still better than what you have now may be a
more cost-effective choice.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a hard-core gamer, or anxious to drain every drop of
performance from a graphics card, you may want to look for one
that's friendly to overclocking. This involves forcing the card to
run at a slightly faster speed than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Overclocking can be risky. Graphics chips can get hot, and
making them run faster makes them hotter. This can cause game
lockups, or even damage the chip. But some cards are more amenable
to overclocking, and those that are often come with built-in
utilities that let you do this.
</P>
<P>
   Take it slow, increasing the chip's speed a little at a time,
then testing with your favorite game after each increment. If you
start seeing erratic behavior, shut the game down and back off on
the speed.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, I'll take a look at two state-of-the-art cards:
Elsa's GeForce 2 GTS-based Gladiac and 3dfx's Voodoo5 5500.

FAME AND DISDAIN ON FAR WEST 15TH ST. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a spring Saturday night, a crowd reeking of grunge
and glamour choked the entrance to Gavin Brown's Enterprise, a
gallery in the meatpacking district. It had come to see
Fischerspooner, nine performance artists costumed like a hybrid of
the 1980s band Devo and the cast of ``The Rocky Horror Picture
Show.'' The artists sang and danced with the audience against a
backdrop of smoke, strobe lights and synthesized music.
Reservations for the five nights of performances were a must, but
many wheedled their way past the list-keepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mad,'' said Cecily Brown, the painter. ``No one wants to
be the one who hasn't seen it. Of course, it has to do with Gavin.
He has a consistently high batting average of art that is new and
lively.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavin is Gavin Brown, a British-born dealer, who represents a
roster of rising stars, the best known of whom is Chris Ofili,
whose creativity with elephant dung was the subject of the fuss
over the Brooklyn Museum's ``Sensation'' show last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown is more than an art dealer. He is also the proprietor
of Passerby, a bar adjacent to his gallery, which is a cliquish
rendezvous for art and fashion, attracting the likes of Moby, the
DJ; Chloe Sevigny, the actress; Terry Richardson, the fashion
photographer; and Jeffrey Kalinsky, the store owner.
</P>
<P>
   Right next door, Brown's wife, Lucy Barnes, runs a clothing
boutique, selling her own designs: slip dresses, A-line skirts and
halters with antique lace and crystal beads. She has a following
among well-heeled artists like Rachel Feinstein, who married the
painter John Currin in a Lucy Barnes gown inspired by Marie
Antoinette as a shepherdess. Her bridesmaids wore Barnes dresses
inspired by ``The Stepford Wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Art gallery, bar and clothing boutique _ all are part of a nexus
of cool on West 15th Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues. The
scene, as one dealer put it, is ``superhip, groovy artists, great
parties, a fashion-meets-the-art-world kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown insists that he and his Scottish-born wife never set out
to create a scene, that it is mere happenstance that their three
businesses are cheek by jowl on a block slightly off the beaten
path, making it a kind of demimonde destination.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the polished galleries of Chelsea, Brown's space, with a
concrete floor and only 900 square feet for exhibitions, is a
gritty showcase for emerging artists. Brown, 37, who favors jeans,
work boots and an unshaven look, is not like his slick,
Prada-suited colleagues on West 22nd Street. He cultivates an
anticommercial image and a prickly persona. When working for
another gallery, he faxed friends, asking them to nominate him for
most obnoxious gallery attendant for an art magazine. (He didn't
win. An employee of Mary Boone's did.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Gavin, but he's a rogue,'' said Richard Flood, the
chief curator of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. ``I value
him for his rudeness and his creativity within the marketplace.
Running a gallery has always seemed like an annoyance rather than a
privilege to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hort, a New York collector, said it took a long time
before Brown was enthusiastic about selling art to her. To prove
her support, she bought a broad range of his artists, rather than
just those who were hot. ``A collector who wants to collect with
him gets around the difficult part or deals with him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother? With new and old galleries thriving, why buy
paintings from someone who acts like the Soup Nazi of the art
world?
</P>
<P>
   ``What raises Gavin above his degage attitude is the fact that
he's got some of the hottest artists of the moment,'' said Bruce
Wolmer, the editor of Art and Auction magazine. ``In addition, he's
got a kind of cool magnetism that makes the gallery work. He's the
anti-earnest art dealer. He mirrors the moment. He's not ironic.
He's beyond irony. He's beyond caring. That's what's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not care to be involved in this article. He declined
requests for an interview, then met briefly with this reporter. His
comments were mostly etched in acid.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he chose West 15th Street, rather than a spot among
other high-profile Chelsea galleries, he said, ``It's nearer to the
subways than the other ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the anticommercial bent of his and his wife's
businesses _ she sometimes doesn't let her friends pay for clothes,
and he made no profit from the 30 Fischerspooner performances _ he
replied, ``We're saints.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in suburban London, Brown attended a graduate-level art
program at the Whitney Museum of American Art before opening his
first gallery in 1994 on Broome Street. The space, which he
constructed himself, was minuscule, but it quickly became a place
where artists, dealers and curators gathered to argue aesthetics
over beers.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown moved to 436 West 15th Street in 1997 _ opening with
no sign, only an orange brick facade to mark the spot _ it was
logical that he would also import a bar. Passerby, a bare-bones
establishment, is only some benches and stools, with a disco floor
that lights up in response to music _ actually a work of art by
Piotr Uklanski.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, artists hung out at Spring Street Bar,''
said Ivy Shapiro, a daughter of Joel Shapiro, the sculptor. She is
with the Barbara Gladstone Gallery. ``Until Gavin's bar came
around, there wasn't a good place for artists to hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, 34, is unlike her cantankerous husband. Friendly,
easygoing and soft-spoken, she sometimes pads around her small,
light-filled storefront in flip-flops. The shop contains
cream-color sofas, a birch tree adorned with vintage silk flowers
and a couple of racks of Barnes' simple but quirky clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Because she uses vintage textiles or makes her own printed
fabrics, adding hand finishes like beaded trim or appliques, her
designs, which range from $50 to $1,500, are often one of a kind.
They are sought by artists who want to wear something more unusual
than the latest dress splashed across magazine ads. ``You can wear
Lucy's clothes head to toe and not look like you're dipped in a
designer,'' said Jessica Craig-Martin, a photographer whose work
appears in Vogue. ``You can get really dressed up, and there's
something still funky about them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Barneys New York will begin to carry Barnes'
collection. ``Her clothes are more artisanship than design,'' said
Julie Gilhart, the vice president for fashion merchandising at
Barneys. ``Everything in fashion is big and grand, and we have all
those designers doing major influential collections. It's so
refreshing to trip over someone doing something small and unique...
''
</P>
<P>
   The aura of selectivity that surrounds Barnes' clothes, as well
as her husband's gallery and bar, serves both well. Jack Bankowsky,
the editor of Artforum, said that Brown's detachment, along with
his stable of interesting artists, explains his attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their dealer's off-putting attitude, Brown's artists tend
to show work that is engaging and accessible. Elizabeth Peyton
paints lush portraits of pop stars like Kurt Cobain. (A Peyton work
was auctioned last month at Christie's for $70,500, more than
double the house's highest estimate.) Even the conceptual art that
Brown shows, like Rikrit Tiravanija's work _ in which the artist
offers food to people and displays the leftovers _ has benevolent,
even populist implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two kinds of dealers,'' said Flood, the Walker Art
Center curator. ``One is the kind that harvests when the crop is
mature. The other tends to the seedlings. That's Gavin. He's not an
opportunist. He's identified the talent and maintained it. In last
fall's Chris Ofili show, every painting but one _ that is, four out
of five _ sold to a major museum. That's a dealer who is really
doing his job.''

HOW DID MARBLE GET CHIPPED? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 4, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  My marble fireplace front (sides and top of the face) is a
beautiful dark green in the house built in 1969. Now it looks as if
someone hit it with an ice pick. Little chips are popping out,
making sharp dents. It is a sort of flaking, very small flakes
coming off. What's wrong? Is there a way to stop it or keep it from
recurring? Or is there a way of filling those chips? I don't think
heat was a cause because we have not used the fireplace very often.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN KENNEDY, Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Beats the heck out of the handyman. Your first priority is
to show it to a marble man. It sounds as if water got into some
tiny, invisible cracks, and somehow eroded out those chips. This
would be more plausible if the marble were outside, where invading
water could freeze, popping off the chips. If anything like that
happened, it may mean that the marble was defective, that the chips
were already there, and loose, ready to be popped off.
</P>
<P>
   So now we'll put the question to everyone in the hopes that
someone will know why John Kennedy's great-looking marble chipped.
The handyman and Kennedy would love to hear from anyone who might
have an answer.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the chips occurred, there might be a way of
filling those holes. Carefully remove one of the slabs and sand the
back of it to create some marble dust. Mix this with clear glue and
fill the holes. Let set, sand smooth with very fine emory cloth. If
the patches show, polish the marble.
</P>
<P>
   As a P.S., Kennedy called Plymouth Quarries, a dealer in stone,
brick, and other masonry materials in Hingham, where one of the
specialists thought some movement behind the marble caused the
spalling. He said it was not a defect in the marble.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that movement behind the marble was a rather sharp blow,
knocking off a chip on the other side. It would be a little like a
BB shot that hits a window, knocking off a chip on the inside of
the glass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I have a very nice birdbath but it does not work. The bowl
is square granite and very deep, too deep for the birds to bathe in
or drink. Putting in just a bit of water won't help because it is
too far down the bowl. How can I make it shallower? The bowl is 8
to 9 inches deep and 12 inches square. And, the water gets all
slimy and filled with gunk.
</P>
<P>
   ROZ EPSTEIN, Marblehead, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Some designer did not have the birds in mind when he
designed that thing. Birdbaths should be no more than 2 inches
deep. So, you could fill that bowl with concrete, to within 2
inches of the top. And you could taper the concrete so it is
shallower along the edges. Or, have a shallow copper tray molded by
a metalworker to fit on top of the bowl. The copper will weather to
that handsome green when it oxidizes, and should not hurt the
birds.
</P>
<P>
   Any water will get slimy and full of mold and algae, so on a
regular basis empty the bowl and treat it with bleach, but be sure
to rinse very thoroughly before adding water.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure no water gets under the copper bowl. In summer it will
get stagnant and in winter it could freeze and break the granite.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  The man who serviced my oil burner in a house I own in
Lunenberg noticed that the copper pipes are turning green with
green spots, mostly at the joints. Is this something to worry
about?
</P>
<P>
   JOE LUCA, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Frankly, I don't think so, unless the joints start to leak.
The greening is actually oxidation, caused by water. It is the same
process as the greening of copper outdoors. The water is coming
from water vapor condensing on the cool pipes. The oxidation will
take a long time to make a hole in the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  We had all our windows replaced with vinyl windows, and are
surprised at the brightness of the white. It is a blazing white,
particularly in contrast with the colors in the room. And the
woodwork is dark, aggravating the situation. Can we paint the
windows? How else can we cover that over-bright white? We cannot
cover it with curtains.
</P>
<P>
   SUSAN SHAHID, Brockton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  What about draperies? They would cover most of the window,
even partially open. OK, you can paint vinyl if you sand heavily to
reduce gloss and roughen the finish (an old story). Apply one coat
of a latex enamel undercoater and finish off with any kind of latex
paint you like. Specify Muralo undercoater, which claims to adhere
to shiny surfaces. Sanding still is important. Make the paint
semigloss, or eggshell (neither flat nor shiny) to keep down the
glare.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to avoid the hassle of painting (three coats are needed),
cover the glare with Contact paper. Choose a matte finish color,
and remove it when you tire of it or it gets dirty. Unlike the old
Contact paper, the new version is easily stripped.

MATCHBOX TWENTY LEAD SINGER ROB THOMAS SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO
SOLO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months ago, Matchbox Twenty singer Rob Thomas was flipping
through a music-industry magazine when he came across an ad for the
band's then-upcoming second disc.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, a picture of Thomas was prominently featured. A
headline above it trumpeted him as the writer of ``Smooth,''
Thomas' Grammy-winning duet with Carlos Santana, as well as
Matchbox Twenty's string of hits from its debut CD, ``Yourself or
Someone Like You,'' which has now sold more than 10 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Matchbox Twenty, though, was in the far bottom
corner of the ad, separated from Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Thomas was not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The label did it without my knowledge,'' Thomas said in a
recent telephone interview as the group was kicking off a tour to
promote its second CD, ``Mad Season by Matchbox Twenty,'' in stores
last week. They'll be playing to a sold-out audience at 9 tonight
in Deep Ellum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what they were trying to do, to tie together ``Smooth''
with our new record to help sell it. Even the guys (in Matchbox
Twenty) were like, `Yeah, man, let's tie them together.' But if we
did that, we would be saying something about ourselves that we
don't want to say.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It would say, for example, that Thomas IS the band; that he
doesn't really need the other guys in Matchbox Twenty, that after
``Smooth,'' he could go off and enjoy a successful solo career.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? By winning three Grammys this year for his
``Smooth'' collaboration with Santana, Thomas has become a
household name. Before ``Smooth,'' only real Matchbox Twenty fans _
those who looked at ``Yourself's'' liner notes, not just listened
to the disc _ knew who he was. Now, pretty much, everyone does.
</P>
<P>
   ```Smooth' really opened the door for him, as the singer for
Matchbox Twenty and as a potential solo artist,'' says Scott
Strong, program director for Dallas-Fort Worth rock station Merge
93.3 FM (KKMR), which plays the band consistently. ``If you look at
the demographics breakdown, before `Smooth,' Matchbox got played on
alternative-rock radio and adult-alternative radio. But now you see
Matchbox Twenty in a lot of different demographics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas remains adamant about his role in the band. He says
he has no intention of leaving the group to pursue a solo career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never left in the first place,'' he says. ``This is my home.
I know for a fact that we wouldn't be what we are without the five
of us. No matter what we do in our off time, this is what we do
full time.''
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Newman, West Coast bureau chief for Billboard magazine,
says Thomas really has no reason to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should he go off and do a solo career?'' asks Newman, who
recently profiled Thomas and the band for Billboard. ``He's got
these guys who've been with him for years. And they perfectly
understand that he's the star, and they're fine with it. Right now,
he has the best of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite selling millions of records, Thomas genuinely seems
oblivious to fame. He answers questions with friendly, earnest,
don't-take-me-seriously laughs; he jokes often and makes casual
conversation about his favorite bands these days _ our own Old 97's
_ and shares humorous anecdotes about Matchbox Twenty's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty fortunate that we're all down-to-earth. We keep
each other in check,'' Thomas says. ``Like if we're in a restaurant
and one of us is rude to our waitress, the rest of us are like,
`Hey, rock star, look at you.' We've kept everything within a small
circle _ our crew, our wives, our families. A lot around us has
changed, but we're still a little group that has stayed the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on a military base in Germany, Thomas is an Army brat who
floated back and forth between his mother's home in Florida and his
grandmother's house in South Carolina. When he became stressed over
his unstable home life, Thomas dropped out of high school at 17 and
spent the next few years drifting between homes and in and out of
various rock bands.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he wound up back in Orlando, Fla., where he met
bassist Brian Yale and drummer Paul Doucette. The trio spent the
next three years changing names until they decided on Matchbox
Twenty. Guitarists Adam Gaynor and Kyle Cook, friends of the band
members, then joined.
</P>
<P>
   Through contacts in the music industry, the group managed to
snag Collective Soul producer Matt Serletic to help produce a batch
of demos. The songs wound up in the hands of Lava, a subsidiary of
major label Atlantic. Lava signed Matchbox Twenty and, in October
1996, released its debut, ``Yourself or Someone Like You.''

BALANCING HYBRIDS VS. ELECTRICS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hybrid gas-electric cars can be clean and very
fuel-efficient, and may, if automakers persuade regulators, be used
to fill the quota for battery-electric cars that California, New
York and Massachusetts plan to require. But engineers are learning
that hybrids cannot accomplish everything environmentalists want. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That point was demonstrated at the end of the 12th running of an
alternative-vehicle race, the American Tour de Sol, here on May 18,
when race organizers set out to rank the competing cars on a
variety of scales. One criterion was energy efficiency, which was
measured on a miles-per-gallon basis for the hybrid vehicles that
used gasoline or diesel fuel; for battery-electric vehicles,
organizers came up with an equivalent measure based on how much
fuel an electric utility would need at its power plant to make the
electricity the vehicle consumed. Another criterion was the cars'
potential contribution to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The race showed that all the cars were improving in many
aspects, like range, reliability and handling. The numbers also
showed that hybrids had better fuel economy than some electrics,
but emitted more gases believed to cause climate change. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the race's ``production category,'' for vehicles
commercially available today, the overall winner was the Honda
Insight hybrid. It had a fuel economy average of 92 miles a gallon
in the race. In second place over all was General Motors' two-seat
EV1 electric car. It had the equivalent fuel economy of 68 mpg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the ``global warming potential'' of the Insight _ a number
that includes carbon dioxide and two much more potent tailpipe
gases, methane and nitrous oxide _ was roughly double the EV1's
level. A big reason is that even a very good gasoline engine is
only about 18 percent efficient in turning the gas into usable
energy; the rest of the fuel is consumed by friction or expelled as
exhaust. In contrast, an inefficient power station using the same
amount of fuel is closer to 33 percent effective at turning fuel
into electricity; an efficient one can reach 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tour de Sol organizers had the Argonne National Laboratory, part
of the Energy Department, perform the calculation using the mix of
power plants in the Northeast, since the race ran from New York
City to Washington. That includes nuclear and hydroelectric plants
that do not emit carbon dioxide and related gases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Hazard, who organizes the race for the Northeast
Sustainable Energy Association, a nonprofit environmental group,
said the result was ``something that I was not actually
expecting.'' But even if the Insight gave off twice as much
greenhouse gas as the EV1, it was still a huge improvement over
most cars on the road. It had only a quarter of the emissions of a
conventional gasoline-powered Saturn driven on the same route. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, at least, hybrid cars are more likely than
battery-electrics to be a solution to the problems of air pollution
and dependence on imported oil. Toyota, which has produced both
types of vehicles, told California regulators last week that the
public was not ready to accept electrics; indeed, Toyota said it
could not sell the cars and would have to pay customers to take
them.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrid technology is second-best from a greenhouse-gas
standpoint, and hybrids have a brighter future than battery-powered
cars because they cost comparatively less and travel much farther
without needing to stop for recharging.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of trading off one environmental value against another
is not new. Controlling acid rain by taking sulfur out of
power-plant emissions means using some of the plants' electric
output for anti-pollution equipment, which means more carbon
dioxide for each kilowatt-hour delivered to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is belatedly trying to ban
methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, a gasoline additive it once
favored to clean the air. When gas leaks into the soil, MTBE
contaminates water supplies. Catalytic converters, the basic
pollution-control equipment of ordinary gasoline cars, have been
found to produce nitrous oxide.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When I lay hands on an SUV, one of the first things I like to do
is take it where most SUVs never go _ off road.
</P>
<P>
   In my neck of the New Hampshire woods, that means out where the
skidders have been, following the rutted, muddy, stony, log-strewn
paths of departed or ongoing logging operations. It's a good test
for these rigs because skidders do not pause for steep or sloshy,
stone or stump.
</P>
<P>
   So where better to start my week in the 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee
Limited 4WD? It would be a good test to see if Daimler-Chrysler, in
its 1999 makeover of the Grand Cherokee, had pulled off the
Jekyll-and-Hyde feat of turning this Jeep into a luxurious and
smooth highway performer while at the same time saving its solid
off-road soul.
</P>
<P>
   I took it up steep grades where you could see only the sky
through the windshield. Plunged it through mud, walked it gingerly
over rocks and stumps one wheel at a time, pushed through a
streambed, across a thick scattering of old bark and wood chips,
coaxed it down the same steep grade it had just climbed, this time
with the front bumper seemingly ready to burrow in at any minute.
</P>
<P>
   It remains an off-road beast _ better even than its earlier
incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that has to do with its new engine, the optional
4.7-liter, 235-horsepower plant that replaces the 5.2 and 5.9
liters of old. This new powerplant has 15 more horsepower than the
old 5.2, only 10 less than the 5.9, and gets better gas mileage
than either (17 miles per gallon in off-road and highway driving).
It's a solid case of overhead cams and new technology knocking
aside the old push-rod engine.
</P>
<P>
   It has power that makes it a stubborn crawler up steep hills,
holds the nearly 2-ton rig back on steep declines, and turns it
into a guttural and strong performer on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   But what is best about this new Jeep is its new all-wheel-drive
system. Called Quadra-Trac, it is a full-time, all-wheel-drive
setup that uses sensors to shift torque front to rear, side to
side, and even to single wheels. This means that, if three wheels
are slipping and only one has the faintest hope of purchase, that
wheel gets the torque to nudge you forward. It's great off-road and
will be wonderful for commuting in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Cherokee stands apart in appearance from its more
staid stablemate, the Cherokee, because of a subtle design shift.
They still share the same mouthful-of-Chiclets grille, but on the
Grand Cherokee, that grille is angled back from bumper to hood. The
hood rises in a wedge to a more sloping windshield and a higher
roof line drops off at the rear in a rounded dip. The Cherokee
remains the angular, oblong box it has long been.
</P>
<P>
   The softer lines of the Grand Cherokee hint at the luxury inside
_ an air of comfort meant to please those who won't be chasing
skidders through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The front leather bucket seats have good support up the sides,
though they could use a bit more firmness at the thigh. The rear
bench, billed as a three-person seat, is comfortable at the doors,
but a strange notch has been cut from the cushion at the center,
leaving a middle passenger with less space on which to sit. Leg
room in the rear is a bit tight, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, all is relatively simple with window, door, and
mirror controls on the driver's side armrest, cruise control on the
steering wheel, light controls on one steering column stem, and
wipers on another. Audio and climate controls are big and easy to
use.
</P>
<P>
   Though many SUVs are built on truck platforms, Jeep has put the
new Grand Cherokee with integrated body and frame rails, making it
stiffer and more stable. As with almost any tall vehicle, you get
some sensation of side-to-side roll when cornering at higher
speeds, though the Grand Cherokee is another example of
manufacturers changing suspension and construction methods to make
them more stable than the tippy boxes of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   This model came with an ``Upcountry'' suspension system that
included high-pressure gas shocks, special front and rear springs,
and stabilizer bar. Off-road skid plates and shields were included
in this package.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed transmission did a too-quick, jerky upshift in
lower gears than I would like, but once rolling was smooth in
shifting through higher gears. Disc brakes, assisted by ABS, at all
four wheels brought it to swift, sure stops.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The auxiliary audio control buttons tucked on the backside of
the steering wheel. Felt as if I was playing a video game as I
fooled with volume and stations.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The placing of the driver's seat memory buttons on the door
panel above the armrest. My elbow kept hitting them and changing my
seat position.

UNDATED: Someone Like You.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The disc sat in the bins for months as the group quietly toured
the country, playing small clubs. In late 1996, Matchbox Twenty
played the Galaxy Club in Deep Ellum. Fewer than 100 people were
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knew who we were,'' Thomas says. ``It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Atlantic sniffed a success story and released ``Long
Day'' as a single to several influential alternative-rock radio
stations. The catchy, guitar-driven song quickly took off, paving
the way for other singles: ``3 a.m., Long Day'' and the
then-controversial ``Push.'' One of Thomas' ex-girlfriends, who
claimed ``Push'' was about her, threatened to sue for royalties.
Anti-violence organizations trashed Thomas for the song's chorus:
``I wanna push you around, and I will, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy blew over, but it fueled the band's burgeoning
success. In 1997, ``Yourself'' went gold and, a year later, the
group was named Best New Band by ``Rolling Stone'' magazine's
Reader's Poll. A tour opening for the Rolling Stones _ which
brought Matchbox Twenty to the Texas Motor Speedway that year _
gave them more exposure. The band capped '98 by playing its first
headline show at Reunion Arena, only two years after playing the
Galaxy Club just down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna take some time off,'' drummer Doucette said in an
interview then. ``You can't turn on the radio without hearing one
of our songs. We're gonna forget about being Matchbox Twenty for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   That cryptic remark was a sign of things to come _ for Thomas,
at least. As the band laid low throughout 1999, Thomas, who was
living in New York, got a call from his song publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Would you be interested in writing a song for the
new Santana record?' I want to learn to be a better songwriter, so
I figured, `Why not?''' Thomas says. ``I sent the song to Carlos
and then it got back to me that he liked the song and that he liked
my voice and that he wanted me to sing on it. The rest was just
crazy fun _ I went out to San Francisco, cut the track, they
decided to make it the lead single, then they were, `Hey, let's
make a video.' Carlos wanted my wife to be in the video. He'd say,
`She's beautiful.' Everything's beautiful to Carlos.''
</P>
<P>
   Recording ``Smooth'' didn't bother the rest of Matchbox Twenty,
Thomas says. And neither did the onslaught of attention the song
brought the singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked (drummer) Paul, one of my best friends in the world,
if it was OK or if the guys would have a problem with it. ``He
said, `Go do it.' By the same token, we try and offer that to
everyone in the band. The worst thing a band could do is shackle
you. We want everyone to have an opportunity to do different
things. In the end, it (will) make us better.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to have happened with ``Mad Season,'' which debuted
at No. 3 on the Billboard chart the week it was released. The group
has ditched ``Yourself's'' guitar-driven style for a much more
orchestral sound. Strings and horns are sprinkled throughout. In
other words, it sounds nothing like the Matchbox Twenty you're used
to hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first record was a good pop-rock record,'' Thomas says.
``But now we're all better musicians and we didn't want to make the
same record again. We set out to make a different kind of record,
and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is proud of ``Mad Season'' musically, but he says he's
more pleased with his lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a writer, I feel like such a work in progress,'' he says.
``I listened to a lot of Jayhawks writing this, and they are so
good. I'd like to think that with the new record, I'm one step
closer to being that type of songwriter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Merge's Scott Strong thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen to that CD, you can tell Rob is gonna be around
a while,'' he says. ``Listen to his voice and read his lyrics, he
has lasting power. And he's smart. He knew that ``Smooth'' was
gonna expose him to a whole new audience, which means more CD sales
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas doesn't necessarily see it like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to work with Carlos, and that was phenomenal, but there
was bittersweetness that I wasn't with my guys,'' he says. ``I
don't think I ever would leave them, unless we stopped having fun.
And I don't see that happening for a long time.''

ON FIRST LOOKING INTO GATES' CRICHTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By HAROLD BLOOM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some
few to be chewed and digested.'' _ Francis Bacon, ``Of Studies'' &QR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My very brief plunge into the electronic literary market
consists of tasting Michael Crichton's ``Timeline,'' by courtesy of
a hand-held computer. Even had I been reading Bacon or Shakespeare,
the experience would have been dismal. Since I am not one of
Crichton's ocean of fans, the event has been profoundly depressing.
This scarcely would matter, except that electronic books (to call
them that) may become as prevalent as surfing the Web. Some
publishing experts are predicting a mass market for e-books in two
to three years.
</P>
<P>
   For me the Internet, as I have remarked elsewhere, is like the
Congo. I know it exists, but I will never go there.
</P>
<P>
   Never having learned to type, I am writing this lament with a
Pentel Rolling Writer black ballpoint pen upon a yellow legal pad,
employing the clipboard I inherited from a Cornell roommate in
1947. This is mentioned to acknowledge that I am a dinosaur, Bloom
Brontosaurus Bardolator, perhaps better suited to be a creature in
a Crichton thriller than a reader of one, whether on a screen or in
hard copy.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers who are rushing toward the electronic marketplace say
they are anxious about losing their readership age 45 or younger.
These readers, they believe, will peruse screens, but will not
willingly turn the pages of a book. Perhaps these publishers will
prove to be right, and we will begin to divide into two audiences.
When those in later middle life and in old age gradually yield to
mortality, in a quarter of a century or so, all newly printed books
will be limited editions, and e-books will have replaced the bound
volume, as surely as books once replaced scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   A foretaste of this possible future was available last week when
Microsoft offered free downloads of ``Timeline'' to anyone with a
Pocket PC, a palm-size device about the size and heft of a
mass-market paperback. I acquired a loaner machine from
Hewlett-Packard, which came equipped with Microsoft's Reader
software, which is needed to scroll through a text that runs, in
the old-fangled version published by Knopf, 450 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Over the Memorial Day weekend I settled into the reclining chair
in my living room where I usually read. Being a Falstaffian fellow,
I rested the computer where I normally rest books: on my belly.
Though the Pocket PC type is clear and legible, each screen holds
less than the equivalent of a page _ sometimes there are only five
or six words to a line _ and you must keep pages scrolling by
pressing a button. Ordinarily when we're sunk in a book we're
scarcely conscious of turning the pages, but with Crichton, suffice
it to say, I was all too aware of the button.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, borrowed from ``A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's
Court,'' is about a billionaire clearly modeled on Bill Gates, who
hires a band of adventurers to visit medieval France in a time
machine. Crichton's prose is as dead as the 14th century, and if
you're reading it on a hand-held computer, it is a double ordeal,
physical and stylistic.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a screen is not reading, or rather is not how to read,
if ``reading'' means something more or other than accompanying
Crichton into the theme park of his version of historic France. I
am aware that the screens of personal computers and of e-book
readers, not to mention larger screens to come, are not or will not
be as irritating as that of a Pocket PC, but size is hardly the
crucial factor here. Reading an authentic book is very different
from watching a movie, television program or computer screen.
``Authentic'' is necessarily the key word in that assertion, and
needs a little elucidation.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a short story by Chekhov, a poem by Hart Crane, a novel
by Jane Austen or a play by Shakespeare is an activity only
minimally visual. The tyranny of the bodily eye is usurped by the
inner ear, which is a metaphor for the mind exercising all its
powers. I am not a Luddite, and am aware that there may prove to be
_ even in my own remaining lifetime _ no clear limits to artificial
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Computers may yet read, write, think, speak in ways transcending
their programming. The epics and romances of artificial
intelligence may inundate us and be no better or worse than the
breaking wave of publish-your-own-manuscript e-books. But a screen
remains a screen, and a printed book is something other than a
container, if its content is Jane Austen or Shakespeare. Crichton
does not contain the reader. Shakespeare paradoxically does. If
what we read is ``Pride and Prejudice'' or ``Hamlet,'' we need to
hold it rather more individually than a screen, by its very nature,
can permit.
</P>
<P>
   I am not, in this, stressing the book as an aesthetic object,
but rather as simply an isolated entity, a reminder that ``Pride
and Prejudice'' or ``Hamlet'' is an achieved otherness, an
idiosyncratic adventure of the spirit. Information doubtless is as
well or better transmitted upon a screen as in a book, but wisdom
and beauty cry out for a more individual representation. No one
will say that a computer screen is the precious lifeblood of a
master spirit, or that if you sliced into a screen _ as Montaigne
said of a book's pages _ it would bleed. Milton and Montaigne
became identical with the books they had composed. Will Crichton or
Stephen King become identical with a screen?
</P>
<P>
   I have declared my own condition as a fossil, and I am a little
haunted by the fear that books could yet also become fossils, if
all the world's publishers were to go completely mad. (Last week
the chairman of one house said e-books would ``nudge Gutenberg off
center stage.'' The journalists at his news conference reported
that he spoke in jest _ though maybe not.) Yet, solitary readers
continue to be born and to develop, since the quest for wisdom, and
for aesthetic dignity and difficult pleasure, will continue.
Solitary readers who love Austen and Shakespeare will want and need
to reach out and hold books in their hands, even at moments when
the books are not immediately to be opened for rereading.
</P>
<P>
   There are books on my shelves that I've held, and read, almost
to pieces. One gets fond of the dog-eared quality, even the crooked
bindings. There is comfort in them.
</P>
<P>
   Intimacy with a book is an experience not easy to describe, even
when the writer attempting the description is William Hazlitt or
Virginia Woolf. Intimacy with a screen is, I suppose, possible, but
if there are descriptions of it available, I would rather not see
them.
</P>
<P>
   There is an aura to books that is irreplaceable. The best
analogue would be the aura of dead or lost friends and lovers,
never quite replaceable.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When I lay hands on an SUV, one of the first things I like to do
is take it where most SUVs never go _ off road.
</P>
<P>
   In my neck of the New Hampshire woods, that means out where the
skidders have been, following the rutted, muddy, stony, log-strewn
paths of departed or ongoing logging operations. It's a good test
for these rigs because skidders do not pause for steep or sloshy,
stone or stump.
</P>
<P>
   So where better to start my week in the 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee
Limited 4WD? It would be a good test to see if Daimler-Chrysler, in
its 1999 makeover of the Grand Cherokee, had pulled off the
Jekyll-and-Hyde feat of turning this Jeep into a luxurious and
smooth highway performer while at the same time saving its solid
off-road soul.
</P>
<P>
   I took it up steep grades where you could see only the sky
through the windshield. Plunged it through mud, walked it gingerly
over rocks and stumps one wheel at a time, pushed through a
streambed, across a thick scattering of old bark and wood chips,
coaxed it down the same steep grade it had just climbed, this time
with the front bumper seemingly ready to burrow in at any minute.
</P>
<P>
   It remains an off-road beast _ better even than its earlier
incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that has to do with its new engine, the optional
4.7-liter, 235-horsepower plant that replaces the 5.2 and 5.9
liters of old. This new powerplant has 15 more horsepower than the
old 5.2, only 10 less than the 5.9, and gets better gas mileage
than either (17 miles per gallon in off-road and highway driving).
It's a solid case of overhead cams and new technology knocking
aside the old push-rod engine.
</P>
<P>
   It has power that makes it a stubborn crawler up steep hills,
holds the nearly 2-ton rig back on steep declines, and turns it
into a guttural and strong performer on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   But what is best about this new Jeep is its new all-wheel-drive
system. Called Quadra-Trac, it is a full-time, all-wheel-drive
setup that uses sensors to shift torque front to rear, side to
side, and even to single wheels. This means that, if three wheels
are slipping and only one has the faintest hope of purchase, that
wheel gets the torque to nudge you forward. It's great off-road and
will be wonderful for commuting in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Cherokee stands apart in appearance from its more
staid stablemate, the Cherokee, because of a subtle design shift.
They still share the same mouthful-of-Chiclets grille, but on the
Grand Cherokee, that grille is angled back from bumper to hood. The
hood rises in a wedge to a more sloping windshield and a higher
roof line drops off at the rear in a rounded dip. The Cherokee
remains the angular, oblong box it has long been.
</P>
<P>
   The softer lines of the Grand Cherokee hint at the luxury inside
_ an air of comfort meant to please those who won't be chasing
skidders through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The front leather bucket seats have good support up the sides,
though they could use a bit more firmness at the thigh. The rear
bench, billed as a three-person seat, is comfortable at the doors,
but a strange notch has been cut from the cushion at the center,
leaving a middle passenger with less space on which to sit. Leg
room in the rear is a bit tight, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, all is relatively simple with window, door, and
mirror controls on the driver's side armrest, cruise control on the
steering wheel, light controls on one steering column stem, and
wipers on another. Audio and climate controls are big and easy to
use.
</P>
<P>
   Though many SUVs are built on truck platforms, Jeep has put the
new Grand Cherokee with integrated body and frame rails, making it
stiffer and more stable. As with almost any tall vehicle, you get
some sensation of side-to-side roll when cornering at higher
speeds, though the Grand Cherokee is another example of
manufacturers changing suspension and construction methods to make
them more stable than the tippy boxes of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   This model came with an ``Upcountry'' suspension system that
included high-pressure gas shocks, special front and rear springs,
and stabilizer bar. Off-road skid plates and shields were included
in this package.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed transmission did a too-quick, jerky upshift in
lower gears than I would like, but once rolling was smooth in
shifting through higher gears. Disc brakes, assisted by ABS, at all
four wheels brought it to swift, sure stops.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The auxiliary audio control buttons tucked on the backside of
the steering wheel. Felt as if I was playing a video game as I
fooled with volume and stations.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The placing of the driver's seat memory buttons on the door
panel above the armrest. My elbow kept hitting them and changing my
seat position.

ARE MIAMI RELATIVES DOWN FOR THE COUNT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez have vowed to fight on.
These folks are goofy, but let's give them high marks for tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   They bring to mind the underdog in a boxing match I watched on
television a few weeks back. The guy was trying to wrest a title
from one of those big-deal champs who fires sledgehammer jabs and
hit-by-a-truck uppercuts; the challenger lost the fight but won
plaudits for his willingness to take a beating.
</P>
<P>
   So. Let's hear it for Lazaro Gonzalez, Marisleysis Gonzalez, et
al, who endure knockdown after knockdown and eagerly bounce up from
the canvas and stick out their collective chin as the U.S.
government winds up to throw one more devastating punch.
</P>
<P>
   The latest blow was Thursday's decision by a three-judge panel
in Atlanta that said the Immigration and Naturalization Service was
acting within the law when it ruled that Elian was not entitled to
an asylum hearing. The Miami relatives have been pushing for such a
hearing in hopes of keeping Elian in the United States over the
objections of his father, who wants to take him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Perseverance has its merits. On the other hand, these Miami
relatives are fighting tooth and nail in defense of a point of view
that is just plain wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If would be terrific if Juan Miguel Gonzalez decided to seek
asylum for himself and his whole family, but he has shown no
inclination to do so. Gonzalez says he wants to go home and he
wants to take Elian with him. That should be the end of the story.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who laid claim to Elian after he was fished out
of the ocean last November apparently have no interest in the bond
between a father and son _ just as they have no interest in
complying with the lawful dictates of the INS. The Miami relatives
are still whining about Attorney General Janet Reno's decision to
snatch Elian from their home and return him to his father, but Reno
had no choice; the relatives had defied the law by refusing to give
up the boy voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have consistently upheld the parental rights of
Elian's father and yet this band of distant relatives with no
standing whatsoever to claim custody of the boy persist in throwing
legal arguments at the courthouse wall.
</P>
<P>
   Why won't they do the right thing? Why won't they accept defeat?
Why won't they drop their futile and redundant legal challenges to
the government's reasonable, fair and morally pertinent decision
that a boy should live with his father _ even if some people don't
approve of the country that the father chooses to live in?
</P>
<P>
   If the Miami relatives truly cared about the best interests of
Elian _ and they have repeatedly insisted that those interests are
exactly what they care about _ wouldn't they call off their howling
pack of legal beagles and graciously allow the kid and his dad to
go home?
</P>
<P>
   Sure they would.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Miami relatives couldn't care less about
Elian's best interests at this stage of the game. For them, the
continuing legal battle is no longer about some noble desire to see
Elian grow up free in America _ if in fact it ever was about that.
</P>
<P>
   The battle now is about their own egos. It's about the Cuban
American community's seething hatred of Cuban President Fidel
Castro. It's about the perfectly natural human instinct to keep
fighting when the really sensible thing to do is to lie down and
take a 10-count.
</P>
<P>
   The judges gave the Miami relatives 14 days to file appeals.
Rest assured that if the courts would let them get away with it,
these people would appeal till the cows come home.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-day window is encouraging. It just might indicate that
the courts are as tired of this seemingly endless controversy as
the general public is _ maybe even as tired of it as Juan Miguel
Gonzalez must surely be.
</P>
<P>
   One of the TV newshounds said yesterday that Juan Miguel is
growing more impatient by the day, that he desperately wants to get
on with his life.
</P>
<P>
   And he could _ if only his bullheaded relatives would let him.

IN MASS., AN UPHILL BATTLE FOR WOMEN IN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 4)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Hampshire has and Connecticut had a female governor, Maine
has had three female U.S. senators in the last 50 years, and
Massachusetts is supposedly no less receptive to new ideas than its
neighboring states. But women in top offices? Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Only three women in Congress ever from Massachusetts? And only
three women in statewide constitutional office? Since John Smith
pow-wowed with Pochahontas? That's it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an embarrassment that such a high-profile state as
Massachusetts holds such a poor record,'' says Betty Taymor. For
any woman who aspires to win _ notice I did not say seek _ a
top-rank public office here as governor or U.S. senator, Taymor's
new book, ``Running Against the Wind; the struggle of women in
Massachusetts politics,'' is both a road map and the chronicle of
previous failures.
</P>
<P>
   Why this long history to overcome? Are Type A alpha male pols so
insecure? Do the money people harbor antifeminist bias? Is the
Catholic Church involved somehow? Were the Kennedy women bad role
models? Do Italians and Greeks prefer male officeholders? Maybe,
but things are changing, though not fast enough, asserts Taymor in
her book.
</P>
<P>
   Part personal memoir, part political history of the past 50
years of Bay State politics, part academic excavation of gender
issues, and partly a polemic on behalf of more women running for
every office, the tale Taymore spins explains why the gender gap
(women voting differently from men) is not sufficient to elect
women here. ``In major races in 1998, Marjorie Claprood, Susan
Tracy, Dorothy Kelly Gay, who ran for lieutenant governor, Patricia
McGovern (governor) and Lois Pines (attorney general) all lost in
the primaries. I do not believe that they lost principally because
of gender bias, but for a large variety of other reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 8th Congressional race, Emily's List, the feminist group
that raises campaign money for female candidates, found itself
forced to choose between Claprood and Tracy. Instead, it took a
pass and sent money to neither. Two men who'd built mayoral
machines, Mike Capuano of Somerville and Ray Flynn of Boston,
finished one-two, while Claprood ran fifth and Tracy eighth. Ed
Brooke, a black Republican, won a Senate seat; Greeks like Dukakis
and Tsongas won big, too; Italian-Americans have elected two
governors (Furcolo and Cellucci) and spawned the mayors of the
state's three largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Irish dominance? Hah! The last time an Irish-American made the
finals of a governor's race here was five elections back. Bottom
line? There are many ways to get one of your own elected; women
just have to find one. The present state of affairs turns up:
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift, little known when she was picked
by Cellucci as his running mate; she bore a child during the
campaign, and since then has earned the derisive nickname ``Not Too
Swift'' for a series of missteps and miscalculations that, while
none of them too weighty in their own right, collectively suggest
she is far from ready to be a prime time political player on Beacon
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   --Shannon O'Brien, elected state treasurer on her second try, an
affable, one-of-the-boys style of campaigner, daughter of a veteran
Western Massachusetts governor's councilor, Ed O'Brien, and wife of
former State Representative Emmet Hayes. With Shannon, it's all in
the family. Her skills are still apparent, but a stinkbomb of a
scandal left on her doorstep by ex-Treasurer Joe Malone hobbled
most of the initiatives O'Brien based her campaign upon.
</P>
<P>
   --Martha Coakley, elected district attorney in Middlesex County,
where 25 percent of all the state's voters live. An able prosecutor
who's arguably the best TV persona in the state, she'd be a natural
for attorney general, if only her old boss, Tom Reilly, were not
cemented there.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of female legislators, but it's hard to be a
legislator and get elected to executive office. McGovern and Pines
both took votes that made easy pickings for male rivals in campaign
ads. Nor is money a surefire victory ticket. Taymor quotes Lois
Pines: ``Isn't it terrible, Betty, that a well-funded woman
candidate cannot win a top post in Massachusetts politics in
1998?'' Taymor notes congressional candidates Chris Gabrielli and
John O'Connor dumped nearly $9 million between them and got
creamed.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, there are women who get ahead in the political game
and then refuse to lift up their sisters. Taymor does not name the
Dukakis-era female officeholder who stiffed her effort to help five
minority women get some aid to finish up at Boston College where
Taymor ran a women's program, before moving it to the University of
Massachusetts at Boston and the McCormack Institute. Taymor says
her associate, Elizabeth Sherman, coined this: ``women who went up
the ladder and then cut the rope.''
</P>
<P>
   What will it take to have a woman governor or US senator? Money,
luck, experience, toughness. But above all, timing. Pat McGovern
could have had the nomination for lieutenant governor, a safer step
for her. Or Lois Pines could have dropped out of the lieutenant
governor's race when John Kerry benefited because Pines and Evelyn
Murphy split the women's vote in '82. Tracy could have given
Claprood a clearer shot. Timing is all.
</P>
<P>
   Women control vast personal wealth now; that'll make
fund-raising easier. The key to winning is appealing across
traditional bloc lines. To me, Martha Coakley has the most
potential that way; she can do law-and-order, she can do
softer-side, she can do both great on TV. Her timing? We'll see. I
assume someone already gave Martha a copy of the Taymor book.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Nader's finger on the scale
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidential race is a virtual dead heat five months before
the election, according to
</P>
<P>
   a new Reuters/Zogby poll, with Ralph Nader showing as a possible
problem for Al Gore. The poll found George W. Bush barely ahead of
Gore, 42-41 percent, in a two-man match-up with 17 percent
undecided. Adding three minor candidates _ Nader of the Greens, Pat
Buchanan of the Reforms Harry Browne of the Libertarians _ resulted
in Bush stretching his lead to 42-39 percent. Nader drew 4 percent,
Buchanan 2 percent, Browne 1 percent, and the rest remained
undecided. In both cases, the Bush advantage was within the poll's
3.2 percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   THAT OLD STATESMAN IMAGE
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the focus on international affairs and making fresh
overtures to Hispanic voters, George W. Bush is sharing the stage
with eight other U.S. and Mexican border governors at a two-day
Border Governors Conference in Sacramento, Calif. The Texan joined
three other governors _ Gray Davis of California (D), Jane Hull of
Arizona (R) and Gary Johnson of New Mexico (R) _ and the leaders of
five Mexican states. They were focusing today on border issues
relating to the environment, education and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   NOPE, NEVER TALKED TO ANYONE
</P>
<P>
   The former head of the General Services Administration, Roger
Johnson, says he never talked to Al Gore or anyone else in the
Clinton administration about a proposed $400 million federal lease
for a Democratic fund-raiser and long-time Gore friend. Johnson was
responding to the public disclosure of a memo suggesting that
``Gore has called or is ready to call'' Johnson in an attempt to
help Tennessee developer Franklin Haney on a planned building
called the Portals. Gore denies haveing intervened. Justice
Department investigators have been unable to learn who wrote the
undated, unsigned and unaddressed memo, which was part of a grand
jury proceeding.

   In 1992, then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton pulled off the campaign
trail to oversee the execution of a cop killer. The decision drew
criticism from liberal groups, but allowing Clinton to put forth a
tough-on-crime image and move toward the political middle. Now,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's approval of a 30-day reprieve in a
death penalty case after allowing 131 executions is an act that
could be perceived as the opposite, allowing him to soften his
image and attract more moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   CAREFUL, GUN ISSUE COULD HURT SOMEBODY
</P>
<P>
   Democrats predict the debate over guns will rally voters,
especially women, to support Al Gore for president. But the polls
offer little evidence of that now, however. Gore is shown with no
clear advantage over George W. Bush on the issue. Polls show the
two about even when people are asked who they trust on guns. And
Republicans argue that the debate may actually help their candidate
because of Bush's call for tougher enforcement of existing gun
laws, instead of new legislation.
</P>
<P>
   JERSEY REPUBS LYING LOW
</P>
<P>
   While their Democratic counterparts are capturing most of the
headlines in the race for New Jersey's open Senate seat, four
Republicans are campaigning away in relative obscurity. And many
say the attention focused on the primary battle between investment
banker Jon Corzine and ex-Gov. Jim Florio will work in their favor.
The Republicans _ state Sen. William Gormley, Essex County
Executive Jim Treffinger; U.S. Rep. Bob Franks and Ramapo College
professor Murray Sabrin _ are keeping relatively low profiles and
aiming their shots at Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   PICKING UP THE CONSERVATIVE NOD
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio has all but officially accepted the Conservative
Party endorsement for the Senate in New York, expected to come
Saturday at the party convention in Albany. A
Conservative-sponsored TV spot touting Lazio has begun airing in
New York City and Albany, and the party hopes to raise $1 million
over the next five months for his campaign and ``party building.''
</P>
<P>
   JUST CAN'T STOP TALKING ABOUT HER
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Rick Lazio set out from the Republican convention in
Buffalo, the immediate concern of his Senate campaign was not what
he said, but how he was photographed. Everywhere Lazio went _ a
vineyard here, a schoolyard there _ his staff members vigorously
stage-directed the candidate and the media, seeking the best
photographs of Lazio's inaugural bus tour. Most important, Lazio
was advised to refrain from attacks on Hillary Clinton, because
they might distract from these carefully arranged images. That
restraint, however, lasted for all of five hours.
</P>
<P>
   RAISING THE CEILING IN CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina has never elected a woman to any statewide office
higher than secretary of state, but is poised for something like a
breakthrough this year. Two women, both state senators, are the
major parties' nominees for lieutenant governor: Betsy L. Cochrane,
a Republican, was the first woman to hold a leadership position in
the General Assembly, and Beverly M. Perdue, a Democrat, has been
co-chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   REACHING FOR THE BIG SKY
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will meet in Dayton, Ohio, and Billings, Mont., this
month to gather citizens' views for the platform the party will
approve at its national convention. The Dayton meeting, June 16,
will focus on Social Security, education and health care; the
Billings meeting, June 23, will cover welfare programs, national
security, foreign policy, natural resources and Western land
issues. Montana Gov. Marc Racicot said that with the national
convention being held in Philadelphia, the Bush people are ``trying
to reach as far as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW HONCHOS FOR DEM CONVENTION
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Convention Committee hired a new chief
operating officer and managing director. Rod O'Connor succeeds Dan
Foley, who resigned in late January. O'Connor, who has served on Al
Gore's staff, will be in charge of communications, production,
credentialing and media logistics for the convention committee. Tom
O'Donnell, a Washington lawyer, is the new managing director,
overseeing all administrative, external affairs and management
functions. The convention is Aug. 14-17 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   TEAMSTERS ALWAYS GOOD AT HOLDING OUT
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters President James P. Hoffa said his powerful labor union
may not endorse a presidential candidate this year, and is still
weighing its options. ``Maybe we won't make an endorsement at all,
that's a possibility. And there's a possibility we'll endorse
somebody, but we're just not in a position to make that
announcement now,'' Hoffa said. Last fall, the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, along with the United Auto Workers,
abstained when the AFL-CIO announced its early endorsement of Al
Gore.

   PARENTS OF BIRMINGHAM BOMB VICTIMS TELL STORY OF BLACK SURVIVAL
IN AMERICA. Columnist Vernon Jarrett speaks by phone with his
longtime friend, Mrs. Alpha Robertson, 81, the mother of Carole
Robertson, one of the four teen-age girls murdered when racists
bombed Birmingham's black 16th Street Baptist church in 1963.
Despite the announcement by the State of Alabama that two alleged
Klu Klux Klansmen have been indicted for the murder of her child,
Roberton and Jarrett remain largely concerned about changes in old
racist attitudes. (slugged:

   KOREAN PITCHERS ARE TURNING UP RED. Three Korean pitchers _
Sang-Hoon Lee, Jin Ho Cho and Sun-Woo Kim _ are hoping to make the
big leagues with the Boston Red Sox. Gary Gaetti, who broke into
the majors with the Twins in 1982 and is currently fighting for a
spot on the Red Sox roster, says Lee, Cho and Kim have become
welcome additions during the Grapefruit League season. ``Now there
are a lot more Latin players and a lot more Asian players. And I
guess that's good because we are trying to get global with
baseball,'' Gaetti says. (slugged:

   LIFE AFTER ELIAN. This week, columnist James Garcia writes that,
nationally, the Elian Gonzalez affair exposed longstanding
divisions between Cuban-Americans and other Latinos. Most notably,
the saga highlighted the waning power of the once seemingly
indomitable community of Cuban exiles. ``It's time for Elian to go
home and for Cuban-Americans to let the country know that CANF (the
Cuban American National Foundation, which orchestrated a relentless
legal and public-relations crusade to keep Elian in the United
States) and its right-wing allies do not speak for the entire
community,'' he writes. (slugged:

   SEEING WHAT'S AHEAD. What if the United States and the rest of
the world were at the beginning of a period of change _ an economic
expansion driven by technological progress that would literally

excerpt from Emerge magazine, contributing columnist Nat Irvin II
offers answers to these questions _ and asks African-Americans to
take advantage of the future they envision by reframing the
present. (slugged: BC-NEW-AMERICA-LOOKING-TO-FUTURE-NYTSF)

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Every time I chat with Mrs. Alpha Robertson, I am reminded by
her voice and overall demeanor that I am in the presence of an
ignored chapter in American social history. She is the embodiment
of the historic travail of black parents who lived during the era
of lynch rule in the South.
 &HT;    In the South there was once a truism among blacks stating that
regardless of what parents did for their children, they always was
the albatross of the lynch mob.
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson, 81, is the mother of Carole Robertson, one of
the four teenage girls murdered when racists bombed Birmingham's
black 16th Street Baptist church in 1963. I've maintained a great
friendship with Mrs. Robertson since I first interviewed her in
Chicago over 15 years ago.
 &HT;    Recently, I spoke by phone with Mrs. Robertson following the
announcement by the State of Alabama that two alleged Klu Klux
Klansmen had been indicted for the murder of her child. The nature
of the conversation required me to consider my words carefully.
There could be no lightweight reporters' banter: ``Will you be glad
if the two alleged Klansmen are sentenced to the chair?''
 &HT;    Yet, the temptation to dwell on the superficial was offered. One
of the indicted reportedly had said that his ``only regret's that
the black church was not filled'' when the bomb exploded.
 &HT;    This heartless statement represents an age-old, pervasive,
antihuman attitude that black parents once had to endure whenever
their children left their doorsteps. It also represents the
mentality that once gave lynch mobs a degree of acceptability
throughout the land _ not just in the South.
 &HT;    Despite over 4,742 lynchings from 1909 through 1968, as recorded
by the NAACP, the U.S. Congress remained silent for decades, even
though 1,297 of the hanging victims had been white. Congress
refused to pass any antilynching legislation until after World War
II, when the annual statistics for lynchings had dropped to single
digits.
 &HT;    But don't confuse the lynching of blacks with the hanging of
whites. A black lynching usually expressed a ritualized worship of
racial supremacy. Frequently lynchers dressed in their Sunday best
or wore old army attire from the Spanish American War or World War
I. The lynchers and attendant mob carried the Confederate war flag,
as though brutalizing blacks was an act of patriotism.
 &HT;    Some of the mob even fought for charred souvenirs such as toes,
fingers, and in some instances, burnt genitals for display at
country stores and barbershops.
 &HT;    The tolerance of lynching represented a national and regional
sickness. This sickness can be witnessed today in those who
advocate Confederate flags flying over state capitol grounds.
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson and I strongly favor justice finally prevailing
in solutions to old murders, but we are also largely concerned
about changes in old attitudes. We detect a modicum of hope in the
singular fact that the State of Alabama is trying to correct at
least one of its sins of the past.
 &HT;    As we talked, I recalled a conversation we had one evening over
20 years ago when I was visiting Montgomery, Ala. The phone rang
and an unannounced voice spoke as though it was old friend. ``Hey,
Vernon, how you doin', fella,'' the voice said. ``Your friend Alvin
(black Alabama Rep. Alvin Holmes), told me you were in town ... Any
thing you need?''
 &HT;    I couldn't detect the drawl until the man said ``This is George,
you know me, the governor. I jess wanted to know if everything was
all right.''
 &HT;    Gov. Wallace went on to talk about how he had changed, and how
``we all had to change, no doubt about it.'' Wallace said ``we know
we didn't treat colored people right, and so does everybody.''
 &HT;    I turned down Gov. Wallace's offer of transportation to the
airport, but I conceded to myself that times had changed at some
level in the South. I couldn't resist remembering that in 1963
Wallace stood at the entrance of the University of Alabama and
drawled, ``I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow and
segregation forever.''
 &HT;    Nor could I clear from memory the spiritual climate of 1963 when
those four girls were slain and two black boys were killed the same
day _ one shot by a cop in Birmingham. I also recalled a white
civil rights marcher named William L. Moore of Baltimore who was
shot to death near Attalla, Ala., and that in Jackson, Miss.,
Medgar Evers was assassinated for trying to register blacks to
vote.
 TAKING DOWN THE CONFEDERATE FLAG  
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson and I recognize the significance of this singular
initiative coming from the State of Alabama. Indeed, it should
proceed with serious intent. A sector of Alabama, like Gov.
Wallace, has become clearly aware of the power of the black ballot.
Martyrs such as Martin Luther King Jr., Evers and so many others
did not die in vain.
 &HT;    However, delayed indictments of old culprits will never truly
compensate noble souls like retired school teacher Alpha Robertson
or the ghost of her late educator husband Alvin Robertson Sr. whose
biggest sin was sending their pretty little child ``all dressed
up'' to die in Sunday School.

 By ED ODEVEN  
 &HT;    Sang-Hoon Lee stands out in more ways than one. The 29-year-old
pitcher from Seoul is on the verge of becoming the first man in
history to play in the elite levels of professional baseball in
Korea, Japan and the United States. Lee signed a two-year contract
with the Boston Red Sox in January and at press time appeared to be
slated as the No. 2 lefty in the Red Sox bullpen behind veteran
Rheal Cormier.
 &HT;    Oh, and then there's his famous shoulder-length, bushy
reddish-brown hair that has earned him the nickname ``Samson'' _ a
reference to the Biblical warrior with impressive physical prowess.
 &HT;    Lee has also accomplished what few pitchers have done: excel as
a starter and closer. In 1995, he had a 20-5 record as a starter
and earned the Korean Most Valuable Player honors. Two years later,
Lee saved 37 games, and was chosen as the relief pitcher of the
year.
 &HT;    Last season, he had a 6-5 record and a 2.83 earned run average
(ERA) while pitching for the Chunichi Dragons in Japan. In 95.1
innings, Lee struck out 65 batters and walked 30 in 36 appearances.
 &HT;    These numbers and past accolades, however, don't mean much to
Lee nowadays.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to put too much meaning in them,'' Lee said
through interpreter Seung-hyun Park before a recent exhibition game
against the visiting Minnesota Twins at Wilbur ``Billy'' Smith
Field in Fort Myers, Fla. ``I just want to do my best and not think
about the past.''
 &HT;    Lee adds his main goal for this season is to earn a spot on
Boston's 25-man roster and stick around to contribute all season.
 &HT;    Joining Lee at the Red Sox training camp are fellow Koreans Jin
Ho Cho and Sun-Woo Kim. Cho split last season with Boston's
Triple-A Pawtucket team (9-3 with a 3.45 ERA and 80 strikeouts in
109.2 innings), and also appeared in nine games with the Red Sox,
posting a 2-3 record in 39.1 innings of work.
 &HT;    Kim, a 22-year-old from Inchon, was 9-8 with a 4.89 ERA in 26
games last season all starts for Double-A Trenton. The
hard-throwing right-hander fanned 130 batters and yielded just 44
base on balls in 149 innings.
 &HT;    According to Lee, the duos' presence in Ft. Myers has made his
transition to America easier.
 &HT;    ``It's been very beneficial to have Jin Ho Cho and Sun Kim
here.''
 &HT;    During his brief stay in the United States, Lee says the Red Sox
coaches haven't asked him to alter his pitching style. So, what
should baseball fans expect from Lee this season?
 &HT;    ``He's somebody we are looking for to get out left-handers in
key situations,'' teammate Mike Stanley says.
 &HT;    Certainly that's an important role for a team yearning to
overtake the lefty-loaded New York Yankees as the American League
East's premier ballclub this season. Wendell Kim, Boston's third
base coach, says in limited playing time Lee has made a favorable
impression with the organization.
 &HT;    ``It looks like he can handle himself. He might be able to get
you out with his pitches' change of speeds,'' he says.
 &HT;    After a respectable stint in the big leagues last summer, Cho
appears ready to crack the starting rotation on a full-time basis
as well.
 &HT;    ``He's obviously battling for that number five spot,'' Stanley
says. ``He gave us some good quality innings last year coming up.
He's got pretty good experience and knows what it takes to compete
and win at this level.''
 &HT;    Minnesota Twins manager Tom Kelly believes Cho is progressing as
a productive hurler.
 &HT;    ``He seems like a guy that's sort of learning and making the
transition. I'm sure it's a challenge for him to come over here and
pitch, especially at this level,'' says Kelly, who guided the Twins
to thrilling seven-game World Series triumphs in 1987 and 1991.
 &HT;    ``I think he's handled it well. He seems to be pretty composed
on the mound and I'm sure it s quite a learning experience. You've
got to admire that and take your hat off to the young man for
trying.''

 &HT;    What if the United States and the rest of the world were at the
beginning of a period of change _ an economic expansion driven by
technological progress that would literally dwarf the magnitude of
the Industrial Revolution? If this were true, what would the
implications be for African-Americans?
 &HT;    One way to understand the future is by learning to make up
stories about the future through scenarios. Scenarios are a way of
organizing what we already know (what we've learned from the past),
while encouraging different perspectives on what the future might
hold.
 &HT;    Gerald Harris, of Global Business Network, a San Francisco-based
planning organization, uses scenarios. Harris says that telling
stories about the future can be a very important tool for the
African-American community as a way of seeing the future now, not
later.
 &HT;    ``We can't win the race by looking to see who is coming up from
behind and who is running beside us. We must also see who is in
front of us,'' Harris says.
 &HT;    Futurist thinking is not about predicting the future, but it is
a way of thinking intelligently about how the future might play
out, and making decisions and adjustments today _ in anticipation.
 &HT;    It is also a way of learning from, and interacting with, events
and trends as they unfold and making adjustments when new things
are learned. For example, using scenarios, you can fast-forward to
the year 2025 and then reframe the present by looking backward and
imagining how people in the future might look back on the world
today.
 &HT;    For example, let's ``look back'' from the year 2025. You would
see the American landscape being reshaped by information and
communication technology. It would be a world where the rapid
spread of technology, combined with a world movement toward
capitalistic economic systems, formed an irresistible force of
change and growth.
 &HT;    Looking back, you'd see a world where telecommunications,
biotechnology, nanotechnology and alternative sources of energy had
come together in an era of globalization. It had all come together
to create a long boom of economic expansion with new jobs and new
opportunities.
 &HT;    It was a world in which our ability to communicate with the rest
of the world increased _ faster and broader as the power of the
networked society evolved through communications networks adopted
by nearly one-third of the globe's teen-agers.
 &HT;    This was a world of the networked society where work is varied,
including new work arrangements with employers. There were more
independent contractors used, and there was a big increase in the
speed and scope of transactions and interactions.
 &HT;    It was a world in which AOL gobbled up Time Warner to form a new
company with a market value of about $300 billion. That merger of a
new Internet company and an old media powerhouse brought forth a
new era and was the first of many megamergers of necessity. The
Internet needed content in order to survive, and media companies
wanted to capture a larger audience through personal computers.
 &HT;    It was a world in which identifying and using genetic
information doubled every one or two years, transforming
agriculture, nutrition and health care to create new products in an
emerging life-sciences industry.
 &HT;    In this long-boom scenario of the future, periods of slow
worldwide economic growth are very short and transitional, with no
recessions and no depressions. As to who wins in the long economic
boom to the networked economy, some nations do and some don't.
 &HT;    Every nation that matters _ not just China but Namibia, Ghana,
Nigeria, India, Trinidad and Tobago _ must determine to get on
board this economic train or be left behind in a quickly advancing
game, where being behind can be fatal.
 &HT;    OK, come back to today, April 2000. Ask yourself what are the
implications for the United States in the long-boom scenario? What
are the implications for the African-American community in the
long-boom scenario? What does this mean to you?
 &HT;    The answer, in part, is for African-Americans to take advantage
of the future we envision by reframing the present.
 &HT;    The next generation of African-Americans, according to Harris,
will need to reposition ``the center point of our American
experience beyond the slavery/racist nexus of our past.
 &HT;    ``Black Americans are a diverse group. But as a community, there
will be advantages to forward looking _ a more open vision of
ourselves and our place in America,'' Harris explains. ``What we
are talking about is adding a major plank to our cultural sense of
self.''
 &HT;    We are going to have to change the way we see ourselves, and we
need a tool that allows us to learn to do this. Utilizing the
technique of scenario planning and thinking can help.

PARENTS OF BIRMINGHAM BOMB VICTIMS TELL STORY OF BLACK SURVIVAL IN

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Every time I chat with Mrs. Alpha Robertson, I am reminded by
her voice and overall demeanor that I am in the presence of an
ignored chapter in American social history. She is the embodiment
of the historic travail of black parents who lived during the era
of lynch rule in the South.
 &HT;    In the South there was once a truism among blacks stating that
regardless of what parents did for their children, they always was
the albatross of the lynch mob.
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson, 81, is the mother of Carole Robertson, one of
the four teenage girls murdered when racists bombed Birmingham's
black 16th Street Baptist church in 1963. I've maintained a great
friendship with Mrs. Robertson since I first interviewed her in
Chicago over 15 years ago.
 &HT;    Recently, I spoke by phone with Mrs. Robertson following the
announcement by the State of Alabama that two alleged Klu Klux
Klansmen had been indicted for the murder of her child. The nature
of the conversation required me to consider my words carefully.
There could be no lightweight reporters' banter: ``Will you be glad
if the two alleged Klansmen are sentenced to the chair?''
 &HT;    Yet, the temptation to dwell on the superficial was offered. One
of the indicted reportedly had said that his ``only regret's that
the black church was not filled'' when the bomb exploded.
 &HT;    This heartless statement represents an age-old, pervasive,
antihuman attitude that black parents once had to endure whenever
their children left their doorsteps. It also represents the
mentality that once gave lynch mobs a degree of acceptability
throughout the land _ not just in the South.
 &HT;    Despite over 4,742 lynchings from 1909 through 1968, as recorded
by the NAACP, the U.S. Congress remained silent for decades, even
though 1,297 of the hanging victims had been white. Congress
refused to pass any antilynching legislation until after World War
II, when the annual statistics for lynchings had dropped to single
digits.
 &HT;    But don't confuse the lynching of blacks with the hanging of
whites. A black lynching usually expressed a ritualized worship of
racial supremacy. Frequently lynchers dressed in their Sunday best
or wore old army attire from the Spanish American War or World War
I. The lynchers and attendant mob carried the Confederate war flag,
as though brutalizing blacks was an act of patriotism.
 &HT;    Some of the mob even fought for charred souvenirs such as toes,
fingers, and in some instances, burnt genitals for display at
country stores and barbershops.
 &HT;    The tolerance of lynching represented a national and regional
sickness. This sickness can be witnessed today in those who
advocate Confederate flags flying over state capitol grounds.
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson and I strongly favor justice finally prevailing
in solutions to old murders, but we are also largely concerned
about changes in old attitudes. We detect a modicum of hope in the
singular fact that the State of Alabama is trying to correct at
least one of its sins of the past.
 &HT;    As we talked, I recalled a conversation we had one evening over
20 years ago when I was visiting Montgomery, Ala. The phone rang
and an unannounced voice spoke as though it was old friend. ``Hey,
Vernon, how you doin', fella,'' the voice said. ``Your friend Alvin
(black Alabama Rep. Alvin Holmes), told me you were in town ... Any
thing you need?''
 &HT;    I couldn't detect the drawl until the man said ``This is George,
you know me, the governor. I jess wanted to know if everything was
all right.''
 &HT;    Gov. Wallace went on to talk about how he had changed, and how
``we all had to change, no doubt about it.'' Wallace said ``we know
we didn't treat colored people right, and so does everybody.''
 &HT;    I turned down Gov. Wallace's offer of transportation to the
airport, but I conceded to myself that times had changed at some
level in the South. I couldn't resist remembering that in 1963
Wallace stood at the entrance of the University of Alabama and
drawled, ``I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow and
segregation forever.''
 &HT;    Nor could I clear from memory the spiritual climate of 1963 when
those four girls were slain and two black boys were killed the same
day _ one shot by a cop in Birmingham. I also recalled a white
civil rights marcher named William L. Moore of Baltimore who was
shot to death near Attalla, Ala., and that in Jackson, Miss.,
Medgar Evers was assassinated for trying to register blacks to
vote.
 TAKING DOWN THE CONFEDERATE FLAG  
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson and I recognize the significance of this singular
initiative coming from the State of Alabama. Indeed, it should
proceed with serious intent. A sector of Alabama, like Gov.
Wallace, has become clearly aware of the power of the black ballot.
Martyrs such as Martin Luther King Jr., Evers and so many others
did not die in vain.
 &HT;    However, delayed indictments of old culprits will never truly
compensate noble souls like retired school teacher Alpha Robertson
or the ghost of her late educator husband Alvin Robertson Sr. whose
biggest sin was sending their pretty little child ``all dressed
up'' to die in Sunday School.

 By ED ODEVEN  
 &HT;    Sang-Hoon Lee stands out in more ways than one. The 29-year-old
pitcher from Seoul is on the verge of becoming the first man in
history to play in the elite levels of professional baseball in
Korea, Japan and the United States. Lee signed a two-year contract
with the Boston Red Sox in January and at press time appeared to be
slated as the No. 2 lefty in the Red Sox bullpen behind veteran
Rheal Cormier.
 &HT;    Oh, and then there's his famous shoulder-length, bushy
reddish-brown hair that has earned him the nickname ``Samson'' _ a
reference to the Biblical warrior with impressive physical prowess.
 &HT;    Lee has also accomplished what few pitchers have done: excel as
a starter and closer. In 1995, he had a 20-5 record as a starter
and earned the Korean Most Valuable Player honors. Two years later,
Lee saved 37 games, and was chosen as the relief pitcher of the
year.
 &HT;    Last season, he had a 6-5 record and a 2.83 earned run average
(ERA) while pitching for the Chunichi Dragons in Japan. In 95.1
innings, Lee struck out 65 batters and walked 30 in 36 appearances.
 &HT;    These numbers and past accolades, however, don't mean much to
Lee nowadays.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to put too much meaning in them,'' Lee said
through interpreter Seung-hyun Park before a recent exhibition game
against the visiting Minnesota Twins at Wilbur ``Billy'' Smith
Field in Fort Myers, Fla. ``I just want to do my best and not think
about the past.''
 &HT;    Lee adds his main goal for this season is to earn a spot on
Boston's 25-man roster and stick around to contribute all season.
 &HT;    Joining Lee at the Red Sox training camp are fellow Koreans Jin
Ho Cho and Sun-Woo Kim. Cho split last season with Boston's
Triple-A Pawtucket team (9-3 with a 3.45 ERA and 80 strikeouts in
109.2 innings), and also appeared in nine games with the Red Sox,
posting a 2-3 record in 39.1 innings of work.
 &HT;    Kim, a 22-year-old from Inchon, was 9-8 with a 4.89 ERA in 26
games last season all starts for Double-A Trenton. The
hard-throwing right-hander fanned 130 batters and yielded just 44
base on balls in 149 innings.
 &HT;    According to Lee, the duos' presence in Ft. Myers has made his
transition to America easier.
 &HT;    ``It's been very beneficial to have Jin Ho Cho and Sun Kim
here.''
 &HT;    During his brief stay in the United States, Lee says the Red Sox
coaches haven't asked him to alter his pitching style. So, what
should baseball fans expect from Lee this season?
 &HT;    ``He's somebody we are looking for to get out left-handers in
key situations,'' teammate Mike Stanley says.
 &HT;    Certainly that's an important role for a team yearning to
overtake the lefty-loaded New York Yankees as the American League
East's premier ballclub this season. Wendell Kim, Boston's third
base coach, says in limited playing time Lee has made a favorable
impression with the organization.
 &HT;    ``It looks like he can handle himself. He might be able to get
you out with his pitches' change of speeds,'' he says.
 &HT;    After a respectable stint in the big leagues last summer, Cho
appears ready to crack the starting rotation on a full-time basis
as well.
 &HT;    ``He's obviously battling for that number five spot,'' Stanley
says. ``He gave us some good quality innings last year coming up.
He's got pretty good experience and knows what it takes to compete
and win at this level.''
 &HT;    Minnesota Twins manager Tom Kelly believes Cho is progressing as
a productive hurler.
 &HT;    ``He seems like a guy that's sort of learning and making the
transition. I'm sure it's a challenge for him to come over here and
pitch, especially at this level,'' says Kelly, who guided the Twins
to thrilling seven-game World Series triumphs in 1987 and 1991.
 &HT;    ``I think he's handled it well. He seems to be pretty composed
on the mound and I'm sure it s quite a learning experience. You've
got to admire that and take your hat off to the young man for
trying.''
 &HT;    While observing the 20-plus pitchers during spring training,
Wendell Kim notices Sun Kim has the necessary skills to succeed.
 &HT;    ``He's around the plate. He's got a good presence on the mound.
He looks poised. Nothing seems to rattle him,'' Wendell Kim
reports.
 &HT;    Gary Gaetti, who broke into the majors with the Twins in 1982
and is currently fighting for a spot on the Red Sox roster, says

Grapefruit League season.
 &HT;    ``They are very pleasant human beings,'' the easy-going Gaetti

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    In the weeks after she snatched a crying Elian Gonzalez from his
relatives' home in Miami's Little Havana, federal immigration agent
Betty A. Mills received repeated death threats.
 &HT;    Mills is the officer who fought her way through a gauntlet of
angry protesters as she struggled to reach a waiting government van
while carrying the 6-year-old boy.
 &HT;    The agent eventually made it to the van, but the raid led to
street riots later that day.
 &HT;    This chaotic and rebellious portrait of our nation's
Cuban-American community, as presented by the world's news media,
has since come to hurt Cuban-Americans.
 &HT;    In Florida, the Elian controversy exacerbated political and
racial rifts between Cuban-Americans and other local groups.
Nationally, the Elian affair exposed longstanding divisions between
Cuban-Americans and other Latinos.
 &HT;    Most notably, the months-long saga highlighted the waning power
of the once seemingly indomitable community of Cuban exiles.
 &HT;    Many Americans _ including a growing number of Cuban-Americans _
believe that conservative Cuban leaders went too far this time in
using Elian to wage their latest political assault against Fidel
Castro, Cuba's communist dictator.
 &HT;    Elena Freyre, director of the Miami office of the Cuban
Committee for Democracy, blames most of the negative publicity her
community has received on the Cuban American National Foundation
(CANF) and its hard-line stance against the Clinton administration.
 &HT;    ``It's been a PR disaster,'' she said. ``In Washington,
traditionally hard-line Cuban-Americans have certainly lost a lot
of power.''
 &HT;    Almost from the moment that immigration agents handed over the
child to his Miami relatives last November, CANF has orchestrated a
relentless legal and public-relations crusade to keep Elian in the
United States.
 &HT;    CANF's efforts have largely backfired, and its ability to shape
U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba has weakened.
 &HT;    But the cracks in the once-unshakable alliance between
conservative Cuban exiles and their supporters in Congress weren't
created by the fight over Elian, said Julia Sweig, deputy director
of Latin-American Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
 &HT;    She said the power of conservative exiles began to wane after
the death of CANF's former chairman, Jorge Mas Canosa, in 1997. And
the group's influence was further weakened by Pope John Paul II's
visit to Cuba in 1998. The pontiff's visit, analysts say, helped
soften Castro's international image.
 &HT;    Sweig noted that the Cuban exile lobby has almost always had its
way in Washington. Witness the nearly 40-year economic embargo
against Cuba.
 &HT;    Another powerful lobbying group, however, has been chipping away
at CANF's powerbase in Washington in recent years. A growing number
of U.S. business leaders, especially in the farm industry, now back
proposals to boost trade with Cuba.
 &HT;    Last month, House and Senate committees approved an easing of
the trade embargo, though conservatives and Cuban exile leaders vow
to block the measure's final passage.
 &HT;    Back in Miami, the Elian controversy rocked local politics.
 &HT;    Miami Mayor Joe Carollo fired City Manager Donald Warshaw for
refusing to fire Police Chief William O'Brien. Carollo was furious
that O'Brien did not tell him in advance that the raid was going
down. Carollo wants Elian to remain in the United States.
 &HT;    Tom Fiedler, editorial-page editor of the Miami Herald, says
Carollo's behavior during the Elian affair angered many in Miami.
As a result, the mayor may face a tough challenge if he seeks
reelection.
 &HT;    Many believe the Elian controversy did nothing to help improve
already strained relations between Cuban-Americans and other U.S.
Latinos.
 &HT;    A California group representing mostly Mexican and Central
American immigrants marched to protest the ``special treatment''
granted Cuban emigres. Unlike other immigrants, Cubans who reach
U.S. soil automatically receive permanent legal status.
 &HT;    Observers also note that the nation's leading Latino advocacy
organizations never publicly sided with CANF or the boy's Miami
relatives.
 &HT;    Lisa Navarette, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La
Raza, says her group did not get involved in CANF's battle with the
feds because the issue didn't resonate with NCLR's Latino
constituency.
 &HT;    The Elian dispute, she said, wasn't a ``Latino issue.''
 &HT;    Navarette also noted that conservative Cuban exile groups,
including CANF, have rarely supported NCLR's pan-Latino agenda,
including its stances on issues such as immigration or bilingual
education.
 &HT;    I asked Navarette if she thought CANF's power in Washington has
been waning. She said CANF and its allies continue to wield
substantial influence in Washington, though she believes the tide
has changed.
 &HT;    In Navarette's words: ``I think we are in a different time.''
 &HT;    She's right. It's time for Elian to go home and for
Cuban-Americans to let the country know that CANF and its
right-wing allies do not speak for the entire community.

IVILLAGE IN TALKS TO SELL IBABY TO BABYGEAR.COM
</HEADLINE>
 By STEVEN VAMES   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the going gets tough, the tough put the baby up for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   That just might be the strategy for iVillage, the troubled
womens' Web site, which is in talks to sell its baby products
commerce site iBaby to privately held competitor BabyGear.com.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to ditch iBaby, which sells everything from
strollers to breast pumps, is seen as a significant shift in
strategy for iVillage, which has built an online community of 4.9
million women sharing common interests like parenthood and careers.
When iVillage acquired a $1.35 million majority stake in iBaby in
April 1998, it was widely heralded as a groundbreaking strategy in
which an online content provider could make customers out of its
users.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, New York-based iVillage has apparently
changed its mind about the tumultuous world of retailing after
dealing with the day-to-day annoyances of warehouses and product
returns, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, saying that the
company confirmed it is in talks to sell the unit. An iVillage
spokesman confirmed Friday morning that the company is in talks
with BabyGear but declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Bealle, president and chief operating officer of
BabyGear.com, said in an interview that the talks have been ongoing
for ``a couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a deal yet,'' he said, but added that he hoped
to wrap up an agreement within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   iBaby's appeal lies in part in its affiliation with iVillage,
Bealle said. BabyGear.com hopes to embark on ``a longterm
relationship that really takes advantage of their huge user base,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face in iVillage's strategy comes at a time when the
company is ailing from a severely beaten stock value, high turnover
among its executives and employees, and growing quarterly losses.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which peaked at 113 3/4 following its April
1999 public offering, was at 8 7/16, up 33/36, or 7 percent, in
early trading Friday. The company posted a first-quarter operating
loss of $26.8 million, compared to a net loss of $17.9 million in
the first quarter of 1999, even as revenues nearly tripled to $20.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited people familiar with the situation who said
that iVillage is interested in pursuing more advertising and
sponsorship revenue from companies including baby-products
retailers, and its ownership of iBaby precluded it from that.
</P>
<P>
   BabyGear.com's Bealle noted the retail business is ``far
afield'' for iVillage, whose core business is based on content.
``From the beginning, we have been focused on being a retail
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of iBaby would not severely affect the company's
revenue stream. The company's e-commerce revenue of $3.2 million in
the first quarter was dwarfed by its $17.6 million in revenue from
sponsorship and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of iVillage jumped in early trading Friday, rising 15/32,
or 6 percent, to 8 3/8.

&HT;     RESEARCHERS WARN OF UNINTENDED EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIZABETH ALLEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Chemical pesticides and the delicate green
lacewing are farmers' friends when it comes to controlling
crop-eating bugs. But even carefully targeted pesticides can wipe
out the beneficial bugs, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   While exploring the effects of insect growth regulators (IGRs),
which are supposed to kill specific pests like aphids and
whiteflies by preventing them from maturing to adulthood,
agricultural extension service entomologists found that two of them
kill the lacewing in its third larval stage.
</P>
<P>
   That raises concerns about their effect on the entire ecosystem,
said Andy Scott, research director at Rio Farms, a private
agricultural research foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question I would have is what's the effect on some of the
other beneficial species, such as the big-eyed bug, the lady
beetles (and) the serpent-fly larvae,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Extension researcher T.X. Liu plans to begin testing the IGRs'
effects on lady beetles in August.
</P>
<P>
   The two chemicals that have unintended consequences are
fenoxycarb and pyriproxyfen, approved by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture for use on some crops in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing you want to do when you spray insecticides is
to kill off beneficial insects,'' said Liu, a researcher at the
Texas A&AMP;M Agricultural Research and Extension Center at Weslaco.
Liu is trying to get IGRs approved for wider use in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Liu is also testing buprofezin, which does not appear to hurt
lacewings but is not licensed for use in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to avoiding such trouble is to apply the IGRs when the
lacewings are not in that vulnerable third stage, Liu said,
although he admits that the timing can be tough to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very careful when we use it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the fact that the research station is looking
carefully at the IGRs' unintended effects is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line with any new compound, we really need to know what
we're doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many pesticides tend to take out all beneficial insects, Scott
noted, so IGRs present an advantage, but any change in the
ecosystem can throw it out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the 1995 boll weevil eradication project in the
Rio Grande Valley, where heavy spraying for boll weevils, drought
and an infestation of beet army worms combined to produce a
disastrous year for cotton farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers sued, and a judge ruled the program unconstitutional.
The Legislature revamped the program in 1997, but Valley farmers so
far have declined to opt back into it.
</P>
<P>
   Scott and many farmers contend the boll weevil spray also took
out the army worms' natural predators, giving the pests free rein
in the fields of the Valley's main crop.
</P>
<P>
   However, other chemicals will take out some pests but boost the
aphid population, creating a bountiful food supply for beneficial
insects, Scott pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're dealing with biological systems they're very
complex,'' he said. ``You do one thing, and it causes a chain
reaction.''

NORTHWEST AIRLINES SOARS ON REPORTS OF MERGER WITH AMR
</HEADLINE>
 By JENNIFER FRIEDLIN   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Northwest Airlines surged Friday following reports
that AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, was seeking to
acquire it.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's stock was up 6 1/16, or 21 percent, to 35 1/8 in
morning trading, while AMR shares were off 15/16, or 3 percent, at
28 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, KSTP-TV, a Minnesota television station,
reported that Don J. Carty, American's chief executive, and John
Dasburg, Northwest's president and chief executive, had spoken
about a possible merger. The report was attributed to unidentified
``well-placed sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from each of the companies declined to comment
on the report, which could not be immediately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between American, the world's second-largest airline, and
Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest, would put an end to
speculation that American might offer a counterbid for US Airways,
which recently announced an agreement to be bought by UAL, the
parent of United Airlines, for $4.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   UAL's acquisition of US Airways set off considerable speculation
about the possibility of further industry consolidation. In
addition to a Northwest-American deal, industry analysts said a
merger between Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines might also
be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between the Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest and the Fort
Worth, Texas-based American could face a host of obstacles similar
to those that may obstruct the deal between UAL and US Airways _
namely, the combining of their work forces and their huge
information-technology networks.
</P>
<P>
   For the deal to get regulatory approval, Northwest would also
have to sell off its 14 percent equity holding and 51 percent
voting stake in Continental.

disappointed in the clothes and the show. She raises the question:
Isn't the show ``just a swankier version of ``The Golden Girls''?

   TV-STYLE-REGIS (New York) _ Monday Regis Philbin will introduce
Regis, by Van Heusen just in time for Father's Day June 18. Fashion
magazines say the ```millionaire look'' of monochromatic shirts and

million sales projection is accurate, then Philbin may have found a

   GAVIN-PROFILE (New York) _ Gavin Brown, a British-born art

is Chris Ofili, whose creativity with elephant dung created a fuss
at the Brooklyn Museum. Brown is also the proprietor of Passerby, a
bar adjacent to his gallery. Next door, Brown's wife, Lucy Barnes,

   BLOOM-READING (Undated) _ Harold Bloom, the Yale professor whose
latest book is ``How to Read and Why,'' writes about the depressing
experience of reading the latest Michael Crichton thriller
downloaded onto a portable PC. ``Crichton's prose is as dead as the
14th century,'' he writes, ``and if you're reading it on a
hand-held computer, it is a double ordeal, physical and
stylistic.'' Information may be fine transmitted on a screen, he
concludes, but ``wisdom and beauty cry out'' for a book.

   NITE-OUT-TELLER (New York) _ A night on the town with Jurgen
Teller, the fashion photographer, who is best known for discovering
Kate Moss and creating a look that has been described as dirty
realism and heroin chic. Bob Morris, the reporter, says Teller's
images have helped lower the traditional standards of beauty. ``I
don't care about fashion at all,'' Teller says, and he adds that
being a fashion photograher is a ``kind of pathetic occupation.''

   EIGHTIES-RETURN (Undated) _ From her boutique in Beverly Hills,
Gale Hayman, had a front row seat for the lavish fashion of the
'80s. Now, she reports, furs, feathers, higher heels, pink
lipstick, pony skin and leopard boots, Chanel quilted chain belts
and big hair have all reappeared. The difference is that back then,
women wore it all together, head to toe. Now it's edited down to
one great piece at a time.

JOBLESS RATE JUMPS TO 4.1 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 By STEVEN VAMES   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent in May as the
nation's employers hired surprisingly few workers and curbed wage
increases, indicating that the booming labor market, which has
underpinned the country's stunning economic performance in recent
years, may be starting to feel the sting of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported Friday that nonfarm payrolls, a
broad measure of employers' new hires, rose a
far-smaller-than-expected 231,000 in May, and that the unemployment
rate rose to 4.1 percent. That compares with an upwardly revised
gain of 414,000 payrolls in April, which brought the unemployment
rate for that month to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The data shocked many economists, who had not expected to see
such a swift skid in the labor market. The consensus of analysts
polled by Reuters had forecast a 386,000 rise in payrolls and no
change in April's 3.9 percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   Although labor markets remain extremely strong by historical
standards, the sharp slowdown in May is a sign that a yearlong
campaign by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in an
attempt to slow growth is finally beginning to rattle the
foundations of the record-long U.S. economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   A separate government report also pointed to more sluggish
economic activity Friday. The Commerce Department reported that
factory orders dropped 4.3 percent in April following an upwardly
revised 2.7 percent rise in March.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs data, along with other data showing slower retail and
auto sales, shrinking home sales activity and diminishing growth in
manufacturing, suggest that the economy might finally be showing
broad signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   The slower pace of hiring in May came despite a recent spate of
357,000 temporary hires for the government's Census 2000 effort.
Stripped of census workers, payrolls actually declined by 126,000
in May.
</P>
<P>
   Employees also worked fewer hours, indicating that business
activity for many companies may be slowing. Labor reported that the
number of hours worked by the average employee dropped by six
minutes to 34.4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   With such paltry gains in payrolls, employers were also not
inclined to raise wages and salaries as quickly as they recently
have. The report's measure of average hourly earnings rose only a
penny, or about 0.1 percent, to $13.65 in May. That pulled
year-over-year wage growth down to 3.5 percent from 3.8 percent in
April. Economists had expected a 0.4 percent rise in wages.
</P>
<P>
   That is sure to ease the minds of economists and policy-makers,
who have repeatedly voiced concerns that the hot labor market, and
its upward pressure on wages, was fueling unsustainable levels of
consumer demand. They also fear that higher wages would cause
companies to push the costs along to their customers, causing
inflation to jump higher.
</P>
<P>
   Offsetting the throngs of workers hired for the census was a
sharp and broad-based 116,000 cut in private sector payrolls. That
contraction included a 67,000 decline in retail jobs, a 29,000 drop
in construction jobs, and a 17,000 drop in manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The major areas that declined in May _ construction,
manufacturing, and retail _ indicate that any degree of slowdown in
the economy is hurting low-skill workers the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the slight unemployment rise during the month was
among less- educated workers and underscores the need for education
and training to meet our economy's continuing demand for skilled
workers,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman in a statement.
``Skills are the ticket for the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets took comfort in the weak labor report, as it
suggests the Fed might not have to keep increasing interest rates
as much as previously thought. The Fed has raised short-term
interest rates, which act as a basis for everything from credit
cards to mortgages, six times since last June in an attempt to slow
economic growth. Its last rate move on May 16 doubled in magnitude
from the previous five, to half a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Fed's point of view, this is a perfect jobs report,''
said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial
Services. ``Job growth slowed significantly and there are
absolutely no signs of inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The breadth of the slowdown for labor markets and other key
areas of the economy is helping to convince many economists that
the Fed might stand pat on interest rates when it meets next on
June 27 and 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``These figures are consistent with our view that the Fed will
remain on hold at this month's June 28 (Fed policy-maker)
meeting,'' said Joe LaVorgna, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche
Bank in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But he also cautioned that the slowdown might not mean the end
of the Fed's vigilant inflation-fighting rate moves. Despite the
May labor market weakness, he noted that second-quarter gross
domestic product still appears to be running higher than historical
trends at around 4 percent. The weakness, he said, could be a
``headfake'' as many leading indicators of the labor market, like
unemployment claims and businesses' hiring plans, continue to point
to a healthy labor market going forward.
</P>
<P>
   But other parts of the economy are convincingly showing slower
activity, including the May factory orders data. The report showed
a wide decline in orders, even when volatile transportation orders
and defense-related orders were stripped out. That adds to the
recent signs that home sales, durable goods orders and
manufacturing are starting to react to the Fed's rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Some pockets of the economy, however, are likely to continue
chugging along, especially in the high-tech arena. The
Semiconductor Industry Association reported Thursday that sales of
semiconductors grew 35.6 percent year over year in April to $11.2
billion. The trade group cited growing demand for mobile phones and
wireless electronic devices as the main driver of that growth.

FASHION'S TIME MACHINE LANDS IN THE '80S 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use on Sunday, June 4) 
 By GALE HAYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the 1980s? ``Dynasty,'' affluence, opulence, jewels,
high heels, designer labels and entirely new categories of luxury
goods, from foods to expensively scented candles to indulgent
accessories for the bath?
</P>
<P>
   Fashion designers remember. For fall, they are revisiting some
of the signature styles from the decade of dressing excessively.
Some of the most incendiary young talents, including Marc Jacobs at
Louis Vuitton and Nicolas Ghesquiere at Balenciaga, are again
pushing the shoulder-pad envelope and putting the power back in
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Before all this makes you run screaming in protest to the Gap,
take a deep breath. In style, there was a lot more to the '80s than
the linebacker shoulders of Claude Montana or the silly, desexed
string ties of women ``dressing for success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The '80s really got a bad rap,'' Buffy Cafritz, the venerable
Washington hostess, told a group of us the other day at a lunch for
Bob Colacello, who is writing a book about Ronald and Nancy Reagan.
``Luxury living is bigger than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right, of course. The wardrobe choices of Reagan that once
drew such scorn in the news are the essence of classic elegant
restraint. The china she chose for the White House, another target,
looks fabulous today. The way I see it, the '80s was a dress
rehearsal. This time around, we're getting the '80s right by doing
the original looks better, more stylishly and with greater
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   I had a front-row seat for the dress rehearsal decade. Back
then, I owned one of the quintessential stores for fashion, Giorgio
Beverly Hills, on Los Angeles' Rodeo Drive. We couldn't get enough
Kenneth Lane jewelry, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Versace,
Oscar de la Renta, Karl Lagerfeld, Scaasi, Bill Blass, Calvin
Klein, Christian Dior, Valentino and Zandra Rhodes. Extravagance
walked out of the store. Christian Lacroix's poufs literally
floated out like parachutes. By the mid-'80s, Halston, who had been
enormously popular in the '70s, was all of a sudden too quiet for
the newly created glamour girl.
</P>
<P>
   By day, however, this glamour girl, who couldn't exactly float
into the office in a pouf, was in a fashion quandary. In
counterpoint to the shimmer of evening, there emerged the dress for
success look (and a book by the same name), which dictated dressing
like a man in order to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Two-piece gray, navy or tan suits with a high-buttoned white or
pale blue shirt, worn with a man's black tie. It became a uniform
in offices all across the country. (We sold it, too, except ours
was made by Brioni in Rome). To complement (or perhaps counteract)
the stiffness, I created Giorgio perfume: sexy, powerful, feminine
and effusive.
</P>
<P>
   Today the rigid office look is long gone. It has been stretched,
softened and made to skim the body. Even by night, fit is
everything. Perhaps the biggest revolution in fashion over the last
two decades has been in fabric technology.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to go back to a 100-pound beaded gown (I kid you not)
when you've worn one weighing six ounces, like those Richard Tyler
designs for the stars. Skinny capris now have stretch and give to
them. The famous Jax capris of the '80s would split almost without
fail whenever you sat down. Jeans in the '80s were so tight and
uncomfortable they required you to lie down when you zipped them
up. Now we have slim cuts but wearable, comfortable, slightly
stretchy fits.
</P>
<P>
   The trick in looking like an '80s gal updated for 2000 is to
take what worked best from the past and reject the rest. As Karl
Lagerfeld once told me, ``Fashion comes back, but always in a
different way.'' Imagine, for example, taking a pair of your old
bell-bottom slacks from the back of your closet and trying to pass
them off as today's boot cut. They'd never fly, let alone walk.
</P>
<P>
   Big, constructed '80s clothes don't work today. Big, softly
crushable clothes do. Oscar de la Renta's opulent Degas-style
evening dress made of yards of netting squishes when you sit _ in
the '80s, a similar style didn't. Clothes all across the spectrum
perform so much better than they ever did in dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   We're not following the '90s interval of gray-black-tan-neutral
minimalism with a surge of ostentation or vulgarity. Anything but.
But what we're seeing now is a backlash against that minimalism,
which dictated plain clothes, no jewelry, no color, no fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Too safe, too plain.
</P>
<P>
   Now, energy and sex appeal are back out in the open. The Hermes
bags and Van Cleef jewels fit the mix, along with cashmere in
abundance, pashminas in gently pretty colors, pearls, sapphire
earrings and a Verdura watch (like the one designed for Greta
Garbo). Wonderful luminous satins, velvets and floral chiffons.
Moderation. One wonderful piece of jewelry at a time. And more
moderation.
</P>
<P>
   We always said in the '80s that when the market went up, so
would hemlines. It's not true anymore. The market is up, hemlines
are sensible, but you can also run a company today wearing pink.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that moderation has to be too moderate.
That's where the decade of the '80s has really triumphed this time.
</P>
<P>
   Furs, feathers, higher heels, pink lipstick and big hair have
all reappeared. Off-the-shoulder ``boyfriend'' sweaters. Pony skin
and leopard boots. Silk blouses with or without ascot-tie
necklines, worn with slim or pleated skirts. Hemlines by choice
just below the knee. Chanel quilted chain belts.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that back then, women wore it all together,
head to toe: they came swinging into a room with jewelry on both
hands, a choker, cleavage, a Gucci printed initial bag. Now, it's
edited down to one great piece at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Ultrasuede is back, too, in the new Halston collection designed
by Craig Natiello. Watch for a re-emergence of leotards, the basis
of Donna Karan's first collection, which should be back any minute.
Watch, too, for trends that won't be revived, like the huge
shoulders of the mid-'80s. They didn't sell then, and guess what?
They're not going to sell now. Simply not flattering.
</P>
<P>
   Are we ready for the fedora with our suits as Michael Kors
showed for fall 2000? Perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s beauty _ think ``Charlie's Angels,'' the first time
around, or Cher _ was created with lots of makeup and expressed
with complicated hairstyles, in keeping with that era of excess.
But it's not for today, when the extravagance is toned down and the
look is soft, feminine and all of a piece. Today, the hairstyles
are back but in a way that doesn't cry out, ``Look at me.''
Straight hair used to be teased for height and sprayed so it
wouldn't droop. In fact, not one wisp blew in a breeze. Today's
hair has to move, unless it's in an up-do that's meant to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Headbands are back, but they're skinny, unobtrusive. In the '80s
they were wide.
</P>
<P>
   Skin today glows with foundation, but it doesn't go on like a
mask anymore. Eyes are smudged instead of lined. False eyelashes
are back but only a few wisps at a time. Less, as it turns out, is
much more. If practice makes perfect, we're ready to perform. With
the '80s behind us, let's let them begin anew.

`BIOGRAPHY' PROFILES SAM PHILLIPS OF SUN RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY PACE   
 TimesDaily, Florence, Ala.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Ala. _ The man who discovered Elvis Presley will be
the subject of a two-hour documentary that premieres June 18 on the
Arts &AMP; Entertainment cable network's ``Biography'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock 'n' Roll'' will look
at the life and influential career of the 77-year-old founder of
Memphis' Sun Records, which propelled to stardom not only Presley,
but Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash and other rockabilly artists of
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it, and they've done a great job with it,'' said
Phillips, a Florence native.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary marks the first time Phillips has participated
in a film devoted to his life _ including his pioneering work in
both radio and the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sound is the greatest gift God ever gave to mankind,''
Phillips said. ``Music has brought more people together than any
other force on this earth, and radio remains the greatest tool we
have for communication. I've never been out of radio since the day
I started.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Man Who Invented Rock 'n' Roll'' was written by Peter
Guralnick, a popular music historian whose works include include
``Sweet Soul Music'' and the two-volume Elvis Presley biography,
``Last Train to Memphis'' and ``Careless Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam is one of the American masters, and his story demands to
be told,'' Guralnick said. ``We live in a culture that prizes the
country-club accent sometimes over the colloquial and chooses not
to recognize some of our most precious possessions. Because Sam
wrote his story in a colloquial voice, it has not been recognized
to the degree that it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary is narrated by Billy Bob Thornton, the
Oscar-winning writer, director and star of ``Sling Blade.''
Interview subjects include Lewis, Ike Turner, Jerry Wexler, Rufus
Thomas, Little Milton, Rosco Gordon, Scotty Moore, George Klein,
John Prine, Marty Stuart and Phillips' wife and sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the sense that if Sam were to try again today, he
could find amazing artists who have something different that nobody
else could find,'' said Morgan Neville, who produced the program.
``It's his way of looking at the picture, and nobody else sees it
that way _ but it's completely inspirational.''

 &HT;    PIPELINE OWNERS FINED $3 MILLION FOR SPILL THAT KILLED THREE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal Office of Pipeline Safety announced
Friday it would levy a $3.05 million fine against the owner of a
gasoline pipeline that exploded last year, killing two boys and a
young man near Seattle, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, roughly equal to the combined amount of all previous
fines levied by the agency during the past decade, will be charged
to Olympic Pipeline, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm operates a pipeline that ruptured in the town of
Bellingham, Wash., last June 10, and dumped more than 280,000
gallons of gasoline into a creek running through a park.
</P>
<P>
   Two 11-year-old boys and an 18-year-old youth were killed when
the gasoline exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said Olympic had failed to properly train employees,
continued to operate the pipeline after discovering safety problems
and had failed to properly operate and maintain the line.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Olympic said the company would have no comment
until it had studied the fine. The company can oppose the fine if
it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency and
the Justice Department announced that a former service station
operator would be fined $4.7 million for a 10,000-gallon gasoline
leak.
</P>
<P>
   The gasoline had been left in underground storage tanks after
the station went out of business. Its former owner was Oliver Hill,
against whom the fine was levied. He could not be reached for
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The three deaths in Bellingham energized a national pipeline
reform movement and brought the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS)
under fire for allegedly failing to vigorously police owners of
more than a million miles of pipeline criss-crossing the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases like this, where a pipeline operator fails to take
appropriate actions to improve safety, we will penalize the company
to the fullest extent possible to ensure full compliance with
federal safety laws,'' said Kelley Coyner, head of the Department
of Transportation's Research and Special Programs Administration,
which includes the Office of Pipeline Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of OPS reacted cautiously to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly a step in the right direction,'' said Robert
Rackleff, a Leon County, Fla., county commissioner who is president
of the National Pipeline Reform Coalition. ``The death of three
people in Bellingham last June should have been a clarion call for
OPS to thoroughly review that standards for construction and
operation of pipelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Lois Epstein, an engineer with Environmental Defense,(cq) an
environmental group, declared that the ``action, while welcome, is
simply not enough to prevent future tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline coalition backs legislation increasing the role of
state governments in the enforcement of pipeline regulation and a
stiffer set of fines.

 &HT;    PIPELINE OWNERS FINED $3 MILLION FOR SPILL THAT KILLED THREE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal Office of Pipeline Safety announced
Friday it would levy a $3.05 million fine against the owner of a
gasoline pipeline that exploded last year, killing two boys and a
young man near Seattle, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, roughly equal to the combined amount of all previous
fines levied by the agency during the past decade, will be charged
to Olympic Pipeline, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm operates a pipeline that ruptured in the town of
Bellingham, Wash., last June 10, and dumped more than 280,000
gallons of gasoline into a creek running through a park.
</P>
<P>
   Two 11-year-old boys and an 18-year-old youth were killed when
the gasoline exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said Olympic had failed to properly train employees,
continued to operate the pipeline after discovering safety problems
and had failed to properly operate and maintain the line.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Olympic said the company would have no comment
until it had studied the fine. The company can oppose the fine if
it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency and
the Justice Department announced that a former service station
operator would be fined $4.7 million for a 10,000-gallon gasoline
leak.
</P>
<P>
   The gasoline had been left in underground storage tanks after
the station went out of business. Its former owner was Oliver Hill,
against whom the fine was levied. He could not be reached for
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The three deaths in Bellingham energized a national pipeline
reform movement and brought the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS)
under fire for allegedly failing to vigorously police owners of
more than a million miles of pipeline criss-crossing the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases like this, where a pipeline operator fails to take
appropriate actions to improve safety, we will penalize the company
to the fullest extent possible to ensure full compliance with
federal safety laws,'' said Kelley Coyner, head of the Department
of Transportation's Research and Special Programs Administration,
which includes the Office of Pipeline Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of OPS reacted cautiously to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly a step in the right direction,'' said Robert
Rackleff, a Leon County, Fla., county commissioner who is president
of the National Pipeline Reform Coalition. ``The death of three
people in Bellingham last June should have been a clarion call for
OPS to thoroughly review that standards for construction and
operation of pipelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Lois Epstein, an engineer with Environmental Defense,(cq) an
environmental group, declared that the ``action, while welcome, is
simply not enough to prevent future tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline coalition backs legislation increasing the role of
state governments in the enforcement of pipeline regulation and a
stiffer set of fines.

U.S. AND GERMANY FAIL TO AGREE ON COMPENSATION FOR NAZI LABORERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Five months after German industry and government agreed
to pay Holocaust survivors nearly $5 billion, the deal became
ensnarled here Friday in disagreements with the United States over
the companies' insistence on immunity from future lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, German and U.S. officials warned that the aging
population of Nazi-era slave laborers may have to wait until next
year before receiving any payments.
</P>
<P>
   After about 14 hours of talks on Thursday night and Friday
morning, U.S. and German negotiators failed to reach agreement and
gave up their hope that President Clinton would be able to sign the
final pact this weekend during his visit with European leaders in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and German negotiators said they were still confident of
reaching a final deal, and scheduled another round of talks in
Washington on June 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must agree on final arrangements by then,'' said Otto
Lambsdorff, a former German economics minister who is Germany's
lead negotiator on the issue. ``If we don't get the whole thing
going, then the million or so survivors will have to wait even
longer for the payments.''
</P>
<P>
   What has surprised many observers, including groups representing
Holocaust survivors, is that the dispute has erupted now over an
issue that appeared to have been settled last December.
</P>
<P>
   The main dispute is over German demands for ``legal closure,'' a
guarantee from the U.S. government that German companies will be
shielded from any future American lawsuits stemming from activities
during Hitler's Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Under the basic plan, German industry and the German government
will each contribute 5 billion marks to a new fund that will then
make payments to former slave laborers and several other categories
of Holocaust-era victims who have until now received little if any
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   But German corporations have always insisted on receiving
immunity from future lawsuits over such claims, a guarantee that
this fund will resolve all claims once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is crucial because a primary motive of the
corporations in agreeing to create the new fund was that they faced
an explosion of class-action lawsuits filed in U.S. courts on
behalf of millions of former laborers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, led by Deputy Secretary of State Stuart
Eizenstat, agree in principle, but point out that the U.S.
government does not have the power to forbid future lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the two sides appeared to have agreed on a
workable compromise: the U.S. government would file a strongly
worded legal brief that would be used to urge judges to reject any
future Holocaust claims on the grounds that they had been addressed
by the new fund.
</P>
<P>
   But German officials said Friday that the proposed U.S. brief is
not strong enough, because it rests largely on U.S. ``foreign
policy interests'' in rejecting future lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is only a political statement then there is a risk that
a judge five years from now will have lost the context of what
happened here,'' said Wolfgang Gibowski, a spokesman for German
industry. ``We need legal wording, to explain that there are not
only political reasons but legal reasons to dismiss the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters more difficult, Lambsdorff has only raised 2.4
billion of the 5 billion marks that has been pledged from German
corporations. Hundreds of smaller companies that did business
during the Nazi period are still resisting calls to join the fund,
and some companies are now threatening to withdraw their pledges if
they are not ensured legal immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff has harshly criticized the German corporate hold-outs
and recently accused them of using the issue of legal immunity as a
``lazy pretext'' for not contributing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Negotiators sat down at about 3 p.m. Thursday and worked until
1:30 Friday morning. They resumed again at 8:30 am Friday, but then
broke off talks three hours later, and Eizenstat flew back
empty-handed to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers say German political and corporate leaders have
invested too much effort to turn back now, and they are anxious to
avoid the potential expense and nightmarish publicity of
Holocaust-related trials, which could last for years.
</P>
<P>
   But Eizenstat said Friday that it is now ``much more uncertain''
than before that the aging victims will receive any money this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gideon Taylor, head of the Jewish Claims Conference in New York,
said Friday that he remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that both sides remember what is at stake here,
and I think they will,'' Taylor said in a telephone interview.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures will soar toward 100 degrees in southern Georgia
Saturday, fostered by a very warm ridge of high pressure several
thousand feet above the Southeast. The ridge will be part of an
expansive region of high pressure aloft that will span from the
torrid interior of Southern California to the sizzling Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Within this hot region, an island of diminished heat will lie
over Texas and Oklahoma, where an upper-level low, trapped within
the expansive warm ridge, will produce clouds, showers and
thunderstorms that will suppress temperatures. Rains spawned by the
trapped low will be locally heavy near the Red River Valley, where
rainfalls of 2 inches are possible in places.
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms will erupt over parts of the northern
Plains as a disturbance moves east across Montana. Meanwhile, heat
and humidity will break decisively in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FLORIDA DROUGHT
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of the drought in Florida crystallized on Thursday,
when the National Weather Service issued climatological statements
for May. At Tampa, rainfall for the month was a mere 0.02 inches,
the driest May since records began there in 1890. The cause of the
drought is a warm high-pressure system thousands of feet aloft that
has held steady over Florida for much of the spring. The tenacious
high has effectively prevented air rising above the ground from
reaching rarefied altitudes, thereby suppressing thunderstorms.

BITS OF CELTIC FLOOR LORE TO BE AUCTIONED OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boston Celtics are absent from the postseason for a fifth
consecutive year, but the best parts of their old hardcourt _ the
parquet that ranks with the yellow brick road in the annals of
fabled flooring _ are preparing for a final game.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, parquet equals history. Maybe even art. So the floor
on which Larry Bird's sneakers squeaked and Red Auerbach's cigar
ashes fell will receive its last hurrah at an online auction
starting Monday on sothebys.amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many opportunities like this,'' said Leila
Dunbar, a senior vice president and director of collectibles at
Sotheby's, the auction house. ``What other floor in basketball has
this kind of history?''
</P>
<P>
   The auction was timed to coincide with the National Basketball
Association playoffs and will end June 15.
</P>
<P>
   From 1946 to 1999, the Celtics played on no home floor but the
parquet _ crafted out of scraps of northern Tennessee red oak for
$11,000 _ at the Boston Arena, the Boston Garden and the
FleetCenter. The finale for the geriatric floor came on Dec. 22,
when the Celtics lost to Atlanta, 98-81, in front of some of its
legends.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 40 of the 264 panels that comprised the floor are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the 2-foot-by-2-foot panels are laid out together at a
10th floor gallery at Sotheby's East Side building to recreate
center court _ leprechaun logo included. Another 20 autographed and
framed panels are to be displayed on walls where Impressionist
paintings hanged two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unique because it looked like no other floor,'' said
Bill Russell, the center of the Celtic dynasty from 1956 to 1969.
``But what was most significant about the floor was that teams
found it distracting. And that was all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams searched for reasons for losing to Boston, like the Boston
Garden's dark and cold locker rooms or the floor's dribble-killing
dead spots. ``It was part of our legend for kicking everybody's
butts,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   The auctioneers are not identifying or charging more for the
dead spots. But they have priced the floor panels in order of their
significance, with most of the proceeds going to charity.
</P>
<P>
   So, the minimum acceptable bid for center court is $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   The spot where John Havlicek stole the ball in Game 7 of the
1965 Eastern Conference finals: $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The panel where Russell made a spectacular block in the 1957
finals against St. Louis: $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The spot from which Phoenix's Garfield Heard launched his
amazing shot in the second overtime of Game 5 of the 1976 finals:
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mann, sales director of Boston Parquet at the FleetCenter,
examined old video to identify the panels of Celtic lore: Bird's
theft of Isiah Thomas' inbounds pass during the 1987 Eastern
Conference finals; Kevin McHale's favored low-post area; and where
Bob Cousy cried when he bid farewell in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parquet helped me pinpoint them because of the
intersecting pattern of the floor,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-life of the Celtics' floor is an anomaly, like a
25-year-old cat. Most NBA floors endure for seven to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, the Utah Jazz's Delta Center floor was removed and
auctioned off by Collectors Universe One-of-a-Kind. Some of the
panels were acquired by Upper Deck, of Carlsbad, Calif., which used
them to produce a limited edition of collectibles to commemorate
the last shot of Michael Jordan's careerin the 1998 finals, which
gave the Chicago Bulls their eighth NBA championship. Thursday, on
eBay, the bid for one of the items was $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Upper Deck recently bought a home jersey worn by Joe DiMaggio in
1951, his final season, which failed to sell in April for the
minimum price set by the auction house Christie's. The pinstriped
top will be sliced into swatches and inserted as surprises in 2000
Upper Deck baseball card packs next month.
</P>
<P>
   Upper Deck has similarly diced a Jordan jersey and a Babe Ruth
bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' floor seems destined for a better, more intact
fate, especially for someone who can put center court in his or her
rec room. The 200-plus panels not consigned to sothebys.amazon.com
for the auction will be sold at retail at more modest prices, Mann
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, never one to linger over nostalgia, has a few framed
panels hanging on a wall at his home. ``Sometimes I just look at
them and laugh,'' he said.

 &HT;    GORE OUTLINES REFORMS TO MAKE ABSENT FATHERS MORE RESPONSIBLE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore on Friday proposed a second
wave of welfare reforms that would require absent fathers to take
more responsibility for their children.
</P>
<P>
   With one-third of American children currently living apart from
their fathers, many in poverty, ``we have a national obligation to
insist upon responsible fatherhood everywhere and from everyone,''
Gore said in a speech to the National Fatherhood Initiative, a
public interest group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fathers must take responsibility for the children they bring
into the world,'' Gore said as he outlined what he described as ``a
second generation'' of welfare reforms building on those signed
into law by President Clinton in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposed that fathers who owe child support be required to
pay up or go to work. ``We've been requiring that of the mothers _
let's require it of the fathers,'' he said. Those who are
unemployed could qualify for job training, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposed the creation of ``Parental Responsibility
Accounts'' as an incentive to get families off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, states could allow at least $50 of monthly child
support to go to families on welfare without affecting their
benefits. Additional amounts paid by fathers would go into a trust
fund, which the children would receive once the family is off
welfare. This would cost the government $2.3 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many fathers don't pay child support because they assume
the government can take care of their children for them,'' the vice
president said. ``That's wrong. Fathers have a responsibility to do
all they humanly can to lift their children off of welfare and out
of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposed that fatherhood programs include domestic
violence prevention classes and counseling, and that credit card
companies deny credit to parents who owe substantial amounts of
child support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deadbeat dads should pay what they owe to their children, or
they will leave home without it,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also suggested changes in tax laws to eliminate the
so-called ``marriage penalty,'' which results in some couples
paying a higher tax rate, and to expand the Earned Income Tax
Credit for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be a society that lifts up the institution of
marriage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has been active in the National Fatherhood Initiative
since 1994, told the 500 educators, religious leaders and activists
that a ``personal, passionate and unshakable commitment by
fathers'' is necessary to ``reinvigorate the values that give
America its meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the births of his own four children and the lessons
he learned from the ``quiet moments'' he spent with his father, Al
Gore Sr., whom he followed into the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he joked about the rigors of running for
president, but concluded that they are ``really nothing compared to
a 4 a.m. feeding.''

   NEW YORK _ ``Weird? Please! I don't even want to think about
it!'' Regis Philbin said in his dressing room at the ABC studios on
West 67th Street last week.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin was not referring to the immense, bizarre popularity of
his show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' He was rifling through
a rack of shirts and ties bearing his own name. ``Regis by Van
Heusen'' is a line whose label promises to capture ``the style and
essence of Regis Philbin, America's favorite television
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   What are the odds of a man in his mid-60s becoming a style icon
and reinvigorating an entire category of men's wear? Especially
when that man is Philbin? As he himself is the first to acknowledge
_ in his inevitably emphatic style _ ``it's really strange!''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Philbin will officially introduce the Regis collection
at Macy's Herald Square, where the monochromatic Regis shirts and
ties will be sold as matching sets in seven colors (from blue and
gray to aubergine and khaki) for $77.50. On June 18, Father's Day,
department stores will begin selling the collection nationwide, not
as sets but separately. By year-end, 19 ``Millionaire'' shades will
be available, with shirts at $39.50 to $50 and ties at $38 to $45.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the licensing deal was struck, Macy's and other
department stores were busy creating a craze, with displays asking
customers, ``Who Wants to Look Like a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Many American men, it seems. Mark Weber, the president of
Phillips-Van Heusen, which is paying Philbin for his name and his
look, projected sales of $50 million for the Regis line this year,
based on the orders received so far. At Saks Fifth Avenue, sales of
solid shirts and ties had dipped until the ``Millionaire'' show
took off last summer, said Dan McCampbell, a vice president and the
men's fashion director there. ``There has been a noticeable
resurgence,'' McCampbell said. ``And I think it's pretty fair to
attribute it at least in part to this show.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Michael Corleone in ``The Godfather: Part III,''
just when you thought ties were out, Philbin pulled them back in.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   As Brian Boyer, fashion director of the daily men's wear bible
DNR, said, ``We call it the Philbinization of neckwear.''
</P>
<P>
   The same man who used to wear banana-colored sports coats on
``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee'' is now as hip as Gucci, Prada
and Helmut Lang _ all of whom will be bringing back the suit and
tie this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin could not be more on trend. Don't think he doesn't know
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife took a second look at me!'' he said. ``And after 30
years, that ain't easy, to get that second look, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   He preens. He boasts. ``I walk into a restaurant now and meet
some old friends who aren't into the style yet,'' he said. And what
does he say to them? ```Hey, come on. Get with the `Millionaire'
look. You guys'll never make anything out of yourselves!''
</P>
<P>
   The Regis shirts and ties had just come in. They were mixed in
with the other labels on the rack in his dressing room: Hugo Boss,
Cerruti and Beau Brummel, the SoHo men's store that has been
outfitting him for 10 years. Philbin ran the fabric between his
thumb and forefingers like a tailor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not really much when you look at the choice here,'' he
said. ``Burgundy, black. Different shades of gray, different shades
of blues. And a green. The green is really a big deal. Green is
such a departure. You can wear it with gray!
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, there's one other wild card. The gold is pretty good, too.
It goes good with the gray and with the black. You can wear it with
almost anything and it pops right out. And that's what they want.
They want it to pop right out of the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In 27 countries, ``Millionaire'' hosts cloned from the British
original wear the same look. Michael Davies, the show's executive
producer, put the show on American television and changed nothing.
The set, the music and the host's dark, elegant, vaguely ominous
wardrobe are all part of the formula.
</P>
<P>
   The British-born Davies, 34, described it as the sort of look
worn by ``professional soccer players in Hello! magazine.'' A money
look. And he saw Philbin as being money enough to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that Regis is a very hip guy,'' said Davies,
who came to the United States 10 years ago. ``On `Letterman,'
college kids would always applaud him. There's a certain hipness
within his squareness that sort of works.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   He said that at first, his star reacted to his sartorial
makeover with ``raised eyebrows'' but that now ``he's embraced
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said of some male contestants on
``Millionaire.'' Most still tend to be tieless, and at least one
showed up for his date with destiny in overalls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many fashion experts agree that if anyone can get the
increasingly tie-resistant American male to dress at least as well
as a British soccer player on a club crawl, Philbin can. Jim Moore,
fashion director at GQ, said that his magazine has been advocating
classier attire for the last three years but that ``it takes
someone like Regis to really get it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They see Regis in it,'' he said, ``and it just endorses it.''
</P>
<P>
   Average guys out there may feel more comfortable taking their
fashion cues from television than from GQ. Knowing this, apparel
companies have taken advantage of the medium as a marketing tool
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Botany 500 label was sold to Men's Warehouse three years
ago. But its legacy lives on Nick at Nite and TV Land. Something
like 75 male television stars have worn the Botany label since its
heyday, the '60s, from Dick Van Dyke's skinny suits to the plaid
blazers favored by Mike Connors on ``Mannix.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Carson lent his name to a long line of clothing and
leisure wear during his career, often combining stripes and checks
that would have made a used car salesman blush. In the '80s, Don
Johnson imported Armani's Euro look _ peach T-shirts under
billowing white suits _ for a generation of men who probably had no
business trying it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dorn, who was the press agent for Botany 500 for 25 years,
said that Telly Savalas set off a craze for colored vests when he
started wearing them on ``Kojak.'' They were especially popular in
Europe, Dorn said, where ``suddenly, everyone wanted to look like
Kojak.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that Philbin is enjoying his own ``Who loves ya, baby?''
moment, he must deal with serious questions about
celebrity-licensed apparel. Questions like, Who makes this stuff?
And, Are they being paid a living wage? After his daytime co-host,
Kathie Lee Gifford, got into highly publicized trouble in this
area, the last thing Philbin needs is a sweatshop scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Weber, Phillips-Van Heusen's president, acknowledged that
``given the Kathie Lee situation, Regis is going to be watching us
very closely.'' Weber said one million shirts and as many ties will
be made, starting in factories in the United States, then abroad in
countries ``yet to be determined.''

<P>
   As a makeup artist applied flattering tones to Philbin's cheeks
and forehead, his dresser, a recent addition to his staff, selected
a navy Regis tie, a blue Hugo Boss shirt and a blue Canali suit.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Martin crooned, ``You're nobody till somebody loves you,''
on the stereo. Philbin always plays Dino _ it relaxes him. Being
arguably the biggest television star in the country is stressful.
And stress is Philbin's shtick. Even basking in glory as a style
icon, he has to complain about something. So he recounted an
argument he had with his producer, Davies. The issue was two
buttons versus three.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought in a beautiful blue suit,'' Philbin said, working
himself up into one of his rants. ``And it was nice fabric and
everything, and it was two-button.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Michael Davies,'' he said, doing a pretty good Cary Grant
impersonation, ``said: `No! This is a three-button show.' So I lost
my suit!''
</P>
<P>
   It's always something. As Bill Zehme, a writer who is now
collaborating on his second book with Philbin, said of his
cantankerous subject, ``He's always said he lived under a dark
cloud, so now he's got the wardrobe to match.''

RIGHTS GROUP CHALLENGES RUSSIA TO INVESTIGATE MASSACRE NEAR
GROZNY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ An international human rights group on Friday
challenged the Russian government to seek out and try the Russian
servicemen who entered a neighborhood near Grozny on Feb. 5 and
killed at least 60 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The atrocity is believed to be the worst of the latest Chechen
war.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that documents the massacre and the pillage that
followed, Human Rights Watch called on Russian authorities to
pursue a vigorous investigation into what happened in a Grozny
suburb, Noviye Aldi.
</P>
<P>
   Released on the eve of President Clinton's arrival in Moscow,
the report _ drawn from accounts by more than 35 eyewitnesses _
comes as a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin, who has made
repeated promises to pursue reports of war crimes during the
eight-month war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian government has not undertaken any serious
investigation of these horrendous crimes,'' said Holly Cartner,
executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human
Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure to address what amounts to war crimes in Aldi
directly contradicts Putin's statement on May 29 that `all
violations of the law in Chechnya will be stamped out in the most
severe fashion regardless of who committed them,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for two Russian officials in charge of various
investigations in Chechnya could not be reached for comment Friday.
Vladimir Kalamanov, named by Putin as the Kremlin's special envoy
for human rights, has said that his investigative team, which
includes two Europeans, have received corroborating evidence of
atrocities in Noviye Aldi as well as in Alkhan-Yurt and in the
Staropromyslovsky section of Grozny, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, only one known war crimes case has been put to a
Russian military court. That involves Col. Yuri Budanov, commander
of a tank regiment, who has been charged with raping and murdering
a Chechen woman.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch and Memorial, a Russian rights group, have
pressed Moscow to call in international, independent investigators,
arguing that Russian investigative teams are distrusted by local
people. Although both groups have compiled detailed eyewitness
accounts of alleged war crimes, no Russian official has contacted
them to see their evidence, according to Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reports of a massacre at Noviye Aldi began to trickle into the
overcrowded refugee camps in Ingushetia in mid-February. In an
interview with The New York Times published on Feb. 22, a woman,
who gave only her first name, Sapiyat, described how after several
days of round-the clock shelling by Russian forces the town fell
silent.
</P>
<P>
   `'``Suddenly, it became calm,'' she said. `'And the troops
started mopping up. We thought they would just check everyone's
passports. But it was a cleansing of everything alive. They killed
cattle, dogs, people _ children and old people.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Human Rights Watch report, the violence began
with the arrival of special police and ``contract soldiers,'' who
are older than regular army conscripts and more brutal and are
usually dressed in camouflage uniforms with hats or head scarves.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the soldiers spread through Aldi, they engaged in an orgy
of killing, arson and rape,'' the report said ``Human Rights Watch
has eyewitness testimony describing the murder of eight people; in
each case, the witnesses identified the killers as Russian contract
soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization confirmed the execution of 60 civilians, 52 men
and eight women, one 82 years old. A one-year-old infant was also
killed, according to Human Rights Watch. The report also recounts
second-hand testimony of a gang rape in which three women were
killed, while a fourth fled into hiding, devastated by shame.

FILLING THE INDOORS WITH SUMMERY SCENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All week, our old farmhouse in Maryland has been full of the
smell of mock oranges and fragrant roses drifting through the
kitchen window. The big double purple and white lilacs, which my
grandmother brought here shortly after she eloped at 16, filled the
house with their intoxicating scent weeks ago. Now, I am digging up
some of their suckers to make a new border along the old vegetable
patch.
</P>
<P>
   I'm devoting at least half of the old truck patch _ a rectangle
100 by 40 feet _ to cut flowers, growing them in long farmer rows,
alongside rows of pole beans and potatoes. The farmer in me revels
in the usefulness of these long, wide rows of plants, which can be
cut with abandon without worrying about bare stems in the border.
The more you cut many of these flowers, the more they bloom.
</P>
<P>
   This is also where I will put those mangy-looking tulips, now
that they have bloomed so heftily in the big pots by the kitchen
door and in the perennial garden. Lifting them makes room for
summer blooms, like the scabiosa and Russian sage I'm putting in
the pots, and all the oreganos, lavenders, salvias and you-name-its
I can't stop collecting.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I thought I'd give my bulbs a home for the summer
while they fattened up on all that food manufactured in the leaves.
But now I think I'll leave them right where they are, to bloom as
cut flowers next spring. And I'll add about 100 more, to have
plenty for cutting. Ridiculous as it sounds, this is the best time
to order bulbs for fall. The memory of the ones that worked is
still in your mind, and there are hefty discounts for orders placed
before July 1.
</P>
<P>
   I've ordered a lot of flamed Darwins, like Orange Bowl (red
petals licked with orange), Burning Heart (cream with blood red)
and Ad Rem (a huge red orange with gleaming gold edges), to name
only a few, and Princess Irene, the single early deep-orange tulip
with dark red, which is always sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Summer bulbs are also essential to a good workhorse cut-flower
garden. Giant Dutch irises _ I have Blue Ribbon, Purple Sensation
and White Perfection _ grow as high as 18 inches and are handsome
all by themselves in a tall vase. Spuria irises, which look like
butterflies, range in color from lemon yellow to burnt orange and
lilac blue.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not crazy about big gladioluses, but I like more delicate
types, like Gladiolus communis Byzantinus, the corn lily, which
blooms with the first roses and peonies. Acidanthera, from Africa,
is like gladiolus, but has spikes of white, four-inch fragrant
flowers with maroon throats. It has a three-foot stem and lasts
well in a vase. Gladiolus gandavensis, a French heirloom, is pale
yellow, with red in the center. The three-foot spikes bloom in June
and July.
</P>
<P>
   Oriental lilies also make terrific cut flowers, in moderation.
One is all you need to intoxicate the guests. I planted Casa Blanca
about six years ago, and the plants are spreading to the size of a
small hippopotamus.
</P>
<P>
   There's still time to plant seeds of annuals in the ground. I've
also ordered some flats through the catalogs, just to see how they
work. And I binge at my local nurseries, of course. I tell myself
it's for research, but it's really addiction.
</P>
<P>
   I have a lot of old-favorite annuals, like Firecracker zinnias
and the cut-and-come-again doubles you can find almost anywhere.
Also cleome, or spider flower, which has a globe-shape flower head,
full of delicate white, rose or purple petals and dangling
seedpods, which look more like cat whiskers than spider legs to me,
but anyway. Helen Campbell is a reliable bloomer and a prolific
self-seeder, but just deadhead, or snap off the flower heads, if
you're worried about its spreading elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmos is another workhorse, with tall billowy stems and
single-petal flowers, and the more you cut, the more will grow. It
now comes in many shades: orange, chocolate, pink-and-white
striped. But don't order the dwarf variety by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Lavatera, with satiny, cup-shape blooms in white or pink with
darker pink veining, is another flower that lasts well in a vase.
It's tricky getting it to germinate, so keep the soil moist, and
don't let the seedlings dry out. But once it gets going, it's tough
and drought-tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   Lisianthus, a prairie native that thrives in heat, has delicate
cup-shape flowers that range in color from white to deep purple.
</P>
<P>
   Campanula persicifolia, with its spikes of blue and white
cup-shape flowers, will rebloom when cut, and it also self-sows. So
does Verbena bonariensis, whose purplish-pink flowers bloom on airy
five-foot stems.
</P>
<P>
   I love my trusty perennials, like purple and white coneflowers,
blanketflowers, Shasta daisies, black-eyed Susans, monardas,
verbascums and all the yarrows, which now come in deep red and
orange yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Think of accents, too, like a bit of Blackie, the ebony-purple
sweet potato vine, Ipomoea batatas, or its chartreuse cousin,
Margarita. The delicate greenish-yellow blossoms of lady's mantle,
as well as flowering dill, will lend an edge of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget sunflowers, which are hogs in the garden, but the
finches love them. Just a few look gorgeous in a tall urn, and
their faces are eerily expressive. My favorites include Tithonia,
the orange Mexican sunflower; Velvet Queen, a dark burgundy with
charcoal-color disks; and Italian White, a six-footer with
chocolate centers banded with gold.
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying Penstemon eriantherus this year, a drought-tolerant
Midwestern species. It has dark-burgundy foliage on dark,
three-foot stems, with white or bluish flowers. You can never have
enough salvias, even if you have to plant them every year.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget Nicotiana alata, the white flowering tobacco, which
smells like jasmine. N. sylvestris is the jolly tall one, which
looks terrific in a vase. N. landsdorffii is the green bellflower
tobacco, but N. alata will make the guests swoon.

WADING THROUGH THE WATER CHOICES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
FOR USE AFTER JUNE 5, 2000 
By ANGELA LEMIRE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If only the cultural equivalent to the divining rod existed _
some surefire way to point consumers toward the best available
drinking water for their dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Go into any grocery store and there they all are: Spring water,
artesian water, well water, distilled water, ``drinking water''
bottled from a municipal source, water purified through reverse
osmosis or other filtration, sparkling water, mineral water,
sparkling mineral water, flavored mineral water and flavored
sparkling water, to name a few of roughly 30 types of drinking
water available commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Brands including Sparkletts have begun offering additive options
such as fluoride, while others offer ``purified water'' with
mineral additives such as magnesium sulfate, potassium chloride and
salt.
</P>
<P>
   Throw home water filtration systems into the mix and there's no
getting around it: Health-minded consumers now have to put more
time into thinking before drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Water, which makes up about 60 percent of the average healthy
human, aids such basic body functions as digestion, bringing oxygen
and nutrients to cells and regulating body temperature. According
to medical experts, people can survive weeks without food but only
days without water.
</P>
<P>
   Experts disagree about what consumers should look for in bottled
water. While some say consumers must become better informed about
the varying benefits of water types and the shortcomings of others,
others argue the more pressing concerns are bottling safety
standards, or fluoride as an additive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of misunderstanding (about drinking water) that's
out there is astounding, and actually appalling,'' said Stephen B.
Shaw, a Woodland Hills-based physician of Chinese medicine and
licensed acupuncturist for the last decade at Innovative Wellness
Systems. ``People are living longer, but we're not living better.
We're living sicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who produces a locally based cable television show, ``A
New Vision: Hollistic Health,'` ran a recent segment on how water
from the world's oldest, purest sources _ such as Fiji's artesian
wells and glacial waters frozen for thousands of years _ have the
greatest benefits to human health for their molecular, crystalline
properties known as ``structured water.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many alternative medicine practitioners, Shaw believes
years of built-up toxins from environmental influences can
contribute to a wide-range of diseases, from fatigue and arthritis
to cancer. Changes in diet and lifestyle _ as simple as switching
to better drinking water _ can help purge toxins from the body, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many patients tell me they drink lots of
water, but still feel dehydrated. You can be drinking lots of
water,'' said Shaw, ``but if it's the wrong kind, it doesn't
detoxify the body. And those toxins get stored in fatty tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavily processed water with additives and chemicals does not
pass easily through body cells to flush those microscopic toxins,
Shaw says.
</P>
<P>
   And he notes that although water purified through the
``cleaner'' processes of reverse osmosis and distillation are
nearly 100 percent free of chemicals and other impurities, those
waters lack natural minerals usually found in water.
</P>
<P>
   Reverse osmosis (RO) _ the only filtration system capable of
removing salt _ filters water one drop at a time, while
distillation vaporizes it to separate the impurities before
condensing water back into its liquid form.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Bottled water
</P>
<P>
   Bottling and safety standards are also important issues to
consumers, says nutritional expert Dr. Tung-Shan Chen, a professor
at California State University, Northridge. And people on
low-sodium diets should avoid water with high mineral content and
sodium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more talk now in the industry that these water
companies (retail bottlers) should be up to the same standards as
our local water companies,'' Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking water ``from a municipal source'' is one bottled
variety now commonly found on grocery shelves. Unlike household tap
water, this water has gone through some additional bottling
processes and hasn't traveled through miles of underground pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue municipal water is better than major brands because
it's bottled under stricter health and safety standards _ including
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) disclosure laws _ while
others question the simple point of paying for tap water.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the health-minded, Shaw strongly recommends buying
bottled water from the purest sources, such as high mountain ranges
far from urban areas, glacial waters and the deep artesian wells of
Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding content _ which can be ascertained from most labels _
he recommends water with minerals such as calcium, magnesium and
silica, and pH levels above 7.35 to better match human body
chemistry that is more alkaline than acidic.
</P>
<P>
   Of course those brands carry significantly higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   A 1.5-liter brand of Fiji water that meets Shaw's criteria for
excellence sells for about $1.35 at area grocery stores, while a
one-gallon jug of filtered drinking water can run from between 56
cents and 89 cents per gallon at most stores.
</P>
<P>
   The latest feature added to some bottled water is fluoride.
</P>
<P>
   That trend _ fueled by recent studies showing a resurgence of
tooth decay and other dental problems among children _ has begun
cropping up in areas like Los Angeles, where high numbers of
families tend to drink more bottled water than tap water, for taste
preference and other concerns over chemical treatments. Fluoride
tablets have also become available commercially.
</P>
<P>
   The additive has been present in about 50 percent of the
nation's municipal water supplies for decades to help fight tooth
decay. But recent focus on fluoride's topical dental benefits also
has renewed debate about disputed correlations between ingested
fluoride and long-term affects on health, including nervous system
illnesses and fluorosis, which prematurely weakens tooth enamel.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of fluoride in bottled water typically is displayed
prominently on labels, along with disclaimers that advise consumers
to consult physicians or dentists before using it as a dietary
supplement.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Filtering water
</P>
<P>
   To complicate personal drinking water preferences further,
consumers can filter their own tap water at home to a quality
comparable to most store-bought brands.
</P>
<P>
   Some home filtration experts swear by reverse osmosis (RO)
systems _ which can run several hundred dollars _ because they
remove everything including bacteria, toxins, and that tap water
taste _ to leave only pure water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for your health. It's purified water and it tastes
better,'' said Saiful Islam, who sells reverse osmosis systems for
Healthy Water &AMP; Ice of North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But other industry insiders argue reverse osmosis systems are
last-resort solutions for severe water quality issues.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Hammer, owner of the Westlake Village-based Water Mark for
the past 20 years, usually prescribes reverse osmosis only for
residents in parts of Orange and Ventura counties, and Oxnard and
Calabasas, where municipal water quality is more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer recommends filters of various sizes and prices according
to household needs. Granulated activated carbon filters typically
remove chlorine and lead from water, while carbon block filters
absorb additional impurities that include metals, chemicals,
parasites and e-coli _ as long as filters are changed regularly.
</P>
<P>
   For as little as $20, consumers can buy special devices that
filter tap water into serving pitchers from manufacturers like
Culligan, Brita or Pur. A direct filter attached to a single faucet
starts at around $30, while for less than $100 to several hundred
dollars, there are single or double-filtered systems that can serve
entire homes.
</P>
<P>
   When comparing RO and carbon block systems, Hammer notes that
carbon blocks are less costly to maintain and repair. RO systems
waste two gallons of water for every gallon filtered, while carbon
block systems filter continuously with regularly changed filters.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how consumers choose their drinking water, Shaw
emphasizes it's well worth the time to fully explore all options,
including home-delivery. ``People think water is water. But when
you start putting it under the microscope, you see the
difference.'' &QL;

&HT;     BUSH CAMP DENIES LINK BETWEEN CORPORATE DONATION, REGULATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PEGGY FIKAC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Do corporate campaign donations, coupled with
access to high-ranking state officials and favorable treatment of
regulations, add up to influence peddling?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not, said a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, state
health officials and a lawyer for Metabolife International, a
herbal dietary-supplement company whose contributions to Bush's
1998 re-election effort coincided with the company's attempts to
avoid stringent health regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that just about anything and everything related
to Texas and state government will be brought up in the context of
presidential politics, even when the governor has no involvement
whatsoever in the decision,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Scott
McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it is the battle over regulating the stimulant
ephedrine, which is used in weight-loss products and
energy-boosting supplements.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Time magazine article highlighted the issue, drawing a
connection between Bush's 1998 campaign and favorable treatment for
companies such as Metabolife, which were eager to fend off a
proposed prescription requirement for ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, there were meetings on proposed ephedrine
regulations among Bush-backed Health Commissioner William R.
``Reyn'' Archer III, other state health officials and makers of
products that contain ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, after taking public comments, the State Board of
Health approved regulations that fell short of requiring a
prescription. The rules, among other provisions, do require a
warning label on ephedrine products. Archer called them a first
step.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was sponsored by state Sen. Jeff Wentworth, a San
Antonio Republican and a lawyer who represented Metabolife
International. He donated $2,500 to Bush's gubernatorial campaign
in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said strongly there is no connection between those
two things, and that he donated money to Bush simply because he
supports him as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports of eight deaths in Texas and nearly
1,500 health problems associated with ephedrine products since late
1994, said state Department of Health spokesman Doug McBride.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives have said their products are safe if
used properly.

   Editors, managing editors, wire editors:
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times will publish a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race
still ignites political debates _ over Civil War flags, for
example, or police profiling. But the wider public discussion of
race relations seems muted by a full-employment economy and by a
sense, particularly among many whites, that the time of large
social remedies is past. Race relations are being defined less by
political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports
arenas, in pop culture, in churches and, especially, in the
workplace. These encounters _ relations in the most literal,
everyday sense _ make up this series of reports.
</P>
<P>
   The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a team of
Times reporters to capture some of the troubling issues that
Americans continue to face and some of the voices of ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
   These stories, two or three each week, are long, at 6,000 words
and up. They will move on the News Service wire the day before
publication and will carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. In
addition, the News Service will file an abridged version of each
story, approximately half the length of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief description of the first three articles.

   RACE-CHURCH (Decatur, Ga.) _ Nearly 50 years after the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. scolded Christians for making 11 a.m Sunday
the most segregated hour of the week, the Assembly of God
Tabernacle here is the rarest of religious institutions: a truly
integrated church in the heart of the South. And yet, the
Tabernacle is deeply conservative, socially and theologically. What
draws its members is the intensity of their Pentacostal faith,
which teaches that the Holy Spirit can move in the lives of all
believers, regardless of background. By Kevin Sack.

   RACE-IMMIGRANTS (Miami) _ Before they left Cuba for America in
1994 Joel Ruiz, who is black, and Achmed Valdes, who is white, were
the best of friends. Today, in Miami, the two men live only four
miles apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by
a far greater distance, one they say they never envisioned back in
Cuba. In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to
the white one, they have grown apart in the U.S. because of race.
For the first time, they inhabit a place where the color of their
skin defines the outlines of their lives _ where they live, the
friends they make, how they speak, what they wear, even what they
eat. By Mirta Ojito.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, June 7:
</P>
<P>
   RACE-MILITARY (Fort Knox, Ky.) _ On a chill December morning,
two soldiers _ one black, one white, both part of an institution
portrayed as a model of race relations _ stood only yards apart in
the middle of this sprawling base, each believing himself the
victim of racism; one because of an award, the other because of a
transfer. The Army is not supposed to harbor racial resentment
anymore. Its work force is integrated. The Army is one of the few
institutions in America in which blacks routinely boss around
whites, and supposedly no one gives it a second thought. But that
is an idealized image. The Pentagon has found that two-thirds of
its men and women had experienced a racially offensive encounter in
the previous 12 months. And those findings are more or less
mirrored here at Fort Knox. By Steven A. Holmes.

 CALGARY, Alberta: Air Canada.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Air Canada gouges the public, Collenette warned, the
government will consider at the end of next year whether to allow
American airlines to carry passengers between Canadian cities.
</P>
<P>
   In a boost for Canada 3000, the charter airline, the government
changed its rules in April to allow it to sell one-way and walkup
tickets. The company announced in mid-May that it would buy four
more jets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the merger legislation stipulates that if a
discounter in eastern Canada starts up by September, Air Canada
cannot start a discount airline until Oct. 1, 2001. Ken Rowe, a
Halifax, Nova Scotia, businessman, has said that in July he plans
to start CanJet, a discount carrier to be based in Hamilton or
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, Russell Payson, chairman of Skyservice
Airlines, announced that in November he would start a discount
airline aimed at business passengers, which would serve Canada's
eight largest cities and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But of the six discounters started in Canada in the last 20
years, only WestJet still flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``WestJet is only the first or second successful clone of the
Southwest business model,'' said Julius Maldutis, an analyst for
CIBC World Markets, an investment banking company that helped
WestJet go public.
</P>
<P>
   Following Southwest's no-frills model, WestJet offers one class
of seats, no meals, no frequent flyer program, no airport lounges
and no tickets _ only confirmation numbers. To cut costs, it uses
only one class of plane, the Boeing 737; hedges on fuel prices,
uses incentives to keep employees nonunionized, and encourages
ticket sales through the Internet, which now account for about 11
percent of tickets sold. Until the expansion east, almost all
WestJet flights were under one hour.
</P>
<P>
   Deferring to Canadians' sense of propriety, WestJet assigns
seats, a deviation from Southwest's free-for-all. In return,
passengers _ or ``guests,'' in WestJet-speak _ pay fares that
average 40 percent below Air Canada's. On a recent day, Air Canada
charged walkup travelers the equivalent of $372 (American) for the
40-minute hop from here to Edmonton, Alberta's capital. WestJet's
walkup fare was $209.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low fares, short haul, and focus on people,'' said Smith, who
formerly ran an Air Canada subsidiary, Air Ontario. Believing he is
not competing directly with Air Canada, he added: ``We are putting
new travelers in the skies, getting them out of their cars, off
their couches.''
</P>
<P>
   To lift the morale of WestJet's 1,100 employees, all workers,
after three months, participate in a company profit-sharing plan,
which produced $4 million American last year. In addition, 70
percent of employees take part in a stock purchase plan, in which
the company matches employee contributions up to 20 percent of
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The formula appears to be working. Capping four years of steady
growth, WestJet's revenue passenger miles, a key indicator, were up
54 percent for the first four months of this year. In April, 78
percent of seats were filled, compared with 71 percent in April
1999. Helping to create a niche for WestJet, the combined airline
controlled by Air Canada cut seats by 11 percent this spring _
slightly more than the total number of seats WestJet already
offers.
</P>
<P>
   WestJet consistently turns a profit, while Air Canada and
Canadian incurred losses in the first quarter. WestJet shares
closed Friday at $24 (Canadian), up 25 cents, on the Toronto
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``WestJet is tightly run, well managed, there are no flies on
those guys,'' said Harry Gow, a board member of the Canadian
Association of Airline Passengers, a consumer group. ``There are
not many complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Hamilton is a typical WestJet move. Roughly midway
between Toronto and Buffalo, N.Y., this airport has lower user fees
than Toronto's, but comparable access to the region's 7.5 million
people. With Air Canada talking about moving into Hamilton this
fall or next year, WestJet supporters do not seem concerned. With
about 70 employees per aircraft, half the ratio of Air Canada,
WestJet has operating costs that are about 40 percent lower. In
past price wars, the discount carrier usually made money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Canadian matched WestJet's ticket prices, they
doubled the market,'' Maldutis recalled of Canadian Airlines'
losing battle in Calgary. ``But at those prices, Canadian lost
money, and WestJet made money.''

NEWTON'S LAW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Embargoed until May 6, 2000) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's a nice, Cambridge-educated arthouse flower like Thandie
Newton doing in the fuel-injected commercial head-banger ``M:I-2''?
</P>
<P>
   Having a pretty good time, according to the usually lithe (now 5
months pregnant) British actress, and trying to inject a modicum of
humanity into the John Woo-directed, Tom Cruise adrenaline fest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Completely out of the blue, I got a call from my agent to meet
Tom and John at a hotel in London for `Mission: Impossible 2,' and
I just thought it was a fantastic idea,'' the 27-year-old Newton
says of the widely hyped sequel, whose debut gross of $$70.8
million over the Memorial Day weekend probably surpasses that of
all her previous films combined (if you don't count her first
Cruise collaboration, ``Interview With the Vampire,'' in which she
had a small role). ``The combination of John Woo's style and Tom
Cruise just seemed perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd known Tom for a few years and was completely in awe of
John, which made it really exciting,'' Newton adds, admitting that,
though no action-film fan, she finds the Hong Kong director's
hyper-aestheticized approach to violence and melodrama enchanting.
``They told me how they wanted the film to be more of a love story,
which sounded great to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In what passes for a narrative between ``M:I-2's'' action
explosions, Newton plays Nyah Hall, a master jewel thief recruited
by Cruise's superspy Ethan Hunt to help stop her former lover,
Dougray Scott's Sean Ambrose, from unleashing a deadly supervirus
in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, Hunt and Hall fall in love before he
places her in extreme physical and emotional jeopardy. While she
gets in on some of the action _ a little cliffhanging, a ridiculous
but nonetheless erotically turbo-charged car race down a curvy road
_ Newton's main assignment is to provide the abstract demolition
derby with something resembling heart and feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Not an easy commission in a production machine-tooled to
showcase its male star's (who was also one of its producers)
athletic derring-do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look a lot, you do a lot of homework to find a leading
lady for Tom,'' says Cruise's producing partner Paula Wagner.
``Thandie Newton is a phenomenal actress and we'd been watching her
work for quite a while. Interestingly enough, (Cruise's wife)
Nicole Kidman had worked with her in 'Flirting,' and was very
supportive of this idea. But we had been looking, and we wanted to
find somebody interesting who had depth and range and a certain
kind of sophistication, a sense of elegance and fun and that kind
of mysterious beauty that she has. We just fell in love with her.''
</P>
<P>
   One consideration that evidently remained unmentioned throughout
casting and production was race. Newton, whose mother is Zimbabwean
and whose father is English, is never once identified as a person
of African heritage in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Which she, with characteristic enthusiasm, approved of,
especially in light of a career that's been defined by
race-identified roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not important to the story; what's important are other
things about the person,'' she notes. ``Which is groundbreaking,
sure, because often the predominant factor seems to be color, when
there is so much more that is really intriguing about a person. You
don't really know anything by knowing someone's color; you know
nothing, in fact. So it's just the smart thing to do to think
beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, it looks good, too,'' she adds with a laugh. ``It's kind
of exotic and suggests a bigger world.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton, who trained to become a dancer before injuries
redirected her interests toward acting and her university subject,
anthropology, was 16 when she made her movie debut in ``Flirting''
as an African exchange student at an Australian boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to play American slaves, the famous Sally Hemings
among them, in ``Jefferson in Paris,'' ``The Journey of August
King'' and ``Vampire,'' and the demonic spirit of a slave's
murdered daughter in Oprah Winfrey's film adaptation of Toni
Morrison's ``Beloved.'' Last year, she was seen as an African
political refugee in Italy, who is reluctantly drawn into an
obsessive relationship with an English composer in Bernardo
Bertolucci's ``Besieged.''
</P>
<P>
   That performance, which Newton based to some degree on her
mother, now bears unfortunate real-life echoes. The current
socio-economic strife in Zimbabwe, which is leading to increased
political and ethnic violence as a crucial election approaches,
troubles Newton greatly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my family is there,'' she says. ``What you see in the news
tends to be the hot zones of unrest; all we've got is the phone,
and I get on there to make sure that my relatives aren't involved.
But it's a frightening time and it's hard to imagine it happening,
because it's such a beautiful part of the world. It was, up until
this, a place which was really something to be proud of. Not that
I'm not proud of Zimbabwe now, but I just feel terribly sorry for
the civilians who are caught up in the unrest. It had to happen at
some point, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The future holds more pleasant prospects at home in London.
Besides expecting their first child, Newton and her screenwriter
husband, Ol Parker, are looking forward to the release of a
suspense-comedy they worked on together called ``It Was an
Accident.'' They're also building a house, a process the symbol of
international film glamour says she revels in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really involved in all the aspects of building it,'' she
explains. ``I love to paint, I love carpentry, I love making
things. I'm the most unglamorous person ... If you come to my
house, you'll find me in a pair of overalls with a piece of wood in
one hand and sandpaper in the other. That's when I feel most
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, and we thought dangling from a teetering car over a steep,
rocky canyon was the most fun any actress could dream of having.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, that was terrifying,'' Newton says. ``I mean, it
was all safe, there were a few ropes tied to me to keep me from
tumbling all the way down. But I did have to fall out of the car
and hang there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they scheduled that whole thing for my last day of
shooting,'' she says with comically exaggerated indignation,
``which I thought was a bit tactless. I guess it was just in case
anything went wrong.''

   NEW YORK _ Even during the killing, it all seemed like a movie
to him.
</P>
<P>
   On a humid night in 1989, Ke Feng watched as the scenes unfolded
in the heart of Beijing: a tank smashing through a line of parked
buses in Tiananmen Square; a young woman dashing toward a row of
soldiers, then crumpling with a fatal shot to the head; a group of
chanting students falling silent as bullets ripped into them on the
Avenue of Eternal Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers were pouring out from the Museum of Revolutionary
History, from the Gate of Heavenly Peace,'' Ke said recently
between bites of bouillabaisse in a SoHo seafood restaurant. ``This
would be a great movie. I was thinking that at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   To those unfamiliar with Ke's history, his remarks might sound
like those of a callous observer. But the Shanghai-born filmmaker,
still boyish-looking at 31, was more than just a witness to the
Tiananmen Square massacre, the 11th anniversary of which is Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About a week before soldiers killed hundreds of students in the
early hours of June 4, 1989, Ke oversaw the construction of one of
the most enduring symbols of the movement, the 27-foot statue
called the Goddess of Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the unwanted attention of Chinese government
officials, Ke and the others responsible for the statue's
construction have gotten little notice. But Ke, now a graduate film
student at New York University, has begun filming interviews and
raising funds for a documentary to be called ``Making Goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing that is not widely appreciated about him
is that the Goddess of Democracy would never have been built if not
for him,'' said T.D. Allman, a journalist who met Ke while covering
the demonstrations for Vanity Fair magazine. ``For one moment, his
egomania and the moving fingertip of history coincided. To some
extent, he has been living in the aftermath of that event ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   In the almost 11 years since he fled to the United States, Ke
has focused much of his creative energies on film projects about
the massacre. Last year, he completed a 28-minute fiction film
called ``The Official Account,'' for which he won the Directors
Guild of America award for Best Asian-American Student Filmmaker.
The movie tells of a Chinese television news anchor who is forced
to choose between reporting or covering up the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Ke said the events of Tiananmen inspired him creatively in the
same way that the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and '70s
inspired filmmakers of the ``fifth generation'' movement like Zhang
Yimou, Chen Kaige and Tian Zhuangzhuang.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me that your life could be a movie,'' Ke
said, ``and that compelled a sense of mission in me.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Ke, a political science student, was graduating from
Fudan University in Shanghai when he heard about the demonstrations
in Beijing. Tens of thousands of students were calling for reform
of corrupt government practices. To spur protests in Shanghai, Ke
and several friends built an 8-foot Styrofoam version of the Statue
of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   After marching with it through Shanghai's main avenues, they
tried taking the statue to Beijing. But when soldiers stopped them
from boarding a train, Ke had to sneak on empty-handed. In Beijing,
he walked straight from the station to Tiananmen Square, where
thousands of students had camped out. He stumbled across a tent
housing protesters from the Central Academy of Art and Design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ke Feng came into the tent and talked with me about the
idea,'' said Bao Chao-Jun, an artist now studying computer
animation in Los Angeles. ``We knew it would be the best symbol for
democracy and freedom, if we built the statue there in Tiananmen
Square.''
</P>
<P>
   Bao rounded up about a dozen students from the sculpture
department of academy. Using a steel frame, Styrofoam and plaster
coating, they worked around the clock for three days. On May 29,
the statue was taken in four parts on tricycle carts to the square,
where students finished assembling it. Once standing, it faced the
mammoth portrait of Mao Zedong hanging to the north of the square.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted, Ke said he rested for several days in his
girlfriend's dormitory room. But on the night of June 3, Ke said he
and his girlfriend decided to camp out at the base of his
``creation'' to celebrate his 21st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, soldiers marched into the square and began firing
on the protesters. Ke said he and his girlfriend fled over stones
slick with blood. ``In the movies the people triumph, but there the
soldiers fired again,'' he said. ``It was the most killing I've
seen in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The government began tracking down many Tiananmen dissidents,
including those who built the statue. While some were being jailed,
Ke wrote to the University of California at Berkeley explaining his
role in the demonstrations. The school immediately admitted him to
a graduate program in Asian studies and mailed him an airplane
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Ke soon dropped out of that program and earned a master's degree
in political science at the University of Toronto. But filmmaking,
Ke said, held an irresistible allure, and he enrolled in the
graduate film program at New York University. He is expected to
graduate this year, having completed ``The Official Account'' for
his thesis film and begun planning ``Making Goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   That documentary, which is budgeted at $200,000, will take a
subjective, first-person point of view, Ke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my parents knew I was making this film, they would have a
heart attack,'' he said. ``They think I should tell different
stories. They think that in case nobody employs me in America, I
can make a film in China. I'm burning a bridge if I do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Allman, now a close friend of Ke's, said one of the young
filmmaker's greatest challenges was to move beyond the massacre as
his main source material.
</P>
<P>
   Ke has made a few attempts: a short film he completed recently
tells of a wedding photographer who falls in love with a
bride-to-be. And he is writing a screenplay involving a
Chinese-American tea merchant in 19th-century Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But Ke said he would never be able to purge the killings from
his memory, nor has he been able to forget his last sighting of the
Goddess of Democracy. As dawn broke on June 4, 1989, Ke climbed
atop a nearby billboard and gazed out over the square. Plumes of
smoke rose from burning buses and tanks. In the center of the
debris lay a crushed pile of styrofoam and plaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a bunch of kids at the time,'' Ke said. ``We didn't
know about consequences. I didn't intend to be a protagonist in the
story. But it ended up that I had a story with a beginning, middle
and end.''

Clinton paid tribute Friday to his own country's roots, casting the
United States as a product of European vision and drive. ``We've
always had our differences,'' Clinton said. ``But the simple fact
is, since Europe is an idea as much as a place, America also is a
part of Europe, bound by ties of family, history and values.''
Citing the New World explorations of Portuguese, Spanish, French,

(Eds: Fact box below; `tonight' refers to Mon., June 5.) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wendy Wasserstein's ``An American Daughter'' offers a pretty
insightful look at a major reason U.S. politics is in the doldrums
these days, why we've got a couple of earnest but hopelessly bland
candidates running for president, one a stuffed shirt and the other
an empty suit.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Wasserstein's story, based on her play, only concerns
the confirmation of a nominee for surgeon general. But in
satirically dissecting how one woman's life is undone by the media
rabidly and rudderlessly chasing the merest whiff of scandal,
without a trace of context or perspective, it comments cogently on
any number of recent penny-ante incidents blown up to apocalyptic
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Lahti stars as Lyssa Dent Hughes, descendent of
Ulysses S. Grant, daughter of a conservative Indiana senator
(Stanley Anderson), wife of a prominent sociologist (Tom Skerritt),
crackerjack doctor and nominee for surgeon general. When an oily TV
interviewer (Jay Thomas) distorts the particulars behind the fact
that Lyssa once evaded jury duty and takes a joking comment she
made about her mother out of context, it quickly becomes elevated
to the level of scandal _ she's perceived as elitist and arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   OK, in the real world, no doubt everyone would simply shrug or
say, ``Way to go,'' at the revelation that a nominee for public
service weaseled out of jury duty. But Wasserstein's exaggeration
smacks of satire, and it's certainly no odder than nannies or
marijuana or masturbation observations or cola-can jokes damaging
the reputations of public figures, not to mention Ken Starr's
quixotic efforts to bring down the Republic with a stained dress.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein also makes another cogent observation: that
politicians with a modicum of integrity and intelligence are
essentially doomed, that they have to, in essence, dumb themselves
down to a certain extent lest they not seem populist enough, that
an interesting life is a liability and blandness is rewarded.
That's how George W. Bush _ whom even David Letterman has divined
as, in his words, ``a colossal boob'' _ can appeal to the masses,
while a truly intelligent candidate _ which this current campaign,
alas, hasn't seen _ would simply sink from sight or be dismissed as
a stiff, even though the country could use smart people at the helm
rather than clods adept at kissing babies.
</P>
<P>
   The screenwriter also explores the ceaseless white noise of the
media and its pundits. Wasserstein's most inspired creation here is
the character of Quincy Quince (Blake Lindsley), a young and callow
Elizabeth Wurtzel-esque feminist writer who elevates her generation
and gender and vaguely debases those who came before her, without
ever having honestly bothered to try to understand them from a
historical or sociological perspective.
</P>
<P>
   That Quincy is quite obviously an idiot has no significance to
the news shows that book her to spout her drivel _ she's written a
book, she's telegenic, she's provocative for the sake of
provocation, and her words at least seem to make some sort of
sense. Wasserstein also shows how glib, ill-informed asides from
news anchors and yammering heads on a show like ``The View'' subtly
influence national debate, how the media's pack mentality forces
reporters to flog a dead issue just because other outlets are, how
it's a lot easier to discuss trivial stuff than to do a pertinent
exploration of issues actually facing the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the writer missteps by giving Quince and Lyssa's husband a
predictable, hackneyed and too-convenient affair, and some viewers
simply won't be able to buy that such a hullabaloo could result
over such a minor misstep. Nonetheless, the dialogue has snap and
bite, Lahti's great in the role, and it's refreshing, in a summer
of ``reality'' TV, to get a bracing dose of reality from a smart
piece of fiction. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``An American Daughter.'' &QL; 
What: Playwright Wendy Wasserstein's drama about a surgeon general
nominee's destruction via politics and the media. &QL; 
The stars: Christine Lahti, Tom Skerritt, Lynne Thigpen, Jay
Thomas. &QL; 
Where: Lifetime. &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. &QL;

By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our ghost selves, the ones that flicker and writhe like wobbly
TV screens, are strewn across the floors and walls of the Museum of
Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   Some whine. Some curse. Some shout, `Hey, you!' at startled
passersby. Some lie flattened and immobilized under chairs and
sofas. Some babble under their electronic ``breath'' in loopy
non-sequiturs, like Hollywood street people or alien abductees,
conversing with the secret voices that haunt their splintered
souls.
</P>
<P>
   Lumped together, these spooky little mannequins with
video-animated faces create an eerie din as you step gingerly
through MOCA's exhibition titled ``Introjection: Tony Oursler
Mid-Career Survey 1976-1999.'' The more you try to tune them out,
the more incessantly they penetrate your consciousness, like a
barking dog on a windless night.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Oursler has been tracking these voices and the mental
states they represent for most of his adult life, since his student
days at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia a
quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that time, he has explored many different ways of
capturing the rambling look and sound of the human mind in
conscious and unconscious action: in paintings, video performances,
elaborate multi-media installations and, most identifiably, in a
growing series of ``talking'' effigies with videotaped faces and
explosive, passive-aggressive personalities.
</P>
<P>
   These anxious Mini-Me's are surrogates, of course, for humanity.
Like old-fashioned ventriloquist's dummies, they give voice to the
pent-up anxieties of their flesh and blood masters, anxieties that
for Oursler signify the overwhelming impact of a mass-media culture
that suffuses and shapes our very being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Introjection,'' the psychological term in the exhibition's
title, refers to the way our personalities unconsciously absorb the
tics and traits of the people and the world around us. Oursler sees
the modern mind as a big sponge, indiscriminately soaking up
snatches of passing conversations, pop jingles and TV soap opera
plotlines, along with more toxic substances like government lies
and a host of free-floating, Hollywood-induced emotional
pathologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mind is always shifting soundtracks,'' says Oursler,
speaking by phone in friendly, low-key cadences from his New York
City studio. ``You might be listening to a song, thinking about a
conversation you had with a friend of yours, and also trying to
write a grocery list. The human mind is capable of all these
incredible kind of combination of things.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, we are what we watch and hear. And what we watch
and hear these days is as likely to control us as we _ our
channel-zapping illusions of omnipotence notwithstanding _ are
likely to control it.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, Oursler is still, to an extent, creating what he terms
``anti-Hollywood art,'' wedding serious intent with tongue-in-cheek
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that he's against the mediums of film and television,
per se. Rather, Oursler believes mainstream commercial
manifestations, i.e. studio movies and network television, have
barely scratched the surface potential of the moving image and its
narrative forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in my 20s, I felt very much that people missed the
point in terms of representing consciousness in the moving image,''
he says, ``that, in fact, they weren't even close,'' with the
conventional cinematic progression of ``close-up, medium-shot,
long-shot. That was just not it. And I was trying to think about
the way that I thought, personally, what people really did with
their eyes, how people saw, how they shifted between memory and
being present.'''
</P>
<P>
   Practically from the first time he picked up a video camera,
Oursler sensed a new way of accessing the surreal strangeness of
life in the TV age, of taking the ghost out of the boob tube and
the cineplex projector.
</P>
<P>
   If, 100 years ago, the motion picture camera became an instant
stand-in for the outward-looking human eye, Oursler believed
videotape _ fluid, intimate and ever-mutable _ had become a smeary
mirror of our messy internal condition.
</P>
<P>
   He also found that video's origins as an amateurish and
spontaneous form of image-making gave it an interactive quality
lacking in big-budget entertainment beamed to passive audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it (video) was a way of just getting into this space
that I'd been peering into for my entire life, but I had never been
able to imagine any access to,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in upstate Nyack, across the Hudson River from New York
City, Oursler grew up in a Roman Catholic family with long literary
and artistic roots. His paternal grandparents were authors and
screenwriters, a great-aunt taught art, and Oursler's father was a
former Reader's Digest editor.
</P>
<P>
   Attending Cal Arts happened serendipitously. Though he knew
almost nothing at the time about the newly minted arts school,
Oursler found its then-remote physical location to be a boon.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were the usual '70s collegiate distractions _ sex,
drugs, ``a lot of naked-by-the-pool'' _ the atmosphere at Cal Arts
was serious and experimental. The faculty included performance
artist Laurie Anderson and Conceptual art godfather John
Baldessari; composer John Cage was an artist-in-residence.
</P>
<P>
   Though Oursler now lives and works in New York, his years spent
in Los Angeles, the world's entertainment capital, clearly marked
his artistic growth. His work is both a critique of mass-culture
technologies and an attempt to go beyond them by fabricating a new
visual grammar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to understand the existing language,
because I think there's a lot of amazing, evolutionary things
happening, both visually, sonically, and having to do with language
and how they all kind of mix together,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since he first began making art, Oursler's public-access TV
aesthetic has evolved into something slicker, but no less funny or
troubling. Without losing its sense of spontaneous urgency, his
work has exchanged crude cardboard props and low-res imagery in
video installations like ``Son of Oil'' (1982) for sophisticated
multi- channel video, and experiments in newfangled digital
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its cutting-edge immediacy, Oursler's output evinces
his strong interest in, and working knowledge of, the moral and
conceptual issues that have obsessed and bedeviled Western art for
eons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Optics,'' a 1999 mixed-media installation with video
projection, utilizes an old-fashioned camera obscura, miniature
glass devils attached to various light sources (blacklight,
floodlight), and projections of a tiny human figure tumbling
through space to suggest the eternal struggle between light and
dark, good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   The chillingly beautiful installation ``Aperture'' (1998), also
in MOCA's show, arranges small, gray plaster statues (a skull, a
gargoyle, cupids, kissing lovers) in a hypnotic tableau of dead
icons. An LCD video projector, mounted on a tripod, casts the
flickering shape of a scurrying cockroach across this grotesque
``still life,'' symbolically resurrecting its zombified components.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a concoction likely to capture the top Nielsen rating
anytime soon. But it could hearten those who believe visual
techno-culture's best days still lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see (on commercial TV) is what you can expect from
something that has to communicate to like 10 million people at
once,'' Oursler summarizes. ``It has to be something that's fairly,
I wouldn't even say dumbed-down, but it's got to be within a
certain kind of niche. And that's not what art-making is all
about.''

<P>
   Our ghost selves, the ones that flicker and writhe like wobbly
TV screens, are strewn across the floors and walls of the Museum of
Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   Some whine. Some curse. Some shout, `Hey, you!' at startled
passersby. Some lie flattened and immobilized under chairs and
sofas. Some babble under their electronic ``breath'' in loopy
non-sequiturs, like Hollywood street people or alien abductees,
conversing with the secret voices that haunt their splintered
souls.
</P>
<P>
   Lumped together, these spooky little mannequins with
video-animated faces create an eerie din as you step gingerly
through MOCA's exhibition titled ``Introjection: Tony Oursler
Mid-Career Survey 1976-1999.'' The more you try to tune them out,
the more incessantly they penetrate your consciousness, like a
barking dog on a windless night.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Oursler has been tracking these voices and the mental
states they represent for most of his adult life, since his student
days at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia a
quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that time, he has explored many different ways of
capturing the rambling look and sound of the human mind in
conscious and unconscious action: in paintings, video performances,
elaborate multi-media installations and, most identifiably, in a
growing series of ``talking'' effigies with videotaped faces and
explosive, passive-aggressive personalities.
</P>
<P>
   These anxious Mini-Me's are surrogates, of course, for humanity.
Like old-fashioned ventriloquist's dummies, they give voice to the
pent-up anxieties of their flesh and blood masters, anxieties that
for Oursler signify the overwhelming impact of a mass-media culture
that suffuses and shapes our very being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Introjection,'' the psychological term in the exhibition's
title, refers to the way our personalities unconsciously absorb the
tics and traits of the people and the world around us. Oursler sees
the modern mind as a big sponge, indiscriminately soaking up
snatches of passing conversations, pop jingles and TV soap opera
plotlines, along with more toxic substances like government lies
and a host of free-floating, Hollywood-induced emotional
pathologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mind is always shifting soundtracks,'' says Oursler,
speaking by phone in friendly, low-key cadences from his New York
City studio. ``You might be listening to a song, thinking about a
conversation you had with a friend of yours, and also trying to
write a grocery list. The human mind is capable of all these
incredible kind of combination of things.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, we are what we watch and hear. And what we watch
and hear these days is as likely to control us as we _ our
channel-zapping illusions of omnipotence notwithstanding _ are
likely to control it.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, Oursler is still, to an extent, creating what he terms
``anti-Hollywood art,'' wedding serious intent with tongue-in-cheek
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that he's against the mediums of film and television,
per se. Rather, Oursler believes mainstream commercial
manifestations, i.e. studio movies and network television, have
barely scratched the surface potential of the moving image and its
narrative forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in my 20s, I felt very much that people missed the
point in terms of representing consciousness in the moving image,''
he says, ``that, in fact, they weren't even close,'' with the
conventional cinematic progression of ``close-up, medium-shot,
long-shot. That was just not it. And I was trying to think about
the way that I thought, personally, what people really did with
their eyes, how people saw, how they shifted between memory and
being present.'''
</P>
<P>
   Practically from the first time he picked up a video camera,
Oursler sensed a new way of accessing the surreal strangeness of
life in the TV age, of taking the ghost out of the boob tube and
the cineplex projector.
</P>
<P>
   If, 100 years ago, the motion picture camera became an instant
stand-in for the outward-looking human eye, Oursler believed
videotape _ fluid, intimate and ever-mutable _ had become a smeary
mirror of our messy internal condition.
</P>
<P>
   He also found that video's origins as an amateurish and
spontaneous form of image-making gave it an interactive quality
lacking in big-budget entertainment beamed to passive audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it (video) was a way of just getting into this space
that I'd been peering into for my entire life, but I had never been
able to imagine any access to,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in upstate Nyack, across the Hudson River from New York
City, Oursler grew up in a Roman Catholic family with long literary
and artistic roots. His paternal grandparents were authors and
screenwriters, a great-aunt taught art, and Oursler's father was a
former Reader's Digest editor.
</P>
<P>
   Attending Cal Arts happened serendipitously. Though he knew
almost nothing at the time about the newly minted arts school,
Oursler found its then-remote physical location to be a boon.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were the usual '70s collegiate distractions _ sex,
drugs, ``a lot of naked-by-the-pool'' _ the atmosphere at Cal Arts
was serious and experimental. The faculty included performance
artist Laurie Anderson and Conceptual art godfather John
Baldessari; composer John Cage was an artist-in-residence.
</P>
<P>
   Though Oursler now lives and works in New York, his years spent
in Los Angeles, the world's entertainment capital, clearly marked
his artistic growth. His work is both a critique of mass-culture
technologies and an attempt to go beyond them by fabricating a new
visual grammar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to understand the existing language,
because I think there's a lot of amazing, evolutionary things
happening, both visually, sonically, and having to do with language
and how they all kind of mix together,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since he first began making art, Oursler's public-access TV
aesthetic has evolved into something slicker, but no less funny or
troubling. Without losing its sense of spontaneous urgency, his
work has exchanged crude cardboard props and low-res imagery in
video installations like ``Son of Oil'' (1982) for sophisticated
multi- channel video, and experiments in newfangled digital
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its cutting-edge immediacy, Oursler's output evinces
his strong interest in, and working knowledge of, the moral and
conceptual issues that have obsessed and bedeviled Western art for
eons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Optics,'' a 1999 mixed-media installation with video
projection, utilizes an old-fashioned camera obscura, miniature
glass devils attached to various light sources (blacklight,
floodlight), and projections of a tiny human figure tumbling
through space to suggest the eternal struggle between light and
dark, good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   The chillingly beautiful installation ``Aperture'' (1998), also
in MOCA's show, arranges small, gray plaster statues (a skull, a
gargoyle, cupids, kissing lovers) in a hypnotic tableau of dead
icons. An LCD video projector, mounted on a tripod, casts the
flickering shape of a scurrying cockroach across this grotesque
``still life,'' symbolically resurrecting its zombified components.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a concoction likely to capture the top Nielsen rating
anytime soon. But it could hearten those who believe visual
techno-culture's best days still lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see (on commercial TV) is what you can expect from
something that has to communicate to like 10 million people at
once,'' Oursler summarizes. ``It has to be something that's fairly,
I wouldn't even say dumbed-down, but it's got to be within a
certain kind of niche. And that's not what art-making is all
about.''

 &HT;    Nurse aides shortage has hospitals taking action
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ They don't have licenses or shiny white smocks or
half the alphabet after their names, but nurse aides are the people
who take care of the infirm and incapacitated. They work in
hospitals, nursing homes and private bedrooms. They help bathe,
dress and feed the patients. They comb their hair, help them out of
bed and take them for walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do the hands-on care, help with all the activities of
daily living,'' said Debra Meador, who coordinates the nurse aide
training program at Miami-Jacobs College. And there aren't nearly
enough of them to go around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a crisis right now,'' she said. ``We've been hearing
from everyone who uses nurse aides, and they all need help.''
</P>
<P>
   The health care system has critical shortages in many
occupations. Hospitals are offering skilled nurses a few thousand
dollars in bonuses to take new jobs or keep their old ones. But the
budgets for nurse aides are such that employers can do little to
lure them than suggest how working with sick people is more
rewarding than asking hungry people if they'd also like fries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to not only address them as aides, but also as key
members of our health care team,'' said Meador, whose 76-hour
training program graduates about 600 nurse aides a year. In order
to do that, she has brought together several forums this year to
exchange ideas among those who hire nurse aides and those who train
them.
</P>
<P>
   The forums so impressed the Ohio Department of Health that
Meador will be a keynote speaker this month at a conference in
Columbus. Health department officials aren't aware of any other
cities taking this sort of initiative to increase the supply of
nursing assistants, she said, ``and they want to encourage
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Jacobs also is holding a hospitality day Monday for people
to learn about what nurse aides do. ``It's for people who have
thought about becoming an aide or are thinking about going into
nursing or any other health care field,'' Meador said. ``They can
start as an aide to make sure health care is what they want to do.
It's just a two-week class.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is the inevitable result of separate influences
both increasing the demand for nursing assistants and reducing
their supply. Medicare and managed care plans are shifting patients
from hospitals toward nursing homes and home health care, areas
that use more nurse aides. Pending legislation and regulations
would require still greater ratios of nurse aides to patients. But
at the same time, a full economy gives lower-paid workers more job
options.
</P>
<P>
   Other jobs start looking good to a nurse aide on a short-handed
staff, Meador said. ``They're being pushed to the maximum. We burn
them out. They're overworked and they feel underpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the forum have attacked problems varying from
morale and training to such logistical details as finding
transportation and child care for an overnight shift. They've
talked a lot about ``encouraging and developing the nurse aide as a
person,'' Meador said. Add the right training and mentoring, she
said, and the job takes on the appeal of a career stepping stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a special being to go into health care,'' Meador
said, so the least the system can do is recognize the value of
nursing assistants. ``They're the key caregivers. We have to have
them.''

AS PEACE MOVES CLOSER, FOUR MOTHERS' WORK MAY BE DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In 1997, two Israeli army helicopters collided on
the way to Lebanon, killing 73 soldiers as they crashed in the
front yard of the school that Rachel Ben Dor's children attended.
At the time, Ben Dor's oldest son was a soldier in Lebanon, and
several of his former classmates, recent graduates like him, died.
</P>
<P>
   That pushed Ben Dor, an opponent of what she saw as Israel's
senseless involvement in Lebanon, over the edge. Summoning three
friends to her kitchen in a northern kibbutz, she hatched a group
eventually called The Four Mothers _ Leave Lebanon in Peace.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the military and political establishment dismissed
them as overly emotional and ignorant of security concerns. But
later, after they spawned a significant anti-war movement, they
were derided on a baser level. An army commander crudely insulted
them using a slur for women earlier this year, but in a signal of
how the tide had turned, he was pressured to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Four Mothers met with Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
who last week completed the unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon that
they had pushed for.
</P>
<P>
   The women once called traitors were embraced by the nation's
most decorated former general, and the whole issue came full
circle, dizzyingly for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There we were inside the Defense Ministry that we used to
picket, kissing and hugging with the prime minister and the army
chief,'' Ben Dor, 42, said. ``And all the generals were standing
there, thinking I don't know what. It was so amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis celebrated the Four Mothers this week. The
Jerusalem Post on Friday called them ``one of the most successful
grassroots movements in Israeli history.'' The women took a classic
Israeli stereotype _ the silent, suffering soldier's mother _ stood
it on its head and dared to challenge the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, it was so shocking to the Israeli public
that it was mothers who were demanding answers from the
government,'' said Linda Ben Zvi, a leading member but not one of
the original four. ``Mothers were supposed to make the schnitzel
and hand-wash the uniforms and play the passive role in-bred in
Israeli society.''
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1980s, large anti-war rallies challenged
Israel's invasion of Lebanon. But then the country fell largely
silent for more than a decade. Israel's occupation of a what it
called a ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon, with its annual
death toll of 25 to 35 Israeli soldiers, became a reality that
seemed immutable. The helicopter crash sent a spasm of doubt
through the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a sign from the skies, telling us the whole thing
had to be stopped,'' said Ben Dor, a teacher and mother of three
sons. ``For many, many nights afterward, people who had sons in the
army didn't sleep. They were waiting for the devil to come knocking
at their door.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Israel, we are all the time thinking that the army knows
what it is doing, and sometimes we have to think twice,'' she
continued. ``Someone should say this is crazy, I decided. It was
crazy to educate our children to be decent and then at 18 send them
places to kill the other people. We should send our children to die
because our leaders can't solve our problems by talking?
</P>
<P>
   ``And on a more specific level, the army's plan wasn't working.
If they were in Lebanon to protect northern Israel, why were the
Katyusha rockets falling on us?''
</P>
<P>
   The women began with small street protests at intersections.
They wrote letters to lawmakers. They organized debates at northern
kibbutzim.
</P>
<P>
   After the first story about them appeared on national
television, they received calls from all over the country. Working
women all, they found themselves at the vanguard of a movement,
without any organization, time or money. And they knew that what
they were doing would take all that plus endurance.
</P>
<P>
   It also took its toll on their families. One mother quit when
her soldier son demanded it. Ben Zvi had a hard time figuring out
how to react when her son, Or, won a medal for fighting in Lebanon.
He asked her if she was proud. And with difficulty she told him he
was, because ``his reality was the war'' and she had raised him to
excel at whatever he did.
</P>
<P>
   On talk shows, the mothers were placed opposite generals who
patted them on the shoulders and rolled their eyes when they spoke.
``It was a tremendous miscalculation,'' Ben Zvi, a professor, said.
Eventually, the military understood that the women were shaping
national opinion, and began to attack them as bad for the morale of
the soldiers and the country.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late; the Israeli news media loved the mothers,
and the public appreciated the way that they memorialized every
soldier who died.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the shift in public sentiment, the three leading
candidates for prime minister in the last election promised to
bring the boys home from Lebanon. Barak, who took office last July,
made it a pledge with a date: by July 7, 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in imitation of a military custom, Ben Dor pinned a
medal on Barak's chest _ with force. It was a Four Mothers button.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers, who will meet on Saturday to vote on whether to put
themselves out of business as an organization, do not need them
anymore.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ In the strongest signal yet that the
booming U.S. economy is finally slowing, the Labor Department
reported Friday that the nation's private sector employers, instead
of hiring, shed 116,000 jobs in May, the largest drop in more than
eight years and the first since the economy began to boom in the
mid 1990s. The stock market immediately celebrated. By Louis
Uchitelle.

   RUSSIA-DEFENSE (Moscow) _ In a bid to recast the debate over
missile defense just before his summit meeting with President
Clinton, Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested an
alternative to the proposed American defense against missile attack
by nations like North Korea. Putin hinted that the United States
and Russian could collaborate on new ways to shoot down enemy
missiles soon after they were launched. By Michael R. Gordon.

   INDONESIA-DEMOCRACY (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Everything has
changed in Indonesia since its strongman, Suharto, was pushed from
office just two years ago. The clamor of democracy is everywhere,
along with the violence and instability that accompany a time of
unfettered transformation. And nothing has changed. Indonesia is
still focused on the ideas, the directives _ even the whims _ of

   SOUTH-SUBURBS (Smyrna, Ga.) _ In state after state, a platform
of conservative social issues that once monopolized the
conversation of Southern suburbs _ lower taxes, welfare reform,
crackdowns on crime _ has been supplanted by a new agenda: managing
growth and transportation, bringing in high-tech jobs, and above
all improving public education. In a swath of states from the
Carolinas to Mississippi, Democratic governors have made these
issues their own, and Republicans are struggling to keep up. By

EX-WIFE SAYS `PERFECT STORM' IS PAINFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ALAN BARTON   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ Jodi Tyne says a television commercial for an
upcoming George Clooney movie resurrects painful memories for her
and her daughters of her ex-husband's death at sea. She is furious
with how Clooney is depicting the former Cortez fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers may marvel at the special effects mastery in the
promotional snippet for ``The Perfect Storm,'' which shows 10-story
waves battering a fishing boat captained by Clooney's character as
crew members are swallowed by a raging ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But Jodi Tyne, the ex-wife of Billy Tyne, the man Clooney
portrays, says the movie is putting her and her two college-age
daughters through a second round of painful mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you like it if every time you turn on the TV you see
your father dying during the commercials?'' Tyne said. ``It's been
10 years, and thanks to this movie, I can't put him to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Brothers film, due out June 30, is based on the
October 1991 sinking of the Andrea Gail swordfishing boat. The
six-man crew included three men from Manatee County in southwest
Florida: boat captain Billy Tyne and deck hands Dale ``Murph''
Murphy and Michael ``Bugsy'' Moran. All three are portrayed in
``The Perfect Storm.'' The movie is based on author Sebastian
Junger's best-selling 1997 book with the same title.
</P>
<P>
   Junger used facts about the fateful journey of the ship, which
sailed from Gloucester, Mass., and sank near Nova Scotia. But
because there were no survivors, Junger had to speculate about what
happened on the Andrea Gail in the final days before the 70-foot
boat was sunk by Hurricane Grace.
</P>
<P>
   According to Junger's narrative, Tyne put his crew's lives at
risk, in part because his catch might have spoiled if he had
waited, by heading through the approaching hurricane, which had
dangerously collided with two other storms.
</P>
<P>
   Jodi Tyne disagrees with that depiction of her ex-husband and
resents that millions of moviegoers will think of him that way. She
has hired an attorney who is talking with the movie studio about
why she wasn't asked if her ex-husband's name could be used in what
is likely to be a summer blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   The book is ``half fantasy, speculating on what happened at
sea,'' and is an inaccurate source for the movie, says Jodi Tyne's
attorney, Ned McLeod.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, working on an article about the Sierra Leone civil war
for ``Vanity Fair,'' could not be reached for comment. His New York
City agent, Stuart Krichevsky, said Junger quoted Jodi Tyne in the
book and wrote it ``with dignity and respect'' toward the family
members of the drowned men.
</P>
<P>
   Junger didn't need the families' permission to use the names in
his book, which is presented as a journalistic account of a
historical event, McLeod said. But McLeod insists that the movie
studio should have come to an agreement with the families about
using the dead men's real names in the movie, which is presented as
a theatrical entertainment, McLeod said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Warner Brothers executives reached in Burbank, Calif.,
on Wednesday, said they would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   A studio executive who asked that his name not be used said
Warner Brothers' lawyers have met with Jodi Tyne's attorney. The
studio has agreed to give the Tyne family an early screening of the
film but has not come to any understanding with the family about
rights to the movie. Billy and Jodi Tyne were divorced in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod said the film studio could face a lawsuit from the Tyne
family if the film copies Junger's portrayal of the fishermen as
heavy drinkers who do nothing but party when ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the book was so far off,'' said Karen Bell, who
runs A.P. Bell Fish Co. in Cortez. ``They worked hard and they
partied hard. That's the way it is.'' Billy Tyne, 37, was a
successful and well-respected fisherman when he captained one of
Bell's boats. Murphy, 30, and Moran, 36, also ran boats from her
docks. The three men had three decades of combined experience in
commercial fishing.

COASTAL STATE BONANZA MUST NAVIGATE TRICKY SENATE CURRENTS 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers) &HT;    
 By CARL HULSE  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _ A generous
<TEXT>
conservation measure that would funnel millions of dollars to
Southern states for environmental projects faces its first test
this month in the Senate, where it could receive a cooler reception
than in the House.
<P>
   Western senators are leery of anything that looks like a federal
land grab and individual lawmakers have a much greater capacity to
stall legislation in the upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not optimistic,'' worried one Florida House member, who
would like to see the measure pass, giving his state its $141
million share.
</P>
<P>
   But backers of the bill, busily preparing for a June 14 vote by
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, believe the
Conservation and Reinvestment Act has a good chance of passing this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are further along than we have ever been,'' said a
legislative strategist for Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., chief sponsor
of the measure. ``Members are coming up to her with ideas or
opinions. The question is whether we can reach an agreement that
can make everybody happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the fierce objections of property rights advocates, the $3
billion measure breezed through the House last month, swept along
by the dollars it would steer to oil-producing states and their
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana was a big winner, getting a $300 million annual cut,
while Texas came in at $237 million. Mississippi and Alabama fared
well, receiving $78 million and $53 million respectively, while
North Carolina was allocated $46 million and South Carolina $26
million. Every state gets something.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has a few other things going for it in the Senate.
Republican lawmakers would like to have some environmental success
to tout during the fall campaign season and this bill may be their
best bet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi is
a backer though he is not likely to force it through over
substantial GOP opposition. And Alaska, the home state of Energy
Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, would get $167 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to work out a deal, supporters of the measure
are looking for conservative House members who backed the measure _
GOP Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana comes to mind _ to ease the
concerns of Senate property rights warriors.
</P>
<P>
   AMBULANCE CHASING
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt believes he has found another way
residents of small-town America are at a disadvantage as compared
to their more urban counterparts when it comes to health care.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican lawmaker introduced a measure that would allow
Medicare to pay for a patient's ambulance ride from an accident or
their home to an ambulatory care center. While trips to hospitals
or emergency rooms are covered, transportation to the newer
outpatient clinics are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many rural residents live a long distance from a hospital but
have access to a local ambulatory medical center,'' said Aderholt.
``This bill would mean quicker treatment to those in a medical
emergency. This bill could save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   HOWLING AT THE MOON
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Democratic members of the Blue Dog coalition have
sniffed around and found an element of campaign finance reform they
can support.
</P>
<P>
   The group that counts a large number of Southern lawmakers as
members is backing a measure that would require so-called stealth
political organizations to fully disclose the source of their
money.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively new development, the groups from across the
political spectrum exploit a tax loophole that allows them to
anonymously run campaign attack ads. They have sprung up already in
the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``With millions of dollars involved, citizens deserve to know
who is attempting to sway their opinions and at what price,'' said
Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, a leader of the Blue Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook is bleak for enacting even small campaign
reforms prior to the November election.
</P>
<P>
   COVERT ACTIVITY
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Connie Mack and Bob Graham get all the attention when it
comes to Florida politicians mentioned as candidates for jobs in
the next administration. But it is another lesser known congressman
from the state who might actually end up serving under a new
president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, the Republican chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee, is rated a top prospect for director of the
CIA or another national security post if Gov. George W. Bush is
elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   Goss, who has been intimately involved the past few years in
crafting new intelligence policy, concedes he would relish the
opportunity to play a role in putting theory into practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly like to be able to jump over to the
executive branch in one capacity or another to make sure we are
getting the applications we designed,'' said Goss, himself a former
CIA officer.

SUMMER ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; `tonight' refers to Tues., June 6.) 
FOR USE ON OR AFTER JUNE 6,2000. 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early on in tonight's episode of ``M.Y.O.B.,'' Riley, the lead
character/narrator, a feisty teen-ager played by Katharine Towne,
decries her fate at getting stuck on NBC: ``I would've preferred
cable, but, !ital!whatever.'' One sympathizes with her
disillusionment: A cable network would never have frittered away as
funny a sitcom as this in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Created by screenwriter/director Don Roos, ``M.Y.O.B.'' pretty
much cribs the best bits from his hilarious film ``The Opposite of
Sex'' _ the characters played by Christina Ricci (caustic,
seen-it-all blonde teen, here played by Towne) and Lisa Kudrow
(uptight educator, here called Opal and essayed by Lauren Graham).
Roos bolsters his show with very self-conscious but always
effectively amusing narration (that frequently pokes fun at the
conventions of TV storytelling) and takes cheeky swipes at shows
like ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Friends,'' ``Ally McBeal''
and, particularly, ``Law &AMP; Order,'' but his show doesn't seem like
just another media-centric series. It's more a renegade, as
disgusted with the same old same old in sitcoms as you are, and
enjoying tromping around mucking things up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``M.Y.O.B.'s'' main problem lies in its name _ it's a sure bet
you have a troubled title if you have to explain what it means both
in the opening title sequence and a character's monologue (for the
record, ``mind your own business''). Well, that, of course, and the
fact it's not on NBC's fall schedule (and unlikely ever to return
in any fashion, as Graham's already found other work for the fall,
in the WB's dramedy ``Gilmore Girls'').
</P>
<P>
   Here, Riley shows up at Opal's school as part of her search for
her birth mother _ who may or may not be Opal's sister. She got
Opal's name when a buddy hacked a government computer system.
``Your friend Frankie committed a felony,'' Opal sniffs; ``Well,
two, after I finished thanking him,'' the underage Riley deadpans.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's all about going for shock value and doing the right
thing in the wrongest way imaginable; she's effective at both. When
she lights a cigarette and Opal chides her, ``If I had just seen
somebody drop dead of a heart attack, I would never smoke again,''
Riley shrugs, ``Well, maybe for me it'll take two.'' She resorts to
blackmail to win Opal the principal's job that's rightfully hers
and, in episode two, outs a peer to save that same job.
</P>
<P>
   Riley dismisses her own show as ``the whole fish-out-of-water,
odd- couple, unrequited-love combo platter you get every night on
every channel.'' True enough, but it's rarely executed as cleverly
as it is by Roos and company. Enjoy it while it lasts.
</P>

 &HT;    Hepatitis C on the rise
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Within two years, Dr. Peter Somani predicts
hepatitis C will kill more Americans than AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The former state health director sounded that alarm last week in
helping to unveil the Ohio Hepatitis C Coalition, more than 200
organizations hoping to increase awareness of the viral liver
disease that is spread through infected blood. The U.S. Surgeon
General released a public service TV announcement this week for the
same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Increased awareness is important because hepatitis C can go
undetected for as long as 30 years after infecting people. They
don't know to undergo medical treatment and take precautions
against spreading the virus and straining their livers. In
announcing his resignation Friday, Montgomery County courts clerk
Craig Zimmers said doctors told him he had been infected about 20
years before his diagnosis a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has been recognized as a serious health threat only
recently, as it surfaces among those who underwent blood
transfusions before July 1992 or injected drugs with contaminated
needles _ the two most common sources of infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have no idea they have hepatitis C until it has
reached the chronic phase and the damage to their liver is
severe,'' Somani said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of every 10 Americans with the hepatitis C virus don't
realize it, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). That indicates how rough are the CDC estimates of
3.9 million infected Americans, of whom 2.7 have chronic liver
disease. Both figures far exceed the 1 million estimated by the CDC
to be living with HIV or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   About three people in 20 fight off the hepatitis C virus without
consequences but about 1 in 20 eventually die from it, prompting
Health News editors to write in April that a hepatitis C diagnosis
is ``like entering a lottery you didn't want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmers, 50, for whom treatment did not work, said he was a
regular blood donor until the early '90s, when he was told his
liver enzymes were slightly above elevated. ``Naturally, I feel
quite bad about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of infection from blood transfusion is down to 1 in
100,000 since donated blood has been routinely tested for the virus
since 1992, so about 60 percent of infections now are believed to
come from intravenous drug use. It also has been transmitted
through dialysis before 1992, clotting blood products before 1987,
birth by a mother with the virus, infected tattooing or body
piercing needles, exposure to tainted blood in health care settings
and unprotected sex.

THE LAST AMERICAN MAN IS GONE FROM FRENCH OPEN AS CHANG LOSES TO
KUERTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ With Friday's last match even at one set apiece and
Gustavo Kuerten suffering from a sore back, it looked as if like
Michael Chang, the only U.S. man left in the third round here, had
a fine chance to be the only U.S. man in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuerten, the loose-limbed Brazilian, had other plans, and
soon it was Chang who was suffering: feeling cramps coming in his
legs and watching helplessly as his final forehand sailed wide
after his strings broke without warning or mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I would have loved to have done better here, but
step by step and little by little, we'll keep plugging away,'' said
Chang, after Kuerten's 6-3, 6-7 (9), 6-1, 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   For only the second time in the 32 years of open tennis, no U.S.
man has reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam event. The first
time it happened was two years ago in this same grueling
tournament. Not that the Americans should complain. They have won
their share here in recent years: Chang doing it first at age 17 in
1989, Jim Courier doing it twice in 1991 and 1992 and Andre Agassi
doing it best last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the French is the one that Americans tend to
struggle with the most, but ironically we've had four Americans win
here in the past 11 years,'' Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the only Americans left in contention are women, and
two of them reached the fourth round in straight sets Friday. First
was Chanda Rubin, who eliminated but hardly upset the No. 7 seed
Nathalie Tauziat of France.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat's recently published work on women's tennis is selling
briskly here, but the book on her as a player is that she loses her
nerve on clay. Rubin won 6-4, 7-6 (3) and will next face Natasha
Zvereva. Monica Seles, the No. 3 seed, needed only 48 minutes to
defeat Rita Kuti Kis, an overmatched Hungarian baseliner, 6-1, 6-2.
But then Seles has been overmatching players from many nations of
late, putting her downsized racquet and upgraded fitness to
ferocious use: winning the Italian Open last month and losing eight
games in her first three matches here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely I feel really good out there,'' she said. ``I've
been moving well, trying to improve upon that. I've been doing a
lot better with getting to balls, just getting in better position
to hit the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It will get trickier from now on, however. With Lindsay
Davenport's loss in the first round, the bottom half of the draw is
substantially weaker than the top half where Seles lurks, and if
all goes according to seeding, she will have to beat France's
Amelie Mauresmo, France's (and Ohio's) Mary Pierce and Martina
Hingis just to reach the final.
</P>
<P>
   First comes Mauresmo, whom Seles beat in the Italian Open final
and who has been playing impressively here. ``I think both of us
are playing some fantastic tennis coming into the tournament; it's
unfortunate that we have to meet each other so early really,''
Seles said.
</P>
<P>
   While Seles pushes forward, her friend Davenport is scheduled to
leave Paris for California on Saturday to begin racing the clock to
get ready to defend her Wimbledon title. Muscle spasms in her back
caused her considerable pain in her first-round loss to Dominique
Van Roost and forced her to withdraw from the women's doubles event
Friday in which she was seeded first with partner Corina Morariu.
``I don't want her to play hurt just for me,'' Morariu said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Davenport's agent Tony Godsick, she plans to ``rest
for a few days, see how it feels and maybe play a warm-up
tournament on grass before Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten's back has also caused him trouble this year, and with
Chang leading 3-2 in the second set, he called for the same
trainer, Per Bastholt, who had treated Agassi's foot blisters
during his second-round loss to Karol Kucera. ``I felt something a
little strange,'' Kuerten said. ''As fast I could, I see him and
have him loosen it up.''
</P>
<P>
   He would receive treatment again midway through the third set,
but by then he was in control of the match, and by the time it
ended after three hours of often-sensational baseline play, he was
still the favorite and Chang still struggling to regain his former
stature. He has not advanced past the third round in a Grand Slam
since 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Loyal listeners of public radio are accustomed to moments of
dead air _ those long silences between movements in a symphony or
the announcer's dramatic pause before reading the title of the work
just played.
</P>
<P>
   But listeners should not expect much quiet during the weekly
broadcast of the conversation show ``Satellite Sisters,'' debuting
at 9 this morning on KCRW-FM (89.9).
</P>
<P>
   Except for a possible repeat of that time when the five Dolan
sisters actually choked with laughter simultaneously as Lian Dolan
talked about quaffing an old hotel mini bottle of mouthwash that
had gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were laughing so hard we couldn't talk,'' said Lian, the
35- year-old baby sister who lives in Pasadena and records her part
of the hourlong show in a Los Angeles studio. ``We've tried not to
laugh so hard on the air. We're getting better at it, but sometimes
it just happens. We crack each other up.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which launched April 1 on WNYC-FM in Manhattan, is an
hour of chat among the five siblings and occasionally a close
friend or two who chime in with a meaningful topic or a well-told
anecdote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole idea is that everyone has a story to tell, so it can
be serious like a breast self-exam or it can be just a really funny
story that you'd love to hear at a dinner party,'' Lian said. ``We
had a friend who came in and told a flat-out hilarious story about
finding a woman intruder that broke into her house wearing an
evening gown, sitting on the toilet in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolans are all over the map, figuratively and literally,
having gone different directions in their personal lives and making
their homes in Portland, Ore. (Monica), New York (Sheila and Liz),
Pasadena (Lian) and even Bangkok (Julie). Liz (who quit her
high-powered job at Nike to start her own marketing firm), Lian (a
mother and wanna-be screenwriter) and Julie (a former college
administrator) are the official hosts, uplinked from their
far-flung studios, with Sheila (an elementary school principal) and
Monica (a nurse) calling in about every other week.
</P>
<P>
   Even in their 30s and 40s, they haven't lost that knack for
bantering they perfected as kids while doing the family dishes in
Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Liz brought up the idea for the radio show in 1996 when the
women were on a retreat at a California spa. Before they were out
of the mudbath, all had agreed to do it. WNYC, Oregon Public
Broadcasting and Mudbath Productions produce the show, which is
distributed by Public Radio International.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a few constraints on the Satellite Sisters'
subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to come at anything from a personal angle, whether it's
money or health. It has to have a personal beginning with one of us
or one of our guests,'' Lian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of shows that do the top 10 reasons to get life
insurance very well. We don't need to cross those lines. In fact,
in the development stage we played around with a lot of different
kinds of stories and when we did those how to save for college for
your children (topics), we sounded like bad versions of Katie
Couric, so we scrapped that whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Satellite Sisters'' is girl talk that holds the interest of at
least some of the male listeners from its WNYC lead-in, ``Car
Talk.'' It's unscripted comedy without the two-drink minimum. For
over-achieving or overwhelmed women, it's a vicarious girls' night
out over a cup of morning coffee.
</P>
<P>
   They award honorary Satellite Sisterhood to any listeners or
guests who come up with good responses to questions that have no
right or wrong answers, such as, ``Would you rather win a Nobel
Prize or an Oscar?'' and ``Have you ever lied to your doctor and
about what?''
</P>
<P>
   Lian, a mostly stay-at-home mother of two boys _ Brookes, 4, and
Colin, 2 _ says in light of the show's close-to-home perspective
she is ever on guard against sounding even vaguely like a certain
broadcast personality with a reputation for telling too many cute
anecdotes about her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In preproduction meetings, that is our code word for we're not
going there _ `That's a little Kathie Lee,''' Lian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is really more about the relationship you have with
your children than your children,'' she said. ``Most of the
segments are turned around back on me as opposed to telling cute
stories about my kids. It's 'how did this affect me,' and hopefully
there are some broader lessons in that. Yes, it's a worry, the
Kathie Lee moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Satellite Sisters are not worried, however, about the
prospect of getting any on-air competition from their three
brothers, their former tormentors who have been relegated to
occasionally reading the ``Sisters'' closing credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what that would sound like,'' said Lian. ```Hey,
how's it going? Well, good. All right, talk to you later.' It's
laughable, the idea of Satellite Brothers.''

 &HT;    Giant baseballs make Turner Field debut
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So maybe your cutoff should have been the second beer.
</P>
<P>
   But that really was a giant baseball at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fans got the first look Friday at the Atlanta Braves'
and New York Yankees' ``All-Star Balls'' _ the first of 500 giant
plastic baseballs to be displayed throughout the city for Major
League Baseball's All-Star Game in July.
</P>
<P>
   The six-foot balls were unveiled during a pregame ceremony
Friday and will be on display in Monument Plaza in front of the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball promotion, which is patterned after the highly
successful Cows on Parade exhibit in Chicago last year, will run
for the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   So far, dozens of businesses have plunked down big bucks to buy
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Patron sponsors, at $27,000 each, include Georgia-Pacific Corp.,
Southern Co., Worldspan, iXL Enterprises, Bell South Corp., UPS,
PepsiCo Inc., Delta Air Lines, Bank of America, Priceline.com, and
the Sherwin -Williams Co.
</P>
<P>
   Patron sponsors get three balls to decorate and display _ one
each for an American and National League team and one to decorate
any way they want.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, sponsors get tickets to the All-Star Game and other
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We verbally have commitments from about seven more, but we
don't count them unless we have their checks in the bank,'' said
Bill Howard, vice president of tourism and public relations for the
Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, which is also a patron
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Others can purchase individual balls for $5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those have been sold. Buyers include MARTA, Marriott
International, Visa International, the Buckhead Life Group and Saks
Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Denmark, a furniture retailer, plans to display its
ball in front of its showroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an American and I'm still trying to get into the
sport,'' said John Querl, corporate controller and a native of
Zambia. ``I think it's a neat idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to have a city full of baseballs,'' Howard said.

 &HT;    Airline merger reports rising
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Talk of airline mergers heated up Friday amid reports
American Airlines has had exploratory talks about buying Northwest
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The unconfirmed reports follow last week's move by United
Airlines to buy US Airways for $4.3 billion in cash, pending what
is expected to be a tough antitrust review by federal regulators in
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe a United-US Airways deal will force
United's top rivals, American and Atlanta-based Delta, to pursue
their own acquisitions or lose national market share _ especially
in crucial East Coast markets.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Delta has made no move. But an American-Northwest
marriage could clear the way for it to make another run at
Continental Airlines, which Delta tried unsuccessfully to buy in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest currently owns a 51 percent voting stake in
Continental but likely would have to divest it before a sale to
American, leaving Continental free to entertain other offers.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman Clay McConnell declined comment on the
American-Northwest reports.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I would reiterate that Delta is monitoring the
competitive situation closely in order to ensure our interests are
protected and that Delta will be successful regardless of the
industry environment.''
</P>
<P>
   A Minneapolis television station and Dow Jones News Service
reported that American and Northwest executives have had
preliminary talks. Spokesmen for both carriers declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones said it was unclear whether the talks would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest stock jumped on the reports, gaining $6.37 1/2 to
close at $35.43 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   If the United-US Airways deal survives regulatory review and
labor hurdles, United would become dramatically stronger along the
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   That would put pressure on both Delta and American and could
trigger a consolidation among the top six airlines, some analysts
believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a Soviet planner point of view, we think the most logical
airline combinations are United/US Airways, Delta/Continental and
American/Northwest,'' Salomon Smith Barney analyst Brian Harris
said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts think such a massive consolidation has little
chance of government approval.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe American may court Northwest simply to give
anti-trust regulators more of a reason to block the United-US
Airways deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds like a copycat move to bring out more regulatory
heat,'' Merger Insight analyst Tom Burnett told Dow Jones.

   PRIVACY-ISSUE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Lurking just below the surface
in the campaign of 2000 is the issue of personal privacy.
Democratic and Republican pollsters both say it is a sleeper issue.
By Richard J. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   ROGUE-DEMOCRACIES-REVIEW (United Nations) _ For years the United
States has classified some countries, like Iraq and North Korea, as
``rogue states.'' Now, as the world becomes more democratic _ more
than 60 percent of countries have elected leaders _ something more
complicated enters the political lexicon. Call them ``rogue
democracies.'' By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HEIGHT-VANITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ A study appearing this month in
the American Statistical Association Proceedings reports that many
Americans appear to lie about their height. Not weight or age,
though they lie about that, too. But height? Why? By Eric
Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   DETERRENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ For nearly half a century the Cold
War world's tense stability was built on a simple bit of political
philosophy. Nicknamed, appropriately, MAD, for Mutual Assured
Destruction, it held that the leader of a country advanced enough
to build nuclear weapons would never actually use them if he was
assured his nation would also be obliterated by his enemy. As
nuclear technology proliferates, however, the nuclear equation is
becoming more complicated, and a new view of deterrence is growing
rapidly in importance. By Michael Oreskes.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-GINGRICH-REVIEW (Washington) _ As Gov. George W. Bush rolls
out policy address after policy address, congressional Republicans
are watching in admiration as he does what Newt Gingrich, Trent
Lott and the self-effacing J. Dennis Hastert could not: win a fresh
hearing for ideas cherished by true-blue conservatives. It's the
Newt-less revolution. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-VIRUSES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The ``I Love You'' bug,
allegedly launched by a Philippines computer student with too much
time on his hands, touched off a cyber-flu season. More than 29
variants have emerged so far, including diabolical derivatives with
names like ``NewLove'' and ``Resume _ Janet Simons.'' The question
is, what's love got to do with it? Quite a lot, perhaps. By John
Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-ROCK&AMP;ROLL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Perhaps it was inevitable
that as the Internet began permeating the culture, the techie
language that was once confined to textbooks and instruction
manuals would begin to sound beautiful, or at least pretty enough
to sing. Physicists, who among other things invented the World Wide
Web, have been quick to realize that their lexicon is no longer too
obscure for pop songs. By James Gantz.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   PERU-REVIEW (Lima, Peru) _ Authoritarianism and democracy have
long coexisted in this region where nation states were founded by
generals and oligarchs where the ideals of the European
Enlightenment never developed very deep roots. Octavio Paz, the
Mexican essayist, once wrote that the problem with democracy in
Latin America is that it was ``imported but not adopted.'' By
Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   HAITI-REVIEW (Port Au-Prince, Haiti) _ More than five years
after a United States-led military occupation restored democratic
rule in Haiti, the civil serenity that Haitians hoped for remains
elusive. By David Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-REVIEW (London) _ Northern Ireland is locked in a grim
struggle to trade in tested old tribal instincts for risky new
communal ones, and the tensions and reluctances of that swap were
on display this week in the actions of a key figure in the peace
negotiations, David Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   ETHIOPIA-REVIEW (Nairobi) _ The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea
is often described as the most deadly in the world, fought on
terrain of little consequence while millions of people in two very
poor countries face starvation. This is all true. But the war is
also something else, something that has become quite rare: A war
fought between the regular armies of two nations, in which both
sides generally follow the rules of war. By Ian Fisher.

HARD MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 4, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chances are that you've seen part of the dandy advertising
campaign for the U.S. Mint's new gold-colored dollar coin, mostly
on television. A slyly animated visage of George Washington,
familiar from the $1 bill, pops up in a variety of modern
situations and urges you to treat those new Sacagawea dollars just
like any other coin. ``What are you waiting for? It's money. So use
it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But have you seen the coin itself? If only the marketing plan
were as good as the ads.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how few people have had one of those new Sacagawea
dollars in their hands, especially in New England. The advertising
campaign is half over and the golden coins still are hard to find
anywhere but in a stamp machine or at the Post Office.
</P>
<P>
   Banks no longer have difficulty ordering them from their
regional Federal Reserve Banks. But consumers tend to stash the
ones they are given on dresser tops and drawers, to buy them in
rolls only for special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The new coin was designed to replace the Susan B. Anthony dollar
coin, first issued in 1979. which was one of the more peculiar
blunders of the presidency of Jimmy Carter. The coin was virtually
indistinguishable from a quarter by size or weight or color.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Susie'' was introduced at a time of raging inflation
(remember the hapless William G. Miller, who was chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board?) and quickly came to symbolize Carter's
inability to manage the currency at any level. Consumers resisted
using it at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   The new dollar coin has none of these defects. It's heavier than
the quarter, bigger, thicker, easy to distinguish by feel in the
pocket. It's bright gold in color, at least when it's new, thanks
to its brass-manganese cladding.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, it affords a good civics lesson. The coin shows the
shining face of Sacagawea, carrying her infant son upon her back.
The Shoshone woman guided the Lewis and Clark expedition across the
mountains and to the Pacific Ocean from 1804 to 1806.
</P>
<P>
   Pedants, too, have had their fun with the coin. No likeness of
the native American woman survives. Lewis and Clark always spelled
her name with a G, but most persons pronounce it as if it were
spelled with a J. She almost certainly carried her baby in a sling
across her chest.
</P>
<P>
   But Sacagawea remains one of America's most durable symbols of
cross-cultural cooperation, and a famous working mother to boot _ a
fitting symbol for these times. The coin itself is an undisputed
success.
</P>
<P>
   Its distribution is another story.
</P>
<P>
   The initial roll-out took place in January. Commercial banks,
which ordinarily would have been instrumental, asked for a repreive
while they returned the excess currency they they had built up in
anticipation of Y2K. They didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the US Mint proceeded to ship coins via registered mail
to 2,900 Wal-Mart stores across the country, in hopes of putting
the coin directly into the retail cash drawer.
</P>
<P>
   The banks were furious. And soon it was apparent that the coins
were going straight out of the retail cash drawer into the dresser
drawer. Consumers were hoarding the bright new dollars, stacking
them on window sills or giving them as gifts. They were not going
into circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint has continued to pump the new coins out. Some 650
million have been shipped to date. Banks no longer have trouble
ordering them. But many don't bother.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Sacagawea dollar is making headway, especially
as a universal token for machine transactions. The Mass Transit
Authority of New York City is giving change from fare card machines
in dollar coins. The Chicago Transit Authority has eliminted paper
in its fare boxes; passengers must change their bills for coins.
The Washington subway may yet convert to dollar coins.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which at 85 cents still has the cheapest mass transit of
any big city in the nation, may go to a $1 fare in the fall; look
for the golden dollar to make its debut then. Meanwhile, automated
car washes, toll roads, vending machines and airport luggage carts
are rapidly converting to four-tube changers to handle the new
coins.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint expects to pump out more than a billion $1 coins this
year, more than all the ``Susies'' shipped in the past 21 years. No
federal agency has been more ``reinvented'' than the Mint: it has a
chief technology officer, strategic business units for circulation,
numismatics (coin collecting) and protection, a wicked good web
site (www.usmint.gov) and a $43 million advertising budget,
financed by the savings on the $1 coin.
</P>
<P>
   So why the stumbling? European nations and Canada all have
introduced the equivalent of the dollar coin. In each case they
deliberately withdrew the counterpart banknote. The coin quickly
and completely replaced the bill.
</P>
<P>
   No such move is contemplated by the US Treasury Department,
which administers the Mint. The reason is determined opposition
from a coalition of lobbying interests known as ``Save the
Greenback.''
</P>
<P>
   One big backer is Massachusetts Crane Paper Co., which makes the
high-tech paper on which US currency is printed. Another is the
zinc lobby. Much of its mining and fabrication business is located
in Vice President Al Gore's home state of Tennesee, including a
company which has a lucrative contract to supply blanks for the
penny. The penny is 97.5 percent zinc. The dollar coin, on the
other hand, is 88.5 percent copper.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminate the penny to make a place in cash registers for the
Sacagawea dollar? It makes sense. But the Treasury is right to
fully support demand for the dollar bill for the forseeable future.
The management of the currency is a highly-charged emotional issue.
As George Washington says in those ads, ``I still look good on
paper.''

THE PATTERNS HIDDEN IN MARKET SWINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, the craggy peaks and sharp precipices of the
common stock chart have redefined the American landscape. Charts
flash on television screens and computer monitors, inspire animated
debate and wild expectations, and become minor obsessions. Anyone
who follows charts cannot follow them casually; too much is at
stake. But anyone who follows them closely can be baffled by their
vast swings, unexplained moves and dizzying plunges.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, professional commentators would argue, these
movements are hardly arbitrary. Among the reasons they offer for
the ups and downs: changes in interest rates, shifts in foreign
policy, technological innovations. And theories abound for how to
predict the fate of a company's stock chart.
</P>
<P>
   Investors like Warren Buffett have championed ``value''
investing, in which a company's cash flow, future earnings and
assets are rigorously analyzed; stock prices are expected to
reflect a rational analysis of value.
</P>
<P>
   One interpretation of stock market behavior, known as the random
walk theory, has less faith in reason: Prices randomly stumble
around a perceived value like a drunk looking for a lost coin; no
past price can tell us anything about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Other theories argue that the future can indeed be anticipated
by examining past activity through computer analyses of the rate of
stock sales, or calculations of the averages of stock prices over
the last 200 days, or examinations of seasonal price patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, another set of techniques appeals to the
fundamental hope that in the bewildering movements of the
marketplace, a deeper order is being revealed. It is known as
``technical analysis.'' As the Internet has turned the market into
a mass market, technical analysis, once the domain of professional
traders, has entered the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Software programs like Omnitrader and Internet sites like
www.barchart.com bring the approach home. Television discussions of
``support levels,'' and ``consolidation,'' ``break outs'' and
``corrections,'' have made the vocabulary as familiar as a weather
man's references to low-pressure systems, pollen count and
wind-chill factors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the theory of technical analysis, nothing needs to
be considered aside from a chart showing price movements and
volumes of trades. Forget profit statements, business plans and
inflation figures; ignore whether the company makes widgets or lays
fiber optic cable. Investors, the theory believes, have already
come in contact with all these bits of knowledge, reacted to them,
judged their impact on other investors, and acted upon them. The
result is a stock's price; and the intensity of commitment to that
price is measured in the volume of trades.
</P>
<P>
   Technical analysts examine charts, draw geometric shapes,
connect points and mark off familiar patterns. Each pattern has a
meaning in the analyst's lexicon, providing a glimpse of what might
happen next. Some technical analysts, having seen a promise of
pictorial order, go further, arguing that there are even more basic
rules governing these shapes, rules that grow out of what they
consider basic laws of nature and geometry; some get even more
fantastical, invoking the principles of astrology. These latter
hypotheses do not seem to have a major following, but few traders
work without using some of the techniques of technical analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In one classic text, ``Technical Analysis of Stock Trends,''
(seventh edition, 1997, St. Lucie Press), Robert D. Edwards and
John Magee trace technical analysis back to a set of ideas first
advanced a hundred years ago by Charles H. Dow, a founder of Dow
Jones &AMP; Co. The market, they explain, moves in longterm trends in
which stocks either rise or fall; those trends are subdivided into
other secondary or tertiary trends in which retreats and advances
also take place.
</P>
<P>
   The entire effect, they suggest, is like the ebb and flow of the
tides, punctuated by individual waves washing against the shore,
whose own surfaces are, in turn, shaped by more chaotic ripples.
The goal of analysis is to identify places where the tide will
change.
</P>
<P>
   Charts can help, analysts argue, if their pictorial language is
properly understood. These patterns tend to have geometric names
like a ``right-angle broadening formation'' or pictorial names like
``falling wedge.'' A chart might, for example, create a ``head and
shoulders formation,'' which is composed of three jagged hills, the
central one (the head) reaching the highest point. These patterns
and scores of others can best be understood as maps of human
behavior, revealing ways in which investors act and react.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Consider one fundamental example: the ``head and shoulders''
pattern. When a stock's price is rising, analysts argue, the
pattern is almost always followed by a reversal. Why? Imagine a
stock moving from $10 to $12 and back, forming a ``shoulder.'' It
then rises again to $15 before falling again to $10, forming a
``head.'' Finally another shoulder forms, resembling the first. Why
should this mean that the stock will eventually fall from $10?
</P>
<P>
   Well, think of the behavior this pattern portrays. The first
rise is energetic, with heavy volume, but the fall back from $12
reveals some doubts. Some owners cautiously sell off a bit, but
others may hold on as the first shoulder is formed. The head
represents yet another burst of support. But though the stock
reaches higher, the trading has less volume. Conviction is limited
and the stock drops again.
</P>
<P>
   Two such rises and falls might be thought inconsequential, but
by the time the stock rises yet again, worry becomes palpable. The
faith in the stock cannot be supported. Finally, the stock begins
its extended fall, plunging below $10, which is picturesquely
referred to as the ``neckline.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty shown in this pattern might be affected by a
company's fortunes, or the state of the economy, or changes in the
marketplace, but according to the theory, interpreting the pattern
requires no knowledge of any of this. ``Head and shoulders'' is a
pattern caused by conflict; it reveals a gradual defeat of bullish
optimism. And the pattern has the same meanings for any stock being
considered.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of analysis then goes even further: rules not only
predict broad patterns, they also provide guidance about the extent
of a rise or fall. For analysts, charts almost seem to follow
aesthetic principles. For example, analysts suggest that in the
``head and shoulders'' pattern, the second shoulder will tend to
mirror the first, and the rise of the ``head'' will tend to be
matched by the extent of the fall after the stock drops below the
``neckline.'' There is something uncanny about such assertions;
they are much more difficult to justify as laws of human behavior.
But they reveal a determination to find order in the midst of
seeming chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that these sorts of rules have so many exceptions
that they can hardly be relied upon; that patterns are best seen in
retrospect, when they are no longer helpful; that analysts' ideas
can end up becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. And indeed, while
investment banks and trading houses have technical analysts on
staff, strict analysis is generally tempered by considerations of
other factors.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort to find pictorial order seems almost universal.
The Japanese, for example, have used a 300-year-old method of
charting known as ``candlesticks,'' made familiar in the West after
the analyst Steve Nison examined them in books like ``Beyond
Candlesticks: New Japanese Charting Techniques Revealed'' (1994,
Wiley). Instead of just marking the range of a day's trading with a
single vertical line, as on Western charts, the Japanese create
candlesticks: small rectangles whose ends represent the stock's
opening and closing prices. If the price fell during the day, the
candlestick is darkened (and is called a ``long black body''); if
the price rose, it is left unshaded (and is called a ``long white
body''). In candlestick charts, technical analysis becomes almost
poetic, with patterns named ``morning star,'' ``hanging man'' and
``falling window.''
</P>
<P>
   But if charts reveal hidden patterns, some believe there are
even deeper esoteric patterns guiding the charts. In ``The
Psychology of Technical Analysis'' (1993, Irwin), which The
Financial Times of London said would ``entertain and intrigue keen
investors,'' Tony Plummer, a British trader, argues that the ebb
and flow of human activity actually follows a pattern that
resembles the curve of the Nautilus shell. That curve, which
expands outward without changing its shape, recurs throughout the
natural world in various organic forms (pine cones, sunflowers,
tree leaves). It is an image of a certain form of growth that,
Plummer suggests, also applies to the large-scale actions of the
marketplace. He argues that a properly drawn Nautilus curve _ and
it is by no means easy to find the proper curve _ will intersect
with the stock's highs and lows.
</P>
<P>
   Major turning points in stock charts, other theorists have also
argued, occur at intervals determined by the Golden Mean _ a ratio,
approximately equal to 1.618, that also determines the shape of the
Nautilus curve.
</P>
<P>
   Similar arguments are made in ``Fibonacci Applications and
Strategies for Traders'' by Robert Fischer (1993, Wiley) and are
regularly described in survey texts like ``Technical Analysis of
the Financial Markets'' by John J. Murphy (1999, New York Institute
of Finance). The quest for order would now seem complete: charts
not only are rife with symmetries and patterns, but they also
reflect a ratio that is considered one of the most beautiful in the
natural world.
</P>
<P>
   It is, perhaps, too much to believe, that the cumulative effect
of individual decisions to buy and sell would create such hidden
patterns. But the attempt to make sense of the chart is no
different than the attempt to explain any complex system. In fact,
push the notion of hidden pattern a bit further and chart reading
can even turn religious: The stock analyst Perry J. Kaufman devotes
10 pages to financial astrology in an otherwise scrupulous
theoretical text, ``Trading Systems and Methods'' (1998, Wiley), a
method few analysts would confess to using.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these assertions are not widely accepted; they are
extensions of the theory, not exceptions to it. Technical analysis
has its believers and detractors, but it is an unusual attempt to
make sense of an exceedingly mysterious phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the market may be created by its participants but it
is also independent of them; it reflects their will but also
affects their will; its participants believe they are free, but
their actions fall into familiar patterns. The chart is not just
the record of a company's share price; it is the record of attempts
to guess the future. It is a trace of human behavior. So what are
we seeing when we examine these charts? Images of ourselves.

&HT;     WOMEN RUNNERS SAY AGE IS NO LIMIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If they were baseball players, their arms
probably would be showing signs of wearing out. Basketball players,
their explosiveness may be dwindling. Football players, slower and
more vulnerable to injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Distance runners, though, appear to be of a different makeup,
especially when it comes to determining the best years of their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   They are not at their athletic peak at 19 or 23 or 28. The
performances of world-class runners indicate that turning 30 is not
the bridge to the end, but rather the beginning of the best years
of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something that people don't understand about
running,'' Lynn Jennings, who won her eighth Freihofer's Run for
Women championship in 1998 at the age of 37, said before finishing
third here last year. ``It's a sport that tends to reward maturity.
It's not like all the other sports. We keep getting stronger as we
go, and if we stay healthy, we can compete at the highest level
that much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Freihofer's Run, which will be contested on the
streets of Albany for the 22nd consecutive year on Saturday, has
its share of elite runners between the ages of 20 and 25, with
24-year-old Blake Phillips-Russell and 25-year-old Jennifer Rhines
headlining that list.
</P>
<P>
   However, four other women on most lists of runners expected to
contend for this year's championship were born in the 1960s. Libbie
Hickman is 35, Sylvia Mosqueda is 33, Anne Marie Lauck is 31, and
Donna Garcia is 32.
</P>
<P>
   And each appears to be just on the cusp of her running prime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in their 30s and they're still among the best out
there,'' said Ryan Lamppa of the United States Track and Field
Association. ``There's no limit to what a lot of them can do.''
</P>
<P>
   So, is the thirtysomething set of women distance runners in this
country like fine wine? Do they get better with age?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can keep getting better every year, if you do things
intelligently and take care of yourself,'' said Hickman, who is the
favorite in the Freihofer's Run. ``All you do each year is keep
getting stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheri Goddard-Kenah, now 29, won her first Freihofer's title
here last year. She is not in this year's field because of an
injury, but she knows that her window of opportunity to win the
Freihofer's should remain open for several more years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she maintains that her best years may be four, five,
perhaps even six years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the way it is with women. We get stronger and even
faster as we age,'' Goddard-Kenah said. ``The more years of
distance running you have under your belt, the easier it gets. With
age you can run more mileage, and that just makes you stronger
every year, so what you do one year just keeps paying off down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Freihofer's race director George Regan understands that runners
like Jennings have helped make his race what it is, but that
runners like 1997 champion Elva Dryer and Goddard-Kenah are the
future stars of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't even hit their peak yet,'' Regan said. ``That's
amazing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Goddard-Kenah, like most of the other elite distance runners in
this country, says she logs many more miles per week in her
training now than she did when she was younger, and said that the
increase in mileage has been a key to her longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies indicate that a teen-aged female who logs more
than 40 miles per week regularly over an extended period can hurt
her long-term running potential, for the simple reason that asking
so much from a young body can take too much out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Evans, who chairs the Nutrition, Metabolism and
Exercise Laboratory at the University of Arkansas, published a
report that found wide-ranging differences in opinion when it comes
to peak athletic performance. Some sports psychologists quoted in
the study say the typical peak age for athletes is 18. Others say
it comes around 33. That alone would seem to prove that ``peaking''
is an inexact science.
</P>
<P>
   His report says, in part, that sprinters tend to have more
fast-twitch muscle fibers that give them explosiveness, strength
and quickness. Distance runners generally have more slow-twitch
muscle fibers, which the report says take longer to deteriorate.
Thus, the increased longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long I'll be able to stay at that peak once I
get there,'' Goddard-Kenah said. ``I just know I'm not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Extreme amounts of mileage done before the body is finished
growing and maturing makes it more prone to injuries, and those
injuries take their toll later in life, Hickman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take care of yourself when you're younger,''
Hickman said. ``Knock on wood, I've been injury-free for my whole
career, and that may be because I increased, increased, increased
my mileage slowly. It only makes sense to do it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she's a better runner now than she was a decade ago,
Hickman didn't hesitate. No question about it, she said, adding
that she has no plans to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can use the same speed I had as a 25-year-old,'' Hickman
said. ``Now my endurance is so good that I can continue it. When I
was younger I couldn't keep that speed up, except maybe in 1,500s.
My speed for 5ks and 10ks now is good enough to be competitive
internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the American female running greats, Mary Slaney, hasn't
been as fortunate as Hickman in terms of injury prevention. Slaney
has said she has lost count of the number of surgeries that have
been performed on her 41-year-old body, but knows the number is
more than 20. Still, Slaney said at the 1996 Olympic Trials that
even then, at 37, she was running as well as she had at any time in
a career that has spanned nearly a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Salazar, the former marathon world-record holder who
helps advise Slaney now as part of his duties with Nike, said
Slaney's obsession with competition is what helped her survive
those injury-laden years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say that she's like a racehorse,'' Salazar said.
``She can just run herself out, and when you have little nagging
injuries, that can cost you, especially at her age.''
</P>
<P>
   Slaney said she does not believe in chronological age, instead
clinging to the axiom that you truly are only as old as you feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as long as you're interested and feel good about
yourself and what you are doing,'' Slaney said before the 1996
Olympic Trials for the Games in Atlanta, ``there isn't a reason to
stop.''

CHIPPING AWAY AT THE COMMUNITY OF NEW YORK

<P>
   Few may have noticed, but last week saw another step in the
dismantling of New York's pioneering social benefit system. Eliot
Spitzer, the state attorney general, announced that he would no
longer oppose converting Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield to a
for-profit corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, various government and nonprofit health,
housing and cultural institutions have been turned into
money-making entities outside of public control. Slowly, the city
and state are giving away a civic patrimony that earlier
generations of New Yorkers built with their money, imagination and
political will.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, New York hospitals founded what became Empire Blue
Cross to ensure themselves steady income while giving people a way
to finance hospitalization. Individuals were the first subscribers,
but the plan took off after it began signing up groups of workers.
Unions, by demanding that employers provide coverage, helped fuel
Blue Cross' meteoric growth after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, some Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in other
states began turning themselves into for-profit companies. They
argued that because of increased competition, they needed access to
private capital and they needed to shed mandated responsibilities,
like accepting all applicants or charging all customers the same
fee. In some states, officials responded by allowing them to
privatize but forcing them to finance nonprofit foundations, a
route Empire Blue Cross is now trying to take.
</P>
<P>
   Empire Blue Cross has long been mired in problems, stemming from
both mismanagement and competition that picked off its healthiest
customers, leaving the organization with the sickest, most
expensive clients. (Until recently, state regulations required Blue
Cross to accept applicants that other plans could reject.)
</P>
<P>
   These problems are serious, but they can be addressed without
privatization. For more than 60 years, Blue Cross has acted not for
the benefit of stockholders, but for its customers. Isn't that
model still important? A large nonprofit insurer provides a
benchmark for private competitors and an alternative for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over privatization is not unique. In 1996,
debate raged over Co-op Village, a complex of cooperative
apartments on the Lower East Side, which had originally been
financed with government subsidies and union loans. After fierce
debate, residents decided to abandon rules that required them, upon
moving, to sell their shares back to the cooperative at the
original price. Residents have profited from this plan, but the
conversion has reduced opportunities for other working and
middle-class families. In 1996, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani sold off the
city's broadcast facilities. A public uproar forced the sale of
WNYC radio to a nonprofit foundation, but the municipal television
station went into private hands.
</P>
<P>
   Once public and quasi-public assets slip out of public control,
it is almost impossible to retrieve or replace them. While
privatizing any one might seem reasonable in the face of problems,
the cumulative effect is to destroy a web of institutions that
helped keep New York City livable and attractive during decades
when many cities drastically declined. In good times, public
services and safety nets do not seem so important. In bad times, it
is too late to get them back.

MUSIC MAKER WANTS TO FOCUS ON PHOTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Graham Nash took a quick glance at his photos before beaming a
top-of-the-line, professional smile at those who were waiting to
meet him.
</P>
<P>
   He was late and he was limping, but he owned the room as soon as
he walked into it.
</P>
<P>
   Star power. Nash uses it to connect. He makes connecting look
easy, and he makes it look like fun. He's not in Seattle to talk
about his star power, however.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to focus on his photographs. They're at the Benham
Studio Gallery, along with Elliott Landy's rock portraits, through
June 24 in honor of the opening of the Experience Music Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a gallery to show you what you do,'' Nash said. In
his case, of course, a gallery shows him a small part of what he
does. He knows that people who hail him on the street aren't
smiling because they love his images. They're responding to Crosby,
Stills, Nash &AMP; Young, especially recently, after a highly
successful reunion tour.
</P>
<P>
   He could point out that he's been taking photographs longer than
he's been making music, but usually he doesn't bother. He doesn't
have to. He's a real deal in photographic circles, and the exhibit
demonstrates why.
</P>
<P>
   His crisp, black-and-white photos are offbeat portraits of his
friends and bizarre slices of daily life, printed with exquisite
attention to tonal detail. Nash is a pioneer in digital printmaking
technology. In 1991, he and his friend Mac Holbert founded Nash
Editions in Southern California. It's a fine-art digital
printmaking studio whose clients range from David Hockney to Olivia
Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an unlisted phone number and don't advertise,''
Holbert said. ``We only work on small editions. You have to really
want to work with us to find us.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbert looked sympathetic as Nash declined a chair. Nash broke
both legs last year in a boating accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got rods and pins and plates and screws in this leg,''
Nash said, looking down. ``It's like owning a small railroad.
Bacteria love metal. If you get an infection, they camp out
there.'' Sounds gruesome, but Nash is certain antibiotics will soon
restore his once-confident stride.
</P>
<P>
   Old rock 'n' rollers aren't noted for their confident strides.
It's a burn-out business. At 58, married for 23 years and the
father of three children, Nash looks not just healthier but sexier
than he did in his dissolute prime.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1960s he was bone thin and often stoned. According
to the photographic record, he was also self-absorbed, a quality
that has disappeared completely. Today he looks pleased to be on
planet Earth and curious to see what will happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Nash moved to the rear gallery to see Landy's portraits of rock
superstars in New York from 1967 to 1969. Between the two shows
there is only one overlap: Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   Nash and Landy are big Dylan fans, with Nash having the greater
claim, because he insists Dylan is not just a seminal songwriter
but a great singer. ``Dylan has 40 different ways to sing a phrase
and can kill you with each one,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's portrait of Dylan is lovely, but Landy's are a world:
Dylan looking like a young Amish father with his toddler son; Dylan
buried behind a piano; Dylan smiling a completely unguarded,
personal smile (later the cover of ``Nashville Skyline''); and
Dylan standing on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Landy, 58, has fabulous black-and-white shots of Jimi Hendrix,
The Band and Janis Joplin. He has even better color shots of Procol
Harum, Joplin and John Lee Hooker, the last bathed in acid-yellow
light and wearing a snappy, peach-colored suit.
</P>
<P>
   His photos became famous enough for Landy to receive the
ultimate 1960s compliment: the rumor he didn't exist at all. There
was even evidence: His name is an anagram of Dylan's (Landy/Dylan),
proving that Dylan must have been behind the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Nash was struck by one of Landy's black-and-white shots of Jim
Morrison, a blurred moment in which Morrison seems to float in
front of the microphone. ``Whatever Jim was, it's there, man,''
Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   Nash and Landy suddenly seemed to realize that they were
surrounded by a host of dead friends' portraits. ``We're lucky be
be standing here talking to each other after all that went on,''
Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's photos couldn't be more different. Although there are a
few rock stars in evidence (David Crosby, Joni Mitchell, Dylan),
the photos aren't about character, soul or personal magnetism.
They're about light and how it plays with the bizarre loose ends of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Landy's black-and-white tones are often muddy, but Nash's are
exquisite, with depths in the darks and volume in the lights. He
never arranges anything or sets up a shot. ``Life is weird enough
without me trying to make it weirder.''
</P>
<P>
   One print is a window he shot from below, with a rubber chicken
hung in its center as decoration. The tones are magisterial, but
the content is tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Nash disagrees, finding no fault with the anonymous decorator's
taste. ``Anybody who hangs a rubber chicken in a window is OK by
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A computer program called Photoshop gave him the print of
Crosby's face with his eyes closed. At the time he was listening to
the first playback of ``Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.'' Crosby looks a
little like the melting-mercury bad guy in ``Terminator 2,'' but
more blissful and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all blissful and sweet now, aren't we?'' Nash asked,
grinning. ``I know I am. I live with my family in Hawaii with no
address. To get there you take Power House Road and turn right
after the 25th telephone pole. It's paradise. Who'd complain about
that?''

DRESSING DOWN THOSE TRENDY `CITY' GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps because I am not from New York, and even now do not live
there but rather arrive each morning by train through the aqua
light of Grand Central, then up the Vanderbilt stairs and into the
glare and slow-moving traffic of 43rd Street, I am more apt to
identify with writers who saw the city from afar.
</P>
<P>
   The one who described New York best, especially that sense of
how easy it is to feel out of the game even before one has a chance
to be in it, was Joan Didion. She wrote, ``When I first saw New
York I was 20, and it was summertime, and I got off a DC-7 at the
old Idlewild temporary terminal in a new dress which had seemed
very smart in Sacramento, but seemed less smart already, even in
the old Idlewild temporary terminal.''
</P>
<P>
   That line, from an essay called ``Goodbye to All That,'' which
originally appeared in 1967 in The Saturday Evening Post, came back
to me the other afternoon as I sat in my kitchen near the Hudson
previewing the new episode of the HBO series ``Sex and the City,''
which begins its third season Sunday night. It stars the perky
Sarah Jessica Parker and is based on columns Candace Bushnell wrote
in the mid-1990s for The New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
   I watched not only the latest installment, which has Carrie
(played by Parker) and her gal pals tripping off to Staten Island
in their mules and tube tops to see a bunch of fire department
hunks wiggle around in their underwear at a pin-up contest, but
also all of the first season and most of the second. I cooked a ham
and made a strawberry pie.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell isn't a great writer. She doesn't have Didion's range
or Fran Lebowitz's wit, and the world she described _ often,
admittedly, against deadline _ would be unrecognizable to anyone
who had never spent evenings at Elaine's or in junior lofts
wondering why men didn't realize just how wonderful the eligible
women of New York are.
</P>
<P>
   But Bushnell was in the right place at the right time. She
picked up early on the strange gulf that existed between men and
women who were perhaps too smart or selective for their own good,
but who, in any case, could not see themselves sleeping with
someone who didn't have money or beauty, or at least some
incredible ability in the sack to make it worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this picture of Manhattan singles warily advancing
toward one another with no thought of building nice stable
relationships _ who cares about that? _ was both sad and funny. But
by the end of the '90s, with films like Neil LaBute's ``In the Co.
of Men'' taking an even colder view of modern romance, Bushnell's
``downtown babes'' and Gucci-clad ``modelizers'' had begun to seem
almost quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Until someone from HBO sent me the tapes, I had paid scant
attention to the television version of ``Sex and the City,'' an
oversight that might be construed as derelict on my part,
considering that the show has been widely praised for being up on
fashion trends. But I'm wary when the mainstream media calls a show
like ``Sex and the City'' influential, then cites examples of
trends it started, without evidence. It's the same concern I have
whenever the fashion elite get behind a single look or declare that
jewelry is out: the influence rarely travels as far from the center
as one might be led to believe by the fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't flip my skirt when people who work for fashion
companies told me they had successfully placed products, like
handbags, on the show, and hoped to do more in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Watching an earlier episode in which the show's four principal
characters struggle with their Vuitton bags as they board the
Hamptons Jitney, I can see how a little logo flogging might be good
for both Vuitton's business and establishing the characters'
priorities. But it's hard to think that a series that purports to
reflect hip New York is doing itself any good by showing stuff you
can get anywhere. Even I still expect New York to be emphatic when
it comes to knowing what's smart.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, though, the clothes selected by Patricia Field,
the show's costume coordinator, reflect what's happening in New
York and in fashion, and jibe as well with the characters'
personalities. In the season opener, the gimlet-eyed Samantha Jones
(played by Kim Cattrall) swans into a local firehouse wearing
turquoise fur and a leopard slip for some personal 911 relief from
Ricky, her latest slab of honey-coated beef. Ricky's sweet, but as
usual, Samantha isn't interested in what's between his ears.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene from next week's episode, Samantha discovers that the
stock trader she's just had sex with buys his suits in the boy's
department at Bloomingdale's. When the little guy counters with a
stiff insult, you get the feeling that Samantha has finally met her
match.
</P>
<P>
   The dopey art dealer Charlotte York (played by Kristin Davis)
turns up in chic strapless numbers, including a tube top (big this
summer), while Miranda Hobbes, the lawyer played by Cynthia Nixon,
sticks with her minimalist look. Gold hoop earrings are the most
conspicuous accessory, but this is not a surprise. They've been
making a comeback for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's wardrobe is something of a disappointment, or maybe the
fuzzy coats she has on over her clingy babe attire are simply a
reflection that she's still dragging her breakup with Big around
like a cord of wood. She seems in a funk, and not even the hint of
dirty mischief with a politician, for whom she thoughtfully dresses
like Jackie Kennedy (vintage Halston, ironed hair), can lighten the
load.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, as I was going through all those episodes, I
couldn't help feeling depressed myself. Not for Carrie. She isn't
such a tough nut to crack. At the end of last season, as she and
her friends were sitting around a cafe table (does anyone in New
York have that much time?) commiserating over her breakup with Mr.
Big, she said something that just confirmed my impression that the
series gets no closer to revealing the truth about New York and its
chop-breaking single girls than a bus ride through Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Barbra Streisand's politically charged character
Katie in the film ``The Way We Were,'' Carrie said, ``The world's
made up of two types of girls _ simple girls and the Katie girls.''
Everyone around the table smiled triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if Katie was going to the barricades, these girls are
going to Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from enjoying the sex scenes, some cool clothes and
moments of crisp repartee between Samantha and her big (and not so
tall) dates, I can't see people, even in other cities, sustaining
interest in characters and a plot line whose novelty had already
begun to wear off (hey, this is New York) when Darren Star, the
producer, turned it into a television series.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, looking at those four women sitting around
the table dishing their dates, isn't Star's ``Sex and the City''
just a swankier version of ``The Golden Girls''?

SOROS HEDGE FUND CHIEF EXECUTIVE RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tumult for the hedge fund empire of George Soros continued
Friday when Duncan Hennes, who was hired last summer to be chief
executive of Soros Fund Management, announced his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought in to do one thing, and George doesn't want to
do that anymore,'' Hennes, 43, said in a telephone interview. That
thing, he said, was to build a larger hedge fund business.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, a billionaire financier and philanthropist, announced in
April that his two top fund managers, Stanley Druckenmiller and
Nicholas Roditi, were leaving and that the fund that made Soros
famous, the Quantum Fund, would be renamed the Quantum Endowment
Fund and changed in emphasis to reduce exposure to risk.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, however, Hennes spoke of his hopes to build up
other parts of the hedge fund business and seemed to have no
intention of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Hennes said that Soros had decided not to move
forward aggressively in hedge funds, although the firm's operations
that invest in real estate and in private companies were continuing
to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``George needed to take some time to decide what he needed to
do,'' Hennes said. ``He has a lot of charitable obligations. He
needs to create a platform where he can manage his money in a way
that is less volatile, in a way that he can assure he will meet his
obligations to the charities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennes said he would step down on June 30, but remain as a
consultant to Soros Funds for another three months. He said he did
not know what he would do after that.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Soros Fund Management, Hennes was executive vice
president and treasurer at Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Soros Fund Management, said that
while the private equity and real estate operations were expanding,
more employees were expected to leave the hedge fund operation.
``We do expect some employees to leave on their own, and that
others will be asked to leave,'' he said. Soros employs about 240
people, although no figures were available regarding the hedge fund
business and the other operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Quantum Fund had comparatively good returns for three
decades, but stumbled earlier this year when it did not sell
technology stocks soon enough. It also lost money in foreign
currencies when it wrongly expected the euro to rise against the
dollar. That led to the departure of Druckenmiller and to Soros
deciding to seek a more conservative strategy. &QL;

COMMENTARY: WE ALL PASS GO. THEY COLLECT $200. 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At long last: Schadenfreude dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   This has not only been a great spring for those rooting for the
comeuppance of Bill Gates, but for anyone who has had quite enough
of New Economy New Millionaires and their irritatingly
unostentatious brand of ostentation. Just a short list of recent
flameouts includes boo.com (a fashion site that burned through $135
million in months), den.net (a ``digital entertainment network'' of
postage-stamp-sized ``entertainment'') and RedRocket.com (toys from
Nickelodeon). Among the countless former high fliers in a Wall
Street tailspin are Drkoop.com and Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy,
whose shares have dropped from $333 in March to around $23 today,
amid investigations for alleged accounting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these sites rode in on a wave of hype as excessive as
those that herald Hollywood's bigger bombs. (On the Web, as in show
business, the big hits are often sleepers.) Saylor was being
canonized in the press as a Medici _ for underwriting a dubious, if
free, on-line university _ just as his stockholders fell on his
sword. Now that these start-ups are in peril or ruin, their press
is almost as apocalyptic as the initial buzz was celebratory. When
Disney bought a 60 percent interest in Toysmart.com back in August,
an expert at Forrester Research gushed to The Associated Press,
``There's nothing bad in it for Disney.'' When Toysmart went
belly-up last week, another Forrester analyst authoritatively told
The AP it was ``the wrong company selling the wrong product at the
wrong time.'' Now you tell us!
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder if these pundits visit the sites they
initially tout. I found from personal experience five months ago
that den.net was nearly impenetrable even on a fast connection and
that no one in its office would come to the phone to explain why.
If anyone wonders whether Barnes &AMP; Noble has mastered online
bookselling, just try, as I did this week, to order from its
not-ready-for-e-time ``same-day delivery'' service. With
competitors like this, no one at Amazon need go sleepless in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally satisfying as these rags-to-riches-to-rags dot-com
sagas may be, however, they are often irrelevant to the long and
looming future of the Internet. Like some other favorite story
lines of the past few years _ the kiddie-porn scare, the ``Blair
Witch'' craze, the day-trader menace _ tales of the Nasdaq bubble
are transient sideshows in the Web's early gold-rush phase that may
look like quaint olden-days phenomena once the Internet is
seamlessly integrated into our lives. As with the original
California gold rush's prospectors, it's inevitable that more
dot-com prospectuses are going to pan fool's gold than pay dirt.
The disasters won't slow the progress of this new technology any
more than earlier economic setbacks did the spread of the railroad
and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The truly illuminating Internet stories are sometimes less
visible than the morality plays of hubristic e-celebrities and
evanescent IPO's. That may be because they are buried in the very
architecture of a technology few of us laymen understand _ or
because they involve the media's own selfish interests. Or both.
</P>
<P>
   Into this category falls the newest pair of corporate marriages
in the increasingly intertwined
Internet-cable-entertainment-telecommunications industry:
AT&AMP;T-MediaOne and AOL-Time Warner. The stories of these mammoth
couplings have been dissected as stock-price dramas and
captains-of-industry personality profiles, to be sure. But if it
hadn't been for the divine intervention of another corporate giant
last month _ Disney _ even a hint of the worst-case scenarios
possible in this new media landscape would have been invisible to
most Americans. Few still understand how these new powerhouses
could make our current cable and phone companies look like kindly
mom-and-pop operations by comparison.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   What Time Warner did to Disney, throwing ABC off its cable in
seven cities until a public outcry forced a retreat, is just a tiny
window into how these corporations can behave in their even more
powerful future, when cable TV service will be inseparable from
Internet service. There is nothing to stop one of these new
megaliths from exerting a larger and more surreptitious chokehold
on all the electronic services that their cable wires will bring by
the bundle into our homes tomorrow, from chat rooms to e-shopping
to movies. Even in the few weeks since the Disney fiasco, when you
might think Time Warner would be too chastened to risk more
censure, it has been caught misbehaving in Texas, where its cable
company offered its employees bounties to place bogus orders for a
rival Internet service offered by Southwestern Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has since apologized for its recent transgressions,
but if it can try to squelch Disney (itself of late described by
The Wall Street Journal as ``one of America's most aggressive
corporate bullies''), imagine what it can do to far smaller
companies, let alone consumers, once Disney and the other giants
inevitably make deals to secure their pieces of the pie. Not unlike
Windows, which blackballed Web software not made by Microsoft, or
the most recent edition of AOL, which snaked into its user's
computer settings to override competing programs, the future AOL-TW
threshold into the Internet/TV can be engineered for nefarious
purposes. It could, for instance, make its own products, like Time
and CNN, come on screen easily and fast while slowing down (or
blocking) the alternatives, whether Newsweek or Drudgewannabe.com.
It could do the same with merchants, TV channels or non-AOL
Internet service providers. In other words, it could control the
entertainment and even the news grid on your computer/TV screen
much as the movie studios (including Time Warner's ancestor, Warner
Brothers) limited Americans' entertainment choices in cities until
antitrust action ended their restrictive practices in 1948. The
result wouldn't be the democratic, go-anywhere-you-want Internet of
yore but a more elaborate version of cable TV, in which your cable
company adjudicates your programming choices.
</P>
<P>
   It would be like ``someone constantly dealing the deck and
knowing every card and shuffling at will, but never letting you
know if you're being dealt every card or not,'' says Jeffrey
Chester of the Center for Media Education. Gerald Levin, of Time
Warner, and Steve Case, of AOL, have pledged not to be naughty, but
even if we take them at their word, they'll not be running their
company forever. What's more, what they say already fails to square
with what they do. This week USA Today persuasively charged AOL
with foot-dragging on last summer's promise to open up its
instant-messenger system to all non-AOL Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote to any possible future misbehavior is not
necessarily to stop the merger _ a non-starter anyway _ but for
regulators to set simple rules of the information highway (and
build them into its construction) so that all comers have equal
access to its various lanes. Yet most of the political pressure on
Washington comes from the media giants, not the spottily informed
public. TV news, the main news source for most Americans, remains
silent about this part of the merger story, in which so much is at
stake for its corporate parents; it's easier to talk about Levin's
open-necked wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do politicians want to take on media corporations whose news
divisions cover them and whose donations increasingly support them.
At my request, the Center for Responsive Politics broke down total
campaign contributions by industry over the past decade, and the
result shows a rapid increase of total donations by media,
communications and electronics companies since the explosion of the
Internet _ a stiffer increase than even those made by the health
care industry. The parties more or less split the loot.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has taken a ``do-nothing attitude''
about insuring fairness for all in the Internet's future, according
to Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard law professor who has more than
anyone framed this issue. Nor is there any Teddy Roosevelt
Republican in sight to ride to the rescue. Still, some
public-interest advocates are hopeful that voters will be provoked
into anger over time, if only because media companies arrogant
enough to pull the plug on Regis Philbin may, like Microsoft before
them, eventually overplay their hand. But it may take something as
startling as a totalitarian new voice saying ``You've got mail'' _
Charlton Heston's, perhaps _ to wake the country up.

 &HT;    Giant baseballs make Turner Field debut
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So maybe your cutoff should have been the second beer.
</P>
<P>
   But that really was a giant baseball at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fans got the first look Friday at the Atlanta Braves'
and New York Yankees' ``All-Star Balls'' _ the first of 500 giant
plastic baseballs to be displayed throughout the city for Major
League Baseball's All-Star Game in July.
</P>
<P>
   The six-foot balls were unveiled during a pregame ceremony
Friday and will be on display in Monument Plaza in front of the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball promotion, which is patterned after the highly
successful Cows on Parade exhibit in Chicago last year, will run
for the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   So far, dozens of businesses have plunked down big bucks to buy
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Patron sponsors, at $27,000 each, include Georgia-Pacific Corp.,
Southern Co., Worldspan, iXL Enterprises, Bell South Corp., UPS,
PepsiCo Inc., Delta Air Lines, Bank of America, Priceline.com, and
the Sherwin -Williams Co.
</P>
<P>
   Patron sponsors get three balls to decorate and display _ one
each for an American and National League team and one to decorate
any way they want.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, sponsors get tickets to the All-Star Game and other
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We verbally have commitments from about seven more, but we
don't count them unless we have their checks in the bank,'' said
Bill Howard, vice president of tourism and public relations for the
Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, which is also a patron
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Others can purchase individual balls for $5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those have been sold. Buyers include MARTA, Marriott
International, Visa International, the Buckhead Life Group and Saks
Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Denmark, a furniture retailer, plans to display its
ball in front of its showroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an American and I'm still trying to get into the
sport,'' said John Querl, corporate controller and a native of
Zambia. ``I think it's a neat idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to have a city full of baseballs,'' Howard said.

WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL WILL NOT LOOK FURTHER INTO NATO BOMBING OF
YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. chief war crimes prosecutor said
Friday that there was no basis for a formal investigation into
whether NATO committed war crimes during the bombing of Yugoslavia
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although some mistakes were made by NATO, I am very satisfied
that there was no deliberate targeting of civilians or unlawful
military targets by NATO during the bombing campaign,'' the
prosecutor, Carla del Ponte of Switzerland, told the Security
Council Friday. She said that a detailed statement on her decision
would be released as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   A parliamentary commission from Russia, Yugoslavia's strongest
international supporter, and Western lawyers working for the
Yugoslav government, had brought allegations of NATO war crimes to
the tribunal last year. Several human rights groups have also
raised questions about NATO attacks on civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-week NATO bombing campaign was intended to stop Yugoslav
repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the Serbian province now
under the administration of NATO and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the NATO actions taken to the Balkans tribunal by critics
alleging war crimes were an airstrike on a passenger train crossing
a targeted bridge; the bombing of a Serbian television center;
killing of refugees in a convoy mistaken for soldiers; the use of
cluster bombs that can fragment over a wide area, in one case
hitting the grounds of a hospital; and the use of depleted uranium
in weapons. There were also more general allegations of genocide
and deliberate destruction of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am now able to announce my conclusion, following a full
consideration of my team's assessment of all complaints and
allegations, that there is no basis for opening an investigation
into any of those allegations or into other incidents related to
the NATO bombing,'' Del Ponte, a former Swiss attorney general,
told the council. She did not discuss the allegations themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans war crimes tribunal, based in the Hague, has played
down the importance of these charges since they were first made
public late last year. Officials have said that the tribunal was
formed to charge individuals, not institutions or organizations,
with war crimes. NATO officials have answered or dismissed the
charges, but have said errors were committed.
</P>
<P>
   Among these charges they include the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade. U.S. officials subsequently said that the
bombing was an unfortunate accident resulting from the use of
outdated maps an incorrect intelligence information, but China has
rejected this explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte, who is also chief prosecutor of a war crimes tribunal
for Rwanda, which is based in Arusha, Tanzania, conducted only an
informal study of the allegations against NATO, officials said. She
has been more deeply involved in formal charges against
Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, who was indicted by the
tribunal last year.
</P>
<P>
   But she told the council that she felt she had to examine the
allegations against NATO because it was her ``obligation and
responsibility'' to look into all complaints and charges. She said
that she had amassed a lot of material from Yugoslavia and
elsewhere to support the allegations, and that it had now all been
examined an analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte acknowledged that the NATO bombing campaign a year ago
and the indictment of Milosevic and other high-level Serbian
officials had all but ended cooperation from Yugoslavia, apart from
on the allegations against NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``This severely hampers my ability to conclude my investigations
involving Serbian victims,'' she said. She and her investigators
have been denied visas to enter Yugoslvia, she said, making it
impossible to talk with Serbs who claim to have been the victims of
war crimes by any side.
</P>
<P>
   The International War Crimes Tribunal for the Balkans was
created seven years ago to deal with atrocities committed in the
civil wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991. At the
start, it dealt mostly with Bosnia and Croatia, where abuses were
committed by Serbs, Croats and Muslims. A warrant is still out for
the arrest of the Serbian leader in Bosnia, Radovan Karadic, and
his military commander, Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the tribunal has extended its
investigations into Kosovo.

COMMENTARY: A GLASS HALF FULL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANYHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Of all the cruelties of apartheid,
the most malicious may have been the deliberate denial of
educational opportunity to blacks. Their segregated schools taught
``Bantu education,'' by design equipping them only for menial jobs;
and the government excluded all but a few from the country's great
universities.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a powerful symbol of change for me to watch a
graduation ceremony the other day at the University of the
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. It was for students of engineering,
regional planning and development, among others; and most of the
graduates were black.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many things in South Africa, the education story is
mixed. Many state schools, especially in rural areas, are
desperately under-equipped. Teachers are badly paid. But the state
schools in the formerly all-white suburbs, which now have large
numbers of black students, are maintaining standards _ and well-off
white families are mostly not moving their children to private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial thing to understand about South Africa is that it
has embarked on the second of two immense transitions. The first
was political: the change from rule by the white minority to
constitutional democracy. The second is economic and social: giving
more South Africans an appropriate share of the country's great
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The political change went astonishingly well. Prophets of doom
were confounded. The new political and legal system is working.
</P>
<P>
   The economic and social challenge is just as daunting. Income
distribution is grotesquely unequal. Apartheid's effects linger in
a vast class without adequate education. Unemployment is severe.
Crime is a serious problem, made to look worse by journalism's
focus on horror stories.
</P>
<P>
   But as any visitor can see, the fact is that South Africa is
functioning as a sophisticated modern society. During my visit
there were headlines about plans of the environment minister, Valli
Moosa, to ban four-wheel-drive vehicles from beaches and outlaw the
thin plastic bags that litter the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptical British columnist, Simon Jenkins of The Times,
visited a few months ago and wrote: ``Six years ago I would have
predicted that, by now, Nelson Mandela's successor would preside
over ailing business confidence, a sliding property market and a
flight of money. I would have been totally wrong. ... President
Thabo Mbeki has tamed inflation and has a sustained private-sector
boom.''
</P>
<P>
   International credit-rating firms recently gave South Africa an
investment-grade rating. A bond issue was oversubscribed, by, among
others, American pension funds. The Financial Times of London
commented: ``Not so long ago, bankers were more familiar with
Johannesburg's crime statistics than with South Africa's economy.
The enthusiastic response to Pretoria's bond issue shows how much
things have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial progress is impressive. But it leaves unanswered
the question of how to uplift the have-nots: the unemployed and the
rural poor who are not in the formal economy at all.
</P>
<P>
   A widespread corporate effort to bring blacks into
administrative jobs, backed by a national commitment to affirmative
action, is enlarging the black middle class quite rapidly. The
danger, though, is that a black elite will still leave the mass of
the population underemployed, poor _ and increasingly resentful.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge requires two further steps, I think. One is faster
economic growth to create jobs. That necessarily means more foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The other answer is more government action, for example to give
land to landless black farm workers and restore land to black
communities from which it was seized. The Ministry of Land is
supposed to be doing this but has so far not even spent the money
it has in its budget.

<P>
   Uplifting the deprived sectors of society no doubt requires some
sacrifice by whites of their economic position, which remains
extraordinarily privileged. Many resist the idea. There is still
little awareness that greater equality is essential to stability.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the problems, one must not forget what a difference the
end of apartheid and its repressive laws has made. A schoolteacher
in the town of Germiston, Joseph Tumahole, noted the difficulties
of his job. But he said: ``I am free now to say what I want to say.
I am free to go where I want to go. I am free to see who I want to
see.''

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ In the strongest signal yet that the
booming U.S. economy is finally slowing, the Labor Department

eight years and the first since the economy began to boom in the

 &HT;    Coke launches Dasani advertising campaign
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola is spending about $12 million on the first
national TV ad campaign to boost sales of Dasani, its year-old
bottled water that's become the fifth best-selling brand.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has developed a special 12-ounce plastic bottle
so Dasani can be sold out of vending machines that dispense
12-ounce cans. That could expand sales considerably because bottled
water is popular at workplaces, where can vending machines far
outnumber the 20-ounce bottle machines.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, which will include another $3 million of
spending in the print media, uses the tagline ``Life Simplified.''
It's aimed at Dasani's core drinkers _ women aged 25-49.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very busy and stressed,'' said Dasani brand manager
Monique Acevedo. ``So our message to her is to replenish her body
and mind with Dasani.''
</P>
<P>
   Acevedo said the national campaign, created by Berlin Cameron &AMP;
Partners, is being rolled out now after the company spent the past
year solidifying its distribution network.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, with only about a half year of distribution, Dasani
became the No. 5 water brand in the U.S.,'' said John Sicher,
editor and publisher of Beverage Digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can predict that in a year or two, it will be one of the top
two bottled water brands in the U.S., along with Pepsi's Aquafina.
Dasani will benefit from the power of the Coke bottling and
distribution system and from Coke's marketing muscle and
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million ad budget ``is a pretty good hunk of money to
put behind a small brand,'' Sicher said. But, he added, ``Dasani
will most certainly become a much bigger brand quite quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because the newer bottled water segment of the
industry is growing much faster than the more mature carbonated
soft-drink sector.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, sales of bottled water grew 35 percent to about 600
million cases, while sales of carbonated soft drinks in the United
States increased 0.5 percent to about 10 billion cases, according
to Beverage Digest data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amercian consumers have been developing a love affair for
bottled war in portable packages,'' Sicher said.
</P>
<P>
   Dasani's new 12-ounce bottle could be expanded to other
Coca-Cola beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're exploring with other brands, but Dasani
is leading the way,`` said Coca-Cola spokesman Scott Williamson.

   In a dramatic display of the improved state of Greek-Turkish

in the western Peloponnesus, as part of a NATO exercise in

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Every square inch of land counts in the
reckoning of victory and defeat in the Middle East. And every inch
along the Lebanese-Israeli border is going to be counted, probably
twice, before anyone can say whether Israel's withdrawal from
southern Lebanon last week will ultimately count as an installment
on regional peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine days since the pullout, the frontier between the
countries has remained tranquil for the first time in more than 25
years. The only spike in tension occurred on Sunday, when Israeli
soldiers fired rubber-coated bullets at a few Lebanese men who,
giddy with newfound bravado, plunged through a border fence to
plant a Hezbollah flag under the noses of their longtime enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still dangerous territory. Although the physical
boundaries between Lebanon and Israel have been redrawn, the
political map contains the same ambushes and obstacles as before
the Israeli retreat.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Syria has not made its own deal with Israel to return
the occupied Golan Heights, the potential for instability and
violence remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis may no longer wake up in the morning to hear of
another soldier killed in southern Lebanon,'' said Joseph Samaha, a
Lebanese expert who writes for Al Hayat, the pan-Arab daily
newspaper. ``But still, each day, in terms of regional strategy,
they will know they can never enjoy peace or integrate into the
Middle East until they have an agreement with Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria has been sending mixed signals about how it will behave in
the new atmosphere. In the extreme, experts said, Syria could
encourage guerrilla attacks on Israeli targets in Chebaa Farms, a
strip of land abutting the Golan Heights that the Lebanese
government, with mild Syrian backing, claims as its own.
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak of violence, with the expected Israeli reprisals,
could ruin Syria's efforts over recent weeks to gain international
approval by cooperating with the United Nations over the Lebanon
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Syria could also keep the temperature in the region turned up by
more limited, and less bloody, means. It could permit Lebanon,
which has so far refused to claim sovereignty over the liberated
south and send its army into the liberated zone, to keep on arguing
indefinitely with the United Nations over whether the withdrawal
has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had years of low-intensity warfare here,'' said Simon M.
Karam, a lawyer in Beirut and a former ambassador to the United
States. ``Now we will have a low-intensity diplomatic imbroglio, a
crisis that's always brewing at just over 98.6 degrees, like
someone who is mildly sick.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lebanon, a tiny nation of barely 4.5 million people, is
effectively a satellite state to its bigger and more militarized
neighbor, Syria. Some 30,000 Syrian soldiers are stationed in
Lebanon, and the Lebanese government always toes the Syrian line on
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Syrian strategy, in peace negotiations with
Israel and through the Hezbollah guerrillas it encouraged to attack
Israeli occupation forces, has been to link the liberation of
southern Lebanon to the recovery of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will not enjoy peace, Syrian officials have often said,
until it leaves the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. Lebanese
officials, taking their cue from Damascus, refused to negotiate
with Israel, insisting that the occupation of southern Lebanon has
to end, but always adding that they could never sign a separate
peace agreement before Syria regained its land.
</P>
<P>
   That stand was shaken when Israel announced three months ago
that it would cut its losses and quit southern Lebanon, with or
without a peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian reaction was summed up in a warning from Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa that such a move would be suicidal. In
Lebanon, the prospect of a unilateral Israeli pullout caused a
shiver of panic, and officials immediately raised other issues.
</P>
<P>
   No Israeli pullout would comply with U.N. resolutions unless
Lebanese prisoners in Israel were freed, the officials said.
Palestinian refugees have to be given the right of return, and the
United Nations has to disarm Palestinians in refugee camps in
Lebanon so that they could not, in theory, attack Israel and
provoke fresh Israeli retaliation against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Since the withdrawal, Lebanon has repeated those demands and
added new ones, like recovering Chebaa Farms.
</P>
<P>
   Although Syria has permitted Lebanon to act as its devil's
advocate, Syrian officials have also tried hard to portray
themselves as cooperative with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   This week, according to a U.N. envoy, the Syrian officials said
they accepted the U.N. position that for purposes of verifying
whether Israel has complied with U.N. Resolution 425, the pullout
will be complete, even if it does not include Chebaa Farms.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, from 1978, calls for Israel's complete
withdrawal from the Lebanese territory that it occupied in that
year. Most of the Chebaa Farms land was seized by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   But for their Lebanese clients, Syrian officials also left their
position muddy by reassuring Lebanon this week that Chebaa Farms
was also occupied Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
   The murkiness of the Syrian stance has left the Lebanese
government and the Syrian-backed Hezbollah militia floundering.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Hezbollah official, Muhammad Raad, said this week that
the militia had a right to continue its armed struggle against
Israel until Chebaa Farms had been returned to Lebanese control and
the Lebanese government had verified that Israel had left every
inch of Lebanese territory. But Raad would not say whether
Hezbollah would exercise that right.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we say we want to claim our land back, we are not going
to act carelessly,'' he said. ``We will resist in the right time
and the right place, so the resistance will be effective. It could
take 20 years even. We are very patient, and we will not be in any
dispute with Lebanon or with Syria.''

FORMER HEARTBREAKER STAN LYNCH COMPLETES DON HENLEY'S `INSIDE
JOB' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL DEYOUNG   
 The Gainesville Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Working as Don Henley's co-producer on the album ``Inside Job''
was Stan Lynch's biggest job yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metaphorically, it's like I've built a lot of small houses,
and this is the first big building that I've really tried to
build,'' said Lynch, who's stayed happily behind the scenes since
leaving Tom Petty's Heartbreakers in 1993. ``But it's been a
logical progression. If I'd tried to do this 10 years ago, it
would've been impossible. I would've freaked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Lynch said, he was miserable in the
Heartbreakers, where he was expected to play drums and keep his
musical ideas to himself. Post-Petty, he has produced a dozen
albums by smaller artists. ``Now I'm getting more comfortable,'' he
said. ``To make a higher-profile record is a little easier for me.
It's natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, 45, grew up in Gainesville, Fla., and like Petty and the
other Heartbreakers left in his 20s to seek rock 'n' roll fame and
fortune in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never liked Henley's old band much. Henley, Lynch
said, ``was part of the aristocracy. Don was part of something I
was already rebelling against. I didn't give them any respect for
having come up the hard way. I thought those guys were born with
silver spoons in their mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   The two became running buddies in the mid-'80s, and co-wrote
several Henley hits, including ``The Last Worthless Evening'' and
``The Garden of Allah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't talk about each other's bands,'' Lynch said.
``Don didn't have any big love affair with the Petty band, and I
was no big Eagles wonk. I think there was a begrudging admiration,
that we both came from small Southern towns and actually made a
living at this.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Inside Job,'' Lynch has co-writing credits on nearly all
the songs. ``Sometimes he'll turn in a track, just a nebulous piece
of music, and I'll like it,'' he said. ``And we build from there.
Or sometimes Don and I will get in a room and pace around and
scream at each other about some book we've been reading, and that
could become a lyric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or Don will say something that will trigger a thought. There's
a song on the record called `My Thanksgiving,' we were talking
about concentration camp victims, and people who have real
problems, and physical things they have to overcome. Neither one of
us have really ever had a bad day _ how do you tell the world how
fortunate you are? That's how it started. He's a thinking guy. He's
not a stoned rock star.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said he believes Henley's new-found domesticity _ married
in 1995, he is the father of three small children _ has smoothed
some of the former Eagle's famously rough edges, something that's
reflected on every track on ``Inside Job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside Job,'' Lynch said, is a portrait of Don Henley today.
``It's not going to resonate with Sugar Ray's audience, and I'm OK
with that,'' he said. ``As a producer, my first job is `Don, did
you make the record you wanted to make?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning he would say `This chronicle of this time in my
life is important to me,' and I knew I was doing my job.''

FORTUNE TELLING FOR PROFIT AND POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This column has been lent a crystal ball for one
week. Reception is a bit fuzzy, but here goes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve will raise interest rates once or twice by
the end of the summer, and then will call a time out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six rate increases in less than a year, to little obvious
effect, have left economists and analysts fretting that monetary
policy has lost its punch. But now there are at least tentative
signs that the rip-roaring economy is slowing. Moreover, the Fed
still has faith in its tools, and after tightening by another
quarter-point at the end of this month, and perhaps again in August
if its hawks insist, it will pause to reassess the outlook.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that technology and globalization have changed the
economy in ways that even Alan Greenspan does not fully understand,
and slowing its growth may require a bigger dose of interest-rate
medicine than in business cycles past.
</P>
<P>
   But monetary policy seems to be working much the way it always
has. Long-term interest rates on corporate debt have risen
substantially, and companies are turning away from bond issuance
and toward bank loans and commercial paper to avoid being locked
into high-cost long-term debt.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the cost of borrowing short-term will rise so
much that companies will choose to defer plans to expand or
modernize _ or they will absorb the higher interest costs in the
form of diminished profits. Either way, business activity and the
economy will slow.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer mortgage rates have jumped and the housing market is
cooling. Retail spending may have peaked. Stocks are volatile but
no longer rising relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is still so low, and consumer confidence so high,
that Greenspan and his colleagues are not comfortable holstering
their weapons quite yet. But unless the stock market takes off
again or unambiguous acceleration in growth and inflation appear,
the Fed will show great patience later this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The federal budget surplus will again prove larger than
expected, with implications for the presidential race and the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the White House will update their long-term surplus
projections over the summer; both will rise substantially,
reflecting the strength of tax receipts this year and the spreading
consensus that the economy is capable of higher rates of
noninflationary growth than in the past. The economy has been so
strong that economists now expect a fiscal-2000 surplus of at least
$200 billion and perhaps $225 billion; in January the Congressional
Budget Office was estimating $176 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even if growth slows substantially, the economy will still be
bigger than had been forecast, yielding more tax revenue, and the
budget office has gradually been raising its estimates of growth
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at Goldman, Sachs recently raised the possibility
that this summer's new surplus numbers could allow the federal
government to pay off the entire $3.5 trillion national debt held
by the public as soon as 2007, six years ahead of the Clinton
administration's current schedule.
</P>
<P>
   More money on the table would give George W. Bush an opportunity
to argue that the nation can afford both his big tax cut plan and
his proposal to create private investment accounts within Social
Security. Vice President Al Gore would get a chance to call both
for accelerated reduction of the national debt and for additional
spending on Democratic priorities like adding prescription drug
coverage to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defining and nurturing the new economy will emerge as a major
political issue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Congress _ especially in the House _ the two parties will
continue falling all over each other to prove that they are au
courant with the wired world (and happy to receive its campaign
contributions).
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will push through a bill to extend for five years
the current moratorium on Internet taxation, and the two parties
will reach agreement on granting more visas to skilled workers from
abroad to meet demand from technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   The whole topic of the government's role in the new economy will
take center stage when the federal judge presiding over the
Microsoft antitrust case orders, perhaps this week, that the
company be broken up.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they maneuver for political advantage, politicians
will continue trying to decipher what these issues mean to voters.
A recent poll by the centrist Democratic Leadership Council found
voters to be optimistic about the new economy's prospects, dubious
that it should be regulated like any other industry and willing to
endure more frequent job changes but insistent that government
support job training and education.
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure: This crystal ball appears to be a prototype,
and carries no warranty. Check back in a few months to determine
its accuracy.

FED'S MOVES BRIGHTEN THE OUTLOOK FOR EQUITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the Goldilocks economy? The not too hot, not too cold,
low inflation porridge beloved by Alan Greenspan and financial
markets?
</P>
<P>
   Although it's too early to say for sure, the latest numbers seem
to indicate that what had been a steaming dish is beginning to
cool. But there is little reason, at this point, to suspect it will
turn stone cold.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, purchasing managers said the manufacturing sector
expanded in May, but not as fast as previously. And the government
said the private sector actually shed some jobs last month, but not
too many.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of stuff is music to investors. The Nasdaq had its
best week ever, rising more than 19 percent. The Dow and the S&AMP;P
500 also moved up briskly.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Callies, chief United States market strategist at
Credit Suisse First Boston, took some time last week to talk about
the economy and the stock market as spring begins to molt into
summer. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. The data suggests that the Fed's interest rate increases are
beginning to slow the economy. Is that how you read these numbers?
</P>
<P>
   A. We think economic growth is plateauing, and will gradually
slow down over the next several quarters. But there is a lot of
natural volatility in reports like retail sales and in housing
data, and activity there is not weak. By the end of the summer, we
will get more conclusive evidence that the Fed tightening is having
an effect.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the stock market has assumed a bigger slowdown than is
coming, a slowdown that will cause the Fed to ease. But we may be
waiting for a while before we know for sure that the Fed has moved
to neutral. I don't think we will know the Fed has reached that
point until sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So you think the Fed hasn't yet finished tightening?
</P>
<P>
   A. We see two more tightenings of one-quarter percentage point
apiece, the first later this month and another in August. Then we
think the Fed will be on hold. The Fed is trying to slow the U.S.
economy to what is still a healthy growth rate against the backdrop
of the first synchronized global expansion that we have seen in a
dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that every region of the world is in a reasonably
healthy recovery mode will place some demand on the supply of goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is therefore operating in a situation where global
growth is reinforcing itself. That will put a floor under global
inflation, albeit at a low level.
</P>
<P>
   We maintain this is potentially good news, because if the Fed is
in a gradualist monetary mode that means it might tolerate a little
inflation without going overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does this mean for stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A. All in all, this is a fairly benign environment for equity
prices. We think the market is in a trading range, and will tread
water until price/earnings multiples get down to the point where
there is a little bit of headroom. We are almost there.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much cheaper does the market have to get? And what sort
of a trading range are you talking about?
</P>
<P>
   A. In order to support a major rally, we need to see multiples
down another 10 percent or so. But that doesn't mean prices have to
fall. If they stay at these levels, profits will catch up over the
next couple of quarters. Trading range corrections are a substitute
for faster, steeper corrections, where prices fall by 25 percent or
so.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, the S&AMP;P 500 could go as high as 1,540 to 1,550
and the Nasdaq composite could go back to 4,000 or 4,100 and still
not change the sideways trend.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the risks to this forecast on the upside, and on the
downside?
</P>
<P>
   A. Bull markets need liquidity in the form of excess money. In
order for the market to break out of the trading range on the
upside, we would need to see a very substantial increase in
liquidity, and we would need to see it over the next month or so.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, a major correction in the S&AMP;P 500 could only
occur as a result of a major accident. And the economy, monetary,
financial market and foreign exchange risks of this occurring are
probably as low as they have been in many years. The one residual
weak point in this scenario is that margin debt was not totally
neutralized in the April correction. But in all, the environment is
remarkably benign.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It has been widely noted that while valuations in the
aggregate are high, big chunks of the stock market are cheap, and
have been for some time. Do you agree?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are pieces of many sectors that look quite good.
</P>
<P>
   The central concept is to identify companies that deliver growth
at a moderate price. That is in contrast to last year, when the
trick was to find the fastest-growing companies and buy them,
because someone else would come in afterwards and pay more. You can
find a lot of the companies I am talking about now in the capital
goods area.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of electrical equipment companies are developing
new-economy growth rates and are trading at old-economy prices.
</P>
<P>
   Three names we like are SCI Systems, Sanmina and General
Electric, which is not overpriced relative to the top-line growth
it is generating.(BOX) &QL;

ROMAN LOCATION OF GAY PRIDE FESTIVAL HAS VATICAN MIFFED 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ World Pride Roma, a global gay pride festival, is
expected to draw gays from all over the world to Rome on July 1 for
a week's worth of conferences, fashion shows, a gay pride parade,
and a concert featuring Gloria Gaynor and The Village People.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, which is host to a Holy Year for religious pilgrims
at the same time, is not amused.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Roman Catholic Church sought this past week to
block the World Pride event, it inadvertently turned it into one of
the most politically charged _ and closely watched _ events on
Rome's Jubilee calendar. The clash between the Vatican and World
Pride organizers has noisily spilled over into national _ and even
international _ politics and has filled newspaper front pages, talk
shows and parliamentary debate.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's center-right opposition, already gearing up for
elections next year, has molded the timing of the gay event into a
political bludgeon, deepening divisions within Italy's already
frayed center-left government.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, breaking with his predecessor
Massimo d'Alema and some of his own cabinet members, chimed in last
week, saying the scheduling of a gay event during a Jubilee was
``inopportune.''
</P>
<P>
   The furor drove one cabinet official to come out of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, Italy's minister of agricultural
policy, said in the current issue of the weekly magazine Panorama
that he is bisexual, a rare breach of privacy that he said was
inspired by what he considered the unjust attacks on gay pride
events.
</P>
<P>
   But the politician who has drawn the most fire is Rome's liberal
mayor, Francesco Rutelli, who first welcomed the World Pride event,
then this week withdrew the city's support, alienating many within
his own center-left constituency while failing to appease the
church.
</P>
<P>
   By stepping forward, then back, Rutelli helped make the World
Pride event into an international cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   ``They advertised it far better than we ever could,'' Leigh
Christopher, a gay events organizer from San Francisco said at the
World Pride offices in the Mario Miele Center, an Italian gay
rights association. Organizers say they are expecting as many as
300,000 to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hold the World Pride festival in Rome was made
in 1997, although some in the organization argued that the event
should be held in a city better known for gay rights, like
Amsterdam, Netherlands, or New York. But the lure of Rome during a
Jubilee of the Roman Catholic Church, which condemns homosexual
acts as sinful, won out. ``There was a compelling argument for the
opportunity provided by a Jubilee year to open discussion on
religion and homophobia,'' said Deborah Oakley-Melvin, a former
president of the San Francisco Gay Pride association who is helping
organize the Rome event. The response was worse, and therefore
better, than she had expected.
</P>
<P>
   With ill-masked delight, Oakley-Melvin said, ``This is turning
into another Stonewall,'' a reference to the 1969 uprising of gays
against a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village.
That event was considered the beginning of the modern gay-rights
movement in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in Italy, a country that never had anti-homosexual
legislation, even under Mussolini, gay rights has not had the
political or social resonance found in the United States or
Germany. It never experienced a Stonewall riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy is a classic example of a Catholic country _ everyone
does everything, but the important thing is not to say it,''
Massimo Consoli, an activist and historian of gay rights, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italian homosexuals never had to fight the kind of government
repression found in other countries, so there has never been a
strong gay movement here _ until now.'' He added, ``The Vatican is
giving us a visibility that nobody has accorded us in centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The church was first to express dismay over the propriety of
holding a gay pride festival during a Holy Year. Cardinal Camillo
Ruini, president of the Italian Conference of Bishops, complained
publicly in January. He was soon followed by Cardinal Angelo
Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state. ``The authorities know that
Rome is a Holy City,'' Sodano said.
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials and some political leaders worried that, among
other things, the gay festival would attract drag pontiffs to the
streets of Rome. But the Amato government's desire to curb the gay
event has incurred the wrath of many groups, including Italian
Jews. ``We Jews are really sorry about this debate against
homosexuals,'' Amos Luzzatto, president of the Union of Italian
Jewish Communities, told the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero. He said
he wanted to express solidarity with homosexuals sent by the Nazis
to death camps alongside Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Few politicians, right or left, have expressed outright
homophobia, insisting that the timing of the gay pride event is the
problem. But conservative politicians who fiercely oppose the
city's being host to a gay festival during the Jubilee have not
warmed to Amato's efforts to distance himself from the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot wash his hands of it,'' Silvano Moffa, president of
the province of Rome, and a member of the right-wing party,
National Alliance, said of Amato. ``In this Jubilee, Amato is
turning into the Pontius Pilate of the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, representatives of the Christian Democratic
Center, a small center-right opposition party, held a protest rally
against the World Pride festival, showing cautionary video clips of
a recent San Francisco Gay pride event that featured men dressed as
nuns, ``The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.'' Only a few dozen
people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After the Vatican made its feelings known, Rutelli asked
organizers in February to postpone their festival for a week,
arguing that the parade, fashion show, and other outdoor events
could conflict with religious Jubilee events. ``There was no
pressure from the church,'' Rutelli explained in an interview.
``There was opposition from the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley-Melvin said that the organizers refused to change their
schedule, having already unilaterally decided not to begin the
festival the last week in June, which is the anniversary of the
Stonewall riots, but which also coincides with the June 29 feast
day of Saints Peter and Paul, a Roman holiday. They also canceled a
planned drag queen contest to spare Roman sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Its just a provocation,'' she said. ``They didn't think we
would respond in any other way than `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rutelli said he was outraged by what he described as an
uncooperative attitude by the event's organizers. ``I didn't tell
them not to do it, I just asked them to postpone it by just one
week,'' the mayor said. He said that the $150,000 the city pledged
to help pay for cultural events within the festival would instead
go to cover municipal expenses, such as police protection and trash
removal. And the organizers would no longer be allowed to display
the city logo. ``The event will take place,'' he added, ``but
without city sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutelli, who publicly urged the organizers to spare the feelings
of ``an aging pope,'' said he had sought a postponement because the
week of July 1 includes several important Jubilee events, including
a Polish pilgrimage. ``The World Pride rally is complicated and
delicate because there is going to be a Jubilee with 200,000 Polish
pilgrims,'' he said. ``Rome is a free and open city, but there is
also a question of public order.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Stanislaw Heymo, a Dominican priest who organizes all
Polish pilgrimages, said that in fact, less than 50,000 Poles would
come to Rome on July 6 and 7, and would hold an evening prayer
meeting at the Colosseum on July 7, the same evening as the
festival's ``Leather World Pride Party.'' He was not pleased by the
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very bad thing, it would be better to spend money on
the poor and immigrants because homosexuals are rich, from rich
families,'' he complained. ``They do nothing other than travel
throughout the world, flaunting their sickness.''

MONEY &AMP; MEDICINE: PATIENT, KNOW THY RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 4) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, Congress has passed several laws designed to
help people remain insured when they change jobs and obtain
coverage for life-altering medical situations that insurers often
shunned.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, most people pay little attention to what their
rights are in such situations until they need them, and then may be
unaware of the new laws' existence.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know many 25-year-old single men who are deeply obsessed
with the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996? (It
was designed to eliminate what came to be called drive-by births by
mandating that insurers cover minimum hospital stays following
childbirth.)
</P>
<P>
   Employers offering health insurance are required by law to keep
their workers abreast of the latest changes in health care law. But
they often go about it in ways that are sure to escape notice.
</P>
<P>
   Annual notices to employees are required for some laws, but a
lot of other important information about health care rights is
buried in what are called summary plan descriptions of benefits
packages, mounds of legalese about as readable as the package
inserts in a Tylenol box. Smaller companies often count on health
maintenance organizations to inform their employees, and HMOs have
been known to fall down on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Taylor, a principal of the Teare Group, a health care and
human resources consultancy, said the first problem involved in
keeping employees informed is that employers often do not
understand what they have to provide in writing. ``The second is
that the employee may not read it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that the Department of Labor, which has
jurisdiction over many of the laws, fields 1,700 calls a week on
health care questions alone. The department has begun to audit
companies to make sure they are giving their workers the necessary
information, especially on the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act, or HIPAA.
</P>
<P>
   Among other provisions, the 1996 law expanded protections for
people with serious medical conditions who change jobs, and it has
helped millions of people, but millions more know nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, as long as there has not been a break in health
care coverage of 63 days or more, the waiting periods commonly
imposed before a new employer's health insurance plan will cover
pre-existing conditions can be reduced or eliminated entirely.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, say you have a chronic heart problem and were
treated for it under your former employer's health plan, but your
new employer's plan does not cover pre-existing conditions for the
first year of employment.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of time your condition was covered by your former
employer's plan counts against that waiting period _ if it was at
least a year, coverage under your new plan begins immediately.
(Your former employer is required to give you a certificate proving
prior coverage.) A similar provision applies to new employees'
children with pre-existing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, employers cannot discriminate against workers
because of chronic conditions. For example, ``under HIPAA, you
cannot charge an individual a higher premium just because they have
diabetes,'' said Leslie Kramerich, acting assistant secretary of
the Labor Department unit that oversees pensions and benefits.
``Some employers used to say, `We will let you in, but because you
have diabetes, you have to pay a 40 percent higher premium,' or
they would keep you out, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires that employees who give birth be permitted
to enroll the baby for coverage immediately, and not have to wait
for the next open enrollment period.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct is that people don't realize how important HIPAA
is,'' said James P. McElligott Jr., a lawyer in Richmond, Va., who
specializes in health care law. ``Today, as a result of HIPAA, if a
child is born to a couple or adopted, that child can have
cradle-to-grave health care coverage no matter what its medical
condition is. That is an enormous change from the way things used
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think your employer has failed to comply with the law, or
you are leaving a job, or you want to understand the basics and the
many exceptions and nuances of HIPAA and other health care laws,
the Department of Labor offers an easy-to-navigate Web site,
www.dol.gov/dol/pwba, with plenty of information. Too much, in
fact: unless you are a policy wonk, I do not recommend clicking and
wading through, say, ``Health Insurance Portability for Group
Health Plans; Interim Rules and Proposed Rule (04/08/1997).''
</P>
<P>
   But documents explaining every twist and turn in health care law
in exhaustive detail are there. Georgetown University also
maintains a Web site for consumers with specifics about the laws
and state-by-state guidelines in modern standard English:
data.georgetown.edu/research/ihcrp/hipaa/.

FORTUNE TELLING FOR PROFIT AND POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Notoriously vulnerable to rising interest rates, utility stocks
fell 23.5 percent last year, their worst performance in a
quarter-century, as the Federal Reserve made credit more expensive
on three occasions, starting June 30.
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened this year as the Fed raised rates another
three times? The stocks have not only rallied but have performed
better than any other group. The Standard &AMP; Poor's utility index
has returned 18.6 percent through Friday while investors in the S&AMP;P
500 have lost 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What's to explain this turnaround? Several things, industry
analysts and portfolio managers say, not least the fact that
utilities are among the few sectors that pay handsome dividends,
resulting in yields that are high even by historical standards.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this year's rally, investors in many utilities are
flirting with 7 percent _ quadruple the 1.6 percent average yield
for the Dow industrials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dividend income is one of the few real things you get from a
company,'' observed William Reaves, president of a Jersey City
money management company that specializes in utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Unfashionable as such thinking has become in a
technology-dominated investment world, it is clearly attracting
some investors partial to equities but weary of the gyrations that
have become commonplace on the Nasdaq and, all too often, for
high-priced blue chip stocks as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're jumping into utilities,'' said Edward Tirello, who
analyzes the group for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. The appeal is not
just high yields, he added, but that utility stocks are highly
liquid and the companies in many cases offer prospects for growth
in a newly deregulated environment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the industry is steadily, though slowly, shedding its
traditional reputation as supersensitive to changes in interest
rates. No longer do most utilities need to borrow huge amounts to
build new generating capacity. Many of the companies are raking in
so much cash that they have become lenders and investors
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And many analysts say that after years of underperforming,
utilities are bargains.
</P>
<P>
   The values are pretty compelling right now,'' said Daniele
Seitz, director of equity research at UBS Warburg. She cited
``hidden value'' that deregulation is unlocking for many companies,
such as from energy-trading and telecommunications, and the
relatively friendly attitude that state officials have taken in
awarding compensation for so-called stranded costs for plants that
are no longer competitively viable.
</P>
<P>
   With federal encouragement, half the states have facilitated
some form of free market in electricity and natural gas, with
consumers getting a choice of suppliers. This kind of deregulation
is changing the risk-reward profile of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although strategies differ, the industry is gravitating roughly
into three camps _ those oriented toward generating power (like
Edison International, based in Rosemead, Calif.), those that
distribute it (GPU of Morristown, N.J.) and those that follow the
traditional route, doing both (Southern of Atlanta, Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Generation is considered riskier but distribution remains
subject to price regulation, and analysts say it is too early to
know the winning strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know which plan's going to work out better,'' Tirello
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the companies do stand to benefit from strong growth in
demand for power, which many believe will result in shortages in
some parts of the country this summer. And there is little risk
that fresh capacity will put downward pressure on rates anytime
soon, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, utility dividends, after a decade in which many
companies cut payouts in response to Wall Street pressure to
transform themselves into vehicles for rapid growth, seem
relatively secure again. That fad is over, Reaves said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about favorite stocks, Seitz cited American Electric
Power, a Columbus, Ohio, holding company yielding 6.86 percent with
an energy-trading operation, good fuel diversification and the
scale to be a major supplier. She also likes New Orleans-based
Entergy (4.18 percent), the company that has the industry buzzing
about its aggressive embrace of deregulation, and Duke Energy of
Charlotte, N.C. (3.81 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Tirello favors Atmos Energy, a Dallas-based gas distributor
(6.20 percent); American Water Works, ``a natural monopoly'' in
Voorhees, N.J., (3.76 percent); and such electrics as the
Dallas-based TXU (6.76 percent) and New Jersey's Public Service
Enterprise Group (5.88 percent).
</P>
<P>
   As for Reaves, who has been following the industry for some 50
years, the high-yield standout is the St. Louis-based Ameren,
paying 6.98 percent and increasing its earnings 6 percent a year.
He also likes Virginia's Dominion Resources (5.73 percent) and, for
the patiently venturesome, the growth-oriented Peco Energy in
Pennsylvania (2.31 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``The stocks tend to do better when there's caution in the
market'' generally, Reaves said. But he said many investors were
still inhibited by old notions about these suppliers of basic
household services.
</P>
<P>
   That is likely to change.

WHAT'S HIDING IN BIG BLUE'S SMALL PRINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miami, Vt.)   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, the 30 percent growth in operating income that
IBM booked last year looks impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Closer inspection, though, shows that just under a third of the
increase came from IBM's employee pension plan. The combination of
a roaring stock market and lower costs associated with IBM's
controversial switch to a new sort of pension plan generated $799
million in 1999. Accounting rules let such gains go into a
company's income statement, although the company cannot spend the
money for anything but pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Gains like these are doing more and more for corporate earnings.
In 1996, pension fund growth amounted to just 1.8 percent of IBM's
operating income. Last year, the pension contribution was 6.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because these gains are typically buried in financial
statements, shareholders may not understand how a company's
earnings are augmented by pension gains.
</P>
<P>
   To highlight this and other financial reporting concerns, Lynn
E. Turner, chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, sent a letter to the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants last December. Well before annual report season,
Turner identified problem areas that could obscure a company's true
financial picture. He warned auditors to be alert to the issues
when preparing financial statements for their corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's letter said that if a company changed its pension plan,
or if the plan's gains or losses were likely to have a material
impact on the company's financial condition, liquidity or results,
the information should appear up front in the ``Management's
Discussion and Analysis'' section of the annual report, not back in
the footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   So why do the gains attributable to IBM's pension plan appear
only in Footnote W?
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Leas, an IBM employee and shareholder, has been asking
just that question. Last Thursday, Leas, an advisory engineer for
IBM in Burlington, Vt., queried Louis V. Gerstner Jr., IBM's
chairman, about it by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday, Leas had not heard back.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter why the pension details were not in
management's discussion and analysis, Carol Makovich, an IBM
spokeswoman, said, ``In terms of changes year to year, we don't
believe it is quantitatively or qualitatively material.'' Makovich
added that IBM's reporting is in strict compliance with accounting
rules.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is just one of many companies that continues to bury details
about its pension plans' gains. But Big Blue could be clearer.
Though still in a footnote, General Electric was much more direct,
for example. GE's report made it obvious at a glance how much
pension income contributed to operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM's annual report is one of the most complicated,'' said
Brad Perry, former chairman and now consultant at David L. Babson &AMP;
Co., an investment advisory firm in Cambridge, Mass. ``Obfuscation
is the name of the game, not just for IBM but for a lot of
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Another area of IBM's financial report that is difficult to
fathom concerns stock buybacks, which have totaled $14.2 billion in
the past two years. By reducing the number of shares outstanding,
the buybacks have helped IBM's per-share earnings grow at a
respectable 10.5 percent _ masking the company's slow growth in
revenue and income, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   But the purchases come at a cost, he added: IBM's ratio of debt
to total capital is 54 percent, up from 31 percent four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to buy back shares if you have excess cash
flow,'' Perry said, ``but when you're loading up the balance sheet
with debt to jazz up your earnings, that's more suspect. And it
certainly is a game that has an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the SEC will follow up its words with action. But
shareholders should be vigilant for accounting gimmicks regardless.
After all, not all earnings are equal. &QL;

 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ There are no malls, fast food chains,
casinos or traffic lights on the Puerto Rican off-island of Vieques
_ not yet, anyway.
 &HT;    But with Puerto Ricans poised to vote on whether to evict the
U.S. Navy from Vieques, hoteliers have turned an admiring eye on
the beach-lined island. ``Expansion is more than inevitable; it's
happening,'' says Vieques Chamber of Commerce President Burr Vail,
who owns the 16-room Hacienda Tamarindo, one of the largest inns on
the island.
 &HT;    Vieques is the only place in the world where the Atlantic fleet
of the Navy practices live bombing, making it a less-than-perfect
spot for vacationers. ``We had a good relationship with the Navy,''
explains Carmen Leticia Guadalupe, a tourism office representative
for the Municipa-lity of Vieques. ``But it was an impediment to
major tourism development.''
 &HT;    After years of off-and-on protests, anti-Navy sentiment
galvanized in April 1999, when two 500-pound bombs fell off course,
killing a civilian security guard and wounding four people. In
early February of this year, Puerto Rican Governor Pedro Rossello
agreed to let bombing resume in exchange for a referendum on the
Navy's future. That referendum could be put to a vote as early as
August. If the Navy gets the boot, troops would be expected to
withdraw by 2003.
 &HT;    If that happens, Vieques could become home to a burst of new
hotels. Currently, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company lists only seven
inns in its Vieques brochures for travelers, with the largest
having just 35 rooms. ``We'll definitely see much more development
if the Navy leaves,'' Guadalupe says. ``I imagine that after it
becomes clear that the Navy is leaving, we'll see interest from the
big hotel chains, because this is an island with tremendous
potential.''
 &HT;    For some hoteliers, the departure of the Navy is a foregone
conclusion. Martineau Bay Resort, a 156-room complex, is scheduled
to open in Isabel Segunda, the larger of two communities on the
9,300-resident island, late this year. The US$49 million resort _
which will be managed by Dallas-based Rosewood Hotel &AMP; Resorts _
will pepper 30 acres of the north shore with villas that rent for
$450 a night. A second phase could give Vieques its first golf
course.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, James Weis, owner of the popular nine-room Inn on the
Blue Horizon, is bidding on 100 acres to build two or three
boutique hotels. Another resort project, stalled for years for lack
of financing, is being redesigned as an eco-lodge.
 &HT;    New hotel investment will be boosted further by ongoing airport
expansion, which will allow large commercial carriers to join the
small propeller planes now shuttling visitors from San Juan on an
18-minute flight. American Eagle and Continental Airlines have
already expressed interest in serving the island.
 &HT;    Vieques was dominated by sugar plantations until the 1940s, when
the Navy came in to become its main resident. The military now owns
two-thirds of the island. While its presence _ and the noise
created by the use of live ordnance _ has discouraged wholesale
tourism development, Puerto Ricans have traditionally flocked to
the 20-mile-long island at Easter, camping on the beaches or
renting spare rooms from islanders.
 &HT;    If the Navy is ousted, international tourists would probably
flood in as well. Tucked between Puerto Rico's big island and the
U.S. Virgin Islands, Vieques boasts more than three dozen beaches,
at least 124 bird species, a circa-1854 Spanish fort and offshore
coral reefs. Non-polluting electric boats take tour groups to
Mosquito Bay, where millions of glowing undersea creatures called
dinoflagellates sparkle with light when disturbed by movement. Wild
paso fino horses roam the beaches, and jasmine, bougainvillea and
frangipani scent the air.
 &HT;    Ellen Adelman, regional marketing director for Rosewood, notes
that while the Navy kept the island free of industrial and tourism
development, it also endowed Vieques with an enviable
infrastructure. She points to good roadways, promises of ferry
terminal improvements, water pipelines from Puerto Rico's main
island and the airport.
 &HT;    Weis, whose posh Inn on the Blue Horizon is the most expensive
hotel in Vieques (rates average around $200 a night), says it's
premature to worry about a tourist glut. ``If we were to bring in
5,000 people, it would be terrible. But with Martineau Bay bringing
in 200 a night and us with 300 a night, it's not going to make it
crowded,'' he predicts.
 &HT;    Weis, who has taken on the role as liaison between Vieques
business owners and the Pentagon, says a Vieques task force seems
to favor converting much of the Navy land _ if the military leaves
_ into a reserve like the one on the Puerto Rican off-island of
Culebra. Parcels with live ordnance might be cordoned off as bird
sanctuaries.
 &HT;    ``The island is small, but there's room for more,'' Weis says.
``I think Vieques is at least 20 years away from worrying about
being too developed.'' Adds Vail at the Chamber of Commerce: ``We
don't want there to be casinos and nightclubs and big hotels. But I
don't think development and tourism are going to overwhelm the
island.''

 &HT;    VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ There are no malls, fast food chains,
casinos or traffic lights on the Puerto Rican off-island of Vieques
_ not yet, anyway.
 &HT;    But with Puerto Ricans poised to vote on whether to evict the
U.S. Navy from Vieques, hoteliers have turned an admiring eye on
the beach-lined island. ``Expansion is more than inevitable; it's
happening,'' says Vieques Chamber of Commerce President Burr Vail,
who owns the 16-room Hacienda Tamarindo, one of the largest inns on
the island.
 &HT;    Vieques is the only place in the world where the Atlantic fleet
of the Navy practices live bombing, making it a less-than-perfect
spot for vacationers. ``We had a good relationship with the Navy,''
explains Carmen Leticia Guadalupe, a tourism office representative
for the Municipa-lity of Vieques. ``But it was an impediment to
major tourism development.''
 &HT;    After years of off-and-on protests, anti-Navy sentiment
galvanized in April 1999, when two 500-pound bombs fell off course,
killing a civilian security guard and wounding four people. In
early February of this year, Puerto Rican Governor Pedro Rossello
agreed to let bombing resume in exchange for a referendum on the
Navy's future. That referendum could be put to a vote as early as
August. If the Navy gets the boot, troops would be expected to
withdraw by 2003.
 &HT;    If that happens, Vieques could become home to a burst of new
hotels. Currently, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company lists only seven
inns in its Vieques brochures for travelers, with the largest
having just 35 rooms. ``We'll definitely see much more development
if the Navy leaves,'' Guadalupe says. ``I imagine that after it
becomes clear that the Navy is leaving, we'll see interest from the
big hotel chains, because this is an island with tremendous
potential.''
 &HT;    For some hoteliers, the departure of the Navy is a foregone
conclusion. Martineau Bay Resort, a 156-room complex, is scheduled
to open in Isabel Segunda, the larger of two communities on the
9,300-resident island, late this year. The US$49 million resort _
which will be managed by Dallas-based Rosewood Hotel &AMP; Resorts _
will pepper 30 acres of the north shore with villas that rent for
$450 a night. A second phase could give Vieques its first golf
course.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, James Weis, owner of the popular nine-room Inn on the
Blue Horizon, is bidding on 100 acres to build two or three
boutique hotels. Another resort project, stalled for years for lack
of financing, is being redesigned as an eco-lodge.
 &HT;    New hotel investment will be boosted further by ongoing airport
expansion, which will allow large commercial carriers to join the
small propeller planes now shuttling visitors from San Juan on an
18-minute flight. American Eagle and Continental Airlines have
already expressed interest in serving the island.
 &HT;    Vieques was dominated by sugar plantations until the 1940s, when
the Navy came in to become its main resident. The military now owns
two-thirds of the island. While its presence _ and the noise
created by the use of live ordnance _ has discouraged wholesale
tourism development, Puerto Ricans have traditionally flocked to
the 20-mile-long island at Easter, camping on the beaches or
renting spare rooms from islanders.
 &HT;    If the Navy is ousted, international tourists would probably
flood in as well. Tucked between Puerto Rico's big island and the
U.S. Virgin Islands, Vieques boasts more than three dozen beaches,
at least 124 bird species, a circa-1854 Spanish fort and offshore
coral reefs. Non-polluting electric boats take tour groups to

EASTERN EUROPE'S FORAY INTO `M-COMMERCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
 By PETER S. GREEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ There's no need to fiddle in your
pocket for loose change if you want a Coke on the streets of
downtown Prague. Simply walk up to a Coca-Cola vending machine and
point your mobile telephone at it.
</P>
<P>
   Punch a few buttons on your phone and bang, a cold bottle
clatters down the chute and 20 Czech Koruny, about 50 cents, is
charged on your mobile phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   As consumer spending in the former communist bloc has risen, so
has the use of mobile phones: in some countries as many as one in
four households now owns one. But the creaky banking system
inherited from Communism has left Central and Eastern Europe mostly
cash economies. Credit cards and checks are seldom used, and both
merchants and consumers are deeply fearful of losing their life
savings to credit-card fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the advent of sophisticated wireless technologies,
improved data security and increasingly versatile handsets, Eastern
Europe _ and the Czech Republic, in particular _ are at the
forefront of a movement to put e-commerce in the hands of
consumers. The result is m-commerce, for mobile. Moving far beyond
the quick Coke, companies like Nokia and Citigroup want to turn
mobile phones into virtual credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``People perceive mobiles as trusted personal devices,'' said
Jari Paakkarinen, of Nokia Telecommunications, the Finnish mobile
phone manufacturer, which is using the highly competitive Czech
mobile phone market to test new technology. ``You eat with it, you
rest with it. It's an extension of your personality, so it's a very
short step to trust it to pay with it.''
</P>
<P>
   M-commerce is likely to take off much more rapidly in Europe,
especially the Czech Republic, than in the United States. Although
some former communist countries lack easily available wired
telephones, most of Europe has mobile networks that are several
generations more advanced and more secure than the older United
States systems. Most European systems function across entire
countries, not just several cities or states.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the widespread use of checks and credit
cards reduces the need for a new payment system. Americans would be
more likely than Europeans to see the spread of m-commerce as a
threat to their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But Central Europe lacks the sophisticated database of consumer
credit that card issuers require. Akshaya Bhargava, general manager
of Citibank's Czech operations, says that the bank is instead
arranging, by this fall, for retailers to accept payment by mobile
telephone for goods sold on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Republic's 10.5 million people already own more than 2
million mobile phones and pay their bills religiously. But credit
cards have hardly made a dent, with few Czech adults holding them.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do Czechs use checks. Instead, most use T.M. cards to
withdraw money, then pay their bills and make their purchases in
cash. Czechs commonly pay for kitchen furniture, airline tickets
and even new cars with wads of bills.
</P>
<P>
   But merchants complain that cash transactions encourage theft
and that customers often forgo purchases because they simply do not
have enough cash in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The prophets of m-commerce, here and around the world,
therefore, see a double boon: The phone will replace or pre-empt
the credit card, giving merchants authorization to immediately
debit a shopper's bank account or add charges to a phone bill. It
can also become the prime means of gaining access to the Internet,
allowing consumers to browse stripped-down Web sites especially
tailored to small mobile phone displays. Only about 7 percent of
Czechs have regular access to the Internet at home or work.
</P>
<P>
   The m-commerce revolution depends on a series of technologies
meant to bring information from the Web to screens not much larger
than a watch face. The current technology, called Wireless
Application Protocol, is seen as only the first step toward
high-speed data transmission for mobile phones that will receive a
constant flow of news bulletins, stock prices or suggestions for
nearby restaurants, as determined by the nearest transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   With an average monthly income of around $341, not many Czechs
are likely to charge a new Lexus on their mobile phone. But Jack
Schrantz, founder of Albumcity.cz, an Internet record shop, says he
expects compact discs to sell well. ``It matches the demographics
here _ it's the young and tech-savvy who buy CD's,'' Schrantz said.
</P>
<P>
   Several European airlines and banks are already making plans to
extend m-commerce. Finnair and Lufthansa already allow passengers
to check for delays and change their reservations with Web-enabled
telephones. Over the next two to three years, Lufthansa plans to
offer everything from ticket purchases to check-in.
</P>
<P>
   Banks in several European nations also are allowing customers to
use telephones and the Internet to make transfers, check account
balances and spend cash downloaded into an ``electronic wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see the technology going even further. At Globopolis
(www.globopolis.com), a collection of regularly updated city guides
to major European cities, mobile phone surfers some time this year
will be able to not only find a restaurant, cinema or nightclub,
but to make a reservation and pay for tickets, and in some cases,
even meal bills.
</P>
<P>
   As with many an Internet business, however, it remains unclear
how m-businesses will generate revenue and profits. Banner
advertisements simply cannot fit on phones.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the airtime that callers burn up while browsing is the
main source of revenue for mobile phone operators. But competition
and further generations of technology could replace charges by the
minute with flat monthly rates, leaving the operators looking for a
new model.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from m-transactions are often small: hi-technology Coke
machines will not make anybody rich. ``The question with
micropayments is how you split commissions: There's not much
there,'' said Robert Chvatal, the marketing director of Radio
Mobil, whose Paegas mobile telephone service, provided in a
partnership with Deutsche Telekom, is the second-largest in the
Czech Republic with nearly one million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Paegas and its larger rival, EuroTel, whose partners are
Bell Atlantic and Media One International, say they may eventually
make their money much as Visa and American Express do, by charging
merchants a percentage on every transaction.
</P>
<P>
   EuroTel and Paegas count on Web traffic to be dominated by the
mobile telephone, not the personal computer, or even palmtops.
``Many of these customers simply cannot or will not invest in a
home PC, so the ability to get to the content and applications of
the Internet via the mobile is very attractive,'' said Mike Burns,
EuroTel's marketing director. ``What's in it for us is to be
essentially the primary provider of Internet services in this
country.''

 &HT;    Job reports bring optimism to market
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This week's news _ showing a definite slowing of the
U.S. economy _ may put a hold on interest rate hikes by the Federal
Reserve, analysts said Friday. If it turns out that way, investors
have reason to cheer some more, as they did most of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The news was capped on Friday by the government's report of
less-than-expected job growth and a rise in the May unemployment
rate to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The hoped-for news sparked a stock market rally that gave the
technology-loaded Nasdaq composite index a record one-week
percentage gain of 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing sentiment was that the Fed's year-long series of
six interest rate increases is finally taking hold and slowing an
economy the central bankers think is running at an inflationary
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Friday's job growth report especially should
lead to a pause in the Fed's policy of raising rates on short-term
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to see how, given this report, the Fed could
raise the fed funds rate on June 28,'' said First Union chief
economist David Orr. He suggested that the jury is still out on
what the Fed might do next, given the possibility of later, more
disappointing economic reports.
</P>
<P>
   At A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, chief strategist Alfred E. Goldman said,
``I think the odds have now changed and there will not be another
rate hike soon. I think the Fed will be out of our face for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Fed stops raising interest rates, history suggests
that investors can expect near-term stock market gains, Standard &AMP;
Poor's analyst Sam Stovall said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He studied the market's reaction at the end of the Fed's
1994-1995 series of seven rate increases, which were also designed
to cool an inflationary economy. The last rate hike was on Jan. 31,
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The S&AMP;P 500, which fell 1.5 percent in 1994, went on to post a
19.5 percent rally in 1995,'' said Stovall.
</P>
<P>
   In just six months after the last 1995 rate hike, the technology
sector had rallied 49 percent, financial stocks by 22 percent,
consumer stocks by more than 15 percent and utilities _ the
smallest increase _ almost 6 percent, Stovall's study showed.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, however, that his survey should be viewed by
investors as ``a guide'' and not a forecast, ``since today's
economic and market conditions are different from those found in
the beginning of 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the market's performance, Robinson-Humphrey senior
strategist Robert S. Robbins said the ``typical summer stock market
rally appears to have begun,'' boosted by a rally in the bond
market that has sent Treasury yields back below 6 percent. That
reduces the bond market's competitiveness against stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to maintain that the yield on the long bond peaked
at 6.74 percent this past Jan. 18,'' said Robbins. ``Our outlook
calls for the 30-year (Treasury bond yield) to decline to 4.75
percent within the next two and a half years.''
</P>
<P>
   On the economic front, the next major reports will be the
government's chief inflation gauges: the Producer Price Index on
June 9 and the Consumer Price Index on June 14.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's trading, demand for technology stocks propelled the
rally in the Nasdaq market. Friday's gain of 230.88 points to
3,813.38 was the index's third-biggest one-day point gain.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Nasdaq rose more than 608 points, just shy of
20 percent, for its best weekly gain since the 9.7 percent increase
the week ended April 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.3 percent on Friday and
almost 5 percent for the week; the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2
percent on Friday and 7 percent for the week; and the Russell 200
index of smaller stocks 4.2 percent and 12 percent, respectively.

IN INDONESIA, THE MORE THINGS CHANGE, THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif.)   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Everything has changed in Indonesia since
its strongman, Suharto, was pushed from office just two years ago.
The clamor of democracy is everywhere, along with the violence and
instability that accompany a time of unfettered transformation.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing has changed. For all the talk about democratic
principles and local empowerment, Indonesia is still focused on the
ideas, the directives _ even the whims _ of one man, its new
president, Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Will the country's separatist movements be crushed by force or
courted with blandishments? Will its military leaders be the hard
men fostered by Suharto or a new generation of liberal thinkers?
Will its press remain open and free? Will Indonesia begin toying
again with the idea of strict currency controls?
</P>
<P>
   For all the clamor of political debate and the new empowerment
of the country's Legislature, these are all fundamental questions
whose final answer lies with one man, the president.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in sharp contrast to Suharto, who was forced to step
down in May 1998 after 32 years in power, Wahid's ability to enact
his policies is dangerously limited.
</P>
<P>
   As he built his top-down structure of personal control, Suharto
so eviscerated the nation's institutions that his successors have
inherited a hollow and nearly useless bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government here is almost hydroponic'' _ like a floating
structure with dangling, ineffectual roots _ said a Western
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid was a compromise president, the product of back-room deals
seven months ago to replace Suharto's immediate successor, B.J.
Habibie. Though Wahid is personally popular, he lacks a broad
political base. Even his Cabinet, the product of his deal-making,
does not fully support him.
</P>
<P>
   So he rules through the force of his personality, through his
moral authority, through the weakness of his rivals and through a
sort of light-hearted bullying in which he pummels potential
challengers with jokes, insults and impulsive personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
   But when he issues direct orders, one of his Cabinet ministers
said, he can never be sure what the result will be. His
subordinates may be recalcitrant or incompetent or simply lack the
bureaucratic machinery to act effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a president from whom everyone expects too much,''
said Daniel S. Lev, an expert on Indonesia at the University of
Washington in Seattle, who was visiting Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a president without the institution of the presidency,''
Lev said. ``Every major administrative institution and political
institution has essentially been destroyed, crushed. There is
really nothing left to work with. It doesn't matter, in a sense,
how good the people are that you appoint because the institutions
are devastated. There's corruption everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, seven months into his presidency, Wahid finds his
country in a slough of discontent, its reforms slowing, its leaders
consumed by personal rivalries, shaken by outbreaks of religious
violence and increasingly annoyed by the mannerisms of its quirky
president.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent missteps have particularly shaken public
confidence. They include the still-unexplained firing of a highly
respected economic minister, Laksamana Sukardi, and his replacement
by a political ally of the president. And they include scandals
involving the president's youngest brother and his personal
masseuse that have evoked fears of a return of the corruption and
nepotism of the Suharto years.
</P>
<P>
   Most dangerously, the public restiveness grows out of a sharp
economic downturn that has seen the currency, the rupiah, lose up
to 18 percent of its value this year and the stock market plunge by
27 percent. Although the overall economy is growing and could
exceed last year's increase by as much as 3 percent, the slump has
caused a panic in this still-traumatized nation, where it was an
economic crash that led to the forced resignation of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Western diplomat offered a succinct analysis of the
current challenges facing Indonesia: ``It's the economy, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid is not a president who takes a great interest in the
economy, and the economic team he has assembled _ skewed by his
political deal-making _ is widely viewed as weak.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has not been helped by a series of ill-considered
statements by government officials, most strikingly by Kwik Kian
Gee, the president's chief economic minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a foreign investor, I wouldn't come to Indonesia,''
Kwik said in a recent, and much quoted, interview with Dow Jones
Newswires. ``The law enforcement is not there, but not only that,
the whole thing is so confusing. How can you come here?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like Wahid, Kwik spent much of his career in opposition to the
Suharto government. Both men, like some other leaders, still speak
and act as if they were in opposition rather than in charge.
</P>
<P>
   So Kwik _ the government's chief economic manager _ blamed ``the
way the government is managed'' for the weak economy. He criticized
his boss for appointing a welter of economic councils and advisory
groups, leading to inconsistent policies.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Wahid told reporters he might just take over
economic management himself, despite his lack of background. He
then said he might take action to control currency fluctuations _ a
seeming reference to the creation of a currency board, an eccentric
idea of Suharto's that aroused shudders among investors.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But while the surface of public life here drifts and sloshes in
what sometimes seems a sea of incompetence, fundamental changes are
being prepared in the structure of the nation and its governance.
</P>
<P>
   Donald K. Emmerson, a professor of political science at Stanford
University, calls it ``the rebirth of the Indonesian political
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissions are preparing constitutional amendments for a
congress scheduled in August that would put in place a democratic
system with striking similarities to that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of Wahid, these changes are likely to include
direct election of the president, a bicameral legislature, a system
of judicial review, decentralization of some power to the provinces
and even perhaps an American-style bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Emmerson suggested that there may be mirror images here.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto placed his emphasis _ and staked his legitimacy _ on
economic development, while corrupting and bankrupting the
political system. It appears that the new government of Wahid,
while drifting economically, has embarked on an ambitious program
of political development.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto took the easy way; he crushed dissent by force. Wahid
has more faith in the ability of his countrymen to live together in
peace; this is a time when that faith is being tested.
</P>
<P>
   It is rainy season in Jakarta, and the gray skies and occasional
cracks of thunder speak to the national mood.
</P>
<P>
   All debates and rivalries and even outbreaks of violence are
focused now on August, when the national assembly will meet to
debate, to pass laws and to hear a state-of-the-nation report from
the president. No one is sure if a storm is coming.

   Think Bill Gates is the anti-Christ? Do you believe that

</P>
<P>
   Sounds as if you might empathize with Harry Mendelssohn, the
deranged, neo-Luddite city librarian who rants and raves his way
through ``Defiled,'' Lee Kalcheim's well-meaning but sketchily
drawn and lead-handed new work about technology and its
malcontents.

<P>
   How discontented is Harry (Jason Alexander)? Well, as we meet
him, he's duct-taping bundles of dynamite to the inner columns of
an unnamed metropolitan library.
</P>
<P>
   His beef? The cynical library brass is abandoning the old card
catalog system in favor of a newfangled computerized version. Like
Theodore Kaczynski, Harry is a Harvard-trained loner who'd rather
unabomb than switch to the cold new world of malls, cell phones and
(shudder) Burger Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there's only one man to handle this job: Lt. Columbo,
aka Brian Dickey, a cagey police negotiator cagily played by none
other than Peter Falk. Though Falk could be accused here of
self-impersonating a police officer, his loose, cockeyed
performance supplies an enjoyable foil to Alexander's uptight,
hyperactive megalomaniac.
</P>
<P>
   Tautly directed by Barnet Kellman, the two veteran actors'
yin-yang chemistry makes ``Defiled'' interesting for about 20
minutes. The problem is that Kalcheim has written a 1 hour-long
play. Once the dynamic is set, ``Defiled'' spins itself out in
improbable plot twists and humdrum emotional disclosures of the TV
``hostage melodrama'' variety.
</P>
<P>
   Character revelations are scattered throughout the dialogue
rather than woven irrevocably to the plot. Dickey, who asks little
from life other than a happy home and a good night's sleep, carries
a thermos of coffee and offers Harry nips of whiskey from a hip
flask between crisis flashpoints. He's wed to an Italian woman, a
great cook, naturally, who realizes ``it's no picnic being married
to a cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry's psychic scars, we learn, reach back to his failed
engagement 18 years ago, and before that to the day that his
practical-minded father gave him a short-haired, fuss-free dog
instead of some more exotic breed. Which gives ``Defiled'' its
promisingly absurdist subtitle, ``The Convenience of a Short Haired
Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in ``Defiled'' there's a scathing black-comic satire
struggling to get out. Kalcheim settles for a generic genre piece
with highbrow aspirations, a choice that seriously undercuts the
play's moral arguments against the dumbing-down of global culture.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Alexander's heroic efforts, in particular, to wring
every possible insight from his lines, the dialogue quickly starts
to repeat itself. Harry succeeds in fending off Dickey with a
remote control detonator, but Falk and Alexander can't fend off the
been-there, done-that feeling that clings to the play like sulfur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defiled's'' single set, a bricks-and-mortar library reading
room of reassuring solidity, has been beautifully designed by D.
Martyn Bookwalter to mesh with the Geffen's elegant interior. Jon
Gottlieb's sound design of helicopters and police bullhorns
persuades us we could be in the middle of a deadly armed standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defiled'' contains at least one big bang, all right, and it's
an absolute doozy. Too bad this technophobic play couldn't have
stopped worrying long enough to embrace some verbal pyrotechnics of

SEC PLANS WARNING ON ANNUITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 4) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, federal regulators have been looking into whether
people who invest in variable annuities are getting a fair shake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, while the regulators continue to gather information from
brokerage firms and financial advisers across the country for
possible sanctions, the Securities and Exchange Commission is
sending up a red flag on these controversial but increasingly
popular investments, which are basically a combination of mutual
funds and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, according to SEC officials, the agency plans to take
the unusual step of publishing an investor alert on its Web site,
www.sec.gov, on the pitfalls of variable annuities.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the agency used an alert to emphasize to
investors that dazzling past performances of mutual funds might not
be reason for future investments. But the SEC has not previously
sounded a warning on variable annuities, which were developed by
insurance companies to attract some of the billions going into
mutual funds and which lately have been accumulating money from
investors at a faster clip than standard, less expensive mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting concerns that sales representatives often do not tell
potential customers all they need to know about variable annuities
_ and certainly do not emphasize the drawbacks _ the SEC document,
``Variable Annuities: What You Should Know,'' reads like a sober
antidote to a salesman's smooth patter. It is filled with
cautionary passages clearly designed to make a potential buyer stop
and think whether he or she really would want to put money into an
investment that financially penalizes those who might need cash in
less than six or seven years and charges for features, like a
lifelong stream of payments after retirement, that are rarely used.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the restrained voice of government, the agency
warns, in particular, that bonuses now being offered as a lure by
many variable annuity companies ``may not be in your best
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives complain that companies that pay
customers bonuses of 3 percent or 4 percent to get them to switch
their variable annuity investments often make potential buyers
think they are getting something for nothing. But the SEC alert
points out that this is may not be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher expenses can outweigh the benefits'' of a bonus, the
agency says. It lists several ways, not always obvious, by which
variable annuity companies take back the bonus payments, including
higher penalties for withdrawals and extending the periods over
which such penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before purchasing a variable annuity with a bonus credit,''
the agency says in its alert, ``you need to ask yourself _ and the
financial professional who is trying to sell you the contract _
whether the bonus is worth more to you than any increased charges
you will pay.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the pioneers of variable annuity bonuses, American
Skandia, just this year became the No. 1 selling variable annuity
company, taking the lead away from Hartford Life, which, until a
few months ago, had not offered bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mackey, chief executive of the National Association for
Variable Annuities, said he had not seen the SEC document but that
he agreed with the agency that there should be full disclosure. He
added that bonus annuities were suitable for some people and that
it was up to sales representatives to ``be familiar with their
clients' circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   While one of the main advantages of variable annuities over
mutual funds is that investments are not taxed until the time of
withdrawal, the agency notes that Individual Retirement Accounts
and 401(k) retirement plans, which offer the same feature at no
cost, ``are often more advantageous than variable annuities.''
</P>
<P>
   Several pending lawsuits accuse variable annuity companies of
inappropriately selling variable annuities to IRA and 401(k)
investors, giving them a useless, double tax deferral feature at a
higher expense than if mutual funds had been used.
</P>
<P>
   Another seldom-used feature of variable annuities is a guarantee
that an investor's heirs will receive at least the original
investment, regardless of how poorly the market performs. But
long-term investors rarely fail to at least break even. Again, the
agency advises, before paying the extra money for a variable
annuity, ``Carefully consider whether you need the benefit.'' &QL;

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In 1997, two Israeli army helicopters collided on
the way to Lebanon, killing 73 soldiers as they crashed in the
front yard of the school that Rachel Ben Dor's children attended.
At the time, Ben Dor's oldest son was a soldier in Lebanon, and
several of his former classmates, recent graduates like him, died.
</P>
<P>
   That pushed Ben Dor, an opponent of what she saw as Israel's
senseless involvement in Lebanon, over the edge. Summoning three
friends to her kitchen in a northern kibbutz, she hatched a group
eventually called The Four Mothers _ Leave Lebanon in Peace.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the military and political establishment dismissed
them as overly emotional and ignorant of security concerns. But
later, after they spawned a significant anti-war movement, they
were derided on a baser level. An army commander crudely insulted
them using a slur for women earlier this year, but in a signal of
how the tide had turned, he was pressured to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Four Mothers met with Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
who last week completed the unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon that
they had pushed for.
</P>
<P>
   The women once called traitors were embraced by the nation's
most decorated former general, and the whole issue came full
circle, dizzyingly for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There we were inside the Defense Ministry that we used to
picket, kissing and hugging with the prime minister and the army
chief,'' Ben Dor, 42, said. ``And all the generals were standing
there, thinking I don't know what. It was so amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis celebrated the Four Mothers this week. The
Jerusalem Post on Friday called them ``one of the most successful
grassroots movements in Israeli history.'' The women took a classic
Israeli stereotype _ the silent, suffering soldier's mother _ stood
it on its head and dared to challenge the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, it was so shocking to the Israeli public
that it was mothers who were demanding answers from the
government,'' said Linda Ben Zvi, a leading member but not one of
the original four. ``Mothers were supposed to make the schnitzel
and hand-wash the uniforms and play the passive role in-bred in
Israeli society.''
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1980s, large anti-war rallies challenged
Israel's invasion of Lebanon. But then the country fell largely
silent for more than a decade. Israel's occupation of a what it
called a ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon, with its annual
death toll of 25 to 35 Israeli soldiers, became a reality that
seemed immutable. The helicopter crash sent a spasm of doubt
through the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a sign from the skies, telling us the whole thing
had to be stopped,'' said Ben Dor, a teacher and mother of three
sons. ``For many, many nights afterward, people who had sons in the
army didn't sleep. They were waiting for the devil to come knocking
at their door.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Israel, we are all the time thinking that the army knows
what it is doing, and sometimes we have to think twice,'' she
continued. ``Someone should say this is crazy, I decided. It was
crazy to educate our children to be decent and then at 18 send them
places to kill the other people. We should send our children to die
because our leaders can't solve our problems by talking?
</P>
<P>
   ``And on a more specific level, the army's plan wasn't working.
If they were in Lebanon to protect northern Israel, why were the
Katyusha rockets falling on us?''
</P>
<P>
   The women began with small street protests at intersections.
They wrote letters to lawmakers. They organized debates at northern
kibbutzim.
</P>
<P>
   After the first story about them appeared on national
television, they received calls from all over the country. Working
women all, they found themselves at the vanguard of a movement,
without any organization, time or money. And they knew that what
they were doing would take all that plus endurance.
</P>
<P>
   It also took its toll on their families. One mother quit when
her soldier son demanded it. Ben Zvi had a hard time figuring out
how to react when her son, Or, won a medal for fighting in Lebanon.
He asked her if she was proud. And with difficulty she told him he
was, because ``his reality was the war'' and she had raised him to
excel at whatever he did.
</P>
<P>
   On talk shows, the mothers were placed opposite generals who
patted them on the shoulders and rolled their eyes when they spoke.
``It was a tremendous miscalculation,'' Ben Zvi, a professor, said.
Eventually, the military understood that the women were shaping
national opinion, and began to attack them as bad for the morale of
the soldiers and the country.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late; the Israeli news media loved the mothers,
and the public appreciated the way that they memorialized every
soldier who died.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the shift in public sentiment, the three leading
candidates for prime minister in the last election promised to
bring the boys home from Lebanon. Barak, who took office last July,
made it a pledge with a date: by July 7, 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in imitation of a military custom, Ben Dor pinned a
medal on Barak's chest _ with force. It was a Four Mothers button.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers, who will meet on Saturday to vote on whether to put
themselves out of business as an organization, do not need them
anymore.

 &HT;    Howard suffers new day of losing legal arguments
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tempers flared again Friday among lawyers in the
murder trial against NFL star Ray Lewis as a defense attorney
accused prosecutors of goading the judge into declaring a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, one of several between the prosecution and the
defense, arose while District Attorney Paul Howard questioned
Atlanta police Detective Ken Allen, the lead investigator in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd like to try it all over again,'' Steve Sadow, who
represents co-defendant Joseph Sweeting, said after court
adjourned. ``Howard knows it can't go any worse than it's gone so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard strongly denied that securing a mistrial was his
intention. ``Far from it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney expects to rest his case Monday or early
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sadow objected when Howard asked Allen about a statement Lewis
gave the morning Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, were
killed during a Buckhead street fight. Howard wanted Allen to say
whether Lewis told police Sweeting had been with him that night _
knowing Lewis didn't identify his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Sadow vigorously objected, saying it was an improper line of
questioning and that Howard knew it. ``This is in my opinion
prosecutorial misconduct,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner, as she did
repeatedly throughout a day of many defense objections, ruled
against Howard, ordering the prosecutor to steer clear of that line
of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   During the first two weeks of testimony, Bonner has not
hesitated to sustain defense objections over the prosecution's mode
of questioning. ``Mr. Howard, I have ruled'' has become a common
courtroom refrain as Bonner cuts off Howard's protests of her
rulings, urging him to move on.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Howard has taken these rulings in stride.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday he did a slow burn.
</P>
<P>
   After Bonner sustained yet another defense objection, Howard
growled, ``All right.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis defense attorney Tony Axam then leaped to his feet and
told Bonner that Howard's ``All right'' was uttered in an improper,
``derisive tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard, after court adjourned, downplayed his agitation. ``When
you fight for justice and what you think is right . . . you can't
be dissuaded or frustrated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Lollar-Owens, Lollar's aunt, seemed frustrated by the
rulings, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``These other people can submit anything; they can say anything;
they can laugh at anything,'' she said, referring to the defense
teams. ``But (prosecutors) get stopped every time they try
something, every time they say something.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen spent most of the day identifying items in brown evidence
bags containing such items as victims' clothing and bullet casings
found at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's clothing, its belt still looped in his bluejeans and his
slashed jacket, drew sobs from the victim's family. Allen testified
that he twice interviewed limo driver Duane Fassett the day of the
killings. It was during these interviews that Fassett said he saw
Lewis strike a victim and that he overheard co-defendants Sweeting
and Reginald Oakley admit to stabbing the two men. But Fassett did
not deliver this when he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Howard knew he couldn't get into the content of Fassett's
statements and danced around the subject during his examination of
Allen. But when he asked Allen if he obtained an arrest warrant
after interviewing the limo driver, Axam objected again. And Bonner
sustained it.
</P>
<P>
   The flustered district attorney rose to argue, but Bonner cut
him off, saying to the deputies, ``Bring the jury back in.''

   Fulton Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner, as she did
repeatedly throughout a day of many defense objections, ruled
against Howard, ordering the prosecutor to steer clear of that line
of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   During the first two weeks of testimony, Bonner has not
hesitated to sustain defense objections over the prosecution's mode
of questioning. ``Mr. Howard, I have ruled'' has become a common
courtroom refrain as Bonner cuts off Howard's protests of her
rulings, urging him to move on.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Howard has taken these rulings in stride.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday he did a slow burn.
</P>
<P>
   After Bonner sustained yet another defense objection, Howard
growled, ``All right.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis defense attorney Tony Axam then leaped to his feet and
told Bonner that Howard's ``All right'' was uttered in an improper,
``derisive tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard, after court adjourned, downplayed his agitation. ``When
you fight for justice and what you think is right . . . you can't
be dissuaded or frustrated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Lollar-Owens, Lollar's aunt, seemed frustrated by the
rulings, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``These other people can submit anything; they can say anything;
they can laugh at anything,'' she said, referring to the defense
teams. ``But (prosecutors) get stopped every time they try
something, every time they say something.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen spent most of the day identifying items in brown evidence
bags containing such items as victims' clothing and bullet casings
found at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's clothing, its belt still looped in his bluejeans and his
slashed jacket, drew sobs from the victim's family. Allen testified
that he twice interviewed limo driver Duane Fassett the day of the
killings. It was during these interviews that Fassett said he saw
Lewis strike a victim and that he overheard co-defendants Sweeting
and Reginald Oakley admit to stabbing the two men. But Fassett did
not deliver this when he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Howard knew he couldn't get into the content of Fassett's
statements and danced around the subject during his examination of
Allen. But when he asked Allen if he obtained an arrest warrant
after interviewing the limo driver, Axam objected again. And Bonner
sustained it.
</P>
<P>
   The flustered district attorney rose to argue, but Bonner cut
him off, saying to the deputies, ``Bring the jury back in.''

A HAND FOR FIRST NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a sad day when First Night has money troubles.
</P>
<P>
   This celebration of the New Year _ a triumph of cultural good
cheer over winter cold _ is part of what makes Boston Boston.
Indoors and on the streets, this public party has for 25 years
featured art, music, dance, displays, theater, poetry, fireworks,
and fabulous parades _ not to mention the ice sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   After this year's impressive celebration, however, First Night
ended up $750,000 in the red. With work the figure has fallen to
under $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Night is not going under,'' insists the event's
executive director, Geri Guardino. She has already gotten help from
``major stakeholders'' _ a mix of corporations, foundations, and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Guardino expects to cut the remaining deficit by some $450,000
within a month, negotiate a break with some vendors, and carry a
deficit of $150,000 to $200,000 into next year.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sign that Boston-lovers should open their wallets. A
joint infusion of cash could clear First Night's books entirely.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, corporations, foundations, and individuals
who haven't been asked but cherish First Night should contribute.
Over the long term, companies that aren't yet should consider
becoming corporate sponsors. This would free organizers to focus on
one crucial thing _ the coming First Night 2001 celebration. And
vendors could participate with greater confidence.
</P>
<P>
   First Night is an appealing investment. Besides its priceless
emotional worth to the greater Boston area, Guardino points out
that the event has not had an accumulated deficit until now.
Surpluses from years in the black have always made up for years
with losses.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is the birthplace of First Night, and it has become a
model for over 200 similar celebrations. Locally, the event's
Neighborhood Network draws in adult and teenage participants from
all over Boston. This dazzling, precedent-setting hometown party
deserves to be kept in peak financial health.

SUMMIT SHADOWS OVER MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's looming decision on a national missile
defense system has cast a shadow over his meeting this weekend with
Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin, like America's NATO
allies, has been warning that any change in the 1972 ABM treaty
necessitated by Washington's pursuit of a dubious missile defense
can unravel the entire fabric of arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   So it is just as well that administration officials are saying
they expect no deal on the ABM treaty to be struck at the summit.
Their reasons for abandoning expectations of a bargain with Putin
may not be reassuring for the long run, however.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, favors a grander missile defense. He has
said: ``Any decision on missile defense would be for the next
president to make, not this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has been no less adamant in rejecting a deal. In
reality, it would be in Russia's interest to seek a bargain, since
Russian specialists understand that the missile defense system
being tested in the United States depends on infrared sensors that
cannot distinguish warheads from decoys and that there would be no
realistic threat to Russia's nuclear deterrence for the next 10 to
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the dispute over missile defense is to be carried over into
future US-Russia dialogues, there are other crucial matters that
should be taken up this weekend. Nothing could more directly
enhance the security of both nations than a decision to take their
nuclear missiles off hair-trigger alert. Since George W. Bush has
already supported dealerting, this measure should have bipartisan
support.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should warn Putin not to carry out threats to strike at
Afghanistan over the Taliban's sheltering of Chechen commanders.
And Putin should be told to cease pretending all criticism from
independent media is purchased by foreign enemies. But the Russian
president should also be reassured that no further expansion of
NATO is imminent, and he should be offered a Russian pipeline to
transport oil from the Caspian basin.
</P>
<P>
   These issues are much more immediate than the distant mirage of
a national missile defense.

ACCESS TO MEDICAL RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 04, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each year, US taxpayers invest more than $17 billion in medical
research through the National Institutes of Health alone. The money
is well spent _ it helps in the development of new drugs, new
surgical techniques, new insights into public health. But the
public has to pay again for access to the fruits of much of this
research.
</P>
<P>
   The former editor of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, George Lundberg, wants to change this. Speaking at the
Harvard School of Public Health last week, Lundberg called on JAMA
and other medical journals, including Boston's New England Journal
of Medicine, to start making available most of the content of their
print magazines on line for free.
</P>
<P>
   It is a worthwhile idea, not least for its benefit to doctors
and lay people in parts of the developing world who cannot afford
either print or Internet subscriptions to the publications. The
proposal comes at a pivotal moment for many medical journals, as
they explore how best to operate in an online environment that is
increasingly swamped by health Web sites that do not adhere to the
same standards of editing, insulation from advertisers' influence,
and peer review that have won the good journals their status.
</P>
<P>
   Three journals _ the British Medical Journal, JAMA, and the
Annals of Internal Medicine _ now put articles on the Internet for
free, but JAMA just announced that it would switch to a
paid-subscription-only service within the next few months.
Officials of the Massachusetts Medical Society, owners of NEJM, are
looking at new print and online options for expanding revenue
potential. Just last year, the longtime editor of the NEJM, Dr.
Jerome Kassirer, was fired for resisting plans of the medical
society to find new ways to profit from NEJM, many of which run the
risk of compromising the standards that have lent the magazine its
prestige.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, NEJM officials note that there is also an
element of self-interest in Lundberg's proposal. He is now editor
of Medscape, a free online service of medical information that
accepts ads. That site would gain some in popularity _ and in
appeal to advertisers _ if it could include links to free articles
at the top journals' sites. Still, there is no question that
Lundberg's plan would expand the public's access to medical
research, and the example of the British Medical Journal, in
particular, shows that it can be made to work.
</P>
<P>
   The trick for journal publishers is to find ways to expand
online access without forgoing too much of the print subscription
and ad revenue that pays for the editing so crucial in setting
peer-reviewed journal articles apart from other Web material. But
the goal of expanding access should be a high priority for
publishers. Not only will greater access improve the public's
health consciousness, it is also a fair payback for the taxpayers'
generous support of medical research.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SMYRNA, Ga. _ When he was swept into the Georgia House of
Representatives in 1994 at the crest of the Republican revolution,
Randy Sauder seemed to personify Cobb County's reputation as one of
the most conservative suburbs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sauder was in favor of mandatory execution for twice-convicted
murderers, abolishing the state parole board and barring Atlanta's
public transportation system from the county. He became an ally of
fellow Cobb County resident Newt Gingrich and a national Republican
organization voted him the top freshman state legislator in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, Sauder infuriated the Republican Party in
Georgia with an audacious heresy. As he saw the future of his
district, he became a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Sauder's conversion says much about the population changes that
are transforming the suburbs of Atlanta and other cities in the
Southeast, rearranging the political order along with the
priorities of state leaders. Nearly 2.5 million Americans moved to
the Southern states along the Atlantic Coast during the 1990s, by
far the largest growth of any region in the country, and they have
proven to be far less conservative than long-term residents.
</P>
<P>
   Suburbs once dominated by religious conservatives are
increasingly home to moderate Republicans, and moderate Republican
districts are teetering on the edge of Democratic reascendancy. As
officials of both parties have begun to move away from divisive
racial and social issues and toward the center, the effect on
public policy has been dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   In state after state, conservative social issues that once
monopolized the conversation of Southern suburbs _ lower taxes,
welfare reform, crackdowns on crime _ have been supplanted by a new
agenda: managing growth and transportation, bringing in technology
jobs and above all, improving education. In a swath of states from
the Carolinas to Mississippi, Democratic governors have made these
issues their own, and Republicans are struggling to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My district has changed so dramatically since I was first
elected,'' Sauder said recently, over biscuits at a Shoney's
restaurant near his house. ``The people moving in want to see
action on issues like education and sprawl, and it's the Democrats
that have grabbed those themes and delivered. The Republicans
around here are seen as bickering and obstructionist.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a matter as racially charged as the Confederate battle flag
on the South Carolina Capitol, which comes down on July 1, has
largely been resolved, mostly at the request of suburban voters who
made it clear they had other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time as centrist Northerners, mostly white, moved
South, an inner ring of Southern suburbs that were once nearly all
white have become more diverse, attracting large and stable
populations of black, Hispanic and Asian residents who do not as a
rule support a conservative political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In Cobb County, where blacks once had to sue to rent apartments,
the number of black residents has grown fivefold since 1980, rising
to 12 percent of the county's population today from 4 percent 20
years ago, according to the Census Bureau and the county. There has
been a similar shift in other Atlanta suburbs, such as Clayton and
Gwinnett counties, along with suburbs of Charlotte and
Raleigh-Durham in North Carolina, and Columbia in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The population shifts, driven by the South's quickening economy
and the prosperity of a mobile middle class, do not necessarily
presage a partisan realignment like the mass movement of white
Southern Democrats to the Republican Party in the 1980s and 1990s.
Nor are they necessarily good news for Vice President Al Gore's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although two state legislators have switched to the Democratic
Party in South Carolina, and more could do so in Georgia, the
pendulum swing is more ideological than political. Its most lasting
effect may be a race by officials of both parties to the center,
mostly at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the explosion of new residents in the 1990s
has actually produced a new breed of Republican in a state
dominated for decades by Democrats and religious conservatives.
They seem to be precisely the kind of voters targeted by the
campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``As North Carolina has filled up with cul-de-sacs, we have
become simultaneously more Republican and far less conservative,''
said John N. Davis, executive director of the North Carolina Forum
for Research and Economic Education, a nonprofit, research group
supported by business that conducts surveys of newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are pro-government Republicans, who want the best soccer
fields, schools and police departments that government money can
buy,'' Davis said. ``And suddenly you see formerly conservative
candidates for office pushing education and environment programs
that they would have tried to cut 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that many of the newcomers come from the Northeast where
it is normal to be Republican and moderate or Republican and
left-of-center, a combination rare in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Native Southerners, whether Democratic or Republican, identify
themselves as conservative far more often than newcomers in his
organization's polls, he said. A similar survey by the University
of North Carolina last year showed that 34 percent of non-native
Southerners considered themselves conservative, compared to 42
percent of native Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers are prodding elected officials to be more aggressive
about spending tax money on their priorities. In the last three
years, residents in 19 out of 20 counties in the Atlanta area have
voted to raise their sales taxes to pay for schools and other
projects, often by overwhelming margins.

OPENING TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, June 05, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress is starting to show some good sense about relations
with Cuba. A bill awaiting action in the House would make it easier
to sell US food, medicine, and health-care devices there. But this
bill, if passed, would not have much impact initially. President
Clinton has ample authority to make more sweeping shifts in policy
that would upset Fidel Castro's careful anti-American balancing
act.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then Castro allows a thaw in relations, but when
the United States gets overly friendly he arranges a provocation,
such as the downing of two small planes piloted by Cuban exiles in
1996. Passage by Congress of the punitive Helms-Burton Act followed
a month later. Yet Castro can modulate his anti-Americanism when
necessary. While the controversy over Elian Gonzalez worsened in
January, Castro encouraged visits by American delegations and
allowed the opening of a trade show for US health-care products.
All the while, the existence of the US trade embargo gives Castro
an excuse for the shortcomings of the Cuban economy.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now in Congress, sponsored by Republican Representative
George R. Nethercutt of Washington, would soften the embargo to
Cuba and other countries under similar sanctions. It would lessen
the red tape around the sale of medical supplies, but these can
already be sold to Cuba as long as the seller abides by a set of US
regulations (the oddest being that the seller must certify the
Cubans are not buying the equipment to torture their enemies). More
important, the bill would allow the sale of food to Cuban
government agencies, which control virtually all food production in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   US farmers are eagerly awaiting an opening to Cuba, but they
will not gain the full benefits of Cuban imports any time soon.
France already has a lock on the export of wheat to Cuba because it
lets the Cubans buy on credit. The United States should only offer
trade credits if Castro opens up the internal Cuban economy and
allows political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the bill contend that if the House is willing to
support improved economic relations with China, as it did last
month, it should not be afraid to do the same for Cuba. The Chinese
leadership, however, wants better relations with the United States,
while Castro does not.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the bill should still be passed because it
encourages a rapprochement between two nations that are forced to
deal with each other due to the inexorable fact of geography. More
than 156,000 Americans made the short trip to Cuba last year
(124,000 of them Cuban-Americans) even though most had to get
special permission from the US government and travel a roundabout
journey. Direct air travel is banned except for limited charter
flights.
</P>
<P>
   A group of senators has sponsored a bill to lift the
restrictions against air travel and other aspects of US anti-Cuban
policy, but it has little chance of passage this year. Clinton,
however, has great leeway to adjust US policy toward Cuba
unilaterally. Last year, the president allowed nonstop charter
flights to Cuba from New York and Los Angeles, joining the existing
service from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He should go further and end all restrictions on travel to the
island. Cuban-Americans, who are now allowed only one trip a year
without a US government license, could then go freely back and
forth, bringing with them dollars to help friends and relatives and
a sense of freedom and friendship that would go far to dispel
Castro's anti-American and anticapitalist propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could also facilitate US business dealings by allowing
direct payments by the Cubans for US goods. Under present
regulations, payments must be made through third countries, adding
time and expense to the transactions. And he should also allow
American businesses to hire Cuban representatives in the country, a
common business practice that is now forbidden under the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Until Castro provides at least the same amount of economic
freedom that is now permitted in China, the United States should
not offer free-trade concessions to Cuba. At the same time, Clinton
and his successor should experiment with policies that emphasize
charity, openness, and magnanimity, qualities that have been in
short supply in Cuban-American relations. Castro may attempt
another provocation if relations grow too warm for his taste, but
the United States would be wise to treat this as merely a familiar
ploy by an aged dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Castro will celebrate his 74th birthday in August. The goal of
US policy should be to offer a sense of hope and promote a climate
of political and economic change to those Cubans who will shape
their country's destiny in a new era.

   In Cobb County, where voters raised the sales tax in 1998 for
new schools, the county commission has proposed a tax increase to

</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett County, a northeast Atlanta suburb that has been a

aside Republicans in seizing the issues at the top of suburban
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have opposed Democratic initiatives to raise
teacher salaries and hold schools accountable with testing regimens
are gleefully painted as obstructionist, and the effects are
visible. Both legislators in South Carolina who switched to the
Democratic Party complained that Republican leaders tried to force
them to vote against education programs that their constituents
supported.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans insisted that the party-switching did not
represent a trend, and that deeply conservative values still
prevailed in the South. Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster
in Atlanta, said the increased emphasis on quality-of-life issues
was the result of an improved economy, not a political shift. But
other Republicans said their party had fallen behind in the race to
capture newcomers with unpledged loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transformation is going on around the South, and the
Republican leadership just does not get it,'' said Matt Towery, a
Republican and former state representative from Cobb County who was
Gingrich's campaign chairman for many years. ``They're still
talking about tax cuts, but the Democrats now have the issues that
appeal to presidential-year voters, the environment, gun safety.
You can't win these counties as a gun-toting, anti-abortion
Republican anymore.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But partisanship still prevails. All but one of the 16
Republican state legislators from Gwinnett County voted against
Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes' overhaul of Georgia's education system,
which passed nonetheless. The law mandates many of the ideas that
Republicans have championed: smaller class sizes, an end to teacher
tenure, strict accountability of each school, as measured by
comprehensive tests.
</P>
<P>
   When he signed the bill, Barnes deliberately chose a school in
the district of the one Gwinnett Republican who had supported him.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, in fact, has been one of the South's shrewdest observers
of these demographic trends, assembling an agenda with
pitch-perfect resonance for suburban voters _ the education bill, a
powerful new transportation and planning authority, a managed-care
bill of rights _ while also retaining his popularity among urban
and rural residents.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked to strengthen the Democratic majority in the
Georgia Legislature in anticipation of the redistricting that will
follow this year's census, targeting districts like Sauder's in
Smyrna. (If he had not switched, Sauder acknowledges, he would
eventually have faced a Democratic opponent with the governor's
strong backing.)
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Kahn, the governor's chief of staff and principal
political strategist, said the population shifts in Georgia have
been of significant benefit to the Democrats, and could make a
difference in Gore's favor this November, although the state is
considered a tossup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outer ring of suburbs are still very Republican, but some
of the counties on the inner ring that had gone Republican are
clearly trending back to the Democrats,'' he said. ``I think Gore
could do better in the suburbs than people expect, particularly
with women. In a close state, you make an impact at the margin, and
the suburbs are the margin now.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those swing districts is likely to be in Smyrna and the
south Cobb area, home to both Sauder and, before he moved to the
governor's mansion, to Barnes. The district has become one of the
fastest-growing integrated regions in Georgia, a leading
destination for middle- and upper-middle-class white and black
families buying homes in the $200,000 range and above. Kahn said
the governor's hometown of Mableton, just southwest of Smyrna, is
now about equally black and white.
</P>
<P>
   The welcome mat for black home buyers represents quite a
turnaround for Smyrna. As recently as 1988, Aunt Fanny's Cabin, a
restaurant with a slavery theme, could be found in Smyrna. But the
restaurant closed in 1994, the city replaced its decaying downtown
with a landscaped civic center and professionals caught in
Atlanta's rush hour began to appreciate Smyrna's easy access to
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Keith De Cay, one of many black homeowners who bought a house in
the affluent Austin Lake section of Smyrna recently, said he was
impressed by the city's friendliness, selecting it after a transfer
from New Orleans based on the number of residents who offered to
give him directions when he pretended to be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lifelong Democrat, and I had heard this was a very
Republican area, so I didn't know what to expect,'' said De Cay, an
executive with Dataradio Corp., which makes wireless modems. ``But
I just haven't found that old-guard kind of politics here. They're
building schools and community centers and parks, and that's what I
want to see my elected officials do.''

 &HT;    A shaken widow thanks the public for their support
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In her first public statement since her
husband was shot and killed outside his classroom, Pam Grunow
avoided the political questions that others around the nation have
been asking.
</P>
<P>
   Trembling but holding back tears Friday morning, Grunow thanked
the school, strangers across the country, the community and
``Barry's basketball buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a reluctant spokeswoman who had to exit early from the
17-minute news conference to keep from losing her composure. Her
lawyers and a public relations firm organized the Sheraton Hotel
news conference for her and three of Barry Grunow's siblings in
response to a barrage of interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still in shock and I am unable to comprehend,'' said the
widow, wearing her husband's wedding ring on a chain around her
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, Christopher Larmoyeux, deflected questions about
gun control, school safety and youth violence. Pam Grunow, her
brothers-in-law Kurt and Steve Grunow, and sister-in-law Kay
Nichols concentrated on thanking the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family intends to be part of that debate. But not today,''
Larmoyeux said. ``Let's give these folks some space, let them find
their own answers.''
</P>
<P>
   They were reluctant to answer questions about Nathaniel Brazill,
and whether the 13-year-old gunman should be tried as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney Barry Krischer, who favors trying the teenager as
an adult, has left messages for family members but has not
discussed the case with them, according to Krischer spokesman Mike
Edmondson. Larmoyeux said the family will set up a meeting with
Krischer next week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's news conference came a week after Brazill shot and
killed Barry Grunow on the last day of classes at Lake Worth Middle
School. In that time, Pam Grunow has gone from an anonymous
stay-at-home mother of two to the focus of a news conference that
would be televised live locally and replayed around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The one message she wished to offer the world concerned Barry
Grunow's dedication to friends, family and community, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't go anywhere without Barry's students coming up and
saying 'Mr. Grunow, Mr. Grunow,''' she recalled, the only time she
smiled during the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Grunow's brother Steve came the closest among family
members to entering the debate over school violence, vaguely
suggesting the family would work to make sure this never happens
again.
</P>
<P>
   But he focused on thanking the community for the good they'd
done: taking care of Pam and Barry Grunow's house and children,
cooking food for them, bringing cookies, sending gifts and flowers,
creating a memorial at Lake Worth Middle School, writing poems and
songs.
</P>
<P>
   The school district voted earlier this week to pay the family
Barry Grunow's $40,809 full salary for the next 17 years, when he
would have been eligible for retirement. Pam Grunow will get
another $145,000 from other public sources. Callers to local radio
station WRMF have donated more than $20,000 toward the two
children's education, and an officer at First United Bank said
corporate sponsors and individuals have sent more dollars from
around the world to an account set up in the family's name. The
family's probate attorney, Bob Sorgini, said he did not yet know
how much the family has received in donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important, obviously, that Pam and (5-year-old
son) Sam and (9-month-old daughter) Lee-Anne can have, hopefully,
as normal a life as possible after this,'' Steve Grunow said during
his brief statement.
</P>
<P>
   Larmoyeux said the family had not decided whether to sue. His
law firm has begun its own investigation into the shooting, though
he stressed that he would not interfere with police and
prosecutors. The family will offer more detailed statements about
the crime itself and related issues after the grand jury meets,
most likely sometime this month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larmoyeux, whose partner Bob Montgomery led a multi-billion
dollar lawsuit against the tobacco industry, said the gun
manufacturer Phoenix Arms and the school district would be included
in his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the world wants to know why,'' Larmoyeux said. ``And all
of those individuals have to be able to answer the question, why?''

FAA WARNS ALASKA AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing about 150 instances of ``sloppiness'' in record-keeping
and maintenance oversight at Alaska Airlines, Federal Aviation
Administration officials said Friday they are prepared to prohibit
the airline from performing major maintenance work on its own
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Seattle-based airline improves its maintenance system
and oversight, the prohibition could lead to the grounding of
Alaska Airlines' 89-plane fleet, one aircraft at a time, as the
planes are scheduled to receive so-called heavy maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented proposal gives Alaska Airlines seven days to
respond. If an adequate remedy cannot be found within 30 days after
that, the FAA will bar the airline from doing heavy maintenance
that is performed on aircraft at regular intervals.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has flights in Alaska, the western United States,
and Mexico. It does not have any flights in New England.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials said they found no examples of maintenance
problems that could have affected a plane's safety of flight, but
said the problems uncovered were very serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The root cause was the result of management effectiveness and
a certain amount of sloppiness,'' said Nick Lacey, director of the
FAA's Flight Standards Service.
</P>
<P>
   The action comes out of a special FAA inspection of the carrier
in the wake of the Jan. 31 crash of an Alaska Airlines MD-80 off
the coast of Southern California that killed all 88 on board.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection, which is continuing and may result in civil
fines, found:
</P>
<P>
   --Instances of planes being put back into service when records
did not reflect that all necessary work had been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   --Procedures for in-depth inspections of aircraft were not
adequately defined in company manuals.
</P>
<P>
   -- In-house audits were unable to detect and correct problems
within the maintenance department.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials said it was highly unlikely that the airline could
implement corrective policies and actions and prove their
effectiveness within the 37 days. The FAA, however, could extend
the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Alaska Airlines,
Friday said the company would meet the seven-day deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased to say that many if not all of the findings the
FAA outlined . . . were addressed by us over recent weeks as soon
as they were raised by the FAA during its audit.'' The airline has
rewritten its maintenance manual and has taken initial steps to
improve its in-house review.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the action gives the company the chance ``to prove to
the FAA, the traveling public and ourselves that the changes we've
already instituted are working and are making us a better
airline.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the accident, several other problems at the
airline _ including the firing this week of two pilots who failed
to adequately pressurize the cabin and then continued the flight _
and the government oversight will damage the public's perception of
the airline, which has had an enviable safety record.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Alaska Airlines fell $1.1875, about 4 percent, to
$30.75 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Jan. 31 accident involved a malfunction of the
horizontal stabilizer, and a sitting grand jury is investigating
maintenance practices at the airline's facility in Oakland, Calif.,
the FAA inspection focused on maintenance by the airline at its
facilities in Oakland and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's 16 inspectors on the special investigation and Alaska
Airlines then reviewed the 79 aircraft in the fleet that had gone
through heavy maintenance and found about 150 examples of problems
with either the documentation of the work completed, or the
inspections of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is serious that the company did not pick up on these
problems,'' Lacey said. ``This is more than a paperwork problem.
Aviation accidents come as a result of small errors and the
inability to detect small errors.''
</P>
<P>
   All planes were reinspected to make sure all the work was done,
and ``we did not find anything that would affect the safety of
flight of the aircraft. If we had found sloppy maintenance, or
found serious corrosion we would have taken a different action,''
Lacey said, referring to shutting the airline down.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Alaska will not be able to outsource its
heavy maintenance ``because if they cannot assure the quality of
their own maintenance, we will not allow it to be done by anyone
else,'' Lacey said.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said the FAA will continue to provide extra oversight of
the airline for the short term, but cannot continue it
indefinitely, which means the airplanes will be grounded if Alaska
management cannot remedy the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has hired consultants to help them improve the
oversight of the maintenance program.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines will also be required to submit a growth plan to
the FAA district office for any proposed expansion of services.
</P>
<P>
   While some industry observers said the proposed FAA action
reflects a tougher agency than the one that seemed supportive of
ValuJet even after one of its planes crashed in Florida in 1996
killing everyone on board, Lacey said the FAA has also learned from
the Alaska audit.
</P>
<P>
   FAA inspectors who are regularly assigned to the airline did not
pick up on the problems. ``The principal inspector has been here
eight years and that may have been too long,'' Lacey said. ``We
will continue to look at what we can do better.''

A PENALTY WITHOUT COMPASSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 04, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush sought to put his
``compassionate'' side on display last week by giving a 30-day
reprieve to a man on death row to allow further DNA testing of
evidence in his case. No American who cares about equal justice
should be reassured by this move.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in 1995 Bush has executed 131 inmates, more
than any other governor. He has pushed for accelerated appeals, so
Texas now leads the nation in the pace of executions. The state
does not have a ``life without parole'' option, which many who
support capital punishment say they would prefer if it were
available. Texas also does not forbid the execution of the mentally
retarded. Bush has done nothing to change this.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Bush vetoed a modest ``indigent defense bill,'' which
would have established a statewide legal aid program to provide
lawyers for poor criminal defendants. Texas has no such program.
Instead, defendants are represented in court by lawyers who are
often friends or campaign contributors of the state's elected
judges. The legal representation provided such poor defendants has
been spotty, at best. Some of the lawyers have been literally
caught napping in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide has been running against Texas on the death
penalty, and Governor Bush appears to have taken notice. His own
Illinois state campaign chairman, Republican Governor George Ryan,
called a moratorium on executions earlier this year, after DNA
testing proved several death row inmates were innocent. At least a
dozen other states have moratorium bills pending in their
legislatures, and there is one in Congress, sponsored by Senator
Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. New Hampshire's legislature voted to
ban capital punishment outright, but the bill was vetoed by
Governor Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he would support DNA testing ``to erase any
doubts or concerns'' about innocent people being executed, though
only a handful of states guarantee post-conviction DNA testing for
the condemned, and Texas isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of more sophisticated DNA tests has, paradoxically,
been a boon for both opponents and defendants of capital
punishment. A national organizing drive called ``the innocence
project,'' supported mostly by law and journalism students, has
succeeded in overturning dozens of death row cases by demanding DNA
tests whenever physical evidence was available. But death penalty
supporters like Bush rely on DNA to bolster claims that the system
works. In February, Bush boasted: ``I am confident that every
person put to death under my watch in Texas has been guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, however, the verdict hinges not on physical
evidence that can be tested but on eyewitness testimony, which is
both very powerful to jurors and notoriously unreliable. The system
is still fraught with prejudice and error.
</P>
<P>
   The probability that innocent poeple are being executed may be
the most compelling reason to oppose capital punishment, but it is
not the only one. Capital punishment does not deter crime. It is
worth remembering that states with death penalties do not have
lower crime rates than those without; quite the opposite is true.
No state in New England has executed a prisoner since the Supreme
Court declared the punishment constitutional in 1976, and it has
the lowest regional crime rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The United States stands in the ignoble company of Congo, China,
and Iran among top countries putting prisoners to death, and it is
increasingly isolated among the world's democracies. The punishment
is degrading, uncivilized, and brutalizing to the entire society.
There is nothing compassionate about it.

NAVRATILOVA SHOWS FLASHES OF OLD FORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Ghost walked into an intimate tennis parlor named
Court 1, smiled at the solid wave of applause from 3,518 patrons
filling the concrete bowl, and was surprised to hear them begin
singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they were singing for my opponent, Sabine Appelmans,''
said the lefthanded ghost, with a laugh. ``She's been voted
Belgium's most desirable woman, so I guess the place was loaded
with Belgians.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad Sinatra wasn't around to sing ``Young at Heart'' to
this Ghost of Championships Past, whose baptismal name you may
recognize: Martina Navratilova.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it is like seeing a ghost, watching Navratilova again.
Making some of the good old moves at Stade Roland Garros Thursday,
this good old girl of 43 stole a piece of the French Open show with
her lifelike reappearance _ and a victory _ almost as we remember
her.
</P>
<P>
   Her brilliant career was supposedly interred six years ago with
appropriate written and spoken eulogies at Madison Square Garden,
buried in defeat by Gabriela Sabatini (although she did play a
couple of mixed doubles tourneys). Sabatini has vanished, but here
is Navratilova again. Inhabiting a major stage once more, she's
doing a second-coming shtick _ doubles only _ on hallowed dirt
where she holds the local record of seven such titles, the first
back in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose she hits the jackpot again alongside 29-year-old Mariaan
de Swardt? Would it be a grande dame's resurrection, something like
80-year-old Jessica Tandy winning an Oscar for ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' in 1989? What's driving Miss Martina here, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fun,'' she said, after the nearly two-hour, first-round
excursion into dusk, a thriller that she and de Swardt, a South
African, snatched from the Belgian-Italian alliance of Appelmans
and Rita Grande, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ``That was a blast. The competitive
juices are flowing again.''
</P>
<P>
   She's five wins short of a title, of course. Whatever, nobody
had ever before won a major match so long after the embalming of a
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I doing it? Because I can,'' she said with a grin.
``Winter of '99 I was feeling out of shape, and I didn't like it. I
started to work out again, played basketball, some tennis. And
hockey _ my team just won the Colorado women's championship. We are
tough. It was great for the legs. I'm as fit as I ever was. So I
thought, well, why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is not a comeback,'' she insisted. ``Just four
tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it a cameo-back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, I could play decent singles,'' she said. ``If I was
down-and-out financially and had to, I believe I could return to
the tour and make a living. I'm not saying what kind of living. But
I wouldn't starve. Which reminds me, I'd better start bringing my
own food to the tournament like I used to do. In the players'
dining room I counted 18 different desserts and not one vegetable
dish. French cooking is great _ but not for an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' she said, pointing to a clay smudge on her
right knee. ``That's from getting way down on volleys. You do that
enough and, if you're not in shape at my age, you can't get out of
bed the next day. I won't feel it. I'm ready for more.''
</P>
<P>
   She is holding her beloved, crippled Bina, a two-legged toy fox
terrier. ``A thalidomide puppy she was, but you should see her get
around like a kangaroo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova was getting around a lot better than de Swardt, whom
you may recall as the 1998 winner of the Boston Cup, the WTA Tour
stopover staged at Babson College in Wellesley. Her flying volleys
and the savvy of a woman who owns a record 162 doubles titles
remain. That held them together until de Swardt got her power and
touch harnessed in the third set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a partner stronger and faster than me. Well, Mariaan
is a much bigger hitter,'' Navratilova said. ``We're friends who
communicate a lot. She'd been out, injured, and didn't have a
partner. She wanted very much to play Wimbledon, and asked me if
I'd play with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got me thinking. Wimbledon is bringing back old champions
to celebrate 2000, and I'm doing some TV. So, OK. But I said I
can't jump right into Wimbledon and embarrass myself. Mariaan
wanted to play 10 tournaments. Nope. Too much. I figured we could
build up playing Madrid (where they went 1-1), here, then grass at
Eastbourne and Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I love the grass,'' on which she won 19 Big W
titles, an untouched nine in singles. ``I don't want to hear about
Billie Jean's record.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to the 20 overall titles that Billie Jean King
hung up at Wimbledon, the last paired with Navratilova in 1979.
``I'm not trying to get a piece of that, just have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, King wished her ``the best of luck. It would be
great if Martina and Mariaan won. She'd be the only player to win
Wimbledon titles in four different decades.''
</P>
<P>
   As Navratilova departed Court 1, she was beaming, her blue eyes
gleaming behind the granny glasses as she inhaled the applause and
the aroma of one more victory _ her 991st in doubles, if you must
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better than the last time I was here, 1994,'' she said. ``I
lost to Miriam Oremans in the first round and smashed my racket to
smithereens. I thought it was my last match in Paris. Court 1. I
didn't make it to Court Central, where I won all my titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I guess I exorcised a few ghosts on this court,'' said the
Ghost of Championships Past.

OCTAVIO'S RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Tonight at the Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles
Galaxy meets Galaxy East _ otherwise known as the New York/New
Jersey MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   The player allocation that brought Mexican superstar Luis
Hernandez to the Galaxy also paid huge dividends for the
MetroStars. Two Galaxy starters, Clint Mathis and Roy Myers, were
sent from L.A. to New York, where they joined Galaxy alumni Steve
Jolley, Mark Semioli and Daniel Hernandez on a team that appears to
be on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars are led by former Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano,
fired by L.A. five games into the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   New York is coming off its biggest win of the season, having
defeated the Chicago Fire 4-1 last week with goals from Jolley and
Mathis and an assist from Myers. The Metros are 5-6 after a poor
start.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy is heading the other direction, struggling through a
1-1-4 stretch. L.A. has the second-best record in the league at
6-1-6.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars might have the Galaxy right where they want them.
The Galaxy is missing striker Cobi Jones and defender Greg Vanney,
who are with the U.S. national team during the U.S. Cup. MLS
all-star defender Robin Fraser is injured and striker Sebastian
Vorbe is with Haiti's national team.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a reversal of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Octavio said he couldn't wait to play us with his whole
team,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid. ``He should be happy we're
not playing him with our whole team, but we're happy to play them
either way. We're not going to cry about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano will not be on the field tonight. He was red-carded
during a team scuffle with the Fire last week. He will watch the
game from the press box.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, the Metros have plenty to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this will mean something extra for the guys who were in
L.A.,'' said Zambrano. ``I think all of them in one way or another
feel they weren't part of the nucleus here, otherwise they wouldn't
be with us. They want to win this one badly, there's no doubt about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano is not convinced the Galaxy is a depleted team since
the Hernandez signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all, the Galaxy is still the team to beat,'' said
Zambrano. ``They finally got the piece they were looking for to
take them to a championship and this team has to win a
championship. There's no reason why they shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about chemistry and their loss of players?
</P>
<P>
   ``They got Luis Hernandez,'' Zambrano said. ``He's the type who
can win you a championship. There are very few foreign players who
have his kind of impact on a team. I don't think anyone would
disagree that Luis is the best foreign striker in our league's
market. He will carry that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said he might have a few surprises in his lineup.
Midfield/striker Sasha Victorine played defense in a scrimmage this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``(A win) could set a great tone,'' said Schmid. ``But I told
our guys not to be concerned about the results as much as us
playing good soccer. We haven't played good soccer in the last
three to four weeks.''

CUBA CALLED WILLING TO NEGOTIATE WITH U.S. FIRMS WHOSE ASSETS IT
SEIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cuba is prepared to negotiate with U.S. companies
that had property confiscated when Fidel Castro came to power 41
years ago, according to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce official who
returned from Havana on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A dialogue on settling claims would be the first since Castro
took power in 1959 and seized assets from many foreigners who owned
houses or did business there. The United States and Cuba do not
have formal diplomatic relations and have not held bilateral talks
on the disputed assets, Clinton administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The offer is being made as several U.S. lawmakers, the Chamber
of Commerce and some American corporate executives have sought to
improve ties with Cuba, which is subject to a strict trade embargo
by the United States. Some U.S. companies are eager to see the
embargo eased so that they can conduct business in Cuba, where
Canadian and European rivals have invested hundreds of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber vice president, L. Craig Johnstone, said senior
Cuban officials were ``receptive to the notion'' of negotiating
settlements when he met them this week. He said Foreign Affairs
Minister Felipe Perez-Roque and the president of the National
Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, were among the officials who expressed
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong sentiment in Cuba today that the relationship
has the potential of improving,'' Johnstone said. ``I think this is
an attempt to incur good will and appear reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cuban Foreign Ministry official said Friday that he had no
information about discussions with Johnstone. He said his
government had long offered to discuss compensation claims with the
United States, because Cuba wants to be compensated for losses
incurred under the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,900 U.S. companies and individuals have $6 billion in
claims against the Cuban government for property seized after 1959,
an administration official said. The claims were adjudicated by
U.S. courts in the 1970s and have been pending since then. The
official said he was not aware of any recent Cuban offers to
discuss settlements.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that they do not expect much progress in
resolving asset claims until relations with Cuba are normalized.
But the overture by Cuban officials seems intended to bolster U.S.
business support for better ties between the nations.
</P>
<P>
   Johnstone said the negotiations would be sponsored by the
Washington-based chamber and held outside diplomatic channels. He
said the Cuban officials indicated a preference for discussing
claims with selected U.S. companies, but added that they did not
rule out resolving disputes with other claimants down the road.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many U.S. claimants are eager to reach
settlements with Cuba outside official channels. Johnstone said
that several companies within the chamber's corporate membership
have indicated a willingness to do so, but he declined to name
them.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate attempt to improve commercial ties, Cuban
officials agreed for the first time to allow a delegation of
private restaurateurs and farmers to visit the United States in
September, Johnstone said. He called the exchange a breakthrough
because it would allow a relatively obscure part of the Cuban
economy to emerge into the international spotlight.

NORTHEASTERN NAMES NEW HEAD FOOTBALL COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Brown took over as Northeastern's head football coach
Thursday with the blessings of his former boss, University of
Massachusetts coach Mark Whipple, himself a candidate for the
Huskies' job 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don is an excellent coach and person,'' said Whipple of Brown,
a 1976 Norwich University graduate and former All-New England
running back. ``He'll get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don was my assistant at Brown and here at UMass. We had
success working together at both places and I feel he'll do a
terrific job. He has a solid background and I'll miss him. But he
deserves a chance to be a head coach at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Word around Amherst was that if Whipple were to leave, he'd have
been succeeded by Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a native of Spencer, Mass., replaces Barry Gallup, who
resigned last month after nine seasons to become director of
football operations at Boston College. Gallup beat out Whipple, who
was head coach at New Haven, and BC's Tom O'Brien, for the NU job
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who signed a multiyear contarct, was one of three
finalists, according to NU athletic director Ian McCaw. ``We had
over 60 applicants and I broke it down to eight,'' McCaw said. ``Of
those eight, three were interviewed: (Maine coach) Jack Cosgrove,
(Harvard assistant) Bruce Tall, and Don. Don was a nice fit. I feel
very comfortable with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern's four captains, Steve Arienta, Kyle Porter, Matt
Comella, and Chris McEwan attended each interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about playing for Coach Brown even if this is my
last year,'' said Arienta, a tight end from Parsippany, N.J. ``I
like him. He's honest and right to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also appreciate the defense he threw at us last year when we
played UMass. His teams do a lot on defense. I saw UMass films last
season and played against UMass and I really liked what he
installed.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass defeated Northeastern, 77-0, last season.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five decades, Northeastern has been a graveyard
for coaches. In nine seasons Gallup was 38-60-1 with winning
seasons in 1996 (6-5) and 1997 (8-3); Paul Pawlak was 35-67-1 from
1981 to '90; and Robert ``Bo'' Lyons was 34-52-1 from 1972 to '80.
</P>
<P>
   The last Husky coach with a winning record for his career was
Joe Zabilski, who was 101-76-6 from 1948-71. Many of NU's opponents
were in Division 2 and 3 during those years.
</P>
<P>
   The past figures don't bother Brown, who is known for defensive
expertise. ``I believe in the now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's defenses at Plymouth State (1993-95) were feared and
respected. He stressed an intelligent, swarming defense that
featured quickness and the ability to adapt. His 1998 Brown defense
held opponents to 19.4 points a game, the Bears' best in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is to attack from both sides of the ball,'' said
Brown. ``We will be a ready football team and we will play with
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I have to let the dust settle and next week I'll
talk with all the coaches who assisted Barry Gallup. We'll see what
fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I have to say I'm excited about Northeastern even
more now than before the first interview. Meeting the four captains
told me a lot about the Northeastern players and the program. They
made me want the job even more. I can't wait to meet the rest of
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown repeated the words aggressive and intensity several times.
His wife, Debbie, said, ``We've been close since I was 10 years
old. He's that kind of man.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown started coaching at Hartford (Vt.) High School and went on
to coach at Mansfield University in Pennsylvania and Dartmouth
under Joe Yukica. He made a name for himself as a defensive whiz at
Yale under Carm Cozza from 1987-93.
</P>
<P>
   At Plymouth State, Brown's teams posted a 25-6 record, including
back-to-back undefeated regular seasons, two Freedom Conference
titles, and two trips to the NCAA Division 3 playoffs.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ En Vieques no hay centros comerciales,
cadenas de servicio rapido, casinos ni semaforos. Y mientras los
puertorriquenos se preparan a votar sobre el futuro de la Marina de
Guerra norteamericana en la isla, llena de playas, la belleza del
lugar ha deslumbrado a los hoteleros. ``La expansion es mas que
inevitable: ya esta en marcha,'' dice Burr Vail, presidente de la
Camara de Comercio de Vieques y propietario de la Hacienda
Tamarindo, uno de los mayores moteles de la isla, con 16
habitaciones.
 &HT;    Vieques es el unico lugar del planeta donde la flota atlantica
de la Marina realiza bombardeos de practica con proyectiles reales.
 &HT;    Tras anos de protestas esporadicas, la oposicion a la presencia
militar se galvanizo en abril de 1999, cuando dos bombas erraron el
blanco y mataron a un guardia de seguridad civil e hirieron a
cuatro. A principios de febrero de este ano, el gobernador de
Puerto Rico, Pedro Rossello, acepto la reanudacion de las practicas
a cambio de realizar un referendo sobre la presencia de la Marina.
El referendo debe celebrarse en agosto y la Marina podria tener que
retirarse para el 2003, en cuyo caso Vieques podria albergar a una
legion de hoteles.
 &HT;    La Compania de Turismo de Puerto Rico solo menciona siete
moteles en sus folletos sobre Vieques, el mayor con 35
habitaciones. ``No cabe duda que el turismo se desarrollara mas si
la Marina se va,'' dice Carmen Leticia Guadalupe, representante de
la Oficina de Turismo de Vieques. ``Me imagino que despues que
quede claro que la Marina se va, veremos un gran interes entre las
cadenas hoteleras, porque esta isla tiene un gran potencial.''
 &HT;    Para algunos hoteleros, la retirada de la Marina es inevitable.
El Martineau Bay Resort, de 156 habitaciones, debe abrir este ano
en Isabel Segunda, la mayor de dos comunidades en la isla de 9.300
habitantes. El complejo de US$49 millones, administrado por
Rosewood Hotel &AMP; Resorts, de Dallas, contara con 12 hectareas de la
costa norte llenas de villas, a US$450 la noche. Una segunda fase
dara a Vieques su primer campo de golf.
 &HT;    Entretanto, James Weis, dueno del popular motel Inn on the Blue
Horizon, de nueve habitaciones, esta pujando por 40 hectareas de
terreno para construir dos o tres hoteles. Otro proyecto turistico,
estancado desde hace anos por falta de financiamiento, se redisena
para convertirlo en un hotel de tema ecologico.
 &HT;    Las promesas de inversion hotelera recibiran el impulso de la
expansion del aeropuerto, ya en marcha, que permitira que los
grandes aviones comerciales se unan a los pequenos aparatos que
transportan a los visitantes desde San Juan en vuelos de 18
minutos. American Eagle y Continental Airlines ya han expresado
interes.
 &HT;    La economia de Vieques estuvo dominada por el cultivo de la cana
de azucar hasta los anos 40, cuando llego la Marina, que ahora es
su vecino mayor y duena de las dos terceras partes de la isla.
Aunque su presencia y el ruido de los bombardeos han desalentado el
desarrollo del turismo en gran escala, muchos puertorriquenos
viajan a la isla de 32 kilometros de largo, acampan en la playa o
alquilan habitaciones a los vecinos.
 &HT;    Si la Marina se marcha, probablemente tambien lleguen turistas
extranjeros. Encajada entre Puerto Rico y las Islas Virgenes de
Estados Unidos, Vieques tiene unas 25 playas, unas 124 especies de
aves, una fortaleza espanola construida en 1854 y arrecifes de
coral. Embarcaciones con motores electricos para no contaminar el
medio ambiente llevan grupos de turistas a Mosquito Bay, donde
millones de microorganismos llamados dinoflagelados emiten luz
cuando algun movimiento los perturba. Caballos salvajes recorren
las playas y los jazmines y flores silvestres perfuman el aire.
 &HT;    Ellen Adelman, directora regional de mercadeo de Rosewood,
apunta que aunque la Marina alejo de la isla el desarrollo
industrial y turistico, doto a Vieques de una infraestructura
envidiable: buenas carreteras, promesas de mejoramiento en la
terminal de transbordadores, las tuberias que llevan agua desde
Puerto Rico y el aeropuerto.
 &HT;    Weis, cuyo lujoso motel Inn on the Blue Horizon es el mas caro
de Vieques (US$200 la noche), dice que es demasiado pronto para
preocuparse por una avalancha turistica. ``Si vinieran 5.000
personas, seria terrible. Pero con Martineau Bay trayendo 200 y
nosotros 300 por noche, la isla no se va a congestionar,''
pronostica.
 &HT;    Weis, que hace las veces de enlace entre los duenos de negocios
de Vieques y el Pentagono, dice que un grupo especial encargado de
estudiar el asunto parece estar a favor de convertir gran parte de
los terrenos de la Marina en una reserva como la de isla Culebra,
frente a Puerto Rico. Los lugares donde hay emplazamientos de
artilleria podrian apartarse como santuarios para aves.
 &HT;    La isla es pequena, pero hay espacio para mas gente,'' dice
Weis. ``Creo que en Vieques tienen que pasar 20 anos por lo menos
para empezar a preocuparnos sobre el exceso de urbanizacion.''
Vail, de la Camara de Comercio, agrega: ``No queremos ser solamente
casinos, clubes nocturnos y hoteles. Pero no creo que la
urbanizacion y el turismo abrumen a la isla.''

 &HT;    VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ En Vieques no hay centros comerciales,
cadenas de servicio rapido, casinos ni semaforos. Y mientras los
puertorriquenos se preparan a votar sobre el futuro de la Marina de
Guerra norteamericana en la isla, llena de playas, la belleza del
lugar ha deslumbrado a los hoteleros. ``La expansion es mas que
inevitable: ya esta en marcha,'' dice Burr Vail, presidente de la
Camara de Comercio de Vieques y propietario de la Hacienda
Tamarindo, uno de los mayores moteles de la isla, con 16
habitaciones.
 &HT;    Vieques es el unico lugar del planeta donde la flota atlantica
de la Marina realiza bombardeos de practica con proyectiles reales.
 &HT;    Tras anos de protestas esporadicas, la oposicion a la presencia
militar se galvanizo en abril de 1999, cuando dos bombas erraron el
blanco y mataron a un guardia de seguridad civil e hirieron a
cuatro. A principios de febrero de este ano, el gobernador de
Puerto Rico, Pedro Rossello, acepto la reanudacion de las practicas
a cambio de realizar un referendo sobre la presencia de la Marina.
El referendo debe celebrarse en agosto y la Marina podria tener que
retirarse para el 2003, en cuyo caso Vieques podria albergar a una
legion de hoteles.
 &HT;    La Compania de Turismo de Puerto Rico solo menciona siete
moteles en sus folletos sobre Vieques, el mayor con 35
habitaciones. ``No cabe duda que el turismo se desarrollara mas si
la Marina se va,'' dice Carmen Leticia Guadalupe, representante de
la Oficina de Turismo de Vieques. ``Me imagino que despues que
quede claro que la Marina se va, veremos un gran interes entre las
cadenas hoteleras, porque esta isla tiene un gran potencial.''
 &HT;    Para algunos hoteleros, la retirada de la Marina es inevitable.
El Martineau Bay Resort, de 156 habitaciones, debe abrir este ano
en Isabel Segunda, la mayor de dos comunidades en la isla de 9.300
habitantes. El complejo de US$49 millones, administrado por
Rosewood Hotel &AMP; Resorts, de Dallas, contara con 12 hectareas de la
costa norte llenas de villas, a US$450 la noche. Una segunda fase
dara a Vieques su primer campo de golf.
 &HT;    Entretanto, James Weis, dueno del popular motel Inn on the Blue
Horizon, de nueve habitaciones, esta pujando por 40 hectareas de
terreno para construir dos o tres hoteles. Otro proyecto turistico,
estancado desde hace anos por falta de financiamiento, se redisena
para convertirlo en un hotel de tema ecologico.
 &HT;    Las promesas de inversion hotelera recibiran el impulso de la
expansion del aeropuerto, ya en marcha, que permitira que los
grandes aviones comerciales se unan a los pequenos aparatos que
transportan a los visitantes desde San Juan en vuelos de 18
minutos. American Eagle y Continental Airlines ya han expresado
interes.
 &HT;    La economia de Vieques estuvo dominada por el cultivo de la cana
de azucar hasta los anos 40, cuando llego la Marina, que ahora es
su vecino mayor y duena de las dos terceras partes de la isla.
Aunque su presencia y el ruido de los bombardeos han desalentado el
desarrollo del turismo en gran escala, muchos puertorriquenos
viajan a la isla de 32 kilometros de largo, acampan en la playa o
alquilan habitaciones a los vecinos.
 &HT;    Si la Marina se marcha, probablemente tambien lleguen turistas
extranjeros. Encajada entre Puerto Rico y las Islas Virgenes de
Estados Unidos, Vieques tiene unas 25 playas, unas 124 especies de
aves, una fortaleza espanola construida en 1854 y arrecifes de
coral. Embarcaciones con motores electricos para no contaminar el
medio ambiente llevan grupos de turistas a Mosquito Bay, donde
millones de microorganismos llamados dinoflagelados emiten luz
cuando algun movimiento los perturba. Caballos salvajes recorren
las playas y los jazmines y flores silvestres perfuman el aire.
 &HT;    Ellen Adelman, directora regional de mercadeo de Rosewood,
apunta que aunque la Marina alejo de la isla el desarrollo
industrial y turistico, doto a Vieques de una infraestructura
envidiable: buenas carreteras, promesas de mejoramiento en la
terminal de transbordadores, las tuberias que llevan agua desde
Puerto Rico y el aeropuerto.
 &HT;    Weis, cuyo lujoso motel Inn on the Blue Horizon es el mas caro
de Vieques (US$200 la noche), dice que es demasiado pronto para
preocuparse por una avalancha turistica. ``Si vinieran 5.000
personas, seria terrible. Pero con Martineau Bay trayendo 200 y
nosotros 300 por noche, la isla no se va a congestionar,''
pronostica.
 &HT;    Weis, que hace las veces de enlace entre los duenos de negocios
de Vieques y el Pentagono, dice que un grupo especial encargado de
estudiar el asunto parece estar a favor de convertir gran parte de
los terrenos de la Marina en una reserva como la de isla Culebra,
frente a Puerto Rico. Los lugares donde hay emplazamientos de
artilleria podrian apartarse como santuarios para aves.
 &HT;    ``La isla es pequena, pero hay espacio para mas gente,'' dice
Weis. ``Creo que en Vieques tienen que pasar 20 anos por lo menos
para empezar a preocuparnos sobre el exceso de urbanizacion.''
Vail, de la Camara de Comercio, agrega: ``No queremos ser solamente
casinos, clubes nocturnos y hoteles. Pero no creo que la
urbanizacion y el turismo abrumen a la isla.''

TESTING THE OUTER LIMITS AT ABB 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 4) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland _ For a man who wants to unlock the
brainpower of his company's 165,000 employees, Goeran Lindahl,
chief executive of the Swiss-Swedish multinational ABB, came to
respect the power of the human mind in an unconventional way.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man drafted into a mountain ranger military unit in
his native Sweden, Lindahl said, he once spent a night huddled in a
tent at a temperature of minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit. ``It's so
cold you have to play piano with your toes'' to keep them from
freezing, he said _ a task that required as much mental as physical
toughness. The experience led him to a conclusion. ``The only limit
is in your mind,'' he said in an interview at ABB's unpretentious,
five-story headquarters here. ``The capacity of the human being is
without limit.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Lindahl, 55, an electrical engineer by training, has
traded his mountain adventures for hobbies like inline skating and
trout fishing. On the road 200 days a year to his company's
far-flung outposts, he spends his other time with his wife,
Kristina, a former teacher, and two children. But his belief in the
power of the mind in survival and transformation endures.
</P>
<P>
   His ready charm and poker player's blue eyes mask what some
staff members call simmering impatience and a lightning temper. In
the three years since he took over ABB _ part of the empire
associated with Sweden's Wallenberg dynasty _ he has begun a
transformation with long-term survival and profit in mind. He has
shed the power generation, nuclear and rail divisions that marked
ABB as an anchor of the old economy to gain it a larger place in
the technology-driven world of the new.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has dismantled the company's complex
ownership structure, which involved two holding companies, in
Zurich and Stockholm, and four categories of stock to protect
control of the Wallenberg family in Sweden and the Schmidheiny
family in Switzerland. Now there is just one class of stock _ a
move intended in part to ready the company for listing on the New
York Stock Exchange later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes have also wrought a shift in Lindahl's standing.
In the course of what he terms ABB's ``second revolution'' after
its formative 1988 merger, Lindahl has moved out from what many saw
as the shadow of industry titans who were the benchmarks by which
he has been measured: John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric and
Percy Barnevik, Lindahl's predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Barnevik won wide acclaim for overseeing the 1988 merger that
created ABB from Sweden's Asea and Switzerland's Brown Boveri and
building a vast, global engineering company. In the process,
Barnevik earned comparison with Welch. When Lindahl took over, some
analysts assumed he was no more than a strait-laced engineer moving
uncomfortably into a bigger man's boots. But today, Lindahl
dismisses such comparisons with breezy nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   Barnevik, he said, ``has a different shoe size so I can't
respond to that question.'' He acknowledged that without Barnevik's
efforts in unifying two very distinct companies, ``we couldn't have
taken the steps we have.'' But, putting some distance between
himself and Barnevik, he went on to say, ``Each time needs its
approach and we have new times.''
</P>
<P>
   By ABB's traditional standards, those times have been
tumultuous, moving the company away from its 110-year-old roots as
a power generator to concentrate on areas like switches and other
technology-laden supplies used in construction, oil and gas
exploration, factory automation, power transmission and financial
services, where it hopes to deploy high-technology innovation and
expertise alongside its traditional engineering skills. But the
shift brought some soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think: is it right to dispose of your roots?'' Lindahl
said. ``A tree without roots will die unless you replant it and put
it in new soil, with new roots. Then it will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindahl signaled the beginnings of the transplant with the 1998
$2.1 billion acquisition of Italy's Elsag Bayley Process
Automation. He announced the deal as part of what he termed ``a
master plan to take this company into the third millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lindahl's rush to build bridges between the old economy and
the new is not heedless or headlong. True, ABB is part of a $1
billion Swedish consortium to promote high-technology start-ups. It
is moving toward selling its products on a business-to-business ABB
Mall Web site that will be started late this year. Its worldwide
staff includes some 25,000 software engineers. But Lindahl bridles
at attempts to distinguish between old and new economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to accept the word `old economy','' he said. ``I
could maybe talk about a classical economy and then the digital
economy. But these are part of the same economy.'' The digital
economy, he said, was no more than ``a tool in our kit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't create revenues,'' he said. ``It doesn't create
the bottom line. That comes out of the classical economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula seems to have pleased the markets: between the
acquisition of Elsag Bayly in October 1998 and the final shedding
of its power generation interests in March this year, ABB stock
soared. And, while the slow pace of the company's revenue growth at
4 percent in 1999 has worried some investors, its earnings leaped
by 24 percent last year, to $1.6 billion. But Lindahl is not
through yet. By listing in New York, he said, he wants to be able
to use stock as the currency for acquisitions in the United States
and elsewhere. ``I don't want us to be seen as a Swiss or even a
Swedish-Swiss company,'' he said. ``I want us to be seen as a
global company.''

 &HT;    Entrepreneur fills the niche for gun traders
 &HT;    By Brad Schrade
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sitting in linen shorts in his meticulously kept home,
Steve Urvan runs a Web site that helps gun enthusiasts find that
perfect .44 magnum handgun at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   GunBroker.com is the 34-year-old Georgia Tech dropout's effort
to grab a nugget of the e-business gold rush. It's an online
auction house that brings wired gun buyers and sellers together.
Industry observers say the year-old site is among the leading gun
auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Urvan, who favors golf as a sport and had never fired a gun
until moving to Georgia from Ohio, sees nothing wrong with people
selling guns on the Internet as long as federal and local laws are
followed. Urvan maintains the site and doesn't sell guns himself,
but instead creates a safe, user-friendly marketplace, he says. He
makes his money from the site through advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this idea that children can log onto the Internet and
buy guns as easily as you could log on and buy a book or a CD,''
said Urvan. ``That's just not the case. You can't order a gun and
have it show up on your doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gun forces have targeted the Internet as part of their
effort to slow gun sales in America. And an incident last month
focused national attention on the company Urvan and his girlfriend
run out of his home on a quiet, tree-lined street. Police say two
New Jersey high school students posing as a gun dealer illegally
purchased semi-automatic handguns through GunBroker.com.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey case illustrates how easily guns can slip into
the wrong hands through e-commerce, in transactions often conducted
over hundreds of miles without face-to-face contact, said David
Bernstein, spokesman for Handgun Control, a Washington-based lobby
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet opens up another loophole in our gun laws that
needs to be closed,'' Bernstein said. ``Internet gun sales is a
virtual gun show where buyers, criminals and minors can buy guns
without having to complete background checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Urvan counters that GunBroker.com requires that any firearm
transaction take place through a dealer with a federal firearms
license, which requires a background check. A seller must ship the
gun to a licensed dealer, who charges a small fee to the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-olds in New Jersey persuaded a Florida gun dealer to
give them his license number and they forged a license, police
said. They used the license to purchase guns from dealers who had
posted on Urvan's site, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-gun political climate is what gave Urvan his start.
E-Bay, a leading auction house for anything from Beanie Babies to
old Playboy magazines, discontinued gun auctions in 1999, saying
the Internet wasn't appropriate for selling guns. Others followed,
leaving online gun traders few places to turn.
</P>
<P>
   So Urvan, a computer consultant who had been toying with various
Internet business plans, seized the opportunity. He and friends
pooled $5,000 to $10,000 and had a site up within a month. Urvan
projects year-end sales reaching more than $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a slam-dunk, absolute no-brainer to jump on,'' said
Urvan. ``These people were going somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 80 auction sites devoted to firearms and about
4,000 sites that have firearm sales, the federal government is
paying attention. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is
starting a unit to investigate firearms and explosives sales on the
Internet, said ATF spokeswoman Tracy Hite.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date we have not seen that many cases of (illegal) firearms
trafficking on the Internet,'' Hite said. ``However, it is a
potential problem that we are working to prepare for.''

NASDAQ SOARS, OTHER INDEXES ALSO GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also ECON-REPORT, STOCKS-ASSESS) 
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index soared 6.44 percent
Friday, ending its best week ever, as investors cheered data
suggesting that the nation's economy is slowing and the Federal
Reserve may be almost done raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in many technology stocks echoed the wild trading seen
in January and February, with many big technology companies rising
10 percent or more on heavy volume. Overall, the Nasdaq rose 230.88
points, to 3,813.38, continuing its extraordinary volatility. Other
indexes also gained, though less than the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones
industrial average increased 142.56 points, or 1.34 percent, to
10,794.76, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index jumped 28.45
points, or 1.96 percent, to 1,477.26.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment in May rising unexpectedly and wages nearly
flat, Wall Street strategists believe that the Federal Reserve is
no longer likely to raise short-term interest rates later this
month and may not have to push rates much higher this year. To slow
the economy and keep inflation down, the Fed has already raised
short-term rates six times since June 1999, and until this week
many economists thought at least two more increases were likely.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are usually considered bad for stocks,
because a slower economy hurts corporate profits. Now, whether
right or wrong, investors, who are convinced that rates will remain
relatively stable, are eagerly seeking out shares in many of the
companies they fled earlier this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The buying spree, which began in earnest Wednesday, accelerated
Friday as many stocks jumped at the opening bell and stayed strong
through the close of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is fairly clear that investors, after believing
that there would be at least one more Fed tightening, have
concluded that would not be the case,'' said Ed Yardeni, chief
economist and global investment strategist with Deutsche Bank
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni said he believed that the Fed, whose primary mandate is
to keep the U.S. economy growing steadily with low inflation, ran
the risk of embarrassing itself if it continued to raise rates this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a spike in energy prices and scattered indications that
wage inflation is rising, ``the latest inflation indicators suggest
that inflation isn't even close to being a problem,'' Yardeni said.
``The Fed is just going to have to chill out and enjoy
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief investment strategist for Goldman,
Sachs, said the breadth of this week's rally impressed her. While
the Nasdaq's frantic gains in January and February came largely at
the expense of old-economy stocks in the S&AMP;P 500, the gains this
week included both the Nasdaq and the S&AMP;P, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation where investors are taking a look at the
economic data and deciding the situation was not quite as ugly as
they had assumed,'' Cohen said. ``The economy is still growing, but
more slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Friday's action had more than a touch of last winter's
speculative fever to it. Many big Nasdaq stocks rose 10 percent or
more, with JDS Uniphase up 12 1/8, to 110 3/8, and Broadvision
gaining 10 1/8, to 53 5/8. Bellwether Cisco Systems, the
second-largest stock on the Nasdaq, continued to rally, gaining 3
7/16, to 64 3/8. Cisco has now gained almost 30 percent in just
over a week, adding $100 billion to its market valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Other big winners included financial stocks, which often gain
when interest rates are falling. Merrill Lynch rose 4, to 108,
while Citigroup jumped 2 15/16, to 66\.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Levy, the chief economist at Banc of America Securities,
said he expected financials to continue to gain. ``Financial stocks
always outperform prior to an inflection point,'' when the Federal
Reserve stops raising interest rates, Levy said. ``They've been
rallying in the last few weeks. They've outperformed. As analysts
soften their expectations for the Fed to tighten even more, the
rotation into financials will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone believes the Fed is done raising rates. Stephen
Slifer, the chief U.S. economist for Lehman Brothers, said he still
expects the bank to increase short-term rates by one-quarter of a
percentage point at the end of June and another quarter point in
August. In the wake of Friday's unemployment report, which showed
joblessness rose from 3.9 percent in April to 4.1 percent in May,
Lehman lowered its estimates for U.S. economic growth for the
second quarter from 6.3 percent to 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Slifer expects the economy to expand at 5.2 percent for
all of this year and another 3.7 percent next year, levels that are
extremely high by the standards of the last two decades. With the
economy growing so fast, the Fed must continue to be wary of
inflation, Slifer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any sort of recent historical standards, growth is just off
the charts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has publicly worried
about the potential inflationary effect of a rising stock market.
As the market rises, investors who feel flush may increase their
spending, overheating the economy and causing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Coming along with the broader economic slowdown, the nearly 40
percent drop in the Nasdaq between March 10 and Tuesday, which
erased more than $2 trillion in investor wealth, may have
alleviated some of the Fed's concerns, Slifer said. But if the
Nasdaq regains its losses too quickly, it could once again overheat
the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of months from now, if the Fed doesn't do anything,
they could be right back worrying about the economy overheating
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices were mixed Friday. The price of the 30-year Treasury
bond fell 2/32, to 104 9/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.94
percent. The price of the 10-year note rose 4/32, to 104 9/32. The
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell
to 6.16 percent from 6.17 percent on Thursday.

PUTIN PROPOSES ALTERNATIVE TO CLINTON'S ANTI-MISSILE PLAN

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a bid to recast a security debate just before his
summit meeting with President Clinton, President Vladimir Putin has
suggested an alternative to the proposed U.S. defense against
missile attack by nations like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing with the U.S. assessment that so-called rogue states
pose a nuclear threat, Putin hinted that the United States and
Russia could collaborate on new ways to shoot down enemy missiles
soon after they were launched. The Russian proposal is intended to
replace the plan for a nationwide shield to protect the United
States against incoming warheads that the Clinton administration
has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's alternative approach seems to resemble the plan known in
the United States as ``boost phase defense,'' which has been
proposed by a number of arms control advocates. Russian officials
have been talking privately to U.S. negotiators about the idea in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of such an approach in the United States say it would
provide the United States, Europe and Russia with the protection
that the administration insists it needs from so-called rogue
states.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system would be of little use against the Russian nuclear
force. That would make it far more acceptable to the Russian
military, which fears that a solely U.S. missile defense would be
used to gain a strategic edge.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's remarks were made in an interview with NBC Nightly News.
Parts of the interview were broadcast Thursday night by NBC, and
other parts will be aired over the weekend. A complete transcript
was made available Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to arrive here on Saturday and stay two
days.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials reacted cautiously to Putin's comments,
which were very sketchy and at times hard to interpret.
</P>
<P>
   They said his approach appeared to suggest an unacceptable
substitute for the administration's missile defense plan, which
involves the deployment of 100 interceptors and a battle-management
radar in Alaska to protect all 50 American states.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says he will make a final decision on whether to develop
such a defense based on a coming test, and new assessments of the
threat and of the effect of a missile system on arms control. But
there is tremendous political momentum behind the program, and Vice
President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic nominee to succeed
Clinton, has already endorsed such a limited defense.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by the Russian president were important as an
opening move in what promises to be a difficult negotiation. In the
interview, Putin acknowledged that the emerging missile threat _
one that Washington has associated with North Korea, Iran and other
nations _ was indeed a growing danger for the United States, Russia
and Europe. In the past, Russia dismissed such concerns as
unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than flatly rejecting the idea of new anti-missile
systems, as many Moscow officials have been doing publicly in
recent months, Putin's remarks indicated that the Kremlin believes
that some type of political pressures on those nations, as well as
anti-missile systems, might be needed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``As to new threats that they talk about in the United States,
we agree with that,'' Putin said. ``We should create new mechanisms
that will protect us from these threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning North Korea or Iran by name, Putin noted that
certain Third World nations lacked long-range bombers or
missile-firing submarines to threaten the United States. But they
are, he acknowledged, developing long-range, land-based missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are talking about threats that are directed or could be
directed at Russia or at the United States,'' he said, ``there are
countries that have that capability today that can only do that
from their own territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader then went on to describe a possible way to
deal with those threats, apparently alluding to the possibility of
a boost-phase defense that would prevent emerging Third World
powers from attacking Russia and the West with missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we could jointly put up these umbrellas above potential
areas of threat,'' he said. ``With this umbrella, we could jointly
protect all of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference to Europe also seemed to be a way of scoring
points with Western Europeans, who are very skeptical of the U.S.
missile defense plan. The administration plan would protect only
U.S. territory, and senior administration officials have made only
vague comments about Washington's willingness to share anti-missile
technology with the European allies.
</P>
<P>
   China might not welcome collaboration between Russia and the
United States on missile defense. But the limited approach proposed
by Putin might be seen by Beijing as far less threatening that the
more extensive American system, which would neutralize the Chinese
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's remarks developed some themes discussed with U.S.
officials by Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov and other Russian
officials, some of whom hinted at the boost-phase approach. Russian
politicians said Putin's comments should be seen more as inviting a
dialogue with Washington on missile defense, albeit on Moscow's
terms, than as a detailed proposal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an important political gesture toward the United
States,'' Andrei Kokoshin, a senior lawmaker who was national
security adviser when Boris Yeltsin was president, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kokoshin said the aim of Putin's plan was to explore ways to
meet some of Washington's concerns by adapting ``theater missile
defense'' systems. These are land-based interceptors that were
originally intended to counter attacks by short- and medium-range
missiles and which are allowed by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's goal, he acknowledged, was to persuade the
administration to abandon its more ambitious program, which would
require amending the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater missile defense is capable of boost-phase
interception,'' Kokoshin said in an interview. ``It would be a more
perfect solution in terms of overall strategic stability than the
unilateral American decision to build a national missile defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's suggestions leave Washington and Moscow with deep
differences. Administration officials have said they do not expect
a breakthrough at the summit meeting here, but rather are hoping to
establish a dialogue that could lead to an accord on an
anti-missile system and nuclear weapons reductions before the end
of the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The administration does not agree that the theater systems Putin
is referring to would be effective against a Third World missile
threat. And the two sides are far apart on the related issue of
slashing strategic arms, with the Russians insisting on deeper
cuts. Still, U.S. officials sought to accent the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are nuggets we can work with in a positive way,'' a
senior administration official said. ``They are recognizing the
ballistic missile threat and talking about cooperating to meet that
threat. But we do not see this as a substitute for our national
missile defense program.''
</P>
<P>
   Other American experts outside the administration were more
positive. They said Putin's plan might lead to a better system from
the point of view of U.S. as well as Russian interests.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Garwin, a leading physicist who served on a
congressional panel on the emerging missile defense, argued that a
boost-phase system would be far more effective than the
administration's proposal because it would intercept attacking
missiles before they reached their full speed and dispersed their
warheads and decoys.
</P>
<P>
   Garwin has proposed deploying such a defense on ships near the
Korean peninsula and perhaps on Russian territory. He and Ted
Postol, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
who also supports a boost-phase approach, have discussed the plan
with Russian officials and experts and promoted it as an
alternative to the administration's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot easier to put a lid over North Korea than an
umbrella over the United States and Eastern Pacific,'' Garwin said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan promoted by Garwin, however, would require amending the
ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In his NBC interview, Putin spoke of the need to preserve the
ABM accord, which sets strict limits on the testing and deployment
of anti-missile systems, saying it was a condition for arms cuts.

 MORE HMOs ARE PULLING OUT OF MEDICARE  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More health maintenance organizations will soon
pull out of Medicare or curtail their participation, disrupting
insurance coverage for hundreds of thousands of elderly people,
according to federal officials, independent experts and
managed-care executives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pledges by the Clinton administration to slow the
withdrawal of HMOs from Medicare, the insurance program for the
elderly, the exodus may actually accelerate this year, a White
House official and several experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cigna Corp. said Friday that it would end coverage for
104,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 11 states: New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland,
Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna will drop 8,000 people in New York City and Nassau and
Suffolk counties in New York; 10,700 in Connecticut, 4,800 in
northern New Jersey, 17,400 in the Los Angeles area, and 23,300 in
Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna Inc., with 676,000 Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in its
HMO, said it would pull out of some markets, without specifying
which ones.
</P>
<P>
   Health Central of Harrisburg, Pa., a not-for-profit managed care
company owned by six hospitals, said it had already decided to pull
out of Medicare next year, leaving 6,500 beneficiaries to seek
other insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare will increase payments to HMOs next year, but costs are
rising much faster. Many health plans say they have concluded that
Medicare's managed-care program, in its current form, is not viable
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries, who are elderly or disabled, must
arrange other insurance by Jan. 1. People dropped by private health
plans can try to enroll in another HMO or can return to Medicare's
original fee-for-service program. Insurance coverage for
prescription drugs _ one of the chief attractions that drew them to
managed care _ is not available under the original program. And
many people in managed care have established relations with
individual doctors that may not be easy to duplicate in a new plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, HMOs have pulled out of more than 400
counties in at least 33 states, directly affecting 734,000 Medicare
beneficiaries _ 407,000 in 1999 and 327,000 this year. The turmoil
touched one of every nine beneficiaries enrolled in managed care.
</P>
<P>
   About 6.2 million of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, or
16 percent, are now in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   July 3 is the deadline for HMOs to announce their intentions for
next year. Clinton administration officials and industry experts
say the number of people forced out of HMOs may exceed this year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number may be greater than we've seen in the past,'' said
Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House.
``We don't have a stable marketplace for managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary M. Frazier, a senior health care analyst at Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown, said, ``It wouldn't surprise me if we have another
round of pretty significant exits from the Medicare managed-care
program.'' Charles A. Boorady, a vice president of Goldman Sachs,
said the number of people affected could be ``very significant, in
the range of 400,000 to 1 million.'' And Alan J. Mittermaier,
president of Health Metrix Research Inc., an independent research
organization based in Columbus, Ohio, said he expected ``widespread
Medicare HMO withdrawals effective January 2001, resulting in
displacement of 500,000 to 1 million beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn., said she was distressed that
HMOs were pulling out of more markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crime that the federal government has been so oblivious
to this problem,'' Johnson said in an interview. ``Medicare has
smothered HMOs with regulation and starved them with low
payments.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they wanted to preserve HMOs as an
option for the elderly and the disabled but had opposed the
industry's effort to get more money because they believed that HMOs
were overpaid by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives emphasize what they say are inadequate
reimbursement rates. Aetna said it was ``reviewing future options
for its Medicare business on a market-by-market basis and expects
to exit a number of markets next year.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Joyce A. Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said: ``Our
financial performance in the Medicare business has deteriorated and
is disappointing to us. It's become increasingly difficult to offer
an affordable quality product with the existing reimbursement and
premium structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Dondes, president of Health Central, in Pennsylvania,
said his company had decided to pull out because of the losses it
would sustain on its Medicare business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision with a great deal of hesitation and a
great deal of regret,'' Dondes said in an interview. ``We have a
mission to serve seniors, but it was impossible to reconcile our
costs with the reimbursement we were receiving from Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawals of the last two years appear to have undermined
beneficiaries' confidence in HMOs, slowing the growth in
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Tricia Smith, chief federal health lobbyist at AARP, the
nation's largest organization of older Americans, said: ``Our
members have become much more cautious about the decision to join
HMOs. They realize that managed care doesn't necessarily deliver
from one year to the next in the way they anticipated.''

</P>
<P>
   Under Medicare, an HMO gets a fixed amount of federal money for
each beneficiary. Payments, set according to a complex statutory
formula, vary from county to county, with many anomalies. Urban
areas generally get more than rural areas, but some urban areas,
like New York City and Miami, get much more than others, like
Minneapolis or Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare pays $747 a month for a person living in Philadelphia,
but only $422 for a resident of York County, Pa. That disparity is
far greater than the difference in medical costs and helps explain
why HMOs are pulling out of York County. Moreover, Medicare
generally spends less on an HMO patient than on a fee-for-service
patient in the same locale, and the gap is growing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, soon after the first large group of health
plans announced that they were cutting back their Medicare
operations, President Clinton said, ``These decisions have brought
uncertainty, fear and disruption into the lives of tens of
thousands of older Americans across the country.'' He vowed then to
``prevent another disruption in coverage like the one we are seeing
now.''
</P>
<P>
   When the same thing happened a year later, the California
Legislature passed a resolution saying that thousands of HMO
patients were ``in a state of panic and confusion regarding their
future ability to access health care services, including pharmacy
benefits, at a reasonable cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials initially denied that there was
a serious problem and insisted that HMOs were just making routine
business decisions, based on many factors. But now, with more
health plans joining the exodus, officials have become more
worried.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, federal officials have been quietly
calling HMOs to ask about their plans for the coming year and to
find out what the government could do to keep them in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration emphasizes that such calls do not
reflect any change in policy, and officials still maintain that
HMOs are overpaid for the patients they treat. But Karen M.
Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans,
said, ``Our members would not be leaving Medicare if they were
overpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say some HMOs may be cutting back
participation in Medicare because of pressure from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report on the HMO industry, Frazier of Deutsche Banc
said, ``We hold little hope that Medicare is going to emerge as an
attractive business for publicly traded managed care organizations
in the near future.'' In an interview, Frazier said, ``Investors
have rewarded managed care companies that stayed away from
Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa L. Rehfus, vice president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield
of Florida, which runs an HMO serving 151,000 Medicare
beneficiaries, said, ``Our costs went up 6 percent to 8 percent
last year, but our Medicare payments have increased only 2
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, the White House official, said the best thing Congress
could do for HMOs would be to pass Clinton's plan to revamp
Medicare and guarantee prescription drug coverage as an option for
all beneficiaries. Then, he said, HMOs would get a ``direct
subsidy'' for the drug benefits they provide.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When HMOs pulled out of Medicare in the past, members of
Congress in the affected states were inundated with telephone calls
from constituents. Democrats say they have come to realize that
some of their traditional constituency groups are particularly
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation said that blacks,
Hispanics, low-income people and disabled people under the age of
65 ``experienced the greatest problems'' when HMOs withdrew from
Medicare.

<P>
   AACHEN, Germany _ Honored in this ancient European center for
his service to European unity, President Clinton Friday urged
America's European allies to invite Russia into their military and
political unions.
</P>
<P>
   Standing under an unforgiving sun in the courtyard of the
ninth-century cathedral where Charlemagne is buried and where many
Holy Roman emperors and German kings were crowned, Clinton told an
audience of several hundred people that to do otherwise would
destroy the vision of an undivided Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered his speech after he was awarded the
Charlemagne Award, which is given to a world leader who furthers
the cause of European unity.
</P>
<P>
   And in the spirit of unity on the eve of a two-day summit
meeting in Moscow with President Vladimir Putin, he made clear that
Russia deserved Europe's warm embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't yet know if Russia's hard-won democratic freedoms
will endure,'' Clinton said, citing the country's economic crisis
and the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But he envisioned a time when a prosperous, democratic Russia
would be offered membership in NATO, the military alliance created
a half-century ago to contain the Soviet threat, and in the
15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the stakes are so high, we must do everything we can
to encourage a Russia that is fully democratic and united in its
diversity; a Russia that defines its greatness not by dominance of
its neighbors, but by the dominant achievements of its people and
its partnership; a Russia that should be, indeed, must be, fully
part of Europe,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means no doors can be sealed shut to Russia _ not NATO's,
not the EU's,'' he said. ``The alternative would be a future of
harmful competition.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that if Russia decided it did not want to join NATO and
the European Union, then they must make sure that their eastward
expansion does not create ``barriers to trade, travel and security
cooperation'' with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has long said Russia could eventually
become a member of NATO if it met the military alliance's stringent
requirements. Up to now, Russia has shown no interest in joining.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, it has been a member of the interim Partnership for
Peace, a sort of junior partnership in NATO that includes no
military umbrella. In 1997, NATO and Russia signed an agreement
that allows for additional consultations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Clinton nor the Europeans have ever suggested that
Russia should join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton characterized his views as part of larger strategy for
the transformation of Russia from a hostile dictatorship to a
friendly democracy that belongs to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do everything we can to encourage a Russia that is
fully democratic,'' he said. ``Though Russia's transformation is
incomplete, there clearly is reason for hope in Russia's remarkable
journey over these last few years _ from dictatorship to
democracy.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He offered no blueprint on how to reach such ambitious goals.
But this is the last scheduled trip to Europe in the his
presidency, and Clinton was in a mood to be magnanimous.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture could also be seen as a symbolic peace offering to
Moscow, defining Russia as a great power and potential partner as
Clinton and Putin prepare for talks on such contentious issues as
Washington's proposal to develop a limited missile defense system
and Russia's prosecution of the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the other essential task for the Europeans was to
bring the Balkan region into the global mainstream. ``That is the
only way to make peace last in that bitterly divided region,'' he
said. ``Our goal must be to de-Balkanize the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also challenged the image of the United States as
a superpower bully with more power, money, military might and
political will than Europe, and portrayed it instead as a close
friend who wanted to pay his respects and clear up what he called
``potentially harmful misperceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a perception right now in America that Europe doesn't
always carry its fair share of our mutual responsibilities,'' he
said. As proof that the statement was untrue, he pointed out that
Europeans were providing more than 80 percent of peacekeeping
troops in Kosovo and of the money for economic reconstruction
there. He also said Europeans paid for more than 60 percent of all
aid to Central America after it was ravaged by Hurricane Mitch in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, there is a perception in Europe that
America's power _ military, economic, cultural _ is at times too
overbearing,'' Clinton added. He acknowledged that America's
dominant military role in NATO's air campaign in Kosovo accentuated
such fears.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was welcomed to Aachen by Mayor Juergen Linden and
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Linden put a yellow-ribboned medallion over Clinton's head, as
10 other medallion-wearing recipients of the award, including
President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic and King Juan Carlos
of Spain, looked on from the makeshift stage.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was fitting for what may be Clinton's most
comprehensive reflections on Europe in the final months of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Although Aachen, a western city a few miles from the Belgian and
Dutch borders, was severely damaged during World War II, in 1944 it
became the first German city to be occupied by the United States.
Today, it is on the cutting edge of Europe's information economy.
</P>
<P>
   In honoring Clinton for his contributions to Europe, Schroeder
praised him for ``preserving, strengthening and further
developing'' America's partnership in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton becomes the third American, following former secretaries
of state George Marshall, the architect of the plan to rebuild
Europe after World War II, and Henry Kissinger, to receive the
award.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he would donate the $2,500 that comes with
the award to a student exchange program between the sister cities
of Aachen and Arlington, Va.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ It's time for the latest installment of ``Who
Wants to Second-Guess a Billionaire?'' In today's episode, Craig
McCaw, the publicity-shy cable television and telecommunications
entrepreneur with a fabled knack for anticipating the future, hits
quicksand in his pursuit of a high-risk dream.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw's investments include a maze of advanced wired and
wireless services. But none presents a more formidable puzzle than
Teledesic, his futuristic scheme to dot the heavens with a
288-satellite network for voice and data communications.
</P>
<P>
   To most satellite experts, Teledesic's prospects have always
seemed uncertain. But the outlook for attracting investors would
appear to be considerably gloomier now that the spectacular
bankruptcy of the Iridium phone system, problems in several other
satellite ventures and the relentless advances of land-based
competitors have confirmed Wall Street's worst fears about how
tough it is to build a successful satellite business.
</P>
<P>
   Teledesic is already scaled back from the mind-boggling
840-satellite system McCaw first announced in 1994 and the start of
service has been delayed from 2001 to 2005. Still, the venture
McCaw has referred to as ``an Internet in the sky'' remains by far
the most ambitious commercial project in space.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, McCaw and his backers put up $1.2 billion to
take control of bankrupt ICO Global Communications, a smaller
satellite venture. But that hardly made the outlook any clearer.
ICO could, as McCaw contends, be a steppingstone to Teledesic. Some
experts, however, predict it will become the rationale for scaling
back Teledesic into a more marketable venture.
</P>
<P>
   For now though, Teledesic continues to grandly promise nothing
less than a full array of high-speed video, data, and voice
services to the vast portions of the planet beyond the reach of
today's ground-based wired and wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's thinking of tens of millions of customers for
satellites,'' said Samuel A. Farrer Jr., a Reston, Va.-based
satellite expert. ``No one else is talking those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one else would dare to. In an age of singular
entrepreneurs who have achieved unfathomable wealth by leading the
charge into the Information Age, the 50-year-old McCaw has been
among the boldest, repeatedly going deeply into debt to buy
licenses and communications properties that soared in value as he
improved them and new technology spread.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say they have often talked of the need to be ``90
percent'' certain before embarking on a new investment or strategy.
``But Craig's feeling of 90 percent was often Craig alone,'' said
Wayne Perry, who was a young Seattle attorney helping an equally
youthful McCaw buy cable television companies when he went to work
full time for him in 1975. ``It might be 40 percent to someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the complexity of the challenges facing Teledesic,
consider the hurdles that were already in its path when Iridium
collapsed last summer.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, rapidly evolving and expanding terrestrial
services have been chipping away at the parts of the world for
which satellites had been the only option.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, demand for satellite systems is certain to be
fragmented among services already in orbit or soon to be there.
Teledesic's focus is on computer users at fixed sites rather than
mobile customers like ICO Global and other satellite phone
companies. But those who might compete in certain segments range
from international phone companies like Globalstar, a Vodafone
Airtouch PLC subsidiary, and regional operators like the Asian
Cellular Satellite System as well as proposed high-capacity
satellite networks from consortiums led by Hughes Electronics,
Alcatel and Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Teledesic's technical feasibility is still in
question. The company has missed deadlines to settle specifications
with Motorola, its prime contractor _ which is expected to be
replaced by Hughes Space Systems, ICO's prime contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The need for overseas phone companies to sell Teledesic services
locally is another risk factor. ``It's a mess trying to get your
partners around the world working together when it's not their core
business,'' said J. Armand Musey, who follows the industry for Banc
of America Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But even assuming those hurdles could be completely overcome and
the service launched for $10 billion, the lowest estimates around,
what then? Teledesic has just two groups of potential customers
that seem out of reach of the competition: computer users in remote
lands and waters who will pay for the electronic equivalent of an
all-you-can-eat buffet and users in the developed world who will
pay to have a backup satellite Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to construct a business model with a $10 billion
investment and I can't,'' said Farrer. ``He clearly sees things I
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Preternatural far-sightedness, though, is part of McCaw's track
record. ``He's the billionaire whom even billionaires find
interesting,'' said O. Casey Corr, whose biography of McCaw,
``Money From Thin Air,'' is scheduled to be published next month by
Times Books/Random House.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw's admirers include Bill Gates, a childhood acquaintance
and now a neighbor, who put $5 million into Teledesic in 1994 after
reviewing the business plan on his honeymoon. (He has since added
millions more.) Gates told Fortune magazine in 1996 that McCaw
``understands the communications business and where it's going
better than anyone I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Detractors tend to have more qualms than criticisms. ``I'm not
sure he's a visionary,'' said Michael Cleamon, a San Francisco
consultant who has worked with Teledesic. ``He's a gambler.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyalists say that perceptions of McCaw as an extreme risk-taker
underestimate his fanatic attention to escape routes from his bets
and his willingness to shift course when conditions change
unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always knows where the back door is,'' said Robert
Ratliffe, a long-time aide. ``I don't know of a single time where
conditions have changed so much that Craig couldn't morph his
position into something useful.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein may be the clue to Teledesic's future. McCaw and his
backers could have acquired Iridium for far less than the sum they
are sinking into ICO. But ICO offered a big advantage: None of its
12 planned satellites is in the air yet, and that gives McCaw's
engineers a chance to tinker with the design of both the satellites
and the ground stations.
</P>
<P>
   The McCaw group's stated goal when ICO goes into service in 2003
is not only to sell phone service to mobile customers, as its
founders originally planned, but also to deliver email and data.
The data capacity will be just an hors d'oeuvre compared to the
Teledesic feast, but it will be a step in the direction McCaw wants
to go.
</P>
<P>
   His latest plan calls for merging the two ventures as soon as
possible, generating revenue from ICO to help fund Teledesic, using
ICO's connections to local phone companies around the world to
market Teledesic, and tailoring Teledesic's satellite network to
run traffic through ICO's ground stations, which have already been
linked by a high-capacity fiber network.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suspect, though that ICO _ even if it manages to
become profitable _ will be less a steppingstone than a path of
retreat for McCaw from his intentions to launch and operate a
full-scale Teledesic network.
</P>
<P>
   After getting ICO running, step two will be to move on to
Teledesic, predicts Roger Rusch of Telastra, a consulting firm in
Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., that advised bondholders in the ICO
bankruptcy. ``But step three,'' he said, ``will be to cancel step
two.''

</P>
<P>
   History suggests, though, that McCaw will not abandon his grand
vision simply because everyone around him sees that as the sensible
option. Many of his decisions have been described as intuitive, an
attribute McCaw himself has often ascribed to his severe dyslexia.
Unable to digest long documents, he has become a master at sizing
up the interests of those he is dealing with and staying focused on
fundamental questions, like how potential customers will perceive a
new service.
</P>
<P>
   When his intuitions harden into conviction, associates say, even
his most trusted advisers cannot budge him.
</P>
<P>
   One such occasion was McCaw's decision to acquire control of
Nextel in 1995, according to Tim Donahue, a longtime McCaw
executive who is now chief executive of Nextel, the digital
wireless carrier based in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other cellular phone systems, Nextel grew out of the
radio dispatch sector and can easily tie many users into a single
conversation. Five years ago, though, Nextel was burdened by debt
and by the poor quality of its two-way radio equipment from
Motorola, losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually and
searching for billions to build out service in the cities where it
had licenses.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw plunged in anyway, relying in part on Motorola's
commitment to improve the system if he became involved. By 1999,
Nextel's customer base had more than doubled, its stock was up 600
percent, it was branching out into foreign markets and Microsoft
had decided to invest $600 million to develop Nextel Online, an
Internet service for Nextel customers. Today, McCaw and his fellow
investors were sitting on a $3.4 billion gain on their investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves big problems with big opportunities,'' said Peter
Currie, a senior executive with McCaw Cellular Communications
during Teledesic's formative days.
</P>
<P>
   Even McCaw's charitable interests have a way of escalating into
grand schemes. His effort to return Keiko, the killer whale
featured in the movie ``Free Willy,'' to the wild has become a
multi-million-dollar project to vastly extend knowledge about the
lives of the orcas of the North Atlantic where Keiko, then about 2,
was captured in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw's career began prematurely, in tragedy. The second of four
sons of J. Elroy and Marion McCaw, a socially prominent and wealthy
Seattle couple, it was Craig who, on a visit home from Stanford
University, discovered his father dead from a stroke. Although only
19 years old at the time, Craig had been the son most interested in
the family's financial affairs, including a small cable television
business where he worked during the summer, and he was quickly
accepted as the primary manager of the family's interests going
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out Elroy's estate was no simple task. The elder McCaw
had been an avid dealmaker and borrower who loathed documentation
and paid little attention to the actual operations of the
businesses he owned. But Craig quickly set about expanding the
family's cable investments as soon as the legal clouds lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, McCaw began adding paging businesses to the portfolio.
Seven years later, when the Federal Communications Commission
licensed the first cellular phone companies, he was an active
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw prided himself on beating industry service standards.
Unlike his father, he concluded early on that happy customers
produce more revenue, which helps support more rapid expansion. But
he became best known for his willingness to borrow what seemed like
astronomical sums to bid aggressively for new properties, confident
that they would grow rapidly enough to cover his soaring debts. He
was sure that latecomers to the cellular business would pay far
higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, McCaw focused on building a nationwide network of
cellular phone licenses, in the belief that customers would be
attracted to any service that allowed them to roam freely at a
reasonable cost with a minimum of trouble. The value of such
freedom seemed obvious to a man who preferred flying, kayaking,
sailing and camping in remote regions of western Canada to working
in his office. (Water pistol wars tend to erupt when McCaw is stuck
at work too long, according to Ratliffe.)
</P>
<P>
   To build up a war chest for the increasingly expensive battles
for cellular territories, he unsentimentally sold his family's
cable television business for $755 million in 1986 and, with the
help of Michael Milken, became a major issuer of high-yield bonds.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation for making risks pay off was established by the
wealth generated in cable television. It exploded into the realm of
business legend when he sold McCaw Cellular to AT&AMP;T for $11.5
billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is like a great painter,'' said Steven Rattner, who as an
investment banker at Lazard Freres was involved in many of McCaw's
dealings. ``He doesn't paint the same thing twice, but you can see
similarities in the brush strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaw's satellite plans provide the most obvious test of such
skills, but they are hardly McCaw's only concern at the moment.
Through Eagle River Inc., an investment firm based in this Seattle
suburb, he has controlling interests in both Nextel and Nextlink,
which provides businesses with high-capacity telecommunications and
Internet services in the United States and Europe. In February,
McCaw gathered $470 million to fund the expansion of Nextel's
network into secondary and rural markets by spinning off Nextel
Partners Inc. in a public offering; the 40 percent stake controlled
by McCaw through Eagle River or Nextel is currently worth almost
$1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw has said there is no grand plan to link his
telecommunications empire together, but associates like Donahue,
Perry, and Dan Akerson, chief executive of Nextlink, look for ways
the various companies can work with each other. Nextel uses
Nextlink networks, and Perry foresees both companies promoting
Teledesic's capacity as a backup service for their business
customers.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw acknowledged that the companies could end up competing
against each other in some areas. ``Our dream, however, is to find
ways to make competitive situations more synergistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that McCaw would announce a grand plan unless forced by some
business need. Teledesic came to light when the company had to file
a petition for radio spectrum with the Federal Communications
Commission. Those in his inner circle say he is open with them, but
often difficult to read. Russell Daggett, vice chairman of
Teledesic, says associates have to ``connect the dots'' of McCaw
commentary to come up with executable plans, and Dennis Weibling,
president of Eagle River and a close financial adviser since 1982,
says that McCaw's good ideas come interspersed with ``things that
will make you bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, McCaw is so wealthy that he has a greater margin of
error than early in his career. After remarrying in 1998 following
a bitter divorce in 1997, then becoming a father for the first
time, he also has less of his life wrapped up in making his
business bets pay off. Where he once kept his aircraft, yachts and
other toys deployed to make business and vacations as convenient as
possible, he now juggles them to support family life, although not
always with the same success.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of infrastructure can keep you on schedule with
kids,'' he recently told a bemused Ratliffe.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaw remains fascinated by the satellite opportunity and is
unlikely to retreat drastically anytime soon. His interest began in
1986, when he explored putting satellites in orbit above the Indian
and western Pacific oceans to serve Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It was rekindled in 1990 when Ed Tuck, a pioneer in using
satellites to pinpoint the location of boaters, hikers and others
with handheld transmitters, suggested using satellites in low-earth
orbits for a global phone system that would not suffer the
disruptive delays that plagued calls using geo-stationary
satellites in high orbits.
</P>
<P>
   In McCaw's hands, the vision expanded to encompass a variety of
computer applications that could benefit from eliminating that
signal lag, known as latency. The devil was in the details: No one
could see how Teledesic could afford, much less control, the 840
satellites in the original plan, which would be constantly shifting
their positions in relation to the earth's surface. Beyond that, no
one had ever secured permission from regulators around the world to
use the broad swath of high-frequency radio spectrum Teledesic
wanted for such communications.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw handed the challenge to Daggett, a lawyer by training, and
has yet to look back. Today, Teledesic has its regulatory
approvals. It also has big name investors like Boeing ($100
million), Motorola ($750 million, including assets from Celestri, a
planned network that was folded into Teledesic), and Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia ($200 million).
</P>
<P>
   Teledesic's new headquarters in Bellevue, Wash., presents a
thrifty facade: it is the back half of a warehouse abutting a
railroad line in an industrial section of town. But inside is a
confidently over-budget mixture of cool and whimsy, complete with
an on-site coffee bar.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ICO deal, the apparent prosperity could not quell
reports that Teledesic's progress had stalled. Indeed, if anyone
but McCaw had been involved, Teledesic would probably have been
dismissed long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But McCaw is someone you never bet against,'' said Musey.

JOBS REPORT INDICATES SLOWING OF U.S. ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET, STOCKS-ASSESS) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the strongest signal yet that the booming American economy is
finally slowing, the Labor Department reported Friday that the
nation's private sector employers, instead of hiring, shed 116,000
jobs in May. It was the largest drop in more than eight years and
the first since the economy began to soar in the mid 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate edged up to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent,
with blacks and Hispanics absorbing most of the loss. Wage
increases, which had accelerated in the early spring, eased in May,
reducing concerns about inflation. Jobs disappeared in almost every
sector of the economy, except government, where the hiring of
357,000 census takers for the once-a-decade population count offset
the decline in business jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs report came on the heels of a half-dozen other
indications this week that a still very strong economy is beginning
to cool off, responding to the Federal Reserve's six interest rate
increases over the last year. Car sales and home sales have dipped
recently, partly because of higher car loan and mortgage rates.
Construction spending is off and manufacturing production appears
to have weakened in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly have evidence now that the economy is slowing,''
said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers. ``The question is how much.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, investors pushed up stocks across the board
Friday _ as they have for much of the week _ in the belief that the
accumulating evidence of a slowing economy would encourage the
Federal Reserve to limit future rate increases aimed at keeping
inflation under control. The Nasdaq index registered its largest
weekly percentage gain in history and the Dow Jones industrial
average had one of its best weekly performances this year. The Dow
closed above 10,794 Friday, up more than 142 points. The Nasdaq
closed at 3,813, up more than 230 points.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy may not be losing as much steam as many
investors now seem to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Wall Street forecasters had expected another
rate increase at the Fed's meeting in late June. That expectation
had helped to damp stock prices, and had led many economists to
predict that the robust consumer spending fostered by the so-called
``wealth effect'' of rising stock prices would begin to moderate.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street's exuberance now creates a quandary for the Fed.
``The economy is probably slowing, but the markets are so excited
about it that higher stock prices are already increasing the odds
of a speed-up in the economy this summer,'' said John Makin, an
economist at the American Enterprise Institute. A revived wealth
effect, he and other economists argued, could swamp the Fed's
efforts to slow the economy, or convince the policy-makers to keep
raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that when people believe the economy is slowing,
the markets behave in a way that encourages people to spend more,''
Makin said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Fed's policy-makers, starting with Alan
Greenspan, the chairman, have made no reference in recent speeches
to the state of the economy _ one concern being that if they were
to observe that the economy might be slowing, stock prices could
really take off.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argued that the latest figures were
nothing to worry about. ``The economy took a breather in May,''
said Alexis Herman, the labor secretary, ``but it remains robust.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists lowered their forecasts Friday for economic
growth in the second quarter, which ends on June 30. For example,
Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis, predicted
that growth would be closer to 3 percent than the 4.5 percent
originally forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But the May report may have overstated the job losses. Just as
the March and April reports seemed to exaggerate job growth, some
economists said, the May numbers seemed unrealistically low.
Indeed, job growth in the private sector averaged 182,000 a month
from January through May, almost in line with last year's average
of 202,000 jobs a month.
</P>
<P>
   Count all the census takers hired in May and jobs actually rose
by 231,000, the Labor Department reported. But without them, the
116,000 jobs lost in the private sector was the first loss since
January 1996, when 61,000 jobs disappeared, and the largest since
November 1991, when the work force shrunk by 129,000 jobs as the
nation emerged from its last recession.
</P>
<P>
   May was the last month in which census takers will be hired in
huge numbers; the estimate for June is only 11,000. Still, some
economists argued that if the census takers had not gone to work
for the government, at $8 to $18 an hour, many would have found
employment in the private sector, swelling the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private sector employment number is definitely''
excessive, said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic
Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cutbacks were widespread. Reversing an earlier trend,
29,000 jobs disappeared in construction, 71,000 in wholesale and
retail trade, 17,000 in manufacturing, and 11,000 in
transportation, mostly trucking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jobs even fell for college graduates,'' said Lawrence Mishel,
research director at the Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department statisticians offered various special reasons
for much of the drop, particularly for construction and retailing.
Warm winter weather, for example, swelled construction rolls in
April, so employers did not need to hire in May. Retailing
exhibited a similar pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The wage and hours numbers were less equivocal. Average hourly
earnings, covering 80 million production employees in a work force
of 131.7 million in May, rose only a cent, to $13.65, the smallest
increase in months. This number is the first on wage trends each
month, and with the slight May increase, wage growth over the
previous 12 months fell to 3.5 percent from 3.8 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   The slight rise in joblessness hit hardest at blacks, whose
unemployment rate rose to 8 percent from 7.2 percent. That was
still well below the peak for the 1990s of 14.2 percent in June
1992. And Hispanics, whose rate edged up to 5.8 percent from 5.4
percent, also were far from the peak of 12.1 percent, also in June
1992. By comparison, the unemployment rate for white adults
remained at 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of people available to take jobs _ those either
actively seeking jobs or willing to work if a job came their way _
rose to 10.2 million from 9.9 million in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's job numbers come from a monthly survey of
400,000 business establishments. An annual revision, announced
Friday, resulted in small changes in earlier months, most of them
upward.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate, on the other hand, comes from a separate
survey of 50,000 households that also produces an estimate of the
total work force, generally considered less accurate. In May,
according to the household survey, 991,000 jobs disappeared, the
largest one-month drop since the survey began in 1948. To the Labor
Department, that outsized decline suggested problems in the way the
results are adjusted in an attempt to account for seasonal
variations.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the statistical quirks, the new signals of a slowing
economy suggested to William Dudley, director of domestic research
at Goldman Sachs, that ``it is going to be hard for the Fed to
justify raising rates at the June meeting.''

HIGH-TECH PHILANTHROPY IN A LOW-TECH GUATEMALAN VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 4)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO LA LAGUNA, Guatemala _ It is early evening on a hazy
spring night, and a group of children are gathered on the shores of
Lake Atitlan, eagerly awaiting the visit from Karin Stahl. Her boat
has just pulled in to this tiny Mayan village 90 miles west of
Guatemala City, and it is as if a celebrity has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karina!'' they cry, rushing toward the docks. ``Bienvenidos,
Karina!''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl grins and hugs each child, doling out kisses like
chocolates, asking questions in flawless Spanish. She has been
coming to this village of 12,000 since 1997, and everywhere she
goes people call out to her. Three families have even named their
newborns Karina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't she beautiful?'' Stahl asks a companion, cradling one of
her namesakes.
</P>
<P>
   Two young boys offer to help with Stahl's bags, but they give up
when they discover how heavy the bags are. Inside, amid the heap of
clothing, are four gleaming new Compaq Presario laptop computers,
complete with DVD's. There is also a server, a monitor and
Spanish/English translation software _ all courtesy of eBay, the
online auction house, where the 34-year-old Stahl works.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, eBay has donated 15 computers and two printers to
Colegio Bethel, a private school here in San Pedro. The school was
founded 11 years ago by Emilio Battz, a local pastor, and his wife,
Ester, who live in a modest home on the premises with their three
children.
</P>
<P>
   About 350 students, in kindergarten through 9th grade, attend.
Their parents pay 25 quetzales ($3.25) a month for the elementary
school and 40 quetzales ($5.20) for junior high. And while these
rates sound nominal, families struggle to make the payments. Many
live in adobe or bamboo huts, four or more to a bed, with no
running water, no telephones, and limited electricity. They share
outhouses with neighboring families and bathe in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   But five days a week their children come to Bethel, where, in
addition to studying traditional subjects like math and history,
they are learning to use computers.
</P>
<P>
   The region is known for its unique handicrafts, with brightly
patterned designs and intricate embroidery. One goal is for
students to sell these wares _woven and beaded place mats, napkins,
hats and scarves _ on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, the force behind the San Pedro project and, separately,
the director of the eBay Foundation, the company's philanthropic
arm, said she would like to provide scholarships or loans for the
children to continue their higher education outside the village.
They would repay the loans by returning to Bethel to work as
interns for a year, helping students learn the e-commerce process,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of us at eBay have made so much money,'' Stahl said.
``We want to help kids do something with their lives other than
selling fruit. The point is to give them some means to get out, to
give them a vision of what they can do with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, women here earn about 5 quetzales (65 cents) if they
sell their goods to a third party; the wholesaler then typically
resells the items for 10 times that price. Some local men make the
handicrafts, too, though most work in the fields, growing coffee,
corn and cotton, for 20 quetzales a day. If families here could cut
out the middlemen, the theory goes, their options would expand.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the rate of economic growth in Guatemala rose to
5.1 percent _ the highest level in the 1990s, when the economy
expanded at a yearly average of 4.1 percent. But last year, the
growth rate slumped to 3.5 percent, according to Bank of Guatemala
estimates. And, in any event, ``to have an impact on poverty
reduction and to accommodate the population explosion, the economy
should be growing by 6 percent,'' said Maurico Valdes, the Central
America coordinator for the United Nations Development Program.
``Computers may help.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl met Battz in July 1997 while traveling and working in
Guatemala for Compassion International, a U.S. relief organization.
When she joined eBay as an account manager in October of that year,
she wondered how she could continue helping the village. She
mentioned San Pedro in conversations with colleagues, and her
enthusiasm spread throughout the company. A year later, she
returned here with the first round of computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karin is passionate about the project,'' said Meg Whitman, the
chief executive of eBay. ``All 1,200 of our employees know about
the school; it's part of our culture now. We have a bulletin board
with the children's photographs on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, nearly 30 eBay employees and relatives, including
Whitman's 15-year-old son, joined Stahl on a trip to San Pedro,
where they trained teachers on computers. Another group is heading
out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   On this spring trip, though, there is just Stahl and Ron
Sackman, 34, a friend and a consultant for Lucent Technologies, the
communications equipment maker. Sackman is linking the new
computers to the Internet. This is not an easy task; the dial-up
connection is extremely slow, and the school only has one phone
line _ in Battz's home. Web access is costly _ about $60 to open an
account and $10 a month after that, not including local and
long-distance telephone charges, in an area where incomes average
about $900 a year.
</P>
<P>
   To curb costs, Sackman runs a 200-foot cable from Battz's home
phone into the main server in the school. ``I'm hoping to do it so
the kids can write e-mails during the day, and then late at night,
when the rates are lower, the e-mail will automatically send,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   While he fiddles with the cable, Juan Cruz, Bethel's computer
teacher, sets up the new machines. ``Hay mas mouse pads?'' (``Are
there any more mouse pads?'') he asks. He flips through a manual he
has put together, a 100-page curriculum that includes the history
of technology and a step-by-step guide to Windows and other
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, 25, learned computers in Guatemala City, then returned to
San Pedro, his native village, to teach. ``These kids never saw a
computer before, but now it's like no big deal to them,'' he said.
``They're so happy to take classes; otherwise they have to go to
Guatemala City, and it's very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is not especially new to Guatemala; there are
cybercafes in the capital and in tourist towns. But it is a novelty
in this village, which did not have electricity until the mid-'90s.
The school has had power for just two years; before that, teachers
would dangle an extension cord out a window and ``borrow'' a
neighbor's.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now, while there is Web access in San Pedro, there are no paved
roads _ just dirt and loose rocks. Dogs and chickens roam freely.
Few tourists visit, except for some travelers who are generally
understood to come for the marijuana, which grows abundantly in the
hills. And though there are six other schools in the village _
three private and three public _ Bethel is the only one with
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unusual for schoolchildren in a rural area like San
Pedro La Laguna to have Internet access,'' said Valdes of the
United Nations. ``In the more elitist private schools in the larger
cities, it might be more common, but even basic things like
electricity and telephone lines aren't always there to make
computer technology work.''
</P>
<P>
   The computers are ``a giant step,'' agreed Battz, 47. ``Our kids
are getting three years of computer training. It's excellent.'' A
byproduct is that the computers have enhanced the children's
self-esteem. ``I'm a Mayan, and we're typically very timid and
think we're less important than those people with blue eyes and
blond hair. Now that the children are learning new skills, they are
seeing their own value.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he wants to also train parents on the machines _ a
necessity if the villagers are to sell their wares on eBay, since
children aren't supposed to use the auction site on their own. That
will be a formidable challenge, as most of the adults are
illiterate and speak only Tz'utuhil, the indigenous language.
</P>
<P>
   The parents seem thrilled with their children's education. ``I
like that she studies,'' said Diego Pop, 60, whose daughter, Vila,
is an eighth grader at Bethel. A widower, Pop works in the fields
and supplements his income by embroidering clothing. He earns about
85 quetzales, or $11, for a pair of pants that takes about three
weeks to complete. ``I don't want her to be like me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lidia Gonzalez, the mother of 14-year-old Norma, cannot read or
write; she earns her living selling pots and pans in the local
market. ``It's important that she doesn't suffer like me,'' said
Gonzalez, 29. ``I want her to study in the capital so she'll get a
good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer skills certainly can't hurt. ``If students acquired
programming skills or were able to do word processing or
spreadsheets or knew how to surf the Web, that would increase their
job prospects tremendously,'' said Susan Peacock, senior associate
at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, realities often fly in the face of these dreams. Vila Pop,
for example, is the youngest of six children, and she has been
saddled with the responsibilities of cooking and cleaning for her
father and brothers since her mother died three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although she plans to further her education, it's not uncommon
for students to drop out of school. According to a 1999 U.N.
Development Program report on Guatemala, only about 56 percent of
the Guatemalan population had attended school through the 9th
grade.
</P>
<P>
   That number is only an estimate, Valdes said. ``A lot of people
are migrant workers, and they migrate with their whole family
during the harvest of sugar cane, so the children leave school to
go with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How much time will the villagers actually have to devote to the
Net? Would they be better off with clothes and food instead of
computers, as some critics suggest?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think computers are a luxury, but we can't say
that rural areas only need water and sanitation and basic health,''
Valdes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let the technological gap go on, but you have to
devise a way to make it economically self-sustaining,'' Valdes
added. ``In poor, rural, isolated areas, you can't just have
computer access at a school. It has to become an information center
for the community, because otherwise it's too expensive. There are
local merchants and professionals who can benefit from a connection
and, with time, be able to pay something for it. But these issues
have to be discussed at the local level, in the villages, and not
by people in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said she would like to integrate into the junior high
curriculum instructions for selling online, including shipping
preparation and accounting. ``The village is slowly growing in
tourism, so this program will provide students the business and
people skills to successfully help their community grow,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there are more pressing issues. Back in the computer
lab, Sackman has managed to get online, though it takes nearly 15
minutes to download a page. The students hover around him
excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   He checks his own e-mail account and prints out a few pages to
show the students. Stahl also goes online _ only to learn that she
did not win a bidding war for a house she had hoped to buy back
home in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bid $100,000 over the asking price, and I was still
outbid,'' she said. She glanced at the children clicking away at
the computers and sighed. ``As if it really matters.''

HONDA'S HIGH-MILEAGE, HIGH STAKES HYBRID 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 4) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With gasoline prices pushing toward $2 a gallon in
some parts of the country, Honda could not have picked a better
time to bring out a car that gets 70 miles to the gallon on the
highway. Sure enough, the Honda Insight, the first hybrid car to be
sold in the United States, is off to a fast start, at least by the
standards used to measure alternative vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Honda has sold more than 1,100 of the futuristic-looking
Insights since the car went on sale in December, and the company
recently raised its sales target for this year to 6,500 cars, from
4,000. While even that new goal might seem small, it is double the
number of purely electric cars sold by all manufacturers combined
in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question of whether hybrid cars, which combine
gasoline engines and electric motors, will provide an alternative
to electric vehicles for reducing emissions. The issue is expected
to come to a boil in September when the California Air Resources
Board considers whether to relax its mandate that starting in 2003,
10 percent of all vehicles sold in the state must give off no
emissions or extremely low emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Insight became the first product ever honored by
the Sierra Club for ``excellence in environmental engineering,''
environmentalists worry that the auto industry will try to argue
that hybrids, which still emit low levels of pollutants, should be
allowed to substitute for true zero-emission vehicles, weakening
air-quality goals.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with electric vehicles is their limited
battery range. The cars can travel only 50 to 100 miles or so
before the batteries must be recharged, a process that takes
several hours. But a hybrid uses the batteries only to supplement a
gasoline engine. Moreover, the batteries can be recharged
automatically using power from the gas engine or from braking, so
hybrids do not have to be plugged in. Indeed, the Insight rarely
has to be taken to a filling station because it can travel 600
miles on a single tank of gas.
</P>
<P>
   The high mileage comes not just from having batteries carry some
of the load. Honda went all out to achieve an eye-popping economy
rating, but some of the steps it took ultimately limit the car's
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight seats only two people. It has only a five-speed
manual transmission. Its gas engine is a tiny 1-liter, 3-cylinder,
although Honda says that because of the Insight's lightweight
aluminum body, aerodynamic design and assistance from the
batteries, the Insight behaves like a 1.5-liter subcompact.
Finally, the aerodynamic design, with its tapered rear end and
skirts over the back wheels, will discourage drivers who don't like
to be stared at on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight might also be vulnerable to competition from the
Toyota Prius, another hybrid that goes on sale this month. The
Prius gets ``only'' about 50 MPG but seats four or five people and
has an automatic transmission; it also received the Sierra Club's
engineering award, during the New York auto show in April.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota executives, in a put-down of the Insight, boast that the
Prius is a ``real car'' and say that they hope to sell 12,000 in
the first year. The Prius will be priced around $20,000, not much
different from the Insight's list price of $18,880 without
air-conditioning and $20,080 with it. Both Toyota and Honda are
presumed to be losing money on each hybrid they sell.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight drives pretty much like any other car. One
difference, which makes the car eerily quiet, is that the engine
shuts off when the car is not moving, the shift is in neutral and
the foot is off the clutch. The engine starts up immediately when
the clutch is engaged and the car is put in gear.
</P>
<P>
   Also different is the dashboard, which has some extra displays
showing the car's fuel economy at any given instant and providing
up and down arrows suggesting when to shift. That makes driving the
Insight like playing a video game _ one with the goal of maximum
fuel economy. My score was about 45 MPG on fairly empty city
streets and 60 on a smoothly flowing highway, below the EPA
estimates of 61 in the city and 70 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   But despite hybrids' high fuel economy, some environmentalists
fear that the vehicles will be used as an excuse to postpone or
eliminate California's requirement for zero-emission vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The state air resources board is scheduled to review its
so-called mandate in September, and lobbying is expected to be
fierce. The mandate, which once called for 10 percent of a
company's sales to be zero-emission vehicles, has already been
weakened twice. It now says that only 4 percent of sales have to be
truly emissions-free and the other 6 percent can be extremely low
polluting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But automakers say it is next to impossible to meet even the 4
percent target because battery-powered electric vehicles will be
the only way to achieve zero emissions by 2003, and those cars have
been shunned by consumers. Fuel cells, a new technology for
achieving zero emissions, are not expected to be widely available
until the second half of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry has not yet publicly stated its position,
some automakers are expected to argue that a greater improvement in
air quality could be achieved by selling a larger number of pretty
clean hybrids rather than trying and failing to sell a smaller
number of totally clean electrics.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say the auto companies have not tried hard
enough to develop and sell all-electric vehicles, and they don't
want hybrids to be used as an excuse to take the pressure off.
Hybrids ``are still running on gasoline,'' said Roland Hwang,
transportation program director for the Union of Concerned
Scientists. ``You still have to have something in the program that
says we're moving to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the air resources board have said they hope to keep
some of the zero-emission requirement because it has prodded the
development not only of electric cars but of hybrids, too. If the
mandate is relaxed a third time, electric vehicles might never be
commercialized. What California does is expected to be followed by
New York and Massachusetts as well, and possibly by some other
states.
</P>
<P>
   But hybrids might not be the total answer either. ``Hybrids are
a means of increasing fuel efficiency,'' said Robert J. Bienenfeld,
manager of sales and marketing for alternative-fuel vehicles at
Honda. ``They are not necessarily the way to approach air-quality
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Insight is now classified in California as a ULEV, or
ultra-low-emission vehicle, and as such it would not qualify to be
counted in the 6 percent of extremely low-emission vehicles that
each manufacturer must sell in the state starting in 2003. The
Toyota Prius, however, is a SULEV, or super ultra-low emission
vehicle, which could qualify if it meets certain other
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while all companies are developing hybrids, some
probably won't have them on the market by 2003. Ford has announced
that its first hybrid will go on sale that year, a version of its
new Escape sport utility. The president of Toyota, Fujio Cho,
recently said that his company was working on a hybrid SUV, too.
DaimlerChrysler is showing off a hybrid Dodge Durango that uses an
electric motor not so much for high fuel economy, but to bolster
the performance of a gasoline V-6 engine.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current regulations, SULEV's are given only partial
credit toward the emissions goals. It might take three hybrids to
count as one zero-emission vehicle in the overall 10 percent goal.
Thus, if hybrids are to account for 6 percent of the emissions
goal, they will actually have to account for 18 percent of actual
sales, which would mean 100,000 hybrids for the top six
manufacturers alone. Even with the extra practicality of hybrids,
that could be a tough goal to reach, especially if gasoline prices
drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see this as a mass-market car,'' Bienenfeld said of
the Insight. ``Six months ago, gasoline was $1.10 to $1.15 and no
one was walking into a dealership demanding a high-fuel-economy
car.'' &QL;

<P>
   Are recent fluctuations in stock prices _ up and down _
indicative, or merely the result of investor psychosis?
</P>
<P>
   That may be the most difficult question for stock market
watchers, particularly with regard to the Nasdaq composite index,
which is dominated by technology stocks that regularly soar and
fall.
</P>
<P>
   This week was the best ever for the Nasdaq composite, which rose
18.98 percent. That was nearly twice the gain in the previous best
week for the index, a 9.71 percent rise recorded only six weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even with the two best weeks ever for the Nasdaq market,
the index is down 6.3 percent since the end of 1999. Four of the
five weeks between the two great weeks were losers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this year has also seen the worst week ever for the
Nasdaq market, a 25.3-percent plunge in the week ended April 14.
That decline set off warnings of severe economic effects if the
stock market continued to fall, which it did not.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq market watchers have seen extraordinary volatility become
increasingly common, sometimes a daily occurrence. In the history
of the Nasdaq stock market, dating back to 1971, there have been 26
days in which the average closed with a gain or loss of at least 5
percent. Exactly half of them have occurred in 2000, three of them
occurred this week, when there were only four trading days because
of Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Volatility is not as great in the broader market as it is in the
Nasdaq market, largely because prices of many stocks do not swing
as violently as do many technology issues. So far this year, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 has risen or fallen by 1 percent or more on
49 percent of the trading days. That is well below the 79 percent
figure posted by the Nasdaq composite, but it is up from the S&AMP;P's
37 percent in 1999 and is the highest for that index since 1938,
when stock prices swung wildly in the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the extraordinary volatility relates to the
way the Internet revolution has made it possible for individual
investors to trade rapidly at low costs. Many have done so. If
those traders tend to move in herds, leaping in when prices are
rising and out when they are falling, then they can exaggerate any
market move.
</P>
<P>
   Some volatility, no doubt, relates to the fact that other
traders are only slowly learning to deal with the market effects of
that additional trading. There are precedents for such confusion.
In the 1970s, institutional investors drastically increased their
trading of big blocks of stock, and volatility soared amid a lot of
hand-wringing about the dangers of such trading. Similarly, the
rise of index arbitrage trading in the 1980s increased volatility
and set off complaints that the markets were being destroyed. In
both cases, investors learned to deal with the new form of trading,
and volatility subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, volume has been relatively weak compared to the peaks
earlier this year. Low volume can also increase volatility, with
fewer traders willing to step up to take the other side of a trade
when large numbers of investors want to get in or get out.
</P>
<P>
   None of those explanations, it should be noted, has the
slightest relationship to what is or is not going on in the
economy. But uncertainty about that also seems to have increased.
</P>
<P>
   The huge run-up in technology stocks, particularly Internet
stocks, from last summer through early March, in part reflected
hopes that the New Economy would produce huge profits some day, and
that those who bought were getting in on the ground floor of a new
skyscraper. Others thought that idea was ludicrous, and that
valuations were completely ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   In such a polarized investment climate, prices can swing
violently, simply because there are few investors likely to move in
to buy on a small decline, or to sell on a small increase. So a
relatively small increase in buying or selling pressure can create
a big move in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve also seems determined to raise interest
rates until the economy slows. Because of that bias, reports of a
strong economy can seem bad, because they make further interest
rate increases more likely, while reports of a slowing economy, as
were stimulated by Friday's employment news, can seem like good
news. All that could change, of course, if fears grew that the Fed
was likely to bring on a recession, rather than just slow the
economy to a more moderate rate of growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the extraordinary volatility may mean investors are
nervous and confused. They know that, for the past two decades,
buying stocks has almost always been a better move than selling
them. They also worry about losing some of those big profits. With
those dueling concerns, greed can turn to fear, and back to greed,
within weeks if not days.
</P>
<P>
   So what does any big move in stock prices _ either up or down _
say about the future of the economy? In retrospect, the market
analysts may be able to discern a pattern. But for now, there is no
way to know which move, if any, has economic significance.

SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH BUOYS STOCK MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New figures showing that the Federal Reserve's campaign to slow
economic growth is working sent the stock market surging Thursday,
with the Nasdaq Composite index posting the biggest weekly gain in
its 29-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government reported that the jobless rate jumped to
4.1 percent last month, from 3.9 percent in April. After months of
unusually strong job growth, the private sector reduced payrolls in
May by 116,000, the largest monthly decline in business hiring
since the recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nation's economy remains strong and generated
231,000 new jobs last month, most of those jobs were limited to the
US Census Bureau's hiring of temporary workers to assist in
gathering data for the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Investors cheered the jobs report, which they interpreted as a
signal that the Federal Reserve might not raise rates again at its
next meeting, June 27 and 28, to contain inflation. If the Fed acts
at all, economists predicted that its members would probably raise
rates only a quarter-point.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's half-point increase in the federal funds rate, to 6.5
percent, at its May meeting was the seventh _ and the largest _
rate hike since the central bank began its campaign a year ago to
slow the US economy and relieve some of the inflationary pressures
building because of rising wages and soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the stock market has performed well when the
economy is expanding. But that relationship was turned upside down
in recent months, because investors and Fed members have been more
concerned that the economy's growth is too brisk and might spark
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Given the May jobs report, ``You can certainly argue that the
Fed's series of tightening moves has in fact started to bear
fruit,'' said William Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock
Financial Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Although a one-month slowdown in job creation is not full proof
of a slowdown, Cheney predicted that it would be convincing to the
Fed's members when they meet again later this month. ``Unless we
get a bad inflation number in the two weeks, the Fed is unlikely to
make another move at this meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite index, which has slumped badly since March,
surged 230.88 points Thursday, ending a strong week in which the
technology-dominated index gained 19 percent, closing at 3813.38.
This week's rally trimmed the Nasdaq's losses for this year to 6.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average also built on gains made during
the week, rising 142.56 points Thursday, to 10,794.76. The Dow has
also dropped about 6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Fine, comanager of the Small-Cap Growth Fund and the
Aggressive Growth Fund for Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co., said he still views
the recent surge in Nasdaq as ``a rally in a bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fine predicted the Nasdaq could rise above its current
level by the end of this year, he was cautious. ``There's still not
enough (trading) volume to show that there's conviction behind the
buying,'' he said. The rally appears to be ``a bounce from an
oversold position.''
</P>
<P>
   What became clearer in the jobs data issued Thursday is that the
economy is slowing, according to David Wyss, chief economist for
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a Lexington consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   A slowdown in job creation, added to recent reports of lower
manufacturing activity and weaker chain-store and housing sales _
all ``are pointing in the same direction,'' Wyss said. ``The brakes
are finally working'' by slowing the economy, as the Fed intended
by raising interest rates steadily over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fed members, led by chairman Alan Greenspan, will
continue to watch inflation, especially in the wake of reports that
the closely watched employment cost index has risen 4.3 percent
during the year ending on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Tempering that report, the US Department of Labor in its jobs
report Thursday said that wages in May rose only 1 cent, to $13.65
an hour, after a 6-cent rise in April and a 13-cent rise in the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fed may again raise rates, Wyss said a
quarter-point increase is most likely and a half-point increase
``is off the books now.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Labor reported that the US Census Bureau
hired 357,000 temporary workers last month to collect data for the
2000 census. That more than offset a decline in private-sector
payrolls and resulted in total job growth of 231,000 in May. That
was sharply below the 414,000 jobs created in April.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's employment declined by 991,000 in May, to 134.7
million, pushing up minorities' unemployment. The jobless rate
among blacks increased 0.8 percentage points, to 8 percent, and the
Hispanic jobless rate was up 0.4 percentage points, to 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only the service industry saw tangible job gains in May amid a
widespread scaling back in the private sector. And the 17,000
addition to service-company payrolls paled in comparison with the
industry's pace, an average of 103,000 a month this year.
Employment by construction firms, manufacturers, retail, and
transportation establishments were all down. The financial and real
estate industry payrolls were ``little changed,'' the government
said.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of slowing growth, the average hourly workweek
for factory workers declined one-tenth of an hour, to 34.4 hours,
for the first time in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relatively underprivileged lose every time the economy
slows a bit,'' John Hancock's Cheney said. But, he added, ``a 4.1
percent unemployment rate is still very favorable, and the
opportunities are better than they've been for a long time.''

   Unemployment Rate Rose to 4.1 Percent Last Month
</P>
<P>
   In the strongest signal yet that the booming economy is finally
slowing, the Labor Department reported that the nation's private
sector employers shed 116,000 jobs in May. It was the largest drop
in more than eight years and the first decline since the economy
began to soar in the mid-1990s. The unemployment rate edged up to
4.1 percent from 3.9 percent, with blacks and Hispanics absorbing
most of the loss. Wage increases, which had accelerated in the
early spring, eased in May, reducing concerns about inflation. Jobs
disappeared in almost every sector of the economy, except
government, where the hiring of 357,000 census takers for the
once-a-decade population count offset the decline in business jobs.

   Medicare More health maintenance organizations, including Cigna
and Aetna, will soon pull out of Medicare or curtail their
participation, disrupting insurance coverage for thousands of
elderly people, according to federal officials, independent experts

accelerate this year, a White House official and several experts
said.

   FAA May Ground Alaska Airlines
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration threatened to shut down
major maintenance operations at Alaska Airlines, which would ground
the airline within months. The agency, its attention drawn to the
airline by a fatal crash last January and a federal grand jury
investigation, said that the carrier had a persistent problem in
keeping track of whether required maintenance had been done, and
that managers had not noticed the problem.

   Oprah Magazine Editor to Resign
</P>
<P>
   The editor of O: The Oprah Magazine is resigning for personal
reasons, forcing the owners of the top-selling women's glossy to
find a new leader after just one issue went on sale. Ellen Kunes, a
longtime editor of women's magazines, said her decision was
prompted by ``work-family issues'' and had nothing to do with the
way the magazine was run.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian Pension Fund Controversy
</P>
<P>
   In a political race that was major news in Brazil but little
noticed abroad, a radical-left coalition now controls all three
elected seats on the six-member board of the nation's largest and
most influential pension fund. Two radical leftist candidates who
won seats in an election last month began their terms on June 1,
joining an incumbent colleague on the board of the fund, known as
Previ. That gives them unprecedented power to block decisions that
require a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   Another Loss for Soros Hedge Fund
</P>
<P>
   The hedge fund empire of George Soros continued to shrink as
Duncan Hennes, left, who was hired last summer to be chief
executive of Soros Fund Management, announced his resignation. ``I
was brought in to do one thing, and George doesn't want to do that
anymore,'' Hennes, 43, said. That thing, he said, was to build a
larger hedge fund business. Soros announced in April that his two
top fund managers, Stanley Druckenmiller and Nicholas Roditi, were
leaving and that the fund that made Soros famous, the Quantum Fund,
would be renamed the Quantum Endowment Fund and changed in emphasis
to reduce its risk.

   FTC to Sue to Halt Kroger Deal
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission announced that it would sue to halt
Kroger's proposed purchase of 74 Winn-Dixie Stores supermarkets in
Oklahoma and Texas. The FTC voted 5-0 to seek a preliminary
injunction in a Federal District Court in Dallas. A Kroger
spokesman said the company would explore its legal alternatives.
Kroger has more than 2,300 stores in 31 states.

NORTHWEST AND AMR SAID TO BE IN TALKS
</HEADLINE>
  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The road to the future of the domestic and perhaps even the
global airline industry now appears to pass through Minneapolis.
That is where Northwest Airlines has its headquarters. And in the
wake of last week's announcement by the UAL Corp., the parent of
United Airlines, that it plans to buy US Airways for $4.3 billion,
the chairman of Northwest, Gary L. Wilson, and the chief executive,
John H. Dasburg, are suddenly the men to see.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about other airline deals began minutes after UAL
announced its agreement with US Airways. Few competitors play the
game of copycat more obsessively than the airlines, which instantly
match each other's prices and take only slightly longer to offer
the same amenities from mystery meat sandwiches to greater (or
less) leg room.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that executives at the AMR Corp., the
parent of American Airlines, have already had preliminary talks
with their counterparts at Northwest, as executives speaking on
condition of anonymity have confirmed. One person close to the
talks said that Northwest made it plain that it was looking for a
big price, an indication of the strong hand the airline executives
believe they hold. The negotiations have adjourned while AMR
considers its next move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their view is that the pricing of the US Air deal is
essentially the floor,'' the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen at AMR, Northwest and Delta Air Lines would not
comment on the speculation. They have been quiet since the
United-US Airways deal was announced, which may be because their
bosses have not yet decided to try to block the deal or propose
their own mergers.
</P>
<P>
   For American and Delta, the second- and third-largest domestic
carriers after United, the US Airways deal is a direct threat.
Should it be consummated, United _ which is already the world's
largest airline and boasts the most successful international
airline alliance _ would become about 50 percent bigger than its
nearest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   That means that if you are a frequent flyer based in Chicago,
where United and American have a roughly equal share of flights
from O'Hare Airport, United, with its larger network, would
suddenly look much more attractive than American. The same would
apply on the East Coast, where Delta customers would be attracted
to United after it was supplemented by US Airways' large network of
flights from Maine to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This development is simply too large/threatening for AMR and
Delta to do nothing,'' Brian Harris, an analyst for Salomon Smith
Barney, wrote to his clients this week, referring to the UAL-US
Airways deal.
</P>
<P>
   The same fears were behind a series of hastily arranged domestic
alliances two years ago. On Super Bowl Sunday 1998, Northwest beat
out Delta and bought a controlling stake in Continental Airlines,
forming an alliance between the country's fourth- and fifth-largest
airlines. Three months later, United and Delta and American and US
Airways announced their own separate alliances.
</P>
<P>
   But the concern about the threat from a Northwest-Continental
combination subsided after the antitrust division of the Justice
Department sued to force Northwest to sell its stake in
Continental. That suit is still pending and has led many to believe
that the United-US Airways merger will not be approved either.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment Northwest still owns its stake in
Continental, which gives it control over that airline's destiny and
thus unusual leverage in the next round of deals. Most analysts and
airline executives believe that the most natural merger
combinations are American and Northwest and Delta and Continental.
But Delta cannot make a move for Continental without talking to
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   AMR is widely seen as leading the charge because of its heated
competition with United. ``American Airlines spends every waking
hour measuring themselves against United,'' said one rival airline
executive who insisted on anonymity. ``There is no way they are
going to let this one go unanswered.''
</P>
<P>
   American, which is particularly strong in the Southwest, would
complement Northwest's large presence in the upper Midwest, where
it has hubs in Minneapolis and Detroit. Northwest would also give
American a large presence in the Pacific, a region where it is now
extremely weak.
</P>
<P>
   Another little noticed factor is Northwest's strong alliance
with Royal Dutch KLM. The two carriers have been granted antitrust
immunity to combine their operations across the Atlantic. KLM,
which recently backed away from plans to merge with Alitalia, is
looking for another partner and there has been speculation that it
might combine with British Airways, which is now American's
principal global partner. If British Airways and KLM should merge,
Northwest would probably have to be included.
</P>
<P>
   American could try to outbid UAL for US Airways but the
consensus in the industry is that UAL's offer of $60 a share is
already high. One AMR executive who insisted on anonymity said that
the company had recently looked at making a bid for US Airways but
thought it was not worth the price at $25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   American and Delta could also lobby the Justice Department to
oppose the United-US Airways deal but that is a risky strategy if
they should fail. The other advantage of an American-Northwest
deal, which most people believe would pave the way for a
Delta-Continental merger, is that it would present the Justice
Department with the prospect of seeing the country's six largest
airlines reduced to three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine Joel Klein letting that happen,'' said the
executive who spoke on condition of anonymity, referring to the
head of the Justice Department's antitrust division. A return to
the status quo is much more attractive to American and Delta than
seeing United swallow US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's enviable position has already sent its share price
soaring. Friday it closed at $35.4375, up $6.375 in Nasdaq trading.
It has risen $11.3125, or 47 percent, since UAL announced its bid
for US Airways on March 24. Analysts say that AMR and Delta have to
move within 30 to 45 days to get their deals before the Justice
Department alongside the United and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson of Northwest is known for driving a hard bargain but
Northwest is still only valued at $2.9 billion. AMR could offer a
50 percent premium over its price before the recent climb and still
pay less than $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``American is facing a fork in the road,'' said the person close
to its negotiations with Northwest. ``They either have to come back
with the big price it's going to take to get Northwest to talk, or
they have to conclude that they are going to try to stop the US Air
deal.''

L.A. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT MUST PROVE WATER RESOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a decision that reflects the importance of
water and environmental concerns for California's rapid growth, a
state court judge has temporarily blocked construction of the
single largest housing development ever approved by Los Angeles
County, a 22,000-home planned community on the Ventura County
border.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling late Wednesday, Judge Roger D. Randall of Superior
Court in neighboring Kern County ordered the developer, the Newhall
Land and Farming Co., to prove that it can assure adequate water
for its planned project, Newhall Ranch. Randall also ordered the
developer to conduct more detailed reviews of the project's effect
on traffic and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County and a coalition of environmental groups had sued
Newhall and Los Angeles County to block the project; the case was
moved to Kern County to avoid a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means construction on the project will be delayed
until 2003, a year later than the developer's schedule, said a
spokeswoman for Newhall Land, Marlee Lauffer.
</P>
<P>
   The project's opponents said they hoped the delay and the
requirements for further environmental review might lead to scaling
down the development, which Newhall had already shrunk from 25,000
units to win the approval of Los Angeles County last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that the delays this causes will maybe cause them
to take a harder look at the project and find some ways to reach
more compromise,'' said Lynne Plambeck, vice president of the Santa
Clarita Organization for Planning and Development, which joined the
suit with the Sierra Club and a group called Friends of the Santa
Clara River. ``I think we have a lot of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Ranch development is scheduled in phases over 20 years,
but big as it is, it would barely make a dent in Los Angeles
County's total projected need for new housing, now estimated at
about 25,000 units per year.
</P>
<P>
   County officials said they would have to review the ruling
before deciding whether to appeal it. Lauffer, the Newhall
spokeswoman, said that ``we think, based on our initial review,
that we can resolve these issues over the next year,'' adding that
the ruling seemed to turn on ``relatively minor issues that the
judge has requested additional analysis on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Antonette B. Cordero, an assistant county counsel for
Ventura County, which has adopted some of the nation's most
stringent measures to control growth, said that ``the judge is not
just saying they have to generate more paper on this project, he's
saying they have to go out and do some more analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Randall held that Newhall must demonstrate that
``adequate water sources are available for build-out of the
project,'' especially in dry years, Cordero said. The judge also
required the developer to further study the environmental and
traffic effects of the project in Ventura County, where it has
extensive holdings but does not currently plan to build, and on the
Santa Clara River.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speculate on what changes they may have to make once
they go back and do that,'' Cordero said.
</P>
<P>
   Randall's ruling included rejecting Ventura County's argument
that it was entitled to joint approval over the whole project.

FAA THREATENS ACTION THAT COULD SHUT AIRLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration threatened
Friday to shut down major maintenance overhauls at Alaska Airlines,
which would ground the airline within months.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, its attention drawn to the airline by a fatal crash
last January and a federal grand jury investigation, said that the
carrier had a persistent problem in keeping track of whether
required maintenance had been done, and that managers had not
noticed the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA gave the airline, a unit of Alaska Air Group, seven days
to show why its maintenance hangars should not be shut down, and
said that unless it was persuaded, it would order a shutdown 30
days after that.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed order to shut the airline's maintenance hangars was
highly unusual. Although the agency has occasionally gone even
further, simply grounding carriers, it seldom threatens such tough
action against carriers as big as Alaska, which has a fleet of 89
jets and flies up and down the West Coast and to Hawaii, Canada and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's director of flight standards service, Nick
Lacey, said the lapses, 150 cases over three years, were worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aviation accidents come as a result of a series of small
errors and inability to detect small errors,'' Lacey said, speaking
to reporters here a few minutes after the airline was notified of
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   While no unsafe conditions were found that were attributable to
the maintenance problems, an airline that cannot spot its own
problems and correct them ``lacks the required redundancy,'' Lacey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the problems were merely paperwork, he responded,
``Paperwork, that's kind of a trite word.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paperwork is very important,'' he continued. ``It's basically
the way the airline assures that the work has been completed and
performed.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline's chairman, John Kelly, said in a news conference at
the company's Seattle headquarters that the company had begun
remedying its problems, as the FAA pointed them out. Kelly made
public a list of veteran aviation safety specialists the company
had hired recently, among 70 new maintenance and engineering
employees, and described new procedures that were being followed
before planes were released to carry passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman portrayed the FAA announcement as a demand that the
changes already in the works be put on a firm timetable, and that
they be made permanent. ``I don't blame them,'' he said, promising
to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that the FAA had found 166 gaps in the paperwork, but
he noted that 267,000 documents had been reviewed. That meant the
airline had made errors on 0.06 percent of the documents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lacey, speaking in Washington, said the company's
cooperation, generally good safety record and skilled personnel
were a factor in deciding not to ground the planes at once.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of longstanding lapses at the carrier is bad news
for the FAA as well as the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been struggling to improve its oversight of
airlines since the crash of a ValuJet DC-9 in May 1996, and has
invested heavily in new inspection systems.
</P>
<P>
   What led to the discovery of what Lacey called ``sloppiness'' at
Alaska was not the perceptions of its inspectors or the systems put
in place by FAA management, but the crash in January of one of the
company's MD-80 aircraft, and a continuing grand jury investigation
into maintenance practices at the airline's hangar in Oakland,
Calif.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until a final decision is made, FAA inspectors are functioning
as quality-control personnel for the airline, Lacey said. He added
that inspectors who tracked down the aircraft at airports around
Alaska Airlines' extensive route network found in all cases that
the work had been performed.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said he could not comment on the Jan. 31 crash of the
MD-80, which was en route from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San
Francisco, because that investigation was in the hands of the
National Transportation Safety Board. But that crash has raised
questions about whether the airline's maintenance and operational
practices might have played a role.
</P>
<P>
   All 88 people on board were killed when the pilots lost control
of the plane's pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling wreckage from the coast off Los Angeles, investigators
found the thread stripped from a jack screw, a device like a garage
door opener, that moves the horizontal section of the tail up and
down, and a subsequent inspection of jack-screw assemblies in
planes nationwide found a high incidence of problems on Alaska
Airlines planes, which might be signs of a maintenance problem.
</P>
<P>
   The airline flies mostly Boeing 737s and MD-80s, and at any
given time, five or six of its planes are in hangars at Oakland or
Seattle for heavy maintenance. Without the authority to release
those planes back into service, ``you basically have a shrinking
airline,'' Lacey said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline could not contract out the work, although it could
lease planes from others.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said he hoped that the airline and his agency would reach
agreement on a plan to correct the management deficiencies, and
that the airline could show that the plan was working, before the
agency shut the hangars.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors reviewed other aspects of the airline but did not
find major problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that there were areas needing improvement; for
example, pilots are supposed to be retrained annually but are
allowed a one-month grace period. Alaska Airlines conducts 80
percent of its recurrent training in that 13th month, Lacey said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market reacted unfavorably to Friday's announcement;
shares of the airline closed at $30.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange, down $1.1875. But analysts said it was still a sound
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a bona fide franchise,'' said Kevin C. Murphy, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who added, ``Their raison
d'etre is to be the north-south operator on the West coast, and
that ain't too shabby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will give them the kind of shock therapy they
need to make sure they exceed FAA standards,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others noted that Alaska Airlines had pioneered safer
navigation techniques, along with automated kiosks at airports that
dispense tickets, and that it was experimenting with having
passengers check their own luggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Alaska Airlines isn't here next year, it will be because
they were bought by another airline, not because of safety,''
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a proposed merger between United Airlines and US
Airways, analysts have suggested that Alaska could find itself a
takeover target by a larger carrier.

(For release on Sunday, June 4) 
 By CAROLE GOULD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glen A. Kleczka, 37, the lead manager of the $58.0 million
William Blair Value Discovery fund, admits to being a foodie, but
he rarely finds time to cook at home in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managing the portfolio and servicing clients doesn't leave me
a lot of time,'' said Kleczka (pronounced Klehch-kah). ``So I tend
to eat better when I travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, running the fund requires extensive travel as Kleczka
checks in with the management of companies in whose stock he is
interested. And if Kleczka puts on a few pounds as a result, well,
his shareholders at least are the better for it. William Blair
Value Discovery returned 11.8 percent a year, annualized, for the
three years through May 31, compared with 4.8 percent for its small
value peers, according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Kleczka credits the fund's value philosophy, which he describes
with great simplicity. ``We buy broken stocks,'' he said, ``not
broken companies.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``broken stock'' typically trades at 50 percent or so off its
five-year-high stock price. Its valuation _ Kleczka typically
compares a stock's current price to its three-year forward earnings
potential _ is depressed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a company that is not ``broken'' often has several other
attributes: leading market share, improving profitability, and
management that is purchasing shares or initiating share buyback
plans. Kleczka tries to find stocks that will rise 15 to 20 percent
annually over three years and whose earnings will rise 12 to 20
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not supercharged topline growth companies,'' he
said. ``We'd rather see slower growers with improvements in
profitability and expanding profit margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Each month, Kleczka screens 11,000 stocks with market
capitalizations below $1.5 billion. Expensive companies are excised
from the list using a variety of valuation measures, such as a
companies' cash to share price, which he generally likes to see as
high as possible. He also discards those that trade for more than
twice their tangible book value, that is, book value excluding
goodwill and other intangibles. That leaves him with some 750
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he and the fund's two co-managers, David S. Mitchell and
Cappy Price, investigate the remaining candidates. By reading
company reports, filings and Wall Street research, they are
generally able to find sufficient cause to eliminate 550 more
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they visit companies to evaluate management and seek
clues to the company's improving prospects. Kleczka figures he
spends about 40 to 50 percent of his time on the road and talks to
more than 100 companies each year.
</P>
<P>
   Kleczka and his co-managers each prepare four-page investment
theses for these stocks and exchange them with their colleagues. In
biweekly meetings, they debate possible purchases, which they make
only when they reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The fund holds 50 to 70 stocks and, because it seeks to offset
gains with losses, distributed no capital gains in 1998 and 1999. A
small distribution is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the fund is focusing on capital goods companies and
other firms in the industrial economy.
</P>
<P>
   Kleczka owns shares of Landstar System, a national trucking firm
in Jacksonville, Fla., whose truck drivers operate as independent
contractors. They own their trucks and pay all expenses, turning
over a small portion of their revenues to Landstar. ``That business
model is very attractive because it reduces capital costs and
eliminates price increases, especially in diesel fuels,'' he said.
The company also generates a lot of free cash flow, which it uses
to buy back shares.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares in January 1997 for $24 each, 40 percent below
their five year highs after the company had difficulties
integrating several acquisitions. Profitability has since improved,
he said, and it is using the Internet to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has consistently exceeded rising earnings
expectations in the last two years,'' Kleczka said, ``and we'll
continue to see that.'' Shares closed Friday at $53.25, or between
10.2 and 9.7 times his 2000 per-share earnings estimate of $5.20 to
$5.47. His 12-month price target is $63.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Arch Chemicals, of Norwalk, Conn., which
manufactures and markets chemicals used in the microelectronics and
water industries. He bought shares in November for an average price
of $15.50, after the price had fallen about 40 percent following
Arch's spin off from Olin Chemicals in February 1999. ``It's
extremely cheap,'' Kleczka said, ``and historically, spinoffs tend
to outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Arch plans to sell a low-margin water chemical distribution
business, which should increase its overall profitability, he said,
and plans a venture with an industrial gas company to run its
semiconductor chemicals business more efficiently. Shares closed
Friday at $18.25, or 8.9 times his earnings estimate of $2.05 this
year. He forecasts a three-year annual earnings growth rate of 12
to 15 percent and has a 12-month price target of $24.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite: Overland Data, in San Diego, which makes
magnetic tape data storage systems used by big businesses to back
up their enterprise-wide servers. He bought shares for $10 at the
February 1997 initial offering and added more the next year, as the
price fell to $4. Overland has $14 million in cash on its balance
sheet, (about 20 percent of its stock price), and no long-term
debt, Kleczka said.
</P>
<P>
   Its earnings have been flat, he said, because money has been
reinvested in the business. At year-end 1999, it became an
exclusive original equipment manufacturer for Compaq Computer,
which has one of the largest installed server bases in the world.
That will create economies of scale and should help Overland
increase its operating margins to 9 percent over the next two
years, from 5 percent now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares closed Friday at $9.875, or 15.2 to 13.2 times his June
2001 per-share earnings estimate of 65 cents to 75 cents. His
12-month price target is $12 to $15.

AS SUMMIT NEARS, CLINTON URGES WEST TO FORGE TIES WITH RUSSIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ On the eve of a Kremlin summit, President Clinton said
Friday that major Western institutions, including NATO and the
European Union, must remain open to Russia. Even if such overtures
are rejected, Clinton said, cooperation with Russia remains
``absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's determination that the West remain engaged as Russia
continues to emerge from 70 years of communist despotism and a
government-controlled economy was at the heart of the president's
remarks as he became the third American to accept the 50-year-old
Charlemagne Prize. The award honors work for European security and
unity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flies to Moscow Saturday for his first visit to the
Russian capital since Vladimir Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin as
president. Clinton is scheduled to meet Putin, a 47-year-old former
KGB agent, over dinner Saturday and hold several discussions over
the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must work to build a partnership with Russia that
encourages stability, democracy and cooperative engagement with the
West _ and full integration with global institutions,'' Clinton
said in a 20-minute address in the courtyard of the cathedral in
Aachen, Germany, Charlemagne's seat as the eighth-century Holy
Roman emperor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means no doors can be sealed shut to Russia _ not NATO's,
not the EU's,'' Clinton said. ``The alternative would be a future
of harmful competition between Russia and the rest _ and the end of
our vision of an undivided continent.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, expressing a widely held view, doubt that
Russia will soon be interested in or realistically prepared to be
members of the major military or geopolitical alliances, but
Clinton said that would not let the West off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Russia may very well decide it has no interest in
formally joining European or transatlantic institutions,'' Clinton
said. ``If that happens, we must make sure that, as the EU and NATO
expand, their eastern borders become gateways to Russia, not
barriers to trade, travel and security cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Building such ties ``won't be easy,'' Clinton said, ``and there
is still mistrust to be overcome on both sides, but it is possible
and absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received the prize, a gold medal draped over his neck on
a blue and gold ribbon, in a sunny ceremony that attracted a number
of former award winners, including King Juan Carlos of Spain,
President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republican and former British
Prime Minister Edward Heath.
</P>
<P>
   The prize carries a $2,500 stipend, and Clinton said he would
use the money to provide scholarships in Aachen, a city in far west
Germany near the Dutch and Belgian border, and its sister city of
Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was introduced by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder as
a ``true European,'' but Schroeder again raised warnings about the
prospect of a U.S. missile-defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said there was no question the United States had a
``sovereign'' right to undertake the program, on which Clinton has
promised a decision this year, but the chancellor renewed a call
for caution that he voiced Thursday in welcoming Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this issue could have effects well beyond the U.S.A., it is
in the sense of the alliance that it be treated in a spirit of
partnership,'' Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-missile system is expected to be a major point of
discussion in the Clinton-Putin sessions. Clinton argues the system
would be aimed against the missiles of nations such as Iraq and
North Korea. The Russian leader has argued it could have offensive
uses and would contravene arms-limitation agreements, including the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention the anti-missile issue in his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   He reviewed several continental disputes, especially in
southeastern Europe, including the Balkans. Clinton called
specifically for the European Union, a largely Christian area, to
admit Turkey, which would be its only predominantly Muslim member.
Clinton said the move would be ``good for the entire world, which
is still too divided over religious differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Although trouble spots remain, Clinton said Europe is ``more
united, more successful and more peaceful than ever'' and remains a
shining example of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Western Europe could come together after the carnage of
World War II, if Central Europe could do it following 50 years of
communism, it can be done everywhere on this Earth,'' Clinton said.

N.Y. STATE PLANS TO BUILD NATION'S LARGEST POWER PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The administration of Gov. George Pataki on
Friday gave final environmental approval to plans to build the
nation's largest power plant along a verdant stretch of the Hudson
River 30 miles south of here, marking the start of a new generation
of plant construction in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of competition in the electricity market and a
surge in demand in the last few years have created a sudden rush to
build power plants in the Northeast, after a generation of a lack
of interest among power companies. The plant approved Friday, in
the town of Athens in Greene County, on the west bank of the river,
is expected to be followed in quick succession by half a dozen or
more in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 million Athens plant, proposed by Pacific Gas &AMP;
Electric Corp., a major California utility company, would be New
York's first example of new technology that makes natural-gas fired
power plants far more efficient than older ones and, as a result,
put out far less air pollution. Environmentalists say its emissions
would be less than 10 percent of those from a plant built in the
1970s or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be the first to take advantage of new cooling
methods that allow it to use far less water from the river than
older plants do, an important environmental concern because water
intake pipes and the discharge of heated water into the river can
kill fish by the millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very fortunate that the technology has advanced to the
point that we can have efficient, low-cost power with very little
effect on the environment, and we are insisting on the best
available technology,'' said John P. Cahill, commissioner of the
state Department of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was proposed two years ago, the Athens plant has met
with ferocious local opposition, in part because it was
representing the leading edge of a boom in industrial development
on the banks of the Hudson, after the river had undergone more than
a half-century of transition from industrial thoroughfare to the
attractive centerpiece of a fairly bucolic region.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, opponents repeatedly tried to portray PG&AMP;E as
a corporate villain, reminding reporters and politicians that it
was the company that poisoned much of a California town in a story
made famous by the movie ``Erin Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Community and environmental groups protested that the plant
would mar the view of a swath of the Hudson Valley filled with
forests, farms and small towns _ a view made famous by the 19th
century painters of the Hudson River School. Environmentalists also
said the plant could disrupt a sensitive spawning ground for fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in absolutely the wrong place,'' said David Gordon, a
lawyer with the group Riverkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and Democrats in the Legislature have also
complained that a new state law on approving power plants, pushed
through by Pataki last year, does not contain enough environmental
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   But many environmentalists, while they disliked the process and
the location of the Athens plant, also hailed the construction of
new, more efficient plants as an important advance against air and
water pollution. They hope that the new plants, combined with new
air emissions regulations that Pataki has promised to impose on
older, dirtier plants, will put some of those old plants out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators had indicated they would allow the new plant to
take in more than 4 million gallons of water a day from the Hudson.
But Friday, Cahill said that he would grant the plant a water
permit that allows it to use just 180,000 gallons daily. That
compares with more than 1 billion gallons a day for some plants,
like the two active Indian Point nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   By setting the figure so low, environmentalists said, Cahill
will force the Athens plant to use the latest cooling technology,
with the least effect on fish. It would also eliminate the need for
the cooling towers and plumes of steam that are a visual signature
_ and an eyesore _ for most plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is a victory for the Hudson and sets a precedent
with national implications,'' said Ned Sullivan, executive director
of the environmental group Scenic Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The permit granted by Cahill is widely seen as the last serious
hurdle for the plant, barring a lawsuit. It still must be approved
by a siting board controlled by the governor, and by the Army Corps
of Engineers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The plant is the first approved in New York since the late
1980s. At a capacity of 1,080 megawatts _ 4 percent to 5 percent of
average demand statewide _ it would have the largest output of any
plant in the country. Applications have been filed for more than a
dozen other power plants around the state, including many on or
near the Hudson, and some in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   After last July's heat wave caused blackouts and brownouts
across much of the Northeast, energy experts warned that the region
_ in fact, much of the country _ was dangerously close to
outstripping its power supply, and that it would take four or five
years to build enough new plants to catch up to rising demand. New
York City and Long Island are in particular danger, because there
too few transmission lines to greatly increase the amount of power
imported from elsewhere.

NEW FILM OFFERS TWIST ON THE BAD GUYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If President Clinton wanted to better understand how
ordinary Russians view America as he arrives in Moscow Saturday for
three days of talks, he could do worse than to check out the
country's most popular movie.
</P>
<P>
   The film is called ``Brother 2'' _ yes, it is a sequel _ and it
appropriates slick American production techniques and familiar
action-film cliches to do a neat twist on Hollywood's familiar
Russian boogeyman routine.
</P>
<P>
   The good guys are Russian killers who outwit numerous police and
machine-gun-toting thugs, blow away a cross-section of Chicagoans,
avenge the death of a comrade, and teach a smarmy American crime
boss a lesson. All to the constant beat of Russian rock hits.
</P>
<P>
   This is merely pop-culture entertainment, but director Alexei
Balabanov has also willingly tapped into Russia's growing
patriotic, and anti-American, sentiment. The film's diehard hero,
Danila, played by Russian actor Sergei Bodrov Jr., can romance,
shoot guns, crack skulls, and crack one-liners at least no worse
than Stallone, Willis, or Schwarzenegger. And he can outdrink any
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Danila might as well be the brother from another planet as he
calmly mows down his foes and many innocent bystanders. But Danila
is also an implacable proponent of a very romantically Russian
sense of the ideal that right is might.
</P>
<P>
   ``So tell me, American. What is the source of power? Money?''
Danila asks his suddenly cornered and cowed American adversary
after wiping out his entire security detail and downing a very
large glass of Stolichnaya. ``You have a lot of money, but so what?
I think that strength is in truth. He who has the truth is
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   This stuff is as timely as ever in Russia. The pro-American
euphoria that followed the fall of communism had been fading for
years when it finally disappeared for good in differences over
Kosovo and Chechnya. The United States is still envied as the
world's most powerful and rich country, but most Russians now
believe that America intends to bully and ignore them, rather than
share its good fortune with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't expect anything good from Americans,'' wrote Sergei
Leskov in an article detailing Russian stereotypes of Americans in
Thursday's edition of the daily Izvestia. ``They always take care
of themselves. . . . Americans think someone is better when they
have more money.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is that the American bad guy cheats a Russian player on a
Chicago hockey team, the brother of Danila's friend, Kostya (who
happens to be a hero of Russia's conflict in Chechnya). Kostya asks
a Russian mob boss to intervene. Instead, the mob has Kostya
killed, setting Danila and his wacky, wisecracking older brother on
their overseas quest for justice.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, not only do Danila and his brother break American
laws, which is par for the course for our own action films. But the
film almost gleefully does battle with modern American notions of
cultural etiquette by dredging up every racial or sexual stereotype
in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't racists,'' said director Balabanov in a recent
online chat session. ``But we hold to a healthy sense of national
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians in the film never give up, they never leave one of
their own behind, and they get all the best one-liners (``Are you
all gangsters?'' asks one American. ``No, we're Russians,''
deadpans one of Danila's friends.)
</P>
<P>
   After a while, it gets pretty ugly, though some critics here
have suggested that ``Brother 2'' is, as Moscow Times writer Larisa
Yusipova put it, ``perhaps merely a response to all the nonsense
`they' include in their films about `us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the intent, the larger theme of Russia's lost illusions
of America comes through in the last scene, when one of Danila's
friends makes an obscene gesture at a US border official and gets
on a plane home. The popular song ``Farewell Letter,'' with its
refrain, ``Goodbye America,'' kicks in. Danila grins and orders a
vodka. He is going home.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, this was a song about longing for a better,
forbidden life, embodied by the America the singer ``will never
see.'' In ``Brother 2,'' it is an appropriate send-off to a place
best left behind.

   WASHINGTON _ When the Supreme Court confronted its first
Internet case three years ago, the justices received special
training from their library staff. The lessons ``helped assure each
of us that we knew how to use the Net and understood the technical
matters at issue,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer recalled a few weeks
ago at a symposium on biomedical research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Thus empowered, the court went on in that case, Reno vs.
American Civil Liberties Union, to produce a unanimous decision
that struck down the Communications Decency Act on First Amendment
grounds and established the primacy of free speech principles in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Microsoft antitrust case will be heading toward the
Supreme Court _ although whether directly from Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson's final U.S. District Court ruling, expected this
week, or after review by the Court of Appeals here remains to be
seen. The court has gotten its collective feet wet, clearly, but in
the world of platforms, applications, source codes and interfaces,
familiarity may not be fluency.
</P>
<P>
   So the question remains: are the justices ready to swim?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is almost certainly yes, in the view of a broad
consensus of antitrust experts and students of the court. Year in
and year out, they pointed out, the justices manage to handle hard
cases requiring substantial specialized knowledge across many
fields. But the intersection of old law with new technology that
the Microsoft case represents offers a special challenge that at
least one expert cautioned could test the limits of the court's
competence.
</P>
<P>
   Institutionally, the court remains a novice. The Supreme Court
launched its first Web site (www.supremecourtus.gov) only two
months ago, long after many other courts had established an
Internet presence. A rather static venture that lets users read the
court's opinions and check its calendar, it received one million
hits in its first month, to the considerable surprise of officials.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though Windows NT runs the court's computers, and the
justices' law clerks are undoubtedly as computer savvy as other
members of their generation, the justices themselves, who range
from 52 to 80, all came of age at a time when doing legal research
meant reaching for a book, not a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Substantively, the Microsoft case presents layers of complexity
_ not only the technology of the specific products at issue, but
fiercely contested assumptions about the relationship between
competition and innovation in the fast-changing technology
marketplace. To be told that they hold the future of the
information industry in their hands _ a point the briefs will
undoubtedly try to impress on the justices _ would be more than a
little daunting for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in recent interviews, several people pointed to Jackson
as an example of the judicial ability to climb a steep learning
curve. Whether or not they agreed with the trial judge's approach
to the case, no one seemed to doubt that by the end of it, he had
an impressive mastery of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Jackson never founded a dot-com or acquired any special
credentialing,'' observed John Shepard Wiley Jr., a professor of
antitrust and intellectual property law at the University of
California at Los Angeles. ``For 200 years, federal judges have had
the brains and the motivation to deal with cases people might
assume are beyond their competence. They are used to rolling up
their sleeves.''
</P>
<P>
   Patent law, for example, ``puts incredible demands on generalist
judges,'' Wiley said, because new patents are by definition at the
cutting edge of technology. ``You can have a degree in gene
splicing, but if it's 10 years old, it's not worth much,'' he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   One antitrust expert, Andrew I. Gavil of the Howard University
Law School, noted that the justices regularly decided complex
cases, in antitrust, food and drug law and many other fields
requiring specialized knowledge. ``It's hubris to think that the
Supreme Court can't figure this out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he added in a wry tone, ``it's not like Aspen
Skiing'' _ a reference to an admittedly more accessible 15-year-old
antitrust decision that found the owner of three mountains in
Colorado to have maintained an illegal monopoly by refusing to deal
with the owner of a fourth mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case presents ``interesting legal issues, but not
unique ones,'' Gavil said, noting that at the heart of the case are
antitrust principles with which the court is completely familiar.
``What Microsoft did with its monopoly and how the law treats that
is not that complex,'' he said. ``Did it have a pro-competitive
justification, or did it engage in behavior that cost it something
in the short run in order to hinder its rivals in the long run?
That's a very conventional antitrust question.''
</P>
<P>
   The aspect of the Microsoft case that most closely combines law
and technology, Gavil said, is whether Microsoft's bundling of its
Internet browser with its Windows operating system was an illegal
tying arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson _ who earlier in the case conducted his own experiment,
disabling Internet Explorer on his own computer in 90 seconds _
ruled that it was in his April conclusions of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on that, the justices will be able to use pretty standard
doctrine,'' Gavil said. ``You don't have to be able to read source
code to know what you see on the screen when you turn on your
computer. If you know that there are programs that can be
downloaded from the Internet, you've gone pretty far toward being
able to understand the government's theory.''
</P>
<P>
   The broader question of how judges deal with the substantive
complexity of the cases before them has been a subject of growing
interest, much of it revolving around the capacity of so-called
junk science to sway impressionable jurors. In an important 1993
decision, Daubert vs. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the Supreme
Court reinterpreted the federal rules of evidence to require judges
to serve as gatekeepers, weeding out bad science and preventing
unqualified ``experts'' from testifying.
</P>
<P>
   The Daubert case and two subsequent Supreme Court cases that
elaborated on it have spawned a whole body of law, still a work in
progress and all of it judge-made.
</P>
<P>
   To cite just one example, federal appeals courts are split over
how to assess the reliability of a doctor's testimony about a
differential diagnosis _ the conclusion that a plaintiff's symptoms
are caused by one medical condition and not another. Some courts
allow testimony that reflects standard clinical practice, while
others reject testimony not based on published scientific studies.
The Supreme Court may eventually feel obliged to resolve the
dispute, as well as others stemming from the Daubert case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rely on judges who are generalists, and judges learn what
they need to learn,'' said Richard M. Cooper, a Washington lawyer
who has argued many technically complex cases since his days as
general counsel for the Food and Drug Administration. Most
recently, he won a Supreme Court case on behalf of the tobacco
industry against his former agency's effort to regulate cigarettes
as drug delivery devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties and friends of the court briefs educate the
judges,'' Cooper said. ``The lawyer's job is to marshal the
relevant science, economics and technical information in a manner
that an intelligent lay person can understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our system, and it's a useful discipline,'' he added.
``The Endangered Species Act, for example. Are we really wiping out
that rare species? How do we know?'' For the Microsoft case, he
said, ``if it's something economists can understand and explain to
lawyers, lawyers can explain it to the court.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cass R. Sunstein, a University of Chicago law professor whose
recent book on the Supreme Court, ``One Case at a Time'' (Harvard
University Press, 1999), commends an incremental approach to
deciding hard cases, was one hesitant voice who warned that the
Microsoft case might indeed lie at the outer limits of the court's
institutional competence.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he noted that antitrust cases, unlike most
other cases of equivalent complexity, go to court in raw form,
without having been predigested by an administrative agency with
special expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a court is stuck with a technically complex case, it can
usually turn to strategies of avoidance,'' Sunstein said. ``In
administrative law, you defer to the agency. A real development of
20th century law was the shift from judicial to administrative
lawmaking. We don't have the common law of nuisance; we have the
EPA. We don't have the common law of fraud; we have the FTC.''
</P>
<P>
   But in antitrust, essentially common law constructed by judges
from the Sherman Act's cryptic phrases, the strategy of avoidance
``is not available,'' he said. Without an expert agency to defer
to, explained Sunstein, judges cannot take the path of least
resistance _ that is, ``letting specialists make the first-line
decisions, subject to review by generalists for some sign of
arbitrariness or unfairness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft context, he said, that leaves the court without
much of a lifeline as it navigates uncharted territory. ``To the
extent that this case can be resolved on standard antitrust
doctrine, the facts are pretty straightforward,'' Sunstein said.
``What's messy is to figure out how to apply antitrust when
technology and the market are both changing rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the justices, no one has given more thought to the
relationship between law and science than Breyer, who also happens
to have taught antitrust at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that in this age of science, we must build legal
foundations that are sound in science, as well as in law,'' he said
in a 1998 speech to the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, which he praised for a study on expanded roles for
court-appointed experts.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in his speech last month at the Cambridge
biomedical research symposium, Breyer said the view that Supreme
Court justices ``need not know science but only law to make
decisions'' was ``increasingly unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of ``creating a generalist voice that will speak
for an age of specialization,'' he said, was ``difficult to
accomplish, but it is important to try.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In the din here in the old courtroom, lawyers fight for
billions of dollars as the people in the gallery fight for air.
</P>
<P>
   With as much as $100 billion at risk in a lawsuit brought by
Florida smokers against cigarette makers, lawyers argue hot and
loud whether the tobacco companies should be punished with a huge
judgment _ until the state court judge, tired of all the shouting,
quiets them down.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the lull, the survivors of a pack-a-day past can be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of ruined lungs and surgically altered voices drifts
softly across the pews in the Miami-Dade Courthouse. The hiss of
oxygen bottles mixes with the tortured breaths of lifetime smokers,
and men who suck air into their lungs through holes in their
throats whisper hoarsely to women widowed by cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the front pew, which he has occupied every court day for 22
months in various stages of the lawsuit, 62-year-old Guillermo Saa
speaks through an electronic voice box. A white bib covers the hole
surgeons left after cutting away part of his throat, his larynx and
other cancerous tissue around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   With each breath, the bib gently rises and falls, rises and
falls.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that their scars and surgeries and shortened lives
might be partly their fault, that they could have quit, if they had
truly tried, is not something these former smokers entertain for
very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to stop,'' Saa said outside the courtroom, in his
mechanical voice. ``The most I lasted was two or three days.''
</P>
<P>
   The former smokers and their friends and family members file
into the courtroom every day, a dozen or so, sometimes more, and
always sit in the first few rows on the right-hand side. These are
mostly older people, who started smoking years before it was common
knowledge that the habit could kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Saa comes to see the trial, which is his own story in a way,
played out.
</P>
<P>
   He knew, long before his operation to remove the cancerous
tissue in 1982, that smoking could kill him or ruin his life, but
the habit, the pure pleasure it gave him, was overpowering, he
said. Like others in this courtroom, he became hooked as a young
man, before he knew of the long-term effects. When he did know
smoking could kill him, quitting required more will than he
possessed.
</P>
<P>
   He sits day by day beside people who know that craving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have pulmonary emphysema,'' said Valentin Venas, 72, of
Miami. ``I cannot be cured.'' He started smoking when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the way it is with smoking, people here said. If it
does not ruin the quality of your life, as it did with Saa, it
steals the end of it. The people in the first few pews are not the
worst off of the 300,000 to 500,000 people who are joined in the
lawsuit against five major cigarette makers. The worst off, under
oxygen tents, cannot come to the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are more dead than living, still waiting,'' said
Saa, who lives with his wife, Nancy, on Miami Beach. But he never
goes into the ocean. He is afraid that the water will slip down the
hole in his throat and drown him.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit they have come to monitor has already cost the
cigarette industry $12.7 million in compensatory damages. The same
jury in Miami-Dade Circuit Court is hearing the punitive stage,
which is expected to continue for about another week, so the
smokers are cautious but hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that many courts have already found cigarettes to
be a dangerously addictive product, one designed to be so. One inch
of small print on the side of a cigarette pack _ a warning easily
overlooked, or ignored _ was flimsy protection from that, the
smokers said.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Ruiz, who came here from Puerto Rico, where smoking is
almost a national pastime, comes to the trial and sits there, for
her dead husband. ``In the middle of the night he would go to the
bathroom, and then he would lie down and smoke,'' said Ruiz. Her
husband, Francisco Ruiz, died from cancer in 1978. ``He would give
up food, just to smoke more.''
</P>
<P>
   Each person here has a story of how easy it was to get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoking for me was by choice,'' said Saa, of the beginning of
his habit. He was on an airplane flight from Colombia to Miami, in
1954. A flight attendant, he said, handed out sample packages with
just three cigarettes inside. Three cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hooked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saa came to the United States to study English in Louisiana. He
noticed that everywhere he looked, even the hallways of public
buildings, there were cigarette vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone smoked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the culture. Movie stars who got the girl smoked. Women
smoked _ but only sitting down. Even professional athletes smoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't warnings,'' Saa said. ``In 1964, they started to
give notice'' of the health risks of smoking. ``I already had the
addiction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, there was always the feeling that while it
might happen to others, it could not really happen to him, the same
feeling that people have driving past the scene of a bloody highway
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would harm me this much,'' Saa said. ``I
never thought I would get like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies countered the warnings with their own
scientific data.
</P>
<P>
   Some taking part in the lawsuit say it is not about the money
and some say that is exactly what it is about, forcing the tobacco
companies to pay for ruined lives. But with as many as 500,000
joined in the lawsuit, even a $100 billion judgment would be spread
pretty thin.
</P>
<P>
   Saa said she and her husband lost everything to his medical
bills, including their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a fatal life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Saa said there was one good thing about his ordeal. His children
do not smoke. They look at him, and cannot. He talks to
schoolchildren, to show them how dangerous it is to smoke, and the
high price they could someday pay for trying to be cool.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the tobacco industry have argued that the modern-day
executives have changed, that they recognize the dangers, that they
have refused to aim advertisements at new smokers. That, the
tobacco lawyers said, should be considered by the jury in any
judgment of punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The former smokers in the courtroom shake their heads at that.
The legacy of distrust is too strong.
</P>
<P>
   But smokers who have quit think that quitting, while painful,
was possible, and that it has saved them _ at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any innocent victims here,'' Donald
Livingstone, 70, a lawyer and former smoker, said as he passed by
the courtroom. ``All these people took the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The terrible thing about quitting, some smokers said, is that a
seed might have already been planted deep inside the body that
flowers into death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit at 55,'' Livingstone said. ``I knew my life would lose
all its quality to it.'' But, he said, ``if I had a lethal
diagnosis, I would probably light up.''

 &HT;    Proposed deal could move around the local radio dial
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's fourth-highest-rated radio station, the
adult R&AMP;B formatted Kiss 104.7 (WALR-FM), may soon move down the
dial to 104.1 _ knocking smooth jazz station Jazz Flavors (WJZF-FM
104.1) off the air _ if Cox Radio's offer to buy Midwestern
Broadcasting is accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The news came late Friday, when Cox Radio announced it had
exercised a right of first refusal to buy Midwestern Broadcasting
for $280 million _ one of the highest price tags for a radio deal
in Atlanta history.
</P>
<P>
   Midwestern's chief asset is WALR-FM (104.7), which it purchased
in 1992 for $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cox Radio, Midwestern hasn't responded to the
offer. Midwestern Vice President David Dickey was not available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would not include two other properties owned by the
Dickey family in Atlanta, WCNN-AM (680) and Glory 1340 (WALR-AM).
</P>
<P>
   The deal would expand Cox Radio's power in Atlanta. It's the
city's biggest group owner of radio stations, with WSB-AM (750 _
news/talk), B 98.5 (WSB-FM 98.5 _ soft rock), Jazz Flavors (WJZF-FM
104.1 _ smooth jazz), 95.5/The Beat (WBTS-FM 95.5 _ rhythmic Top
40) and Fox 97 (WFOX-FM 97.1 FM _ oldies). Cox Radio is majority
owned by Cox Enterprises, which owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Morgan, co-chief operating officer for Cox Radio, said the
company ``would not change'' Kiss 104.7's format. Cox Radio also
announced a deal with Salem Communications to trade the license and
transmitting facilities of WALR-FM for the license and transmitting
facilities of KKHT-FM in Houston. Cox will retain WALR's
``intellectual property,'' i.e. the format, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Salem, specializing in religious programming, recently bought
arts station WGKA-AM (1190).
</P>
<P>
   No one was available Friday to say what it plans to do with the
104.7 frequency in Atlanta.

NO ASBESTOS IN CRAYONS WITHOUT TALC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's second largest crayon maker, Rose Art, says its
crayons no longer are made with talc, and new tests conducted for
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer show no signs of cancer-causing
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Art was one of three crayon brands in which laboratories
hired by the P-I found tremolite and anthophyllite asbestos in
repeated tests conducted earlier this year. The other two brands
were Crayola and Prang. Asbestos was found in 32 of 40 crayons
tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether there is asbestos or not in the talc, but
I do know that we no longer used talc in our crayons,'' Lawrence
Rosen, Rose Art's president, said Friday. ``We haven't used talc in
our crayons for at least 15 months and I'm surprised to find any of
the old stuff still around.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said the Rose Art crayons tested this spring for the P-I
``obviously were old stock and manufactured years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Art crayons purchased Friday were tested by Lab/Cor, Inc.,
one of two Seattle labs which did the initial testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no asbestos or talc found in the Rose Art crayons we
tested today,'' Lab/Cor president and chief scientist Robert Fisher
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Crayola, Prang and Rose Art insist that there is no asbestos in
their crayons. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has taken
responsibility for the dispute and is having crayons analyzed by
outside labs. The commission's preliminary findings are expected to
be released late next week, said Russ Rader, the agency's director
of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Labs throughout the country have tested crayons for government
agencies, school districts and news organizations. Most of the
analysts believe that the asbestos is a contaminant in the talc
that manufacturers add to strengthen the crayons.
</P>
<P>
   The talc used by most American crayons makers come from a mine
in upstate New York, owned by R.T. Vanderbilt Co.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt says there is no asbestos its talc, but the
Connecticut-based company has been the center of a contentious
30-year fight with government regulators and public health experts
over whether the cancer-causing fibers are in its talc.
</P>
<P>
   CPSC says it must not only determine whether there is asbestos
in the crayons, but if there is, whether it presents a health
hazard to children. The amount of asbestos detected in the P-I's
testing, and later tests at many other labs, showed relatively low
levels of the carcinogenic fibers. More then 20 physicians and
public health experts said that no asbestos, at any level, should
be in any product used by children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say that I foresaw this talc controversy and
stopped it because of that,'' said Rose Art's Rosen, ``but in
reality, we stopped using the talc because it made a better,
smoother drawing crayon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't used any Vanderbilt talc, or any talc for that
matter, for more than 15 months,'' Rosen said. ``We still have
unopened bags of it in the warehouse that we have no intention of
ever using it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The P-I's report of asbestos in his and other crayons ``came as
a shock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had never been any clue that the talc had asbestos in
it,'' he said. ``99.9 percent of our crayons that are on store
shelves today is the new non-talc products. We sell them to four
huge chains (including Walmart, Target and Toys R Us) and we know
exactly where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to see a recall and we're all waiting to see that
the CPSC finds,'' Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how consumers would differentiate between the old
crayons with talc and the new talc-free model, Rosen said, ``I'll
get back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen's New Jersey-based company, which is family-owned,
employees 2,000 people and produces more than 500 million crayons a
year in the United States and Taiwan.

   MCCAW-TELEDESIC (Kirkland, Wash.) _ Can Craig McCaw salvage
Teledesic, his futuristic scheme to dot the stratosphere with a
266-satellite network for voice and data communications? Many
investors are second-guessing McCaw, but he just plowed another
$1.2 billion into the project, which he considers ``an Internet in

   PROFILE-LINDAHL (Zurich, Switzerland) _ In the three years since
Goeran Lindahl took over the Swedish multinational ABB _ part of
the empire associated with Sweden's Wallenberg dynasty _ he has
shed the power generation, nuclear and rail divisions that marked
ABB as an anchor of the old economy to gain it a larger place in
the technology-driven world of the new. He has also dismantled the
company's complex ownership structure, which involved two holding
companies and four categories of stock to protect control of the
Wallenberg family in Sweden and the Schmidheiny family in
Switzerland. Alan Cowell profiles Lindahl and ABB.

   INVEST-INSIGHT-CALLIES (Undated) _ Remember the Goldilocks

   INVEST-KLECZKA-BLAIRVALUE _ (Undated) Glen A. Kleczka, lead
manager of the $58 million William Blair Value Discovery fund, sums
up his value philosophy simply: ``We buy broken stocks,'' he said,
``not broken companies.'' A ``broken stock'' typically trades at 50
percent or more off its five-year-high stock price, and its
valuation is depressed, he said. A company that is not ``broken''
has several attributes: leading market share, improving
profitability, and management that is initiating share repurchase
plans. By Carole Gould. With graphic and photo.

<P>
   ANNUITIES-SEC (Undated) _ Monday, the Securities and Exchange
Commission plans to take the unusual step of publishing an investor
alert on its Web site, www.sec.gov, on the pitfalls of variable
annuities. Joseph Treaster describes the SEC document, ``Variable
Annuities: What You Should Know,'' as reading like a sober antidote

that bonuses now being offered as a lure by many variable annuity
companies ``may not be in your best interest.''

voted against the creation of Medicare in 1965, although he has
since supported it. He loathes the idea of retiring and, at 76,
doesn't consider himself old. But he has become a hero to senior
citizens for surviving prostate cancer, for speaking out about
using Viagra, the impotency drug, and for his sense of humor.
Actually, he says, some of the Viagra jokes made at his expense
were pretty funny. By Fred Brock. &QL;

   CRYSTALBALL-ECONOMCY (Washington) _ The writer looks into a

Federal Reserve this summer; a larger than expected federal
surplus; and, the new economy emerging as a campaign issue. The
crystal ball is a prototype without a warranty. Check back in a few
months to determine its accuracy. By Richard W. Stevenson.

<P>
   FREEDOM-COLUMN (Undated) _ Daniel Akst suggests forfeiting the
professional quality stove or the new sports utility vehicle and
saving up for a really important commodity _ freedom. Ditch that
lucrative but unworthy gig you've been slaving at all these years
and do something you believe in _ teach school, start a business,
move to the country, read a book, for Pete's sake. Unfortunately,
the author concludes, freedom has a marketing problem.

   HYBRID-CARS (Washington) _ Gasoline-electric cars can be clean

engineers are learning that hybrids cannot accomplish everything
that environmentalists want. That point was demonstrated at the

race showed that hybrids did better on fuel economy than some of
the electrics, but caused more emissions of gases that are thought
to cause climate change. By Matthew L. Wald. &QL;

NASA SET FOR CRASH OF HUGE SPACECRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   by WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a mix of sadness and anticipation, NASA
engineers on Friday prepared for the fiery death this weekend of a
giant spacecraft that has made pioneering discoveries in gamma ray
astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   After gradually lowering the orbit of the 17-ton craft, the
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, with a series of rocket firings _ a
process they have already begun _ technicians will guide it into
Earth's atmosphere early Sunday, Eastern Daylight Time, for a fatal
plunge into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time NASA will have intentionally guided so
large a craft to its destruction, in hope of minimizing danger to
people on the ground. The bus-size spacecraft has been operating
with only two of its three stabilizing gyroscopes since December,
and NASA officials calculated that if it lost another gyroscope and
came down on its own, there would be a 1-in-1,000 chance that
someone would be killed by the debris.
</P>
<P>
   So engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md., who have controlled the scientific mission of the observatory
during its nine years in space, now find themselves getting ready
for its death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood right now is pretty sad,'' Dr. Neil Gehrels, Compton
project scientist, said in an interview from Goddard on Friday.
``It's been a great mission with a great spacecraft, and now it's
ending.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, engineers began a four-stage process to slowly lower
the observatory in preparation for its final descent, into the
atmosphere. That day a 23-minute firing of small thruster rockets
aboard the craft brought the low point of its orbit down to 226
miles, from 316. Then a 26-minute firing on Wednesday night lowered
the orbit to 155 miles and let engineers fine-tune their
projections for the spacecraft's terminal dive into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The final stages for Compton's controlled re-entry are to begin
on Sunday at 12:01 a.m., EDT, with a 26-minute rocket burn that
slows the craft and lowers it to a 95-mile-high orbit. This is to
be followed by a fourth and final thruster firing, of 30 minutes'
duration starting at 1:30 a.m., that will nudge Compton down to 48
miles. At that altitude, the thicker atmosphere will begin heating
and breaking apart the spacecraft, which will be streaking in at
16,000 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said about six tons of metal debris was expected
to survive re-entry and smash into a remote part of the Pacific
about 2,500 miles southeast of Hawaii about 2:20 a.m., EDT.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration and other
agencies have issued warnings for ships and planes to avoid that
area during the operation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NASA has arranged for the Air Force to monitor the final
destruction of Compton with one of its special Cobra Ball
missile-tracking airplanes, equipped with radar scanners and
infrared and optical sensors. Officials want the plane to track
different pieces of the spacecraft as it breaks up, to help NASA
refine computer programs designed to predict the behavior of large
craft as they re-enter the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrels said several large pieces of the Compton observatory
were expected to survive re-entry almost intact before hitting the
ocean, including the solid aluminum bus, or keel, on which the
craft was built; a large sodium-iodide crystal weighing several
hundred pounds; and four 125-pound pieces of tungsten that are part
of one of the instruments aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Also raining down will be 5,500 bolts of various sizes made of
heat-resistant titanium metal. ``These are going to come down
basically intact, like the spray from a shotgun blast,'' Gehrels
said.
</P>
<P>
   Compton will be the biggest spacecraft to fall from orbit since
the United States' 100-ton Skylab space station burned up over the
Indian Ocean in July 1979. Although most of Skylab disintegrated in
the atmosphere, some pieces survived the uncontrolled re-entry and
landed in Western Australia. No one was injured in the Skylab
episode, but NASA officials say the risk of injury from descent of
a large craft is too great to leave to chance.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists have criticized NASA, however, saying it acted
too quickly in deciding to bring down Compton, for which there is
currently no substitute for observations in gamma ray astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   The $670 million spacecraft, deployed by the space shuttle
Atlantis in April 1991, is one of NASA's Great Observatories
series, like the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray
Observatory, designed to study the heavens at all wavelengths of
the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays, which are invisible and
have energies greater than visible light and ultraviolet or X-ray
radiation, appear to come from the most violent cosmic phenomena
and reveal details about the universe that otherwise could not be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James M. Ryan, a professor of physics at the University of
New Hampshire, who used one of Compton's special telescopes, said
NASA had not seriously pursued contingency plans like running the
observatory with two gyroscopes, or even one. Many scientists,
including some at NASA, are angered by the decision to kill
Compton, he said, but are afraid to speak out publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No section of astronomy has hung so much on one spacecraft as
the gamma ray people,'' Ryan said in a telephone interview. ``We
are going to be blind to a huge chunk of the universe for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's chief scientist, said it was his
decision to bring the observatory down now, because waiting, he
said, would have increased the risk of human injury from an
uncontrolled re-entry. He acknowledged that engineers at Goddard
had come up with a theoretical backup plan to continue operating
the observatory and bring it down later, but he said that it would
have increased risk to humans by eight times and that there was no
way to test it. And engineers calculated that there was a 1-in-10
chance that a second gyroscope would fail in as little as a year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could the Goddard engineers, if they had more time, come up
with a way to control the observatory?'' Weiler said. ``I'd bet my
house that they could. But I can't bet a human life on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiler noted that the Compton mission had been planned to last
three to five years, and had lasted nine. ``We got a lot of value
out of this observatory, and scientists will be analyzing data from
Compton for years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrels, of Goddard, said that some 20 percent of Compton's data
had not been studied yet and that analysis of what had been
gathered before the spacecraft's science instruments were turned
off a week ago could occupy scientists for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Further, ``the silver lining here is that there are some
exciting new gamma ray missions coming soon,'' Gehrels said,
including the launching of Europe's Integral spacecraft in 2002,
the flight of the United States' Explorer Swift mission in 2003 or
2004, and the launching of the giant Gamma-Ray Large Area Space
Telescope around 2005.

ENTREMED ASSAILS PATENT LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president of EntreMed Inc., a Maryland biotech firm
developing some of Dr. Judah Folkman's novel cancer drugs, Thursday
denounced a patent suit against Folkman as a ``reprehensible
attempt'' to discredit the cancer researcher, and added the action
is ``egregious, tasteless, and shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Holaday, EntreMed's chairman, president, and chief
executive, said that Abbott Laboratories' suit over a patent on a
form of the drug angiostatin is aimed at obtaining ``the rights to
a product it neither discovered nor owns.''
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical giant, based in Abbott Park, Ill., filed the
suit this week after three years of negotiations over rights to
``Kringle 5'' _ a form of the drug angiostatin, which starves
tumors by shutting off their blood supply. The suit contends that
Folkman and Children's Hospital, where Folkman has a large
laboratory, wrongly obtained a patent on Kringle 5, which is said
to be a particularly potent form of angiostatin.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman, Children's, and EntreMed _ all named as defendants _
maintain that Kringle 5, like the other forms of angiostatin, were
discovered in Folkman's laboratory. Children's officials said
Thursday they will file a reply to the lawsuit within the required
20 days, and said they believe they will prevail in court.
</P>
<P>
   Holaday said in Thursday's statement that patents held by
Children's, which is affiliated with Harvard University, and by
EntreMed cover all combinations of Kringles 1 through 5. A form of
angiostatin that includes Kringles 1-3 is undergoing initial human
testing in Philadelphia; it is not at issue in the legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman, the pioneer of the field of angiogenesis _ the growth
of blood vessels that feed tumors _ has no personal financial
interest in EntreMed or in the development of angiostatin.
</P>
<P>
   Companies frequently sue each other over patent rights in the
burgeoning biotech world, but one patent expert said firms usually
don't sue academic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be reluctant to bring suits against our friends in the
universities, because of the collaborative opportunities and
goodwill we get from them,'' said Thomas J. DesRosier, vice
president and chief patent counsel at Genzyme Corp. in Cambridge.
He said, however, that Abbott is known for being aggressive in
intellectual-property issues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vituperative language in Abbott's suit, which
contends Folkman and the hospital perpetrated ``fraud'' and
``conspiracy,'' DesRosier said he doubted Folkman's reputation
would suffer from the accusations, unless they proved true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty highly respected, and the general philosophy is
that you give people of Folkman's stature benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   EntreMed stock closed up $2.5625 Thursday, to $26.1875, on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A federal jury Friday convicted Gary Paul Karr
of participating in the disappearance of Madalyn O'Hair, giving
prosecutors their first conviction in the presumed murder of
Austin's loudest atheist and her family.
</P>
<P>
   But the verdict leaves the case's most vexing question
unanswered: Where are the bodies of O'Hair, her son and
granddaughter?
</P>
<P>
   Jurors found Karr not guilty of conspiring to kidnap O'Hair, her
son Jon Garth Murray and granddaughter Robin Murray-O'Hair. But
jurors also delivered four guilty verdicts, ranging from extortion
to taking stolen goods across state lines, as Karr listened
expressionlessly.
</P>
<P>
   With eight previous felony convictions, he faces life in prison
under the federal ``three strikes'' law. Sentencing is scheduled
for Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's best chance for a reduced sentence could be cooperating
with federal authorities, perhaps by revealing where the O'Hairs
are buried. Federal law gives defendants one year from their
sentencing date to cut their jail time by substantially helping
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But Karr has maintained his innocence, never indicating that he
has additional information to give, even for a plea bargain, said
his attorney, Tom Mills. ``I would be open to it, but he has never
said that to me, even in confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-man, four-woman jury returned the guilty verdicts
after deliberating 32 hours over four days in Austin's federal
courthouse. In a case without bodies, eyewitnesses or direct
physical evidence, prosecutors sought to convince jurors that the
O'Hairs died in a September 1995 kidnapping scheme masterminded by
the family's office manager, David Roland Waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough case, a very complex case,'' said federal
prosecutor Gerald Carruth. ``We're satisfied with the jury's
verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Waters recruited Karr and Florida friend Danny
Fry to hold the family hostage for one month and extort $500,000 in
gold coins from them. Prosecutors believe the trio was killed,
dismembered in a North Austin storage unit and buried in a Hill
Country ranch.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, several jurors said that without bodies, they
felt uncomfortable concluding that the O'Hairs were killed. And
they were troubled by the fact that Jon Murray _ who flew to New
Jersey to retrieve the money with Karr, and even sat in a bank
conference room with an off-duty police officer during the alleged
kidnapping _ did not appear distressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One belief on the jury was that the O'Hairs were part of a
scheme to obtain money, and that scheme went wrong,'' said jury
foreman Hector Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors did believe that Karr conspired to extort money from the
family. He was found guilty of extortion, interstate traveling to
aid in racketeering, committing a criminal act to gain financially,
and interstate transportation of stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors used credit card receipts, van rental records,
telephone bills and testimony to tie Karr to the disappearances.
The case included more than 70 witnesses and hundreds of documents.
</P>
<P>
   Juror Jeff Babcock praised the prosecution's circumstantial
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just the quantity of the evidence, it was the
quality of the evidence,'' he said. ``They connected it all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is: What next?
</P>
<P>
   Karr is the first _ and only _ person convicted in the O'Hair
disappearance. Waters has not been charged in the case. Fry was
killed, his body dumped in Dallas County. And prosecutors barely
touched on suspicions surrounding a fourth man, Gerald ``Chico''
Osborne, alleged to have rented the storage unit where the bodies
were dismembered. Osborne recently pleaded guilty in Fort Worth to
unrelated gun charges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have until October 2000 _ when the five-year statute
of limitations expires _ to charge additional suspects with any
non-capital offenses in the O'Hairs' disappearance. After that,
federal prosecutors have only one option: murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   But whether officials will go after Waters is unclear. The
53-year-old Illinois native, who pleaded guilty in 1995 to stealing
$54,000 from the O'Hairs' atheist organization, is serving 60 years
in state prison for probation violation in that theft. And proving
a murder case without additional evidence could be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Karr cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have long suspected that Karr knows more than
he's telling. Before trial, plea negotiations between the two sides
stalled when they could not agree on a prison term.
</P>
<P>
   If Karr talks, authorities could stage a new search for the
bodies. Trial testimony indicated that the O'Hairs, believed to
have been buried on a Hill country ranch, may have been moved to an
unspecified subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors won't detail their next move. But Robert Pitman,
chief of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Austin, said the
investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that the United States will not rest until we
have done everything in our power to bring all responsible parties
to justice,'' Pitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said the trial left them with no doubt that Waters
spearheaded the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the evidence pointed to David Waters,'' Rodriguez
said. ``The difficulty of our decision was linking Karr to David
Waters. First, we had to decide that Waters had committed a crime.
Then we had to connect Karr to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the O'Hair mystery begins in 1993, when Waters
answered a newspaper ad for a typesetter at American Atheists, the
O'Hairs' Austin-based organization. Waters, who could type 90 words
a minute, was hired and eventually became the O'Hairs' office
manager.
</P>
<P>
   After Waters stole $54,000 from American Atheists, the O'Hairs
sought a restraining order against him and erected a security fence
around the atheist headquarters. When O'Hair blasted Waters in an
atheist newsletter, Waters vowed revenge, testimony in Karr's trial
showed.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1995, the family abruptly disappeared from their
Austin home. Dirty breakfast dishes sat on the table and medicine
for the ailing Madalyn O'Hair's was left behind. The family's
cherished cocker spaniels _ Gallagher, Gannon and Shannon _
remained unattended.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Waters, Karr and Fry held the family hostage at
the Warren Inn in San Antonio and forced them to transfer $600,000
from New Zealand to a New Jersey bank account. Karr and Jon Murray
flew to New Jersey to pick up the money, later converting it into
gold coins in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Only $500,000 was retrieved. The O'Hairs vanished in late
September, leaving the remaining $100,000 in gold unclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Waters allegedly hid the gold in a Burnet Road storage unit.
Three San Antonio men testified that they stole the gold while
breaking into random units _ blowing it all on cars, strip clubs
and jewelry in two frivolous years of spending.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also believe Fry _ who, unlike his companions, had
never been convicted of a felony _ was killed because the
kidnappers feared he would talk.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers contended that Karr, a handyman who spent 20
years in prison for armed robbery and kidnapping, was hired to
guard the O'Hairs as they prepared to flee the country to escape
federal tax problems. Defense lawyers suggest the family is
secretly living in a remote location. Prosecutors suspect their
bones were washed away by floods and possibly eaten by feral hogs.
</P>
<P>
   As one lawyer said, ``The might have washed away to the Red
Sea.''

GORE VOWS TO OVERHAUL CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo NYT9 is being sent to NYT photo clients.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Describing absent fathers as ``the No. 1 cause of
child poverty in America,'' Vice President Al Gore called Friday
for measures to encourage them to pay child support.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I will launch a second generation of welfare
reform to require all fathers who owe child support to pay up or be
required to go to work to support their children,'' Gore said at a
conference on fatherhood. ``We've been requiring that of the
mothers; let's require it of the fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing statistics showing that children in single-parent
families are more likely to be poor, to drop out of school, to go
to jail or to commit suicide, Gore also called for government
policies that would, as he phrased it, ``lift up the institution of
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments don't raise children and national policies can
never take a child to a baseball game,'' the vice president said.
``But I believe we have a national obligation to insist upon
responsible fatherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his plan, Gore proposed ``parental responsibility
accounts'' for families on welfare. Most child support intended for
families on welfare goes instead to state governments, which use
the money to defer the cost of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's proposal, some of those payments would go into
accounts that would become available to families when they went off
welfare. Gore said that more parents would pay child support if
they knew it would go to their families instead of the government.
He said it would cost the federal government $2.3 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also proposed federal grants for states that
created successful programs for finding work for unemployed parents
who owed child support. And he called for policies that would make
it easier for credit card companies to deny new credit cards to
parents who were delinquent in child support payments.
</P>
<P>
   To help two-parent families stay together, Gore called for
changing the tax code so that working couples would not pay higher
taxes than if they filed as individuals. Under his plan, he would
eliminate that so-called marriage penalty only for families that
used the standard deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans criticized Gore's tax plan, saying it would reduce
taxes for 9 million of the 28 million couples who filed tax
returns. A Republican plan supported by Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the likely Republican presidential nominee, would eliminate
the penalty for all the couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put George Bush in the White House and the marriage penalty
will be gone,'' said Chris Paulitz, a spokesman for the Republican
National Committee. ``Al Gore will not fight for this. He will give
Americans lip service, but not fight.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the upbeat tone of all his events this week,
Gore added confessional touches to his remarks, part of his effort
to underscore his biography and soften his image. Mostly, those
touches were about his late father, Albert, a Democratic senator
from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember watching my father bait a hook on the banks of the
Caney Fork River and sit quietly for an hour,'' Gore said. ``From
such moments sons learn more from their dads about patience, joy,
duty and love than they do from all of the lectures and sermons
that you can add up.''

   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In a political race that was major news in
Brazil but little noticed abroad, a radical-left coalition now
controls all three elected seats on the six-member board of the
nation's largest and most influential pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   Two radical leftist candidates who won seats in an election last
month began their terms Thursday, joining an incumbent colleague on
the board of the fund, known as Previ. That gives them
unprecedented power to block decisions that require a majority
vote. One of the new board members is also the official responsible
for recommending how the $17.5 billion fund invests.
</P>
<P>
   The radical-left's strengthened position could have a major
impact on the priorities of the 62 major Brazilian companies in
which the fund has a significant stake.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the possibility that the radical-left board
members, who oppose the speed and scope of Brazil's privatization
of major industries, could exert their influence to slow or halt
the process that began nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clear position against the government's
privatization program, since it is more than evident that it has
been harmful to the Brazilian economy,'' the winners said in their
election platform literature. ``In a case where the positioning of
Previ could be decisive to stop the privatization, we should
position ourselves accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   The change has not rattled financial markets or worried foreign
investors, who have been pouring billions of dollars into Brazil.
Those investments have contributed to the country's rebound from a
severe economic crisis in January 1999 when the national currency
was sharply devalued. But the popularity of the radical-left's
position on privatization and worker rights has clearly touched a
nerve in Brazil, where many people have lost job security as a
result of the shift of many industries into private hands.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 100-year-old-fund, formally known as the Caixa de
Previdencia dos Funcionarios do Banco do Brasil, or the Social
Security Fund for the Workers of the Bank of Brazil, is governed by
the board of directors. Three members are appointed by the bank,
and three are elected by the workers and retirees. Under a change
in Previ bylaws, the three elected positions, which had previously
been largely ornamental, were given executive powers on the board.
This year's election was the first in which the winners would have
real influence over the investment decisions of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Previ, which can invest only in Brazilian companies, is one of
the largest institutional investors in Latin America. Its holdings
include 27 percent of Brazil's largest exporter, the aircraft maker
Embraer; 10 percent of the world's largest steel maker, CVRD; and
10 percent of Latin America's largest beverage company, Brahma.
</P>
<P>
   Previ board candidates, who must have worked for the bank for 15
years, appeared from all over the political spectrum, eventually
settling into four tickets: two were associated with left-wing
political parties, one was a group of retirees and the fourth was
said to have the support of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and
the Bank of Brazil board.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates canvassed the country, spending an estimated
$250,000 on mailings and personal appearances for 118,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elections are an important way to add transparency to the fund
by debating the problems and the strategies for the future,'' said
Paulo Kliass, the secretary of the Supplemental Social Security
Commission, the government agency that regulates pension funds.
``But this was a radicalization of the process where it devolved
more into finger-pointing than a debate of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The winners, from a coalition of the Workers Party, or PT, and
the Brazilian Communist Party, assumed positions as the director of
participations and director of planning. The third elected board
member, the director of security, who began a four-year term in
1998, is also a member of their coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Even if their positions on privatization do not slow the
process, there is some speculation that the strong left-wing
influence on the Previ board could shift the focus of the fund's
investment decisions away from a strictly financial one. The new
director of participations, Sergio Ricardo da Silva Rosa, will be
in charge of analyzing all future investments for the fund, the
first time the left wing has controlled the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PT tends to politicize the process,'' said Flavio Rabelo,
a Brazilian pension fund expert and professor at a Sao Paulo
business school, the Getulio Vargas Foundation. ``It is not the
function of a pension fund to create jobs or fight poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arlindo Mogno, a coalition official and former board member,
said the coalition's objectives reflected an international trend
among unions and workers rights groups to take a greater role in
corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to use our influence on the boards of these companies
to make sure that the interests of workers are being protected,''
Mogno said. ``This is something that is happening around the
world.''

<P>
   NEHALEM, Ore. _ In the two years that Oregon voters and courts
have spent wrangling over Measure 58, the nation's first
voter-approved initiative granting all adult adoptees access to
their birth certificates, the legal fight here has often been cast
as the most excruciating of moral dilemmas: Don't adoptees have a
right to see the most basic information about where they come from?
Don't women who give up children for adoption have the right to
retain their privacy?
</P>
<P>
   But Helen Hill, the 45-year-old adoptee who spearheaded the
successful campaign for the measure in 1998 and celebrated a final
victory this week when a Supreme Court justice declined to stand in
its way, says she is puzzled by the notion of such a dilemma.
Measure 58, this sculptor and elementary-school art teacher
maintains, will prove a win-win for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have never understood this notion that it could ruin
somebody's life, to have the child she gave up at birth come back
into her life someday,'' said Hill, speaking Friday in the living
room of her log home, on a bluff with a spectacular view of the
Pacific in this little town on the Oregon coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I mean, it's an honorable thing she did,'' said Hill,
growing ever more animated. ``She shouldn't have to hide, and we
shouldn't have to go without that basic knowledge, and that medical
information, because of some lingering shame from the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not a view shared by all, of course. After passage of
the measure 18 months ago, a group of anonymous birth mothers sued
to block the law. One said through her lawyer that the whole debate
had brought her ``flashbacks and nightmares,'' while another
described the prospect of a phone call from her birth child as ``a
bomb held over your head.'' Another said her birth child, whom she
never wished to see, was a product of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has heard all those arguments, but she just shakes her head
in gentle but firm disagreement. ``M-58 is not about forcing
relationships between unwilling people,'' she said of the
initiative. ``It's all about healing the shame, and taking adoption
out of the dark ages.''
</P>
<P>
   When Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on Tuesday refused a request
from the birth mothers to block the law, thus letting stand a prior
ruling by the state's highest court, Oregon officials immediately
said they would begin sending applicants copies of their birth
certificates, which in most cases bear the birth mother's name.
</P>
<P>
   For Hill, that was a final victory, even if one that offers her
no practical gain: She wasn't even born in Oregon, and besides, she
has already found her birth parents.
</P>
<P>
   Her search for them is a compelling tale, one that begins when,
as a 10-year-old girl, she discovered some old adoption manuals
behind the bed of her parents' home in Kansas City. Had she been
adopted? she demanded of her mother. Yes, came the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That caused immediate confusion, bewilderment, even a big
depression,'' recalled Hill, a passionate woman with long, dark
hair and dark eyes. ``The seeds of this whole ballot measure were
probably sown right there,'' she added with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   After decades and thousands of dollars spent on private
investigators _ ``One said it's impossible; you know the whole song
and dance about `the building burned down with all the records in
it''' _ Hill found herself with the information she needed,
including a file that described her birth mother as a ``healthy,
attractive girl who wears her hair in a long bob.'' Hill was 41.
Her birth mother, in Des Moines, Iowa, was 64.
</P>
<P>
   So she just picked up the phone one day. ``My name is Helen, and
I'm calling about a very personal matter. I was born on March 24,
1955, in Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a silence on the other end,'' she recalled Friday.
``A very long silence. And after that she said: ``I love you. I've
always loved you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hill soon flew to Iowa, and they met.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost too much for a human being to deal with,'' Hill
remembered. ``There's an incredible amount of intimacy presupposed
with this person who is a total stranger. And yet there are things
frighteningly familiar about this person. Her scent, her voice. I
mean, the way her fingernails looked. It blows your mind. It just
blows your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the reunion with her birth mother, with whom she
remains friendly. A bit later she sent a letter to her birth
father, in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   He was a dashing lieutenant, back from the Korean War, when he
met her birth mother, and the two had a brief but passionate
romance. He never even knew that Hill existed. But having received
her letter, he picked up the phone and called her right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's this very exuberant Italian-American fellow, with a voice
like Al Pacino's,'' Hill said. ``He was stunned, but he was happy.
He said to me: `Your mama was the love of my life. You were a love
child.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not all adoptees share the intense curiosity of Hill, who drives
a van bedecked with images of planets and asteroids and two bumper
stickers proclaiming, ``Art Saves Lives.'' Experts say about
two-thirds of them do not seek out birth parents, even when there
are ways to pursue the information. (Of the third who do, about 80
percent are women.)
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Oregon law say that mutually desired reunions are
wonderful, but not those forced upon an unsuspecting or even
unwilling birth mother. Some have said the prospect might even so
tip the scales for some pregnant women as to lead them to opt for
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's simply a fundamental misunderstanding of human
nature,'' said Hill, who has three children of her own (a daughter,
21, and two sons, 19 and 14) and who is strongly in favor of
abortion rights. ``A woman doesn't go and have an abortion because
she's afraid her child might find her out some day. That's not the
way the heart and soul works.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who is no longer married, estimates that she spent about
$90,000 of her own money on the campaign for Measure 58. She also
got a friend to lend her Max, the golden retriever who was a
powerful mascot for the campaign. ``Max has his papers,'' read the
yes-on-58 ad. ``We want ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoptees-rights organizations, including a largely
cyberspace-based group known as Bastard Nation, hope the Oregon law
will propel similar movements in other states. Hill said she just
wanted to go back to her art and her teaching, and to her current
campaign to build a youth center in a nearby town. But she supports
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never believed in anything so much in my whole life,''
she said. ``I grew up steeped in the secrecy and shame that the
closed-record system perpetuates, and I don't want anybody else
going through what I went through. It's really as simple as that.''

PEDRO MARTINEZ TO SIT OUT A START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Pedro Martinez has started 10 games in eight
cities this season, picking up baseball converts at each stop.
Friday night, he arrived in his ninth city on the Pedro Tour and
made an announcement: Saturday's show has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was scheduled to make his 11th start Saturday night at
Veterans Stadium against the Phillies. But after experiencing
soreness near the left side of his rib cage _ Jimy Williams called
it a ``hot spot'' _ the Red Sox ace decided it would be wise to
rest. He said he will be able to resume his magical season (8-2,
1.05 ERA) Thursday against the Indians. Tim Wakefield will
temporarily take his place in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal,'' Martinez said several times Thursday, when
asked to describe his injury. He said he has had problems with his
oblique (muscle) since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to pitch with it for five years,'' he said.
``It's not a big deal. It's just something that we're trying to
take care of right now. I could pitch and be fine . . . We're just
trying to be careful with it because it's a little bit (inflammed)
and it's going to get worse if I keep pitching on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also weak from the flu and everything else, so it was the
perfect time to play it smart.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last start, May 28 against the Yankees, Martinez threw a
complete-game shutout to defeat Roger Clemens. But it took 128
pitches for the 170-pound Martinez to complete the game, and he did
so even though he was weak from the flu symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid was sick,'' Williams said. ``He pitched that game in
New York and that probably made it worse. We're going to help him
get his strength back now. He was bothered a little bit when he
threw on the side, so we're just going to back off a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The No Pedro News was disappointing to Philadelphians. The
Phillies are the worst team in the National League. They usually
play before empty blue seats here (they are fourth-worst in NL
attendance), so Martinez on the mound was a good reason to buy a
ticket. Both daily newspapers had stories on Martinez. One headline
referred to him as the ``Boston Strangler.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if fans want to chant and wave K cards, they will have to
do so for Wakefield, the Sox' ubiquitous emergency man. The
knuckleballer has started for both Martinez brothers in a pinch,
either because of suspensions (Pedro in Baltimore) or injuries
(Ramon in Toronto).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitching on one day's rest, which is more rest than he
had in Baltimore,'' Williams said of Wakefield, referring to a
relief appearance May 10 against the White Sox and a start the next
night against the Orioles. ``That's OK,'' Williams said of
Wakefield's short rest. ``I feel good about it.'' Later, the
manager added that, ``This is a marathon. We have to try to take
care of things the way we think it's best to take care of them.
We're trying to keep as many players healthy as we possibly can so
we can go out there and perform.''
</P>
<P>
   As reporters surrounded his locker Thursday and began asking
questions, Martinez scanned the crowd and noticed the serious
faces. That's when he announced, again, that ``this is no big
deal.'' So, he was asked, when will he pitch again?
</P>
<P>
   ``In my very next outing,'' he said with a shrug. ``I'll just go
out there and pitch again. I'll be in the same rotation. Just
(Saturday's) start, I'm not going to make it.''

MEMO NOW JUST A FOOTNOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It turns out that Salt Lake's dreaded ``geld'' memo, which some
believed would prove the bidders bribed International Olympic
Committee members to land the 2002 Winter Games, was much ado about
little. Most of the memo, which lists members by their last names,
is so cryptic as to be useless, e.g. _ MUKORA: geld, half and half.
KUMAR: Health, kids, geld. MZALI: Son a future.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``geld'' is the German word for money, nothing in the
memo indicates that any changed hands. Some entries, though, are
telling: HAGGMAN: Husband needs a job. HAGGMAN is Pirjo Haeggman,
the Finnish member who resigned last year after it was disclosed
that her husband worked for the bid committee. And most of the
members with ``geld'' next to their names, such as Congo's
Jean-Claude Ganga and Mali's Lamine Keita, ended up expelled in the
IOC's housecleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most members were relieved when SLOC chief Mitt Romney
released the memo during last week's IOC meetings in Rio de
Janeiro. ``I was glad I was blank,'' said US member Anita DeFrantz.
</P>
<P>
   Blank, too, was IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, Canada's
Dick Pound (who chaired the IOC's investigative panel), and
Australia's Kevan Gosper, who recently caught heat for a family ski
trip to Utah that was subsidized by the bidders.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A magnificent splash
</P>
<P>
   Inge ``Inky'' de Bruijn of the Netherlands turned in the most
astounding performance in swimming history in Sheffield, England,
last weekend, hanging up world records in the women's 100 freestyle
(53.8 seconds) and 100 butterfly (56.69), equaling the global mark
(24.51) in the 50 free, and breaking the standard in the
non-Olympic 50 butterfly for fun. De Bruijn not only chopped more
than a second off Jenny Thompson's 100 fly record, she became the
first woman to go faster than 54 seconds in the 100 free, where she
busted the record set by China's Le Jingyi at the 1994 world meet.
Nobody has had that kind of a meet since Mary T. Meagher set her
two butterfly records in 1981. Thus the challenge for Thompson, who
was favored to win both the 100 free and fly at Sydney. De Bruijn's
times probably had something to do with the new Fastskin bodysuit
she was wearing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   One last (hand)stand?
</P>
<P>
   Who'll lead the US women's gymnastics squad back to the medal
stand in Sydney? Could be Shannon Miller, who at 23 has come out of
retirement to try for her third Olympic team. ``Shannon stepped
into the gym at our May camp and it was like a bombshell,''
reported team coordinator Bela Karolyi. ``The young ones' eyes
turned big and round and popped out of their heads. Shannon is
Shannon _ she's sturdy.'' Miller and two of her 1996 gold-medal
teammates (Amy Chow and Jaycie Phelps) have good chances to make
the six-member team. Not so Dominique Moceanu, says her former
mentor. ``The kid is not working,'' Karolyi said. ``She's trying to
get by on shortcuts.'' . . . Lighter load for Marion Jones, Michael
Johnson, Maurice Greene, and the rest of the sprinters at the US
Olympic track and field trials in Sacramento next month. The
qualifying rounds will be reduced from four to three to save legs.
Looks like a traffic jam in the men's 10,000, though, which will be
run as a final. More than 40 runners have already qualified . . .
In case anybody gripes if Jones is put on the women's 4 x 400 relay
without running the event at the trials, there's a precedent.
Florence Griffith Joyner was named to the quartet at Seoul and
anchored it to a silver medal. As it is, the 49.59 that Jones hung
up at the Mt. SAC Relays in April would have won last year's world
meet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting picky on selections
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the USA Softball people had to pick the Olympic team
over again after an arbitrator ruled that they'd based their
selections on more than just last summer's training camp, using
performance since the last Games and ``intangibles.'' That was the
gripe of part-time second baseman Julie Smith after she didn't make
the squad. So federation officials went back to Square 1 _ and
chose the same team again . . . Esther Kim, the US taekwondo
fighter who gave her Olympic spot to injured friend and training
partner Kay Poe, has become the consolation-prize queen. First, Poe
promised to buy her a plane ticket to Sydney. Now, the IOC has
invited Kim and her coach/father as their expenses-paid guests and
promised her a special award (probably the Olympic Order). ``I feel
like I have a gold medal in my heart,'' said Kim, after Samaranch
called her at her Houston home . . . The US women's soccer team
can't say it didn't have enough tuneups before the Olympics. By the
time it heads for Sydney, it will have played 32 matches in eight
months, three more than it has ever played in a calendar year.
After the ongoing Pacific Cup in Australia (where it lost, 1-0, to
China in their first meeting since last year's World Cup final),
the Americans play in the CONCACAF Gold Cup (meeting Brazil in
Foxborough June 27), a tournament in Germany, two games at Norway,
and three August matches in the States against Russia, Canada, and
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quite a feat
</P>
<P>
   Ben Olsen and John O'Brien may see double duty with both the US
Olympic soccer team and the World Cup qualifying squad this summer.
Usually, the Cup qualifiers begin after the Games. Not so this
time, with the Americans playing four of their first six regional
matches before the Olympics. No conflict, though, according to Cup
team coach Bruce Arena, who said Olympic coach Clive Charles can
have whatever under-23s he wants. ``It's not my position to
interfere with his team,'' Arena said . . . The US men's basketball
team will play its way across the Pacific to get ready for the
Olympics. The Americans will spend a week in Maui, facing Canada
and a US college all-star team, then four days in Japan, where
they'll meet the Spanish and Japanese. Then it's on to Melbourne
for a final week of workouts and a final exhibition with the
Australians before the Olympic opener against China . . . Among
this year's crop of inductees to the National Wrestling Hall of
Fame is former Emerson and Harvard coach Jim Peckham, who directed
US teams in 38 major international events, including the 1976
Olympics, and also competed in the 1956 Games, where he placed
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No country club in Sydney
</P>
<P>
   How will the East Timor athletes get to compete in Sydney, even
though their country still isn't recognized by the IOC (because it
doesn't have enough sports federations). They'll go generic,
wearing plain white uniforms and marching behind the Olympic flag.
No chance that they'll hold up the parade _ we're talking maybe
four runners and boxers . . . North and South Korea won't compete
together in Sydney, but they may march together in the opening
ceremonies. Samaranch has suggested it and leaders of the countries
will discuss the idea at their upcoming summit in Pyongyang. If it
happens, the teams will parade behind the Olympic flag . . .
Sticking around for a fourth shot at Olympus is Canadian skater
Elvis Stojko, who'll still be chasing his first gold medal (after
two silvers) at 30 at Salt Lake City . . . Used to be you had to
win a gold medal to get your face on a cereal box. Five of the
eight US athletes who'll grace Kellogg's packages this summer
(Jones and Greene, swimmer Lenny Krayzelburg, diver Mark Ruiz, and
cyclist Alison Dunlap) haven't heard the anthem played for them.
Those who have are Thompson, Chow, and softball player Leah
O'Brien-Amico.

RELIGION COLUMN: A MAJOR POLITICAL SPEECH THAT WAS NEVER
DELIVERED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The death on Tuesday of Robert P. Casey, the Democratic governor
of Pennsylvania from 1987 to 1994, was a reminder that one of the
most significant speeches in the last decade of American politics
was never delivered. It was significant, in fact, precisely because
it was never delivered.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1992 Democratic National Convention, Casey asked to
present a minority report opposing the party's plank on abortion
that declared ``reproductive choice'' a ``fundamental right''
deserving government financing. The party leadership barred Casey
from addressing the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The Casey obituaries mentioned the event, but they did not fully
capture its significance. It was a watershed in the nation's
political-moral discourse. At the national level of one of the two
major political parties, opposition to abortion had become
literally unspeakable.
</P>
<P>
   This was a momentous achievement for supporters of the right to
abortion. By 1988, of course, the Democratic Party platform had
already become uncompromisingly in favor of abortion rights. Gone
was the mollifying phrase in earlier platforms that Democrats
``fully recognize the religious and ethical concerns which many
Americans have about abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   But refusing the podium to the liberal and immensely popular
Casey (he won re-election in 1990 by the largest margin in
Pennsylvania history) went a step further. As David R. Carlin Jr.,
a frustrated Democratic state senator from Rhode Island, put it in
an Op-Ed article for The New York Times in August 1992: ``The
national Democratic leadership has made it plain that there is no
room in the party for opposition to abortion. Being pro-choice is
not simply a majority opinion; it has become a mandatory
position.''
</P>
<P>
   At the local level, that is not always true, but at the national
level it remains the case eight years later. No Democrat with
pretensions to national leadership can afford not to be strictly in
favor of abortion rights. Quite a few, including Vice President Al
Gore, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., have
jettisoned their previous reservations about abortion. When
something becomes undiscussable, it is pretty much irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   For abortion foes who had already cast their fortunes with the
Republican Party, the Democrats' sidelining of Casey meant little
more than another opportunity to say, ``We told you so.'' But for
those who considered themselves liberals or dyed-in-the-wool
Democrats, the moment posed a moral dilemma that remains unresolved
even now.
</P>
<P>
   Casey was their kind of politician, and if his credentials could
not earn one a hearing for an anti-abortion case, what could? The
Philadelphia Inquirer's obituary called him ``a fervent Democrat''
and a man who ``stood solidly behind some of his party's most
enduring ideals, particularly in his concern for poor and
blue-collar citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   He strove for health insurance for all Pennsylvanians and,
failing that, gained coverage for poor children whose families
became ineligible for Medicaid. He backed labor rights and tax
breaks for the poor, improved the workers' compensation system,
increased financing for public schools, mandated trash recycling
and upgraded local sewer and water facilities.
</P>
<P>
   He even pushed through a controversial tax increase _
``despised'' was the word used for it in The Inquirer obituary _
that allowed Pennsylvania to remain fiscally strong through
recessionary days and passed on a financial surplus to his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   That successor, Gov. Tom Ridge, is facing a similar interdict on
the other side of the abortion issue. A Republican who favors
abortion rights and, like Casey, an extremely popular leader in a
crucial state for the presidential race, Ridge has been promoted as
a possible running mate for Gov. George W. Bush Bush _ to cries of
betrayal and threats of abandonment from anti-abortion Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Litmus test'' is the term for this kind of unbendable standard
about abortion among Republicans, although it can operate at least
as rigorously among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is nothing wrong with litmus tests, in morals
and politics, no less than in the laboratory. Political parties
have every right to rule some topics totally off limits. Reasonable
citizens do not complain that Holocaust deniers, champions of
totalitarianism or defenders of lynching are denied recognition and
barred from convention microphones.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Democrats opposed to abortion and
Republicans who favor abortion rights should be lumped with such
company. In an editorial calling the Republican platform
``merciless'' on abortion, also in August 1992, The New York Times
warned that ``moderate, mainstream voices'' should not be kept from
making their case at the party's convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to free expression on abortion,'' the editorial
added, ``the Republicans have no patent on manipulation. The
Democrats acted even more crudely in New York last month. They were
so devoted to freedom of choice that they buried freedom of speech,
refusing to allow Gov. Robert Casey to voice anti-abortion
sentiments at their convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing that same month as a ``pro-life Democrat'' and a
sympathizer with the ``wimpy liberalism'' that rejected the
``winner-take-all mentality'' on both sides of the abortion debate,
Carlin said: ``We have been locked out of our own house, yet we
have no desire to enter the Republican house next door. We are
political pariahs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the success of the abortion rights' movement
that, two presidential races later, Republican divisions over
abortion continue to be scrutinized while the pariah status of
people like Carlin, with all its attendant resentments and election
booth abstentions, can be largely ignored. Ridge has a real chance
for the vice-presidential slot, while Casey would get even less a
hearing today than he did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1992 another Casey speech went undelivered, this time
at Cooper Union School of Architecture in New York. Casey was to
speak in the school's Great Hall, where, in 1860, Abraham Lincoln
had challenged the Supreme Court's acceptance of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting demonstrators in favor of abortion rights, however,
kept Casey from speaking. When Nat Hentoff, stalwart civil
libertarian, maverick opponent of abortion and writer for The
Village Voice, which was sponsoring the event, admonished the
demonstrators with recollections of Stalinism and left-wing
intolerance, they could not have cared less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murderers have no right to speak,'' they shouted, referring to
the dangers of illegal abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The title of this undelivered speech was ``Can a Liberal Be
Pro-Life?'' At Cooper Union, the demonstrators' answer was a
raucous ``No.'' In the Democratic Party, the answer is less raucous
but otherwise no different.

MAN GUILTY OF EXTORTION IN O'HAIR CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ From a headless, handless corpse on a muddy
riverbank to $500,000 in stolen gold and to a stream of receipts
from fancy hotels, federal prosecutors here used an ineluctable
chain of circumstantial evidence to convict a sometime handyman on
charges relating to the disappearance of the atheist Madalyn Murray
O'Hair, her son and her granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman, Gary Paul Karr, 52, of Novi, Mich., was found
guilty Friday in U.S. District Court here of conspiracy to commit
extortion, traveling interstate to commit violent acts, money
laundering and interstate transportation of stolen property. He now
faces mandatory life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   He was acquitted of conspiracy to commit kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict came nearly five years after O'Hair disappeared in
1995 along with her son, Jon Garth Murray, and her granddaughter,
Robin Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, 76 at the time of her disappearance, drew national
attention when she made a legal challenge that led that to a 1963
Supreme Court ruling that effectively banned prayer in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, her son and her granddaughter disappeared in 1995. They
are presumed dead, but their bodies have never been found, nor has
anyone been charged in their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's lawyer, Tom Mills, said he was disappointed with the
verdict, particularly because the jury found his client not guilty
of kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the basis of their whole case,'' Mills said. ``It
seems to undermine their whole theory. We have no kidnapping and no
murder, and yet he's still facing a life sentence for these
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   During the three-week trial, prosecutors built a mountain of
circumstantial evidence against Karr, who has three prior felony
convictions. Using 66 witnesses and 325 exhibits that included
credit card receipts and telephone bills, prosecutors linked him
with two other men suspected of killing O'Hair, her son and her
granddaughter and robbing them of $500,000 in gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities charged that Karr and two friends, Danny Fry and
David Roland Waters, kidnapped O'Hair and her family in late
September 1995, extorted money from them over a monthlong period
while holding them captive in San Antonio, then killed and
dismembered them at an Austin storage locker.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, prosecutors said they believe that Karr and Waters
later killed Fry, cut off his head and hands and left his body on
the banks of the Trinity River near Dallas in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The federal authorities are still debating whether to try Karr
and Waters for murder in the death of Fry. Prosecutors have said
that they may try to strike a deal with Karr to gain his testify
against Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Karr's lawyers insisted that the
government had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. They
contended that O'Hair had been planning for some time to flee the
country to avoid a battle with the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   The defense called only four witnesses, including the Rev.
William Gordon, a Baptist minister from Georgia, who testified last
week that he saw O'Hair eating pasta in a restaurant in Romania in
1997. But Gordon could not definitively say the woman he saw was
O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors countered with O'Hair's tax lawyer, Craig Etter, who
told the court that O'Hair's tax problems had largely been worked
out by the time of her disappearance and that fleeing the country
would have been out of character for the outspoken atheist.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was Karr who was on trial, much of the testimony
focused on Waters, a former office manager for O'Hair's American
Atheist organization, whom the authorities believe masterminded the
plot. Waters was convicted of stealing $54,400 from the group in
1994 and is serving a prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence introduced by the prosecution showed that O'Hair and
her relatives had used $90,000 in credit cards and liquidated bank
accounts and that Murray bought at least $500,000 in gold coins the
month before O'Hair and her relatives disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after the disappearance, Waters and Karr went on a
spending spree, prosecutors said, spending thousands of dollars on
motorcycles, computers and expensive hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for the Internal Revenue Service began looking
into the case in 1996 after The San Antonio Express-News reported
that officials of the American Atheist organization filed forms
with the IRS, reporting that the group was missing $610,000 and
that they believed Murray had the money.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, Jeff Sloan, 43, said the prosecutors presented a
compelling case for all of the charges against Karr, but they could
not agree on the kidnapping charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't necessarily say there was no kidnapping,'' Sloan
said as he left the courthouse. ``It was something we didn't
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan said the jury could not agree on the intent element in the
kidnapping charge. Asked what he thought about the fate of O'Hair,
her son and her granddaughter, Sloan, who works for a computer
company in Austin, said he believed they were dead.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, eight men and four women, deliberated for more than
32 hours over four days before reaching their verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Karr is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 4.

REGULATORS CALL FOR RECORD FINE IN PIPELINE BLAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal regulators say Olympic Pipeline Co. should
be fined a record $3.05 million for ``unsafe and illegal''
operation of its pipeline in connection with an explosion that
killed three people, but some residents of Bellingham said that
doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three million? I figured it would be higher than that,'' said
tow truck driver Bob Howard, gazing at the still blackened creek
banks behind the building where he works. ``Look at the damage that
was done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three million is not enough,'' said Shannon Louy, who works at
a Bellingham gas station not far from where the accident occurred
nearly one year ago. ``The only way to get their attention is to
slap them in the pocket book.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle attorney David Beninger, who spoke Friday morning with
the families of two 10-year-old boys killed in the explosion, said
the money does little to ensure safer pipeline operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot of money for the average person, but it is like
a toll in the road for these companies,'' Beninger said. ``None of
that money goes to ensure greater pipeline safety or to pay for
inspectors or to create laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said they would have gone farther if possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a pattern of numerous violations that relate to key
safety areas such as design, training, emergency response,'' said
Kelley S. Coyner, administrator of the federal Department of
Transportation agency responsible for pipeline safety. ``We want to
underscore that we would have fined them more but for the caps that
are in place in our current law.''
</P>
<P>
   In justifying the fine _ which dwarfs the previous record by
$2.3 million _ federal investigators highlighted a series of
lapses, oversights and shortcuts that resulted in dangerous
operation of a pipeline carrying highly volatile gasoline through
residential Bellingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olympic conducted its operations in an unsafe manner and
violated numerous federal pipeline safety standards,'' Coyner said.
``There were sustained and multiple violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators paint a picture of a company that relied on
operators whose training was incomplete or unverified and who
failed to respond adequately when potential problems were
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Vice President Carl Gast declined comment on the penalty
because he had not had a chance to review the details of the
proposed fine. The company can challenge all or part of the
findings and Gast defended his company's actions since the rupture
and explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past several months, Olympic has worked very hard
to comply with all of the safety directives issued by the Office of
Pipeline Safety, and even now is engaged in a comprehensive
internal inspections program of its entire 400-mile network,'' he
said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the Bellingham accident is still under
investigation by another federal agency _ the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline broke June 10, 1999, spewing 229,000 gallons of
gasoline into a Bellingham park. The gasoline ignited an enormous
fireball that raced more than a mile down a creek.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the blast were Wade King and Stephen Tsiorvas, both
10, and 18-year-old Liam Wood. The 400-mile pipeline runs from
northwest Washington refineries to Portland. A 37-mile segment has
been closed since the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Bellingham city officials, many of whom have lobbied actively
for greater oversight since the accident, said the record fine
sends an important signal. ``I'm pleased to hear it,'' said Terry
Borneman, Bellingham city councilman and family friend of Stephen
Tsiorvas. ``While it doesn't go anywhere near bringing back the
lives lost due to negligence, it does help to remedy some of the
footdragging that has gone on when finding answers to questions
posed to Olympic Pipeline at neighborhood meetings and Senate
hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson said the fines were ``right on
track and appropriate under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this has indicated is that we need a change in the
federal regulations (dealing with pipeline safety),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason King, 26, the brother of Wade King, said the $3 million
penalty is a ``small step'' in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me personally it's still kind of a farce overall,'' he told
the Associated Press in a phone interview from the Bellingham car
dealership where he works with his father, Frank King. ``The fact
that a company is able to, in so many words, deny responsibility
for their own actions and try to place blame on third parties ...
and then be allowed to continue to operate is the real tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of the three victims have spent the past year
lobbying Congress and working to keep the issue of pipeline safety
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure Wade's death wasn't pointless,'' said
the Rev. John Riggs, Wade King's family priest at St. Paul's
Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators found eight violations in Olympic's
operation of the pipeline ranging from inadequate training of
control room personnel, failing to investigate structural
``anomalies,'' and not maintaining daily operating records as
required by law. Six of the eight violations carry a penalty of
$500,000 each, while the penalty attached to each of the remaining
violations was $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most alarming violations, according to federal
officials, occurred in 1994 when a local water treatment plant
installed pipes above the gas lines operated by Olympic. Excavation
is the most common cause of damage to pipelines, accounting for
more than 80 percent of structural damage. Because of that, federal
rules require that officials from the existing pipeline be onsite
to ensure that no damage is done during construction.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that well-known requirement, investigators said
documents supplied by Olympic showed that monitoring took place on
only three days during the eight months of construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appears to indicate that inspections were not done as
frequently as necessary to verify the integrity of (the)
pipeline,'' investigators said in a letter to Gast detailing the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Another violation revolved around tests Olympic conducted in
1996 and 1997 to see if there was any structural weakening in the
pipeline. The testing revealed two possible ``anomalies'' in close
proximity, including a possible thinning of the pipeline wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``These conditions, particularly when grouped together,'' the
letter to Gast said, ``are of the type that could adversely affect
the safe operation of a pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   In documents submitted to the Washington Department of Ecology,
Olympic said it intended to excavate around the area to check the
problem in May 1997. The work, however, was never done.
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline operators also violated safety rules by not
following-up when a critical ``isolation valve'' moved to the
closed position ``uncommanded'' more than 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olympic was aware of and did not investigate these abnormal
occurrences,'' the letter to Gast says.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there was no evidence to suggest that operators
noticed the problem or did anything to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellingham accident has galvanized efforts to update and
toughen federal laws governing pipeline safety. Washington's entire
congressional delegation is supporting legislation to accomplish
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the state's U.S. senators, Democrat Patty Murray and
Republican Slade Gorton, have introduced bills. Other lawmakers,
including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Fritz Hollings,
D-S.C., also have introduced measures.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bills differ, they all call for more aggressive
inspection of pipelines, tougher enforcement, higher penalties for
violations and public disclosure of pipeline routes.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rep. Jack Metcalf, a Republican whose district
includes Bellingham, has joined with two other members of the
Washington delegation, Republican Jennifer Dunn and Democrat Jay
Inslee, to introduce a pipeline safety bill.
</P>
<P>
   But prospects for passing a new law this year are bleak. The
Senate has had several hearings on the issue, but none of the bills
is scheduled to be considered by a full committee. The pace is even
slower in the House. No hearings have been held and none are
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said the lack of action has her ``worried'' and she hopes
Friday's action by the Transportation Department will jumpstart
efforts in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an important step,'' she said of the proposed fine.
``But we need to pass legislation this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Inslee echoed that sentiment. ``We can't rely on fines,'' he
said, adding that while the record fine appears large, ``I don't
think it's an untoward number. This is equivalent to several
minutes revenue for the parent company.''

   ARKANSAS: FORMER STATE SENATOR SENTENCED
</P>
<P>
   Nick Wilson, once an immensely powerful Arkansas state senator
who reigned for years over both houses of the General Assembly, was
sentenced on Thursday to 70 months in federal prison after pleading
guilty to a racketeering charge. Wilson, once known as a reformer
who occasionally clashed with Gov. Bill Clinton, was the subject of
a two-year investigation by federal prosecutors, who charged him
and nine others with stealing nearly $2 million from state
programs.
</P>
<P>
   After months of denying the allegations, he was convicted of tax
evasion by a federal jury last year, and then pleaded guilty to the
racketeering charge in March. Wilson, 58, will also have to return
the money, which was diverted from programs providing attorneys to
children in child-care disputes, among others.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA: COMPETITION FOR LUGAR
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, David Johnson, the Democrat trying to unseat
Republican Sen. Richard G. Lugar, has raised nearly $1 million,
``more money than Lugar's last two opponents combined,'' said
Johnson's campaign manager, Timothy Shock. That and Johnson's
background as a policy adviser to two governors, Evan Bayh (now an
Indiana senator), and the current governor, Frank L. O'Bannon, has
Democrats and some political analysts calling him Lugar's strongest
opponent in years. ``I feel very good about where we are,'' Shock
said. Lugar's going to have a real race this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experts believe that Johnson, who has never run for
public office before, has little chance of defeating the four-term
senator, who has raised over $4 million and has $2.3 million cash
on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lugar is very well known,'' said James McCann, a political
science professor at Purdue University. ``He's got a very good
base. He's got name recognition no one could buy. It's definitely
uphill with Johnson.'' &QL;

   Robert M. Fomon, who ran the E.F. Hutton &AMP; Co. brokerage firm
during its heyday and through the scandal that led to its takeover,
died May 31 at a hospital near his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was
75.
</P>
<P>
   Fomon, who retired as Hutton's chairman in 1987 after 35 years

   Under Fomon's leadership in the 1970s and '80s, E.F. Hutton went
public and grew rapidly into a securities firm with a household
name. For most of those years, the firm attracted customers with
one of the first and most memorable television advertising
campaigns for a brokerage firm, using the slogan ``When E.F. Hutton
talks, people listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fomon ordered those ads off the air in 1985 after the firm
shocked its customers and competitors by pleading guilty to 2,000
felony counts of fraud stemming from an elaborate scheme to earn
interest for itself on its customers' money. The Justice Department
contended that Hutton earned as much as $8 million by
systematically overdrawing its bank accounts and purposefully
delaying clearing of checks from 1980 to 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Hutton paid $2 million in criminal fines to settle the charges,
but Fomon was never implicated in the crimes. He maintained that he
had not known about the practices. In a letter to The New York
Times in December 1986, Fomon wrote that a chief executive should
be entitled to rely on his subordinates to perform competently and
faithfully. ``But that does not mean that the chief executive is
personally liable for all the actions or failures of the other
officers and managers,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Hutton's directors relieved Fomon of operating
control of the firm and handed the reins to Robert P. Rittereiser,
who succeeded Fomon as chief executive. Hutton never recovered from
the blow to its reputation. It was acquired by Shearson Lehman
Brothers in 1988 for nearly $1 billion and the Hutton name
eventually disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Fomon took a loose approach to management but fostered a
camaraderie that endured, Thomas said. Last month, about 200 former
Hutton employees, including Fomon, gathered for a reunion at
Chelsea Piers in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago native who grew up in Appleton, Wis., as the child of
two doctors, Fomon spent his entire career working at Hutton. He
began in the firm's Los Angeles office in 1951, after graduating
from the University of Southern California, and learned various
aspects of the securities business, even some that Hutton had
traditionally avoided, such as investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   His successful management of the firm's emerging corporate
finance department attracted the attention of the firm's senior
management in 1970 when three executives were locked in a stalemate
over who should get the chief executive's job. Fomon said at the
time that even he was surprised when he was tapped to move to New
York and run the entire firm.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 15 years, the feisty Fomon occasionally exchanged
harsh words with the head of other major brokerage firms, including
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. When Merrill accused Hutton of stealing its
brokers and raiding its customers, Fomon shot back, ``If they can't
hold their employees that's their problem; if they were running
their business well, there's no way we could hire their
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Fomon held various positions in the securities industry during
his career. He was a governor of the New York Stock Exchange,
chairman of the board of governors of the Pacific Stock Exchange
and a member of the National Market Advisory Board to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   He served on the advisory board of the University of Southern
California Graduate School of Business Administration, which gave
him its Alumni Award for Business Excellence. He was also a trustee
of Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College and a member
of the advisory board of the University of California at Los
Angeles Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Fomon is survived by his third wife, the former Daphne Lewis
Ashley, of Palm Beach; a daughter, Anne Q. Fomon, of La Jolla,
Calif.; a son, Robert Q. Fomon, of New York; a brother, Dr. Samuel
J. Fomon, of New Braunfels, Texas; two wives from previous
marriages, Marilyn Quaintance Fomon of Los Angeles, and Sharon
Mullin, of Los Angeles; and three grandchildren.

BRITISH WRITER DISTILLS GREAT PHILOSOPHERS INTO ENGAGING ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Suppose you were a writer whose book received an
unfavorable review. Your response _ depending on your temperament _
might be to indulge in a paroxysm of self-loathing or to retreat to
your cave of self-righteousness, railing at the reviewer's
incompetence and mean spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Alain de Botton, the author of ``The Consolations of
Philosophy,'' has a third suggestion. What you should do, he says,
is take a deep breath, sweep aside your emotions and apply the
eminently sensible reasoning of the Roman philosopher Seneca, a
great expositor of Stoicism and a first-hand student of the hand of
fate. Among other things, Seneca was forced to abandon his house
and all his worldly goods and sent to live by himself in exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``One element of Stoicism is to think that you can survive, that
what is essential for life is a lot less than you might think it
is,'' de Botton explained in a recent interview, as he
absent-mindedly nibbled on a tuna sandwich. Tall, thin and
delicate-looking, he presented a poised and thoughtful figure, his
air of slight melancholy at war, perhaps, with his constant
undercurrent of amusement.
</P>
<P>
   If you can use Seneca to cope with anger and disappointment, the
30-year-old de Botton argues in his book, there's no reason you
can't turn to Socrates when you're discouraged by your
unpopularity. Or to Montaigne to keep from feeling horrified by
your physical appearance. Or to Epicurus to liberate yourself from
feeling sad that you don't have more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different philosophers for different times,'' said
de Botton, whose book examines six of them. ``There are moments
when Nietzsche's heroic stance, bombastic and rather hysterical, is
very nice. There are times when Montaigne's more gentle and
accepting side seems relevant. To spend some time in the company of
a philosopher like Montaigne is very pleasant, even if you don't
become a committed Montaigne-ian.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain has had plenty of opportunity lately to take in de
Botton's message. A best seller here, the book was made into a
television series, one show per philosopher, with the author
describing and illustrating his points about each one. When de
Botton, who is sometimes called ``Dr. Love'' because of his three
novels with love themes and his philosophical advice to the
lovelorn, went to Manchester for the series, he told a shop-aholic
whose life was being ruined by his addiction that he might find
solace in the teachings of Epicurus. In London, he told a delivery
man prone to terrible spasms of road rage how he might calm down by
reading Seneca instead of The Sun, the popular tabloid newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   And when de Botton visited the home of an attractive young woman
whose boyfriend had just left her, de Botton, in the midst of
applying the lessons of Schopenhauer _ who, he writes, may be among
the finest philosophers for the griefs of love _ found himself
asking the heart-broken subject out to dinner. They are now dating.
</P>
<P>
   De Botton's book is only slightly less quirky than his approach
to television. In elegant essays that filter interesting
biographical data about the philosophers through the prism of his
playful mind _ Schopenhauer's closest relationships, we learn, were
with a series of poodles _ de Botton urges his readers to return to
what he sees as the ancient purpose of philosophy: teaching people
how to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to write a book that would rescue a certain totally
neglected tradition in philosophy, which is the pursuit of
wisdom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Consolations of Philosophy'' is written in an easygoing,
accessible style and filled with whimsical illustrations that help
make its points. But it is by no means a survey of philosophy in
the manner, say, of the phenomenally popular novel ``Sophie's
World'' by Jostein Gaarder. De Botton says he wanted to write in an
engaging, persuasive way because he is easily bored when he reads,
and he assumes others are, too. But it is his breezy approach, as
much as anything else, that has unsettled some serious students of
philosophy. Reviewing the book in The Observer of London, Peter
Conrad said it ``wickedly veers between sagacity and silliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, de Botton suggests, they have misunderstood his intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't written an introduction to philosophy or the
complete guide to any of these philosophers,'' he said. ``What I've
really done is simply written six essays looking at six different
aspects of their thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also trying to do a tricky thing which annoys some people.
I'm not surrendering my claim to be accurate, to get all the facts
right, to be quite scholarly. But at the same time I don't want to
write in a scholarly way at all. I'm being rather brazen about this
and standing up against the opposition, because it's my deepest
belief that you can be at once serious and yet easy to read and
playful. And however much I may fail in that attempt, I believe in
that as a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an approach that he used with much success in his three
novels and, most notably in his last book, ``How Proust Can Change
Your Life,'' a funny, robust and joyous argument for negotiating
the daunting thickets of ``Remembrance of Things Past.'' At first
overlooked in Britain, de Botton's book leapt into public
consciousness and then on to best-seller lists on both sides of the
Atlantic when John Updike raved about it in The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``His curious, humorous, didactic and dazzling book bears the
subtitle `Not a Novel,''' Updike said in the review. ``It contains,
however, more human interest and play of fancy than most fiction.''

</P>
<P>
   De Botton is not a French aristocrat, though that is what
Britons generally assume when they hear his name, which is
pronounced in the French manner, and see his picture. He comes from
a rich family _ his father is a successful financier _ but one that
has always emphasized achievement above anything else, and de
Botton has had to make his own way in the world. The family name
was originally Spanish, but his father was born into a small,
thriving community of Jews in Cairo. His mother comes from
Switzerland, which is where de Botton spent his early years.
</P>
<P>
   De Botton was sent to Harrow, a top-notch boys' boarding school
in Britain, at the age of 8, and had to learn not only English, but
also how to thrive in a place that glorified athletes, something he
is not. He did it by being clever, he said, and by agreeing to do
other boys' homework for them.
</P>
<P>
   After Cambridge University, from which he graduated with a
double-starred first, roughly the equivalent to summa cum laude, de
Botton drifted into academia, looking to acquire a Ph.D., first at
Harvard and then at King's College London. He dropped out of both.
``I was very confused,'' he said. ``I wanted to pursue the history
of ideas, but I found myself not sitting comfortably in any one
discipline. I didn't want to be a philosopher and didn't want to be
a historian, and I got quite depressed by the whole thing. I
thought, `Oh, God, maybe I won't get a job at the end and it will
all be quite miserable.'''
</P>
<P>
   But de Botton said he took a cue from Nietzsche, which is,
according to de Botton: Don't panic about panicking, life is
difficult, and angst is a normal human response.
</P>
<P>
   Unfailingly charming and, one suspects, unlikely to lose his
temper, de Botton has nonetheless had his share of sleepless nights
and crippling self-doubt. He describes his 20s as an anxious time
and says that for him, reading great thinkers is nothing but a
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make myself sound obsessive in this area, but
I've always looked to figures from literature or history as sources
of interesting ideas on how to live,'' he said. ``People come up
with all sorts of responses about what to do about anxiety, and one
of them is the quest for knowledge. I intellectualize things.
That's my way of dealing with anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   But, de Botton said, he is only human. Before he
intellectualizes, he frets, rages and sometimes wallows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seneca would say that one can't help but have emotions,'' he
said. ``Philosophy is for an hour later.''

HORACE BUSBY, 76, AIDE AND ADVISER TO LBJ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horace Busby Jr., a former White House aide and longtime
associate of former President Lyndon B. Johnson, died May 31 at St.
John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 76 and lived in
Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was respiratory failure, said his son, Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Busby, a fellow Texan known as Buzz, served President Johnson
as, among other things, a speechwriter and an idea man. He was an
important aide to Johnson in various phases of his political
career.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson became president in 1963 after John F. Kennedy was
slain in Dallas, he appointed Busby a special assistant. Busby had
been running a management consulting firm in Austin, Texas, and
Washington that specialized in economic research.
</P>
<P>
   Busby served as the liaison between the executive departments
and the White House. He also was a deputy to McGeorge Bundy, then
special presidential assistant for national security affairs.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Busby agreed to remain on the president's staff only
through the election of November 1964, when Johnson defeated his
opponent, Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson persuaded Busby to stay a few months longer, but he
resigned in September 1965, and returned to private life.
</P>
<P>
   As Busby left public service, he received a letter from Johnson
that said: ``As a counselor, you have been wise. As an
administrator, you have been unsparing toward yourself. As a
friend, you have been, and you are, a never-failing source of
strength to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the end of Busby's work for Johnson. In 1988,
James R. Jones, who was the president's chief of staff in 1968,
recalled that early in that year Johnson told him to put Busby back
to work on an ``I will not run'' peroration in which the president,
whose escalation of the Vietnam War led to student unrest and a
bitterly divided nation, would disclose that he would not seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Busby had been assigned to write such a passage for
another Johnson speech, but the president changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, 1968, however, at the end of a nationally televised
speech in which he announced the cessation of bombing north of the
21st parallel in Vietnam, Johnson made his surprise statement that
he would not run again.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson died in San Antonio on Jan. 22, 1973, at the age of 64.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when a book about Johnson, ``Means of Ascent'' by
Robert A. Caro, provided new evidence that Johnson had stolen his
election to the U.S. Senate in 1948, Busby, who had been an aide in
Johnson's senatorial campaign, said: ``I don't disagree with the
accuracy of anything Bob has in there,'' but added, ``There was a
lot of stealing in that election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The irregularity in the voting was caused in most instances by
the local races,'' added Busby, who was a political analyst in
1990. ``It was just incidental that there were also votes stolen
for Johnson'' and for the losing candidate, Coke Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   Horace Wooten Busby Jr. was born in Fort Worth, attended the
University of Texas at Austin and was a liberal editor of the
student newspaper. He was employed for a while as a wire-service
journalist before beginning his first stint as a Johnson aide in
1946.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to the former Mary Alves ended in divorce. Besides
his son, Scott, of Los Angeles, Busby is survived by two daughters,
Leslie Busby, who lives in Italy, and Betsy Busby of Encinitas,
Calif. He is also survived by a grandchild and a sister.

legal fight here has often been cast as the most excruciating of

 &HT;    Defender of the famous defends himself
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ F. Lee Bailey, cast in dual roles as defendant
and star witness, wept as he recounted the deaths of his wife and
mother, then went on to spin a tale of double-dealing, backstabbing
and money-grubbing among big-time drug dealers, big-fee attorneys
and government lawyers eager to claim credit for a big case.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's two days on the witness stand Thursday and Friday were
a bravura performance, perhaps the most important of his 40-year
career. Bailey, who lives in Manalapan and practices in West Palm
Beach, is fighting for his career, which the Florida Bar is trying
to end through this disbarment trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he dropped nuggets of insider legal gossip that
widened the eyes of courtroom spectators_mostly retirees who left
the golf course and ``Judge Judy `` to watch the real thing_such as
a casual mention that former client O.J. Simpson did so poorly on a
lie-detector test before his murder trial that Bailey's co-counsel,
Robert Shapiro, stopped the test and grabbed the polygraph charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read them, but nobody else ever has,'' Bailey said,
``because he says now he doesn't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier County Circuit Judge Cynthia Ellis, who is conducting
the trial, will make her recommendation to the state Supreme Court
after the trial ends next week. If Florida were to disbar Bailey,
he would automatically be disbarred in Massachusetts, where he's
also licensed, as well as in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, this is serious,'' said Don Beverly, the
West Palm Beach attorney representing Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Bar says Bailey committed seven ethics violations in his
handling of millions of dollars in stock and properties once
belonging to a client, international drug-smuggler Claude Duboc.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey spent several months of 1994 flying back and forth to
Europe, working out a complicated deal with the U.S. government for
Duboc to turn over $100 million in cash, stock and property in
exchange for the possibility of a lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the deal fell apart and Duboc wound up in prison for
life with no hope of parole. Bailey wound up in jail himself for 44
days. He was out of money, in debt and facing career extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the disbarment case is 607,000 shares of stock in
BioChem Pharma, a Canadian pharmaceutical company headed by a
friend of Duboc's. Bailey says the government agreed to let him
have the stock free and clear for his fees and expenses, but
reneged when the stock's value skyrocketed from $6 to $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration connected Duboc to six
different multi-ton seizures of hashish and marijuana in San
Francisco and Canada, an operation that Bailey says earned the
smugglers $600 million. The money was laundered through shell
corporations in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Duboc spent part of the loot on a $25 million pleasure palace in
France, ``built in the spirit of Errol Flynn,'' in Bailey's words,
and featuring cameras in every bedroom. He also had a ranch in
Hawaii, an 80-foot yacht, a slip in Cannes, and a fleet of
Porsches, Jaguars and Mercedeses.
</P>
<P>
   After Shapiro called him into the case, Bailey said he met with
federal prosecutors to see what they had on Duboc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat around a broken desk and postured with each other,'' he
said. ``They convinced me they had a strong case.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey persuaded Duboc that the only hope he had of getting a
sentence that amounted to less than life _ Duboc was in his 50s _
was to provide ``extraordinary'' cooperation. That meant giving up
all his assets and not keeping anything back. That was the carrot
he dangled in front of the prosecutors, Bailey said, and they took
it.
</P>
<P>
   They took it so totally, he said, that they offered not to touch
$3.5 million in cash in a Luxembourg bank so that Duboc could
transfer it to Bailey for his legal fees and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no conditions whatever attached to the $3.5
million,'' Bailey testified vehemently. ``That was mine.'' And the
government wanted the transfer kept quiet, he said, because lawyers
for a co-defendant of Duboc's might want a similar deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the government's request, this case was 'papered' as little
as possible,'' he said. ``They wanted the matter of fees kept out
of documents, and I trusted them, a fact for which I am terribly
sorry to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Duboc proposed that Bailey take the BioChem Pharma stock,
worth about $6 million, to keep it from being dumped on the market
and depressing the value. The government agreed that he could take
the stock instead of the $3.5 million, Bailey said, and warned him
that if the stock went down, he would get no other money.
</P>
<P>
   Duboc signed the stock over to him, it went into his Swiss bank
account, and he took a $1.5 million loan against it to pay his
expenses and legal fees while he tried to dispose of the other
properties for the government, Bailey said. He also sold a third of
it to repay that line of credit when needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government took no interest in the stock until January 1995,
when it suddenly shot up in value, Bailey testified. With the value
at nearly $18 million, the government claimed Bailey was only
holding the stock ``in trust.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Ocala agreed with the government and gave
Bailey three weeks to give up the stock or go to jail. Bailey went
to jail and ultimately raised the money to repay $2.3 million in
loans he'd taken against the stock by mortgaging his house and his
74-foot yacht.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Duboc had fouled up the deal by trying to hide
some of his money from the prosecutors, and Bailey had fallen out
with not only the government but also both co-counsels: Shapiro
over power struggles in the Simpson trial and prominent Miami
lawyer Ed Shohat, who Bailey said had given Duboc bad advice and
had tried to get control of $700,000 in Japanese stock that Duboc
owned.
</P>
<P>
   Both Shohat and Shapiro testified against Bailey, supporting the
government's position that all Duboc's assets were to be forfeited.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey told Bar attorney David Ristoff on Friday that he has
turned up evidence to corroborate his claim that prosecutors never
mentioned holding the stock ``in trust'' in negotiating meetings.
He said he intends to introduce the evidence _ notes made by one of
the government lawyers _ next week.
</P>
<P>
   During Ristoff's cross examination, Bailey stopped and asked for
water and pain medication for his bandaged left hand. He said he
had surgery on the hand in April for a condition that causes
tendons in the palm to draw down the fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been getting much sleep at night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's celebrity drawing power filled seats in the Collier
County courtroom, bringing several active and retired lawyers to
watch the defender of the famous defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   John Greer, a retired practitioner from Iowa, was untouched by
Bailey's tearful references to the death of his wife, Patricia,
last year from pancreatic cancer and of his 90-year-old mother in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as phony as a $7 bill,'' he said, waving a hand
dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ludwig and Dennis Harrington, semi-retired lawyers from
Pittsburg, just smiled when asked to evaluate Bailey's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a consummate witness,'' Ludwig said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Knicks' season ended with Patrick Ewing
sitting slumped on the bench with his thoughts to himself. There
was disbelief in his stare. It was over. He had played through his
pain, pushed himself for his team, but it was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Missing six of his last nine shots, Ewing struggled toward the
end of what might have been his last, best chance at a championship
as the Indiana Pacers eliminated the Knicks at Madison Square
Garden Friday night, 93-80. The Pacers won Game 6, and took the
Eastern Conference finals, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell scored 32 points, and Allan Houston faded away
in the second half and contributed just 10. Larry Johnson did not
have any 4-point miracles in his holster, and scored just seven
points. The Pacers were led by Reggie Miller's 34 points, 17 of
which came in the fourth quarter, and Dale Davis' 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Knicks could not re-create the same magical trip
to the NBA finals they went on last year. They could not muster the
same kind of desperate energy that propelled them last year when
Ewing was injured. Although there were so many reasons the Knicks
could not hold off the Pacers, all failures are usually traced to
Ewing. The numbers will show the Knicks won without him, and could
not find victory with him against Indiana. But it may be simpler
than that. Friday night the Pacers looked hungry and more resolved
to put their Knicks demons away.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had that look in his eyes. And there was no defense
against Indiana's wispy 3-point wonder. Miller scored most of his
points in the second half. He sank the Knicks' spirits time after
time.
</P>
<P>
   After the Knicks made up a nine-point halftime deficit on the
energy of Sprewell and the post presence of Ewing, the game was
tied after three quarters. But the Pacers quickly took over the
lead after Miller curled around screens, took his place on the
perimeter and came away with two 3-pointers in two minutes. The
Knicks were down, 72-69, with 8 minutes 45 seconds left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Three straight 3-point misses by Austin Croshere gave the Knicks
a chance to get back in the game. But they failed to take advantage
of the situation. After another 3-pointer by Miller off a pump-fake
of Sprewell, plus two free throws by the spindly guard, the Pacers
held a nine-point lead with four minutes to go. The deficit was 10
points with three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks entered this game with confidence _ made glaringly
apparent by the pre-game guarantees of Ewing and Chris Childs _ but
they also arrived with a lot of excuses if they fell.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, the Knicks harped about how injuries had limited
their effectiveness while others whispered familiar criticisms
about Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadows, some mumbled about how Ewing clogged the lane,
how he slowed the team and how the five playoff games they had won
without him against the Pacers this year and last season were no
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was the only Knick bold enough to actually voice how
unsure he was about whether the team was better with or without
Ewing. ``The numbers don't lie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes to the fragileness of how we handle it,'' coach
Jeff Van Gundy said. ``The Patrick thing, the only way he can win
in this series is to win. That's all we have to worry about. Just
win, because if we win it's all a moot point. If we lose, then it's
going to be his fault and my fault for playing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was unfazed by the inspection of his every move. He came
out, started with a couple of jumpers and helped the Knicks keep up
with a quick start by a Pacers team that started with one strategy
in mind: drive the lane. That aggressiveness spilled over into
their rebounding. The Pacers built a 50-41 halftime lead mostly on
their 22-17 rebounding edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were the team scrambling, the ones playing with more
desperation. The Knicks slipped into the locker room at halftime
and came out with the same attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell delivered the jolt to the Pacers. Whether Ewing was
coming along on the ride or not, he was going to push it and take
over the third quarter. Twice, he pulled up on the break and hit
jumpers in the lane, followed by a hook shot in the lane over a
reeling Jalen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   When the time was right, the ball went into Ewing. With 8:17
left in the third, he connected on a 3-point play on the
overmatched Rik Smits to tie the score, 52-52. The Pacers missed
five shots in a row before Miller hit a 3-pointer over Houston in
transition to give Indiana back the lead with just over six minutes
left.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three minutes, both teams played intense defense.
Ewing came up with a blocked shot, Charlie Ward pulled off a steal
and the Knicks forced the Pacers into a 24-second violation with
2:53 left in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Davis, forced to play
Ewing because of Smits' foul trouble, poked the ball away from his
man. And the Pacers cooled off Sprewell by collapsing on him. With
3:17 remaining in the third, the Pacers held a 57-56 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing continued to pick on Davis until it paid off. Ewing missed
a layup, but sneaked in for a rebound and picked up a foul with
2:41 on the clock. He hit both free throws to give the Knicks the
lead since the opening three minutes of the game. But the Pacers
absorbed that blow and, after a 3-pointer by Miller, the game was
tied at 62-62 entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Knicks were rebounding. They were also keeping tabs
of Travis Best much better than they did in Game 5. The point guard
tandem of Ward and Childs was holding up against Best and Mark
Jackson. Only when Childs and Ward found foul trouble in the first
half did Van Gundy dip into the big backcourt lineup for a total of
four minutes. It was not successful. Both times the Pacers scored
and forced turnovers.

STATE SENATOR IS SAND IN THE GEARS OF TEXAS' DEATH ROW EXPRESS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Eleven years ago, when a plane carrying Rep.
Mickey Leland of Texas on a hunger relief mission crashed in
Ethiopia, Rodney Ellis, a young Democratic councilman in Houston,
was grief stricken and shaken.
</P>
<P>
   He had not only lost his mentor, but he was supposed to have
been on that plane and had even fumed at Leland for bumping him
from the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Urged by Leland's widow to run for his seat in Congress, Ellis
gave it some thought before deciding instead to seek the state
Senate seat that Leland had once held.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since then, Ellis has become perhaps the leading
political force behind the decidedly unpopular efforts in Texas to
slow the state's speedy executions and erase what he said are the
inequities that often keep black, Hispanic and indigent defendants
from a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem an unusual role for a man who, like almost every
influential Texas politician, said that he supports the death
penalty. But Ellis' deep reservations about the system, and his
occasional clashes with Gov. George W. Bush, earned him the
spotlight this week.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush's campaigning in California and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a
Republican, in Europe, Ellis, as the Senate president pro tem,
became the acting governor and was left to decide whether to grant
a reprieve for convicted murderer Ricky McGinn. Bush announced on
Thursday in Sacramento, Calif., that he had recommended a 30-day
reprieve, which Ellis had accepted.
</P>
<P>
   But actually, Ellis had mostly made up his mind five days
earlier, having conferred with his staff and read an order by a
state judge imploring an appeals court to postpone the execution to
allow DNA tests; defense lawyers said the tests might exonerate
McGinn of raping his 12-year-old stepdaughter. McGinn was convicted
of murdering the girl, but prosecutors could not have asked for a
death sentence without also getting the rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said that the case kept him awake until 3 a.m. Monday
night, thinking, ``What if I disagree with Governor Bush? How would
we resolve that?'' His wife told him to call Bush's aides first
thing on Tuesday, which he did, so Bush would have the chance to
return to Texas to make sure the execution was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   But to his surprise, Ellis said, Bush's aides said they were
already seriously considering a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   To Ellis, a 46-year-old Democrat, McGinn's case highlights only
some of the state's criminal justice problems: Ellis said it is
outrageous that there was no process allowing the new DNA tests to
be conducted, as the state's highest criminal appeals court,
without explanation, refused to postpone the execution.
</P>
<P>
   In the Legislature, Ellis has advocated banning executions of
the mentally retarded; giving juries the option of sentencing
murderers to life without parole, thus making it easier for jurors
to forego the death penalty; and putting control of court-appointed
lawyers in the hands of county governments, not the local judges
who, Ellis said, often favor lawyers who speed cases along instead
of fighting tooth-and-nail for their client.
</P>
<P>
   That last proposal was vetoed by Bush because, Ellis said,
judges worried that it took away a piece of their patronage. Bush
said that power should be left to judges because they were better
qualified to select lawyers for defendants who need them.
</P>
<P>
   Texas courts are essentially a system of judicial apartheid,
Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus tends to be on the law-and-order, lock-them-up,
throw-away- of-the-key stuff, and a refusal to look at the
inequities of the system,'' he said. ``Part of the problem is that
our governor and a number of my conservative colleagues somehow
have the view that if you show compassion, you can be perceived as
weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, maintains that all 131 inmates executed
while he has been governor were unquestionably guilty of murder and
had had appropriate access to the courts. And few legislators share
Ellis' view.
</P>
<P>
   ``People commit crimes because of bad values, not because of
their race or status,'' said state Sen. David Sibley, a Waco
Republican and Bush ally.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ellis may not be in sympathy with legislative leaders on
some things, he has still been quite effective on many issues,
including indigent health care and voter registration. He has
earned a place among the elite of the state's Senate, a place
where, Texas Monthly once said, ``toughness is good, shrillness and
criticism are not, and humor is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to put together coalitions,'' Sibley said, before
adding: ``I don't think he's one that says half a loaf is better
than none. He says, `I'll take half a loaf now, and come back for
the rest later.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley and Ellis have already discussed legislation that would
make it easier for prisoners to obtain post-trial DNA testing that
might prove exculpatory. Without commenting on specifics, Sibley
said such legislation might stand a chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis already has some specifics in mind: Giving inmates the
right to get DNA testing of evidence from their case, requiring
that biological evidence be preserved, setting up a commission to
review and investigate cases of possible wrongful convictions, and
providing more compensation to people wrongfully imprisoned and
later exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, the son of a yardman, grew up in Houston, attended
college at Texas Southern University, and earned a law degree and a
master's degree in public affairs at the University of Texas in
Austin. After serving as Leland's chief of staff, he was elected to
the Houston City Council at the age of 29. He now works in the
Houston office of a New Orleans law firm, and is married with three
children.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush and Perry both expected to travel out of state at
times later this year, the final approval for executions could fall
to Ellis again. One inmate scheduled to die soon, Gary Graham, has
drawn a lot of support from those who insist he is innocent. What
would Ellis do if that case were left up to him? Not sure yet, he
said, ``but if I were a guessing man, I would guess the governor or
lieutenant governor will be in town.''

 DOT-COM WORKERS TAKE LAYOFFS IN STRIDE  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's been a tumultuous week for Paul Angeli.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26, the Fremont, Calif., resident went to his job as an
executive producer at Emeryville, Calif.'s Petstore.com and found
out he was being laid off _ the second time he has worked for a
dot-com that has axed staff. On Wednesday, he submitted his
graduate thesis, and Friday he signed up at the Fremont
unemployment office.
</P>
<P>
   But Angeli isn't a bit disheartened. After his Java programming
final Monday, he'll start hustling to form his own business _ on
the Internet, the same job market where he's already experienced
two rounds of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take that chance on myself,'' he said. ``The
Internet industry is just getting started. I'm inspired to stick
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Angeli is among a wave of dot-com workers who have been
deep-sixed recently as their employers confront financial reality.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike layoffs in the 1980s and '90s among steelworkers,
autoworkers and IBM blue suits, the current belt-tightening does
not forecast an economic slump, experts say. It simply means that
Internet companies have started ``running more reasonable
businesses, operating like they're trying to reach profitability,
instead of throwing around money like it's going out of style,''
said Rebecca Nidositko, a senior analyst with the Yankee Group in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``These layoffs aren't symptomatic of bad international trade or
plant closings,'' said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for
Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto, Calif.
``The market is sorting out which companies have the better
products or services. In any major niche, if you get several
companies trying to do the same thing, not all will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, at least 25 Internet companies _ many
with deep pockets and corporate backing _ have downsized, some into
oblivion. And the trend seems widespread in the Bay Area, where
Petstore.com, ThirdAge Media, TurboLinux, LinuxCare and BabyCenter
have all handed out pink slips in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   New Emphasis on Profits
</P>
<P>
   The downsized firms are e-tailers that sell pet supplies, toys
or other goods online; portals that try to be a favored cyberspace
destination; and companies supporting the Linux operating system.
The cutbacks show these firms' dawning awareness of a sterner
climate on Wall Street and among venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has fundamentally changed. Companies will have to
demonstrate profitability over the next 12 to 18 months or it will
be very difficult for them to be funded,'' said Jim Barnett, chief
executive of San Francisco's ThirdAge Media. After deciding it
needed a tighter focus, the baby-boomer portal this week shed about
35 people _ a quarter of its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of the downsizing dot-coms are small to begin with,
the numbers of workers laid off are small, too: perhaps a couple of
thousand people nationwide. By comparison, when Coca-Cola
restructured in January, it laid off 6,000 employees, a fifth of
its workforce.
</P>
<P>
   All the dot-com workers who've lost their jobs this year would
just fill a third of the bleacher seats at Pac Bell Park _ assuming
you could get them to assemble for a ballgame. Most are already
busy interviewing and fending off new job offers.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of Jobs Available
</P>
<P>
   Take Sherry Miller, who was an executive producer at
Petstore.com until May 26. She already has taken a consulting gig
while she mulls several offers. ``Everyone who worked with me who
got laid off can get another job in a week,'' she said. Wherever
she ends up, Miller said, she will miss the camaraderie at
Petstore, where employees routinely brought their dogs, rats,
snakes and other animal companions to work.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the overall U.S. economy slowed this month, the
nation _ and especially the computer sector _ continue to
experience unprecedented growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that adds 30,000 jobs a year in California
and a couple of hundred thousand jobs a year nationwide,'' Levy
said, adding that the layoffs ``don't represent an industry
downturn. E-tailing is growing by any set of statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Commerce Department this week released a report on
first-quarter e-tail sales that showed the sector growing. U.S.
retail sales over the Internet totaled $5.26 billion for January
through March, up from $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 1999.
While the increase sounds small, most retailers experience a
first-quarter dip after the frenetic holiday spending.
</P>
<P>
   Still, e-tail is a tiny fraction compared to the overall market:
Online sales were just 0.7 percent of total first-quarter sales. In
some markets, e-tail is a stronger force. A separate report this
week from market-research firm NPD Group showed that online
book-buying accounted for 5.4 percent of book sales in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Initial Shock
</P>
<P>
   The vibrant economy means that a layoff is an inconvenience,
rather than a life-shattering event. Still, employees may have a
visceral reaction to getting the heave-ho.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked with a dot-com (that was downsized) where people
would tell you in one breath they could get five jobs in Silicon
Valley, and in the next they'd sound like someone from a
one-factory town, as if, if they lose this job, they'll lose
everything,'' said Mitch Marks, an organizational psychologist who
works with firms in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who could give away their Porsches instead of
selling them. Despite objectively knowing that you're wealthy, that
you could find multiple jobs, psychologically, it's still a shock
when you lose your job involuntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a big surprise for Francine Schwartz when
Healthshop.com, a San Francisco purveyor of natural-health
products, fired her and 60 colleagues in April, effectively closing
the firm's e-tail activities. ``The handwriting was on the wall,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Blessing in Disguise
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it ended up being a blessing in disguise,'' the
Novato, Calif., resident said. ``I ended up finding a job in Marin
(Marin County, Calif.) _ a more interesting position and a shorter
commute.'' She's now a senior writer for IC Planet, a site that

   Job hunters who have weathered an Internet firm meltdown may end
up having an advantage, Schwartz said. ``In the job market, people
are quite appreciative of the fact that you've come from a dot-com
that didn't work because they figure you'll be able to set up red
flags for them about things you've seen before that didn't work.
It's an added skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Angeli, who has been both working and going to school full-time
for the past two years, is looking forward to getting reacquainted
with his wife, he said. He hopes to leverage his passion for
children's education and his new master's in multimedia _ for his
thesis he created a 3-D virtual world populated with intelligent
agents _ into a business that ``bridges the gap between kids and
the Net for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after what he calls ``the whole dot-com paranormal
experience,'' he's a true believer in the power of the Internet to
revolutionize the world, he said.

 NASA LOOKS TO UPDATE ITS IMAGES  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Seeking to put the entrepreneurial energy as
well as the financial muscle of Silicon Valley behind the space
program, NASA on Friday launched a new ``multimedia partnership''
with a Bay Area startup called Dreamtime Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, Dreamtime will develop and distribute
new multimedia products and programming based on the space agency's
vast archives of images, sound, video and film and on new programs
like the International Space Station, a joint effort of the United
States, Russia and 14 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Dreamtime, backed by undisclosed equity partners,
will invest more than $100 million to equip the space station,
shuttles and ground facilities with high-definition television
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the seven-year agreement, Dreamtime has committed to
converting the agency's archives into a multimedia database. It
will have its headquarters at NASA's Ames Research Center in
Mountain View, Calif., and additional facilities at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston and the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the material, including everything available to the
public today, will remain freely accessible, but the company will
have the right to sell high-resolution versions, according to
Dreamtime co-founder and CEO Bill Foster. Both Foster and his
co-founder and chief operating officer, Carleton Ruthling,
previously worked at ExciteAtHome, the Redwood City, Calif.,
Internet portal developer and high-speed service provider.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to marketing images and clips from the NASA
archives, Dreamtime plans to create a space-oriented site on the
Web. The company will also develop TV programming and documentary
films about the space program.
</P>
<P>
   Foster pledged that Dreamtime will give 5 percent of its equity
to a foundation that will in turn make donations to nonprofit
organizations. Just what that stake will be worth won't be known
until the company goes public, which Ruthling estimates could occur
in about two years.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamtime won out over 11 other companies that were vying for
the partnership. NASA began soliciting bidders for the role in
December in response to the 1998 Commercial Space Act, in which
Congress declared commercial utilization one of the primary goals
of the space station program.
</P>
<P>
   NASA yesterday brought a parade of luminaries, including its
administrator, Daniel Goldin, two assistant administrators and two
former astronauts, to endorse the deal at an elaborate news
conference at the Ames center.
</P>
<P>
   The event was presided over by Nancy Conrad, who is a member of
Dreamtime's board and the widow of astronaut Pete Conrad.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting also included several quick-cut video presentations
on the history of the space program, plus a phone call from
``Titanic'' director James Cameron and a speech by Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, R-Huntington Beach (Orange County) and chairman of the
House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
   Rohrabacher called the new partnership plan ``an idea that
couldn't have come out of the government bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been happy if they'd just painted a shuttle fuel
tank into a Coke bottle or something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said the Dreamtime deal and other efforts to
commercialize low-Earth-orbit programs like the space station
project would enable the agency to focus more resources on
returning to the moon, then moving on to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   He said three hours of toasts with the Dreamtime team in a Palo
Alto, Calif., restaurant on Thursday evening had convinced him
``we're not dealing with a government bureaucracy here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the event wasn't completely free of
bureaucratic elements. Reporters were handed copies of a 49-page
agreement between the agency and Dreamtime, complete with six
annexes and certain passages blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning: The agreement binds the two
parties to negotiate ``an approved, detailed arrangement for
financial remuneration to NASA'' within 90 days.

GIULIANI EASES TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO LAZIO

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has come up with a plan that
his aides say will make it easier for the contributors to his
now-defunct campaign for the U.S. Senate to give their money to the
new Republican candidate, Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign will send cashier's checks to the
contributors, along with a letter from the mayor urging them to
endorse the checks over to Lazio's campaign. A stamped envelope
addressed to Lazio's campaign headquarters will be included in the
mailing, to make things even easier.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions in question amount to just under $3 million.
Bruce Teitelbaum, who managed Giuliani's campaign, said that no
decision had been made about how Giuliani would dispose of another
$3 million or so, out of $20 million raised, that will remain in
the campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Lazio, said, ``They're doing
everything they can to help, and we're very appreciative.''

NETS OWNER SAYS THORN PERFECT FOR TEAM PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The last two weeks have been wondrous
for Lewis Katz, the principal owner of the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   First, Katz said received a last-minute phone call from his son,
Drew, encouraging him to change his mind about not attending the
NBA draft lottery and sitting on the dais. And sure enough, with
Katz representing them, the Nets received the first pick, defying
the off of 4 in 100.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Monday, Katz said he received a call from Rod Thorn,
the league's executive vice president of basketball operations.
Thorn, who Katz had attempted to woo into the organization last
summer, asked if the Nets had decided on a president. If they had
not, Thorn said, he wanted the job.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Thorn was announced as the Nets' president, reportedly
receiving about $12.5 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, still excited about the No. 1 pick, is floating. He said
he believes he has the best possible man in Thorn for the job of
president, and a franchise that is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major acquisition for us, akin to a first draft
choice,'' Katz said, linking his recent coups together. ``We have
Rod. We have the pick. We have Stephon Marbury. This is really not
going to be a lowly organization for too terribly long.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, the only player at the Nets' Champion Center for the
announcement, called it a ``plus with no negatives.'' Willis Reed,
the Nets' senior vice president, called it ``not a home run, but a
grand slam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we could have come away with a better person,''
Reed said. ``The first thing I asked Rod was, can he get us another
Michael Jordan?''
</P>
<P>
   Thorn, who drafted Jordan while serving as the Chicago Bulls
general manager in 1984, will continue in his duties with the NBA
for at least the next week, but he will represent the Nets at next
week's predraft camp in Chicago, where trade talk is always big.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn, who will head the business and basketball operations for
the franchise, said he is as excited as his new employers about
rejoining the Nets, whom he served as an assistant coach from
1973-1975 and from 1976-1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great challenge and opportunity,'' Thorn said.
``This franchise is not bereft of talent. It has some very talented
players here, and there is a tremendous opportunity here to get
better in a very, very quick time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Thorn has never run a franchise, he said his 14
years in the league office has more than prepared him for the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being associated with the NBA office for the last 15 years is
like getting a doctorate in how to run a franchise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn, who has been an assistant coach, head coach, general
manager and league executive since his eight-year playing career
ended in 1971, will have the responsibility of rebuilding one of
the league's most dormant franchises. His first duties will be to
lead the Nets through the draft and to hire a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure we do the right thing with this great
asset we have in the No. 1 pick in the draft,'' Thorn said. ``We
have 26 days until the draft and we have to make sure we do the
right thing, whether it's who we draft or whether we trade it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorn said the search for a coach will be open.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm looking for is someone who's a teacher, someone who
has tremendous energy,'' Thorn said. ``It may be someone who's
experienced for a long time. It may be someone who's an assistant
coach. It may be someone who's a college coach. I don't want to
limit where we're looking for a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorn, who by virtue of his 37-years in the league has
connections to numerous coaches, said he has no candidates at this
point. He said he hopes to fill the position by the June 28 draft,
but acknowledged that it may take longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Wilkens, who has the most career NBA victories as a coach,
will almost certainly receive consideration. Thorn's first
assistant coaching job was under Wilkens in Seattle in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn also has a history with Eddie Jordan, a current Nets
assistant coach. Jordan played for the Nets when Thorn was an
assistant during the 1977-1978 season. Thorn will also decide
whether to retain General Manager John Nash. Thorn said he had not
yet decided, but it appears that Nash, who has one year left on his
contract, will remain with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known John a long time,'' Thorn said. ``John does a
really good job. But I'm going to evaluate our organization, our
strengths, weaknesses, what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of the Nets, and particularly Katz _ who said his
decision was a ``no-brainer'' after receiving Thorn's call _ they
got what they needed in Thorn.

FAA ACTION COULD SHUT DOWN ALASKA AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACY JOHNSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration threatened to shut down
Alaska Airlines' maintenance operation _ crippling its ability to
keep planes in the air _ unless the airline shows federal
inspectors by next Friday it is fixing maintenance practices.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency announced the highly unusual ultimatum
Friday. If carried out, it could slowly drain Alaska's fleet of
airworthy planes and force the SeaTac-based airline to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   But Alaska officials have confidence they can show the FAA they
have already addressed many of the problems and can convince the
agency to let them keep their authority to do heavy maintenance
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the FAA's oversight obligation, and we look
forward to demonstrating our continuing commitment to do everything
we can to assure the highest level of safety in the airline
business,'' said Alaska Chairman and CEO John Kelly at a brief news
conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Scrutiny of Alaska's operations heightened after a crash in
January took the lives of 88 people on a flight from Mexico to
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found that the plane's jack screw _ a threaded
piece of metal that moved the horizontal section of the tail up and
down _ had been stripped. That focused renewed attention on
Alaska's maintenance practices, which had been the subject of a
federal grand jury investigation in Oakland, Calif., since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA Friday gave Alaska seven days to present an extensive
plan to fix problems its inspectors found, including improperly
documented maintenance work and ineffective ways to detect
maintenance problems.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials said they did not discover that any unsafe planes
had been released for passenger service, but they were still
concerned by their findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aircraft accidents result from a series of small errors,''
said Nick Lacey, director of FAA Flight Standards Services.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA will review Alaska's plan, then issue an order and give
Alaska 30 days to comply. It could officially suspend Alaska's
maintenance authority, a measure Alaska could appeal, or it could
levy civil fines.
</P>
<P>
   During that month, Alaska must get FAA approval on heavy
maintenance work before it returns any planes to passenger service.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by the deadly Jan. 31 crash of Alaska Flight 261, FAA
inspectors spent about two weeks in April scrutinizing maintenance
and operations in the airline's SeaTac and Oakland facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the audit, the agency found problems with the
paperwork documenting ``C'' check inspections on two aircraft.
Alaska quickly began reviewing the maintenance records of each
plane that had undergone a C check _ roughly 80 planes.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Lacey said the review found more than 150 instances in
which work scheduled in heavy maintenance inspections was not
documented.
</P>
<P>
   That means in roughly 267,000 pages of paperwork, said spokesman
Lou Cancelmi, some 150 glitches such as missing signatures turned
up.
</P>
<P>
   Inspection of the aircraft showed the work had been done, Lacey
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had found maintenance that was not performed, or
sloppy... we would be taking a different course. We would not
hesitate to shut the airline down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the April FAA ``white glove'' inspection of Alaska raised
``serious concerns about critical processes,'' he said _ from
improper maintenance documentation to questionable management.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings, the FAA found that Alaska manuals did not
adequately define procedures for in-depth aircraft inspections, and
that Alaska's own audits failed to find and correct problems in
maintenance practices.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also reported that Alaska's procedures for releasing
planes after heavy maintenance did not properly ensure all the work
had been done and documented.
</P>
<P>
   And the agency said two Alaska officials shared the job of
maintenance director, a required position that needs to be held by
one person.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's threat of taking away Alaska's maintenance authority
is intended to spur the airline into correcting its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made great strides, (but) there's enough to be done
for us to propose this significant action,'' said FAA spokesman
Paul Takemoto.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's CEO emphasized the airline already has been working
closely with FAA inspectors and has made a range of improvements in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The airline put together its own team of aviation experts to
conduct an independent safety audit, recently filled the new
position of vice president of safety and hired 70 maintenance and
engineering workers.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska officials said they also have revamped the General
Maintenance Manual to ``assure clarity and consistency to
procedures and policies,'' and established weekly meetings between
FAA officials and Alaska management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased to say that many if not all of the findings the
FAA outlined... were addressed by us over recent weeks, as soon as
they were raised by the FAA during its audit,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's announcement ``serves as formal notice to us to
institutionalize those changes during the next 30 days,'' Kelly
said. ``We're confident we'll be able to prove that we've done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Alaska's recent safety initiatives were prompted by the
complaints of 64 SeaTac-based mechanics, who said they'd been
pressured to cut corners on repairs. They sent a letter to company
executives in March.
</P>
<P>
   The manager has since been transferred and FAA officials have
interviewed each of the mechanics to assess their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FBI is taking a close look at the FAA, trying to
determine if it has sanctioned or ignored any improper maintenance
procedures at Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   If the FAA decides to strip Alaska of its authority to do heavy
maintenance, the effect could devastate the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Five or six of Alaska's 89 planes are scheduled for heavy
maintenance each month. If the airline is not allowed to do that
work, those planes would be grounded and Alaska's fleet of
airworthy planes would begin to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   In that scenario, Takemoto said, Alaska would need to show it
has corrected all of the problems before doing heavy maintenance
work again.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 68-year-old airline would not be allowed to let
contractors perform the maintenance work on its fleet, as it has
done in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is with process. Allowing someone else to do it is
skirting the issue,'' Takemoto said. ``It's up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   CEO Kelly said he is confident, amid the airline's recent string
of troubles, the airline has kept ``a reservoir of good will with
the traveling public'' and will continue to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said we're not perfect,'' CEO Kelly said, ``but
we're never going to stop trying.''

and James Wallace and from the Associated Press.

SPORTS COLUMN: A PICNIC, AND THEN THE BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  NEW YORK _ The New York Knicks had just finished a brisk morning
workout in preparation for yet another monumental Game 6 battle.
This was late Friday morning at the team's Purchase, N.Y., training
facility. I was rushing in from my daughter's talent show; Jeff Van
Gundy was rushing out to his daughter's pre-school picnic. We met
at a common intersection where priorities, often lost in the
pursuit of this trophy or that, are re-established.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Especially in New York, especially in the heat of a
nerve-fraying, back-and-forth battle with Indiana that boiled down
to a single question: Could Indiana win in New York? The answer
Friday night was a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   This whole round had been a series of mind games: Larry Bird
challenging, whipping his team, wondering _ out loud _ where the
Pacers' pride had gone. Where the warrior heart was. Friday night
he found it.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy had tried to paint a more heroic side of the Knicks.
Applauding effort despite sore knees, fractured toes, bad feet. For
despite all this, the Knicks had moved through fog and smoke; they
kept coming like the Mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, facing yet another day on the edge of elimination, Van
Gundy exhorted his team to keep the series alive, to force another
Game 7. The ultimate game.
</P>
<P>
   I reminded him what Cowboys running back Duane Thomas said
before one Super Bowl when asked about playing in what was
frequently described as the ultimate game. ``If it's the ultimate
game,'' he said, ``how come they're playing it again next year?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, how many ultimate games can you have?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you coach,'' Van Gundy said Friday afternoon as he
cleared off his desk. ``You try to get them to focus in on that one
game. Then you've got to try to come up with something for the next
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy gave his office a quick once-over, made certain, in
his haste to make his picnic date, that nothing was left behind. He
plucked a soft drink out of a refrigerator. ``I'm not into giving
them a reason to win other than winning is the reason,'' he said.
``I'm realistic: this is what I see, this is what we have to
correct, this is what I think is good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto series was framed by the news media as a battle
between the Knicks and a young Raptors star, Vince Carter; the
Miami series was cast as the Knicks against a granite Heat defense.
This Indiana series had become a massive exercise in
psychoanalysis, with the Knicks portrayed as being engaged in a
battle, mostly with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to make it a psychological thing instead of:
it's basketball. It's some skill. Some technique and some good
fortune,'' Van Gundy said. ``A lot of these games are decided on
who shoots the ball better that night. Same shots _ sometimes they
go in, sometimes they go out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun to say: `The Knicks didn't guard Mark Jackson's
post-up well,' or, `What does Charlie Ward have to do, where does
the help have to come from?' That's not fun to write about, or fun
probably to read about. Because it's technical. But you have two
teams here who want it, who want the same thing. One doesn't want
it more. They both want it desperately.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy made his way down the steps, across a now-empty
practice floor. He conceded that after Wednesday's Game 5 loss,
when the Knicks squandered an 18-point lead in the second quarter
and eventually lost the game, he did some ego management.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take a hit the way we took a hit the other night, and
didn't respond because we didn't gather ourselves after they made a
run, we have to address that,'' Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go to the whip every day and you can't try to
manufacture some psychological thing. But if you see something _
like in our last game, our bad offense, our struggles on offense,
sapped our energy defensively and with rebounding. That's something
that's real,'' Van Gundy said, emphasizing the last word. ``That's
real. See, that's not something that's manufactured. And so that's
what we addressed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had guys struggling with their offense, mainly because of
not feeling well, not shooting well, whatever, and it took away
from the other end of the floor and from the rebounding. You would
say that's psychological or mental games or mind games. And it is,
but it's more realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Van Gundy went to his car, headed for the temporary
sanctuary of a kinder, gentler world: a world of picnics and
balloons and children's games.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he would enter the cutthroat world of the NBA playoffs,
where, win or lose, life is never a picnic.

   STILLWATER, N.J. _ Danette Conroy was upstairs cleaning kitchen
cabinets and her year-old daughter Kayleigh was asleep when the
black bear somehow got into the ground floor of their new home.
They never heard a thing until the crash of breaking glass. The
bear, apparently startled by the arrival of Conroy's husband,
Chris, had plunged through a double-paned window and stumbled away
toward the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived in Stillwater since I was age 4, and now I'm 41,''
said Chris Conroy, a hunter, recalling what happened last summer.
``I've never ever, even seen a bear until about five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, everybody in this township of 4,500 on the slopes of
the Kittatinny Mountains of northwestern New Jersey seems to know
somebody with a bear story. Charlie McMahon raised goats as a hobby
for 15 years until a bear killed two of them three years ago. Two
weeks ago, at a Boy Scout camp in nearby Allamuchy, a bear yanked a
sleeping bag _ with a teen-ager inside it _ off a bench; the youth,
who was uninjured, screamed and frightened off the bear.
</P>
<P>
   And last summer, a bear broke up Diane Apostola's backyard
barbecue for 20 relatives. ``He just came walking down like he was
coming to the party with us,'' Apostola said. ``We all ran into the
house, and he just left.''
</P>
<P>
   As the numbers of black bears and people have grown in forested
areas of the New York region, the bears _ once timid and content
with isolated lives in the woods _ are venturing more and more into
campgrounds, yards and even houses in search of food. The place
where their wanderings have caused the biggest stir is New Jersey;
the state Division of Fish and Wildlife said it received 1,659
complaints about bears last year, up from 285 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the complaints were about bears roaming in backyards and
getting into garbage and bird feeders, but 28 of them involved
bears killing livestock and 29 were about bears getting into homes.
Although none of the complaints involved bears attacking or
injuring people, the intrusions have imposed anxieties and
restrictions on life in this wooded corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Fish and Game Council will hold a public hearing
Tuesday on its proposal to allow bear hunting this fall for the
first time in 30 years. The council wants to reduce the state's
bear population, now estimated at 1,000, to between 250 and 330 in
the next three years in order to cut down on encounters between
people and bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a safety issue,'' said John W. Bradway,
chairman of the council. ``Some people fear for their children's
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunting proposal, made last March, is opposed by 22 animal
rights groups that want the state to do more to teach people to
coexist with bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no overpopulation problem,'' said Lynda Smith,
director of one such group, the Bear Education and Resource Group
of West Milford, N.J. ``If we cut off food in the neighborhoods,
the bears won't come in.''
</P>
<P>
   But the animals have a keen sense of smell that can penetrate
even the strongest barriers to food. Two summers ago, a black bear
broke into Carolyn and Michael Ganon's home here by yanking an
air-conditioner out of a window and crawling in through the hole _
apparently seeking an uncovered canister of chocolate-covered
toffee in the family room. Terrified, the couple's son, Leland, 13,
ran upstairs and called 911. The police found the animal sitting
near the Ganons' porch, calmly eating the candy.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though the township of Stillwater is sparsely settled,
development has grown steadily in the last 20 years in sections of
Sussex, Passaic, Morris and Warren Counties that were once covered
with forests. The bears _ hearty eaters and intelligent, adaptable
animals _ have come to rely on people to broaden their diet of
berries, acorns, skunk cabbage, rabbits and other small mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Bears have long been meandering into settled areas, particularly
in the summer, as the young are rousted from their lairs to make
way for new offspring. But experts say the bears being spotted now
tend to be older and more brazen.
</P>
<P>
   As their numbers grow, they have migrated to more thickly
populated counties, including Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon and
Somerset.
</P>
<P>
   They are also showing up in other parts of the region. Bears
recently broke into a dozen homes in southeastern New York. One
tore cabinets off a kitchen wall and tipped over a refrigerator
looking for food in Olive, in Ulster County, said Dick Henry, a New
York state wildlife biologist.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, bear sightings and complaints tripled last year,
to about 300, and livestock killings, a rarity in the state, were
reported in the rural northwest, said Paul Rego, a state wildlife
biologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is habituation of bears to people and to
people's garbage,'' said Jon Rosenberg, superintendent of parks in
West Milford, a bear haven in northern Passaic County. He has
worked with New Jersey's bear research team since 1983. Female
bears teach their cubs about food sources both in deep woods and in
backyards, and the bears will return again and again for garbage,
bird seed and pet food at homes, and for morsels at campsites and
countryside picnics and cookouts, Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Black bears are easily intimidated if people yell, wave their
arms or bang pots and pans. But repeated, uncontested forays into
backyards can lessen the bears' natural shyness and wariness of
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Veronica Stevans moved to Stillwater 12 years ago, she
occasionally spotted a bear at night near her home. ``It's a whole
different world now,'' Stevans said. ``Now you see them at any time
of day. They're bolder.'' She added, ``They're not afraid of noise
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, she said, she felt at ease walking alone on country roads.
Now she brings along a 4-inch can of pepper spray and her dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear proofing'' has become a way of life here. People talk of
jogging and walking with whistles, air horns, firecrackers and
pepper spray. Shooting bears, however, is currently illegal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gay Quarty, who saw a bear near her barbecue grill last year,
takes walks with a golf-ball-size jingle bell attached to one of
her sneakers. ``It looks ugly and stupid, and I don't know if it
really works,'' she said, ``but it gives me peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people shut their windows and doors before they cook, and
many store garbage in their basements or sheds until pickup day.
Paul Klimek has installed electric wiring around his pigpen and
wraps bacon around the wires, guaranteeing a slight shock to any
bear biting the meat.
</P>
<P>
   At Swartswood State Park, a stuffed black bear stands on its
hind legs in the lobby, next to a picnic basket and a sign warning
campers to keep all coolers and baskets in their cars when they are
not being used. Campers face eviction and a $71 fine if they feed
bears, intentionally or accidentally, and if their car windows are
found open, even a crack, when food is stored inside. Rangers say
bears can rip the window out to get the food.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, rangers at Swartswood and other state parks in or
near the Kittatinny Mountains, including High Point, Stokes and
Worthington, have shot rubber buckshot and explosive noisemakers at
bears that linger around campsites or garbage bins. This tactic is
meant to stop bears from associating people with ``positive rewards
_ a snack or a meal,'' said Patrick Carr, principal wildlife
biologist for the Division of Fish and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   But more drastic measures are being taken. Four bears deemed
potentially dangerous were trapped and killed last year by New
Jersey animal control agents, including two that had broken into
homes in Sussex County. In March, the Fish and Game Council
proposed the resumption of bear hunting, which the state banned in
1970, when the bear population had been all but wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting would be limited to the northern half of the state;
bills to prohibit bear hunting have been introduced in the state
Legislature, but they are stalled in committees.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions here on the proposal are divided, even among those who
have had encounters with bears. The Township Council in West
Milford, where the animals are plentiful, says it opposes the hunt
because bears are attractive and symbolize the state's little
remaining wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   In Stillwater, Ed Szabo, a hunter, no longer hangs deer
carcasses in trees behind his house to dry because bears ate them
at night. He favors bear hunting, but says he has no interest in
taking part.
</P>
<P>
   In Green Township, Dede Esenlohr said she sleeps uneasily
because bears often come onto her deck at night. Last summer, she
watched two bears kill two fawns in her yard. But she favors a
sterilization program because, she says, too many bears will be
wounded and left to suffer or turn dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The Humane Society of the United States, which opposes the hunt,
has asked the state to conduct a joint study into injecting 20
female bears with a vaccine that prevents conception. The state has
not responded, said Allen Rutberg, the society's senior wildlife
scientist. ``The bear problem in New Jersey is not a crisis, not
like the deer issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But bears inspire a fear that deer do not, especially after a
death last month in Gatlinburg, Tenn. On May 21, the body of Glenda
Ann Bradley, 50, of Cosby, Tenn., a teacher and experienced hiker,
was found partly eaten by two bears in the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park. An autopsy to determine if the bears had killed her
is not complete, said Nancy Gray, a park spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Rogers of Ely, Minn., an expert on black bears, said fatal
attacks by black bears are extremely rare _ only about 40 in North
America in this century. People face a greater chance of being
killed by dogs, lightning or bee stings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   TIPS FOR DEALING WITH BEARS
</P>
<P>
   Blacks bears are intelligent and extremely strong and have keen
senses of smell and hearing. They are excellent swimmers and tree
climbers and can run up to 35 miles an hour. Adult males average
about 350 pounds, but can weigh as much as 600 pounds. Adult
females average about 200 pounds. Black bears are normally not
aggressive toward humans and will usually flee if people make a lot
of noise.
</P>
<P>
   When threatened, black bears may issue a warning by popping
their jaws, making huffing noises, swatting the ground or bluffing
a charge. If faced with a bear doing any of these things, people
should remain standing, avoid direct eye contact, back away slowly
and talk in a calm but assertive tone. Make sure the bear has an
escape route.
</P>
<P>
   AT HOME:
</P>
<P>
   _ Never feed or attempt to pet bears.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hang bird feeders at least 8 feet off the ground and take them
inside at night.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take uneaten pet food inside at night.
</P>
<P>
   _ Store garbage in sheds and garages, away from doors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep barbecue grills clean of grease.
</P>
<P>
   AT CAMP:
</P>
<P>
   _ Never keep food, snacks, candy, gum or their wrappers inside
tents or shelters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep a clean camp and minimize food odors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Store food in vehicles, with windows rolled up, or in
commercially sold, airtight bear-proof containers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash dishes immediately after using them and dump water away
from camp.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put garbage and cooking grease in garbage bins or bear-proof
containers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash any food from your face and hands before going to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hang clothes with food or cooking grease on them beyond bear's
reach.

CORZINE SPENDING $2 MILLION TO ENCOURAGE TURNOUT FOR NJ SENATE
PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Topping off a record-breaking Senate campaign
spending spree, Democratic candidate Jon Corzine is expected to
spend up to $2 million next week to encourage potential supporters
to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   That amount approaches the get-out-the-vote budget in some past
presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
   Although Corzine campaign officials said they did not know how
much would be paid out between now and Tuesday's Democratic
primary, they said they had earmarked $1.5 million for workers
whose sole job will be to encourage likely Corzine supporters to go
to the polls. Several party officials said the spending could reach
$2 million.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Corzine's opponent in the primary, former Gov. Jim
Florio, had budgeted $2 million for his entire campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although the amount Corzine expects to dispense next week is a
fraction of the $35 million he has spent so far, Florio said that
such a large amount of money for election workers had the potential
to taint the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another example of Jon Corzine trying to buy to
election,'' Florio said. ``It's beyond the pale of anything anyone
has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, most political campaigns rely on volunteers and party
loyalists for tasks that include passing out palm cards,
chauffeuring people to the polls and reminding potential supporters
to go vote. Better-financed candidates have been known to pay small
stipends _ generally around $25 _ to election day workers, but
party officials said they were authorized to give more than $100 to
those who will work on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine supporters said they hoped to employ as many as 3,000
people on Monday and Tuesday, although Steven Goldstein, a
spokesman for Corzine, said that 600 of them would be volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a very traditional volunteer get-out-the vote
operation, with people pounding the pavement and knocking on
doors,'' he said. ``Jim Florio has tried to make it into something
else because he does not have the resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio, on learning that Sen. Charles Schumer of New York had
crossed the Hudson River Friday to endorse Corzine, told reporters
that he was stunned, because the senator had praised him in the
past for helping to enact tough gun control laws in New Jersey. In
contrast, Florio said, when Corzine was a co-chairman of Goldman
Sachs, the company was helping the parent company of Remington Arms
Co. in a merger deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer called that charge bogus, and he said of Florio: ``I
still consider him a friend. I think Jon Corzine would be a better
senator and more electable.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Zellner, the field coordinator for the Democratic Party
committee in Bergen County, said the extra money would make his
work easier by paying for literature to be mailed..
</P>
<P>
   Thomas P. Giblin, the chairman of Essex County's Democratic
Party, said he hoped to have an army of 1,100 people on Tuesday.
Some of the Corzine campaign money would help pay for 15 rented
vans to ferry voters to and from the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect people who are making $200 a day to take the
day off for $25,'' Giblin said. ``These are not glamorous jobs.''
But he and other party leaders said they were worried that such
large payments might be counter-productive in the long run. ``If
you give them steak one year, are they going to take bologna the
next?'' Giblin said.
</P>
<P>
   Zellner, for one, said he would not raise the daily stipend
above the usual $30. ``I don't want to offer something I can't
match next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Florio's supporters are making do with an
all-volunteer cadre of election day workers. A campaign spokesman,
Jim Lanard, said he expected to have 3,000 people making calls and
knocking on doors on Tuesday. ``Our workers are motivated by
loyalty, not by money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They may condemn Corzine's spending habits, but many of the
party leaders supporting Florio acknowledge that they wish they had
more cash. Gary Karr, the Burlington County Democratic Party
chairman, said he was frustrated by the profusion of Corzine signs.
``They're every six inches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said he was heartened that a few hundred people had
agreed to volunteer for Florio on Tuesday. ``They'll come because
they have a lot of admiration and respect for Governor Florio, not
because we can spit out cash at them,'' he said. ``These people are
used to burning down the old shoe leather.''

REDSKINS NEXT FOR SANDERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deion Sanders, one of the more talented and high profile players
in NFL history, was released Friday by the Dallas Cowboys. But
don't feel too bad for the Pro Bowl cornerback and kick returner,
because he will quite likely find a home in Washington by next
week.
</P>
<P>
   There is a slim chance the Cowboys will try to rework a deal
with Sanders, or that Sanders could end up in Tampa Bay, but all
indications, several team and league officials said Friday, are
that Sanders will be with the Redskins by Monday or Tuesday. Dallas
released Sanders because of salary-cap reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion was a great player for us,'' Jerry Jones, the Cowboys'
owner, said. ``But because of salary-cap reasons, we can't afford
to keep him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins might play Sanders at safety as much as cornerback,
and his kick-return skills would make their special teams
dangerous. &QL;

CIGNA TO PULL ITS MEDICARE HMO PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE _ Cigna Corp., the nation's sixth-largest health
maintenance organization, will stop offering a Medicare HMO plan to
almost 18,000 customers in Southern California on Jan. 1, a company
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will affect 13,000 Cigna Medicare HMO members in
Los Angeles County, 3,000 members in Orange County, 1,300 members
in San Bernardino and 460 customers in Riverside counties.
</P>
<P>
   The company cited low government reimbursement rates and
competitive pressures in Southern California as reasons for the
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't continue to offer quality care and our wide range of
services at an attractive price to our customers,'' said Jim
Harris, a spokesman with Glendale-based Cigna Healthcare of
California.
</P>
<P>
   The company will continue to cover health care services through
the end of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna will assist its members in either signing up with another
HMO or returning to the traditional fee-for-service Medicare
program that currently does not include coverage for prescription
drugs. In Los Angeles, there are at least a dozen Medicare HMOs
available to help displaced Cigna customers, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Haines, a spokeswoman with Woodland Hills-based Foundation
Health Systems Inc., said the insurer offers a similar Medicare
plan to clients throughout California.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Cigna, however, Foundation Health will continue offering
seniors Medicare coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we do every year, we will look at all aspects of the
product we offer,'' Haines said. ``We don't expect any major
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Philadelphia, Cigna announced Friday that it is also
leaving Atlanta, Connecticut, Delaware, Houston, Baltimore,
Washington, D.C., northern Virginia, northern New Jersey, the New
York City area, Orlando, Tampa, Richmond, Va., Tennessee and
Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   About 104,000 members will be affected in those markets where
Cigna has decided to drop the Medicare program. According to
Harris, Cigna covers about 2.5 percent of seniors enrolled in
Medicare HMOs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna plans to continue offering its Medicare HMO in
Albuquerque, N.M., and the Phoenix area. Currently, Cigna insures
about 50,000 Medicare members in those markets.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said health plans are required to inform the Health Care
Financing Administration, the federal agency that regulates
Medicare, by July 3, which cities they plan to exit for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna is the first national HMO to announce what Medicare
markets it will leave next year. Aetna has announced that it will
leave some markets by Jan. 1, but has not specified which ones. And
industry experts predict that others will announce a reduction or
elimination of their Medicare involvement by the July 3 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, or 6.2
million seniors, are enrolled in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna plan enrollees seeking information can call (800)
633-4227.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cigna also said it would sell its U.S. individual and
group life insurance operations for $170 million cash. The company
said it expects the sale to Life Reassurance Corp. of America to
result in an after-tax gain of $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Life Reassurance is a subsidiary of Switzerland's Swiss
Reinsurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``This divestiture further sharpens our focus on Cigna's
employee benefits business; employee health care, life and
disability benefits; and retirement and investment products and
services,'' said H. Edward Hanaway, Cigna's chief executive officer
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cigna gained $1.9375, or 2.2 percent, to close Friday
at $89.375 on volume of 750,200 shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange.

DROP IDEA OF RENAMING THE STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JERRY HEASTER, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There are a few billion reasons to leave
Ewing Kauffman's name on Kansas City's field of dreams. They're
called dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand the temptation to want to rename
Kauffman Stadium in return for the big bucks a corporation would
pay for the privilege. The extra revenue, after all, could buy the
talent needed to make the Royals a more competitive team. Moreover,
a really shrewd deal might be structured to shift the upkeep burden
to the enterprise with its name on the door.
</P>
<P>
   This would be good business, granted, but it wouldn't be the
right thing to do. There are some things that shouldn't be for
sale. Given everything Ewing Kauffman did for Kansas City, the name
on Kauffman Stadium is one of those things.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against selling out Kauffman already have been
made with convincing eloquence. He not only restored major-league
baseball to Kansas City, but along the way spent considerable sums
of his own money to give fans a championship-caliber organization
of which they could be proud. This alone would be enough to justify
keeping his name on the stadium. But there's an even more
compelling reason to keep faith with his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, business and government leaders have gone to
great lengths to emphasize the economic benefit of having
big-league sports in Kansas City. The most recent number put on
this contribution has been well over a couple of hundred million
dollars a year in economic activity generated by the Royals and
Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Royals play many more games than the Chiefs, let's
assume for the sake of argument the two franchises contribute about
equally to Kansas City's economy. This would mean that over
Kauffman's stewardship tenure, he was probably responsible for at
least several billion dollars worth of economic oomph the area
wouldn't have otherwise enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   During his time as owner, Kauffman never threw his weight around
demanding onerous taxpayer-subsidized goodies in return for keeping
this tremendous economic asset in Kansas City. Quite the contrary.
He spent much of his personal fortune to improve the quality of his
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Even in death he left in place heroic measures to ensure the
continued presence of the Royals in Kansas City. It was an act of
love for his hometown that few, if any, Kansas City benefactors
have ever matched. Not only did Kauffman engineer the business and
financial details of this quest before dying, but he also entrusted
the task of saving the Royals for Kansas City to one of his most
able and trustworthy corporate lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, Kauffman continued to build his Marion Labs
into a premier local company that also contributed much to the
Kansas City area economy apart from what Kauffman did in his more
visible role with the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   To betray such love and loyalty by selling Ewing Kauffman's name
off the stadium at which he accomplished so much for his community
would be a base and classless action unworthy of the fine people
who would be responsible for making this decision.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly fitting way to celebrate Kansas City's 150th
birthday, it seems, would be to drop this idea and pretend it never
existed in the first place.

STOCKER TELLS ANGELS HE'LL PLAY ANYWHERE
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Kevin Stocker hasn't taken a ground ball at
anywhere but shortstop all year, but the Anaheim Angels' newest
arrival won't complain if he and ``utility player'' are mentioned
in the same breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they called to bring me in, I told them I'll fill
whatever role they want me to,'' said Stocker, who joined the team
for Friday's game against the Dodgers and figures to play in this
afternoon's game.
</P>
<P>
   Stocker, 30, has played shortstop for much of his six-year big-
league career and was the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' starter until his
release on May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Stocker should get plenty of opportunites to play shortstop with
injured Gary DiSarcina's transfer to the 60-day disabled list and
Benji Gil's struggles at the plate (.197).
</P>
<P>
   ``If that means playing every day, great. If it's every other
day, fine. I'm just happy to be here filling a spot. I'm not trying
to take anybody's job or anything,'' said Stocker, who hit .263 in
40 games for Tampa Bay. ``I'm grateful that they called me.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia is happy to have a versatile
veteran to call on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to get a chance to play a lot of shortstop. I think
that will give Benji a little breather because he's been really
going hard and hasn't had a chance to get a lot of time off . . .
to get recharged,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Stocker) gives us more depth to our club definitely. Plus he
has the ability to his second which gives us a good look to our
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Interleague not intermission: It won't ruin the season and it
probably won't determine whether or not an American League West
championship is won.
</P>
<P>
   But the first round of interleague play is a chance for the
Angels to improve the majors' second-worst record against the
National League sincethe crossover play began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Friday's series opener against the Dodgers, the first
of nine consecutive interleague games, the Angels were 20-30
against NL competition. Only Tampa Bay (9-25) has been worse than
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won't consider series against the Dodgers, San
Francisco and Arizona as win-or-else, particularly when considering
the balance, if not mediocrity, of the Western Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of (interleague) problems last year,'' first
baseman Mo Vaughn said. ``We just have to go out, be ourselves and
play our game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bid adieu to Dodger Blue: Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully's
famous voice was easily heard during Scioscia's chat with the media
Friday when the longtime Dodgers player and coach was asked about
managing against his old team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brings back memories . . . doesn't it?'' Scioscia asked,
referring to Scully.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the extent of Scioscia's nostalgia regarding the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus is on the 25 guys we have in our clubhouse,'' he
said. ``If I learned anything from my years (with the Dodgers). . .
. You've got to know your club and get your club ready to play. . .
. That's lesson No. 1.''

HALLMARK SUES COMPETITOR OVER TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JENNIFER MANN, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hallmark Cards Inc. is suing competitor
American Greetings Corp., alleging that American Greetings' Web
site and two of its software products used technology owned by
Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark spokeswoman Julie Odell said the dispute centered on
technology that Hallmark acquired in September 1998 from Mary T.
Tackbary and Dan G. Friedrich.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is used on features such as address books,
personal reminders of important dates, and a history of what
products the person has bought. Both Hallmark's and American
Greetings' Web sites have such features.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark also alleges that American Greetings is illegally using
the same technology in its CreataCard and Personal Cardshop
software products.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Petit, vice president of communications for American
Greetings, said the Cleveland-based card maker had no knowledge of
the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in federal court in the
Western District of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, Tackbary met with American
Greetings' vice president of product management in 1994. At that
meeting, Tackbary demonstrated a prototype system and told company
officials she had filed for a patent application.
</P>
<P>
   Tackbary later met with other American Greetings executives,
including Morry Weiss, the chairman and chief executive officer at
the time. Again, Tackbary demonstrated her invention and told
company officials there was a patent pending.
</P>
<P>
   She then had a third meeting with American Greetings, the last
one with the vice president of interactive marketing. Ultimately,
American Greetings decided not to enter into a business
relationship with Tackbary.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark then acquired the technology in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City greeting card company is asking the court to:
</P>
<P>
   - Issue a permanent injunction to stop American Greetings and
entities it has relationships with from using the technology.
</P>
<P>
   - Award damages to Hallmark arising from American Greetings' use
of the technology, together with interest and costs.
</P>
<P>
   - Triple the amount of damages.
</P>
<P>
   - Make American Greetings pay Hallmark's attorney fees.
</P>
<P>
   - Have the issues decided by a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that the two greeting card giants
have tangled over technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   Though the two never went to court, they tussled for several
years over technology used for interactive kiosks where consumers
can create personalized cards.
</P>
<P>
   That battle began in 1992 when American Greetings unveiled its
interactive kiosk with great fanfare at a media event in New York.
Hallmark fired back the next day, alleging those kiosks used
technology owned by Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of bickering the companies declared an
impasse, with each allowing the other to continue using the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Hallmark seems to be taking a firm stand on its ownership
issue this time around. Depending on how the lawsuit turns out,
Hallmark could pursue legal action against others, as many Web
sites and portals offer features similar to those offered on
American Greetings' Web site and in its software products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we won't pursue other legal action,'' Odell
said. ``I don't know that we've necessarily closed that door.''

KOBE'S OK AT START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Coach Phil Jackson extended the suspense as
long as he could, but when tipoff came Friday night, Kobe Bryant
and his sore right foot were in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Exercising either gamesmanship or extreme caution, Jackson
declined right up until game time to reveal Bryant's status, saying
only that he would play. Of course, the Portland Trail Blazers
maintained all along that the Los Angeles Lakers were overplaying
Bryant's injury.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant did skip two days of practice after spraining his foot in
Game 5 on Tuesday and he also skipped Friday's morning shootaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he can play, but he hasn't tested it,'' Jackson said
before the game. ``He's got to be the measure of what he can do and
can't do and has to let me know how he's doing out there. As far as
how he's playing, that's my decision as to whether he's playing
well enough to stay out on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's foot and his game were up to the challenge. He played
the entire first half without a breather.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bryant played 40 minutes or four, Jackson said the
Lakers would be comfortable adjusting. They played the first month
of the season without Bryant, while his broken hand healed, and
went 11-4. They also won at Phoenix on April 4, when Bryant was
serving a one-game suspension for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand how to play without him,'' Jackson said.
``They've done it this year often enough to know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Easygoing: Despite the uncertainty that surrounded Bryant's
status for the last three days, Derek Fisher said the Lakers
arrived in Portland much more relaxed than they had been earlier
this week. Fisher said the team was too tense for Game 5 in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much more relaxed at the shootaround today and that's a
positive sign,'' he said before the game. ``We all felt like we had
to win on Tuesday. We knew we were up 3-1 and we were at home. And
to lose an elimination game at home like that really bothered us.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Kupchak stays: The New Jersey Nets' hiring of Rod Thorn as
head of basketball operations on Friday means Mitch Kupchak will
remain a Laker for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak, the Lakers' general manager, was among the candidates
Nets ownership considered for their top personnel position.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of this point, nothing has transpired in the past few weeks
that would convince me that any other situation is better than the
situation I have with the Lakers,'' Kupchak said in a prepared
statement. He was not available for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers gave permission to the Nets to speak with Kupchak
about the position, but they would not confirm whether he had a
formal interview.

BRITISH FIRM TO BUY BUS COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- NATIONAL EXPRESS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY GENE MEYER, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Britain's largest long-distance
transportation group, National Express Plc, is buying the area's
School Services and Leasing Inc. for $205 million, the two
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The cash transaction, scheduled to be final in August,
represents part of the U.S. expansion by National Express into
operating fleets from California to Connecticut. School Services is
the United States' second-largest privately owned school bus fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction also represents a watershed for Kansas City
transportation executive and sports franchise owner Don Kincaid.
</P>
<P>
   The company from which School Services was created is the same
bus company that Kincaid joined as a part-time driver in the
mid-1960s while attending the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
He bought the company in the mid-1970s with just $400 in the bank
and a Small Business Administration loan.
</P>
<P>
   Its growth, into an organization with 4,000 employees serving 40
school districts in eight states, is the engine that enabled
Kincaid to expand his portfolio with investments in other
regionally substantial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid is owner or a major investor in Kincaid Coach Lines, a
charter service; Midwest Bus Sales; Kincaid Leasing; a Leavenworth
auto dealership; and the Kansas City Attack soccer team. None of
those investments will be affected by the School Services sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``With consolidation and other trends in the industry, this is
the right time and the right thing to do for the company, our
employees and for National Express,'' Kincaid said Friday. ``But it
also is like watching my firstborn walk down the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   From National Express's perspective, ``the acquisition opens up
important new markets and consolidates our position in the
Midwest,'' said Larry Durham, chief executive of the company's
North American operations, which are based in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that when the acquisition was complete,
National Express' U.S. business volume would increase to more than
$500 million annually and include 9,000 vehicles and 16,000
employees in 20 states.

ROMEL MAN SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR KILING WIFE  
</HEADLINE>
 SENTENCED-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY TONY RIZZO, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An Overland Park, Kan., man who tape-recorded
the fatal shooting of his wife was sentenced Friday to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Romel Abufakher must serve 25 years before he can be considered
for parole. The 48-year-old real estate broker had nothing to say
before District Judge William Cleaver pronounced sentence.
</P>
<P>
   He testified at his trial in April that he accidentally shot his
wife, Carol Abufakher, on Sept. 21 while he was trying to leave
their house and she grabbed the gun he was holding.
</P>
<P>
   The voice-activated recorder in his pocket captured Abufakher
telling his wife, ``I'm going to kill you,'' seconds before the
sound of a shot. Police later confiscated the recorder.
</P>
<P>
   A Johnson County, Kan., District Court jury found Abufakher
guilty of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Abufakher's sister, Sharon Whitley, told the judge Friday
that her ``fun-loving and generous'' sister's death had devastated
their elderly parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents loved Romel,'' she said. ``They took him into their
hearts and home, and he repaid their love by killing Carol.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred after several days of marital stress
prompted by Carol Abufakher's anger over her husband's relationship
with a female co-worker, according to trial testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the days before the shooting, Romel Abufakher called
police to the couple's house in the 9900 block of Metcalf Avenue.
One time she locked him out of the house and he called police so he
could go back in, get some belongings and leave.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the shooting he called police again, this time
seeking to have his wife committed for mental problems. Police said
they had no reason to take her.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day the couple went to a counselor, according to
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Romel Abufakher testified at trial that he put the tape-recorder
in his pocket that night to gather evidence that his wife was
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Carol Abufakher could be heard loudly demanding
that her husband tell her the truth. She repeatedly threatened to
reveal things the next morning that would get him in trouble if he
did not tell her the truth about the co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the tape changed abruptly when Carol Abufakher
shouted, ``He's got a gun!'' while speaking on the phone to her
husband's business partner.
</P>
<P>
   Rustling that suggested a struggle could be heard on the tape.
The last words spoken by Romel Abufakher were ``Don't open the
door,'' and then the shot was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Abufakher's brother, Fred Lamm, told the judge Friday that
he believed his sister was killed because of her threats to reveal
``the total truth'' about Romel Abufakher's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was a little money or a lot of money, my sister's
life was worth more than that,'' Lamm said.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Morrison had sought before the trial to
let the jury hear testimony about Abufakher's business dealings,
but the judge did not allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sentencing Friday, Cleaver denied a request by
defense attorney Tom Bath to throw out the verdict and order a new
trial. Bath said that the evidence ``at best'' supported a verdict
of second-degree murder.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR THESE N.Y. FANS, IT IS OCTOBER IN JUNE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., S.C)  By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
ATLANTA _ Pat Riley would have strained his mousse. Reggie Miller
would have had conniptions. The Atlanta Braves prefer to think of
it as money in the bank.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All those ``NY'' caps strutting around the ballpark with large,
hard New York heads underneath were demographics on parade.
</P>
<P>
   There were transplanted New Yorkers, homesick New Yorkers,
lifetime New Yorkers, truculent New Yorkers, even some wannabe New
Yorkers, all of them wearing the dreaded dark-blue insignia that
has been branded into the troubled minds of Atlanta Braves fans
since the 1996 and 1999 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   There was a roar when Ricky Ledee lofted a three-run homer in
the fourth inning that helped the Yanks beat the Braves, 5-2. The
home fans cheered even louder when Andruw Jones made a running,
fully-extended catch to rob Paul O'Neill of extra bases in the
seventh, but there was not that great a disparity between the 90
percent Braves and the 10 percent Yankees in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand Yankees fans had come up with tickets for the
first interleague game of the season between the two World Series
teams of last year. How long ago that seems, back when John Rocker
was just a loutish relief pitcher with rabbit ears, before he
became a household name for his ugly comments about the diverse
types on the New York City streets and subways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait for him to go to New York,'' said Steve Proper,
now from Buckhead, but originally from Meadville, Pa., who was
wearing his NY cap. ``It's going to be nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood was not nearly as intense as it was during last year's
World Series, when legions of Yankees fans marauded around Turner
Field, showing their Yankees emblems and their gall in equal
proportion. They were erstwhile Spike Lees, showing their stuff in
the rival arena, just as the Spikester does in his lightning raids
to Miami and to Indiana during the basketball playoffs, now ended
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   By popping up like Bugs Bunny with orange Knicks paraphernalia
draped all over him, Spike has annoyed resident Elmer Fudds in
Miami and Indiana. Riley and Miller have urged local fans to show
patriotism and gobble up those tickets before ubiquitous New
Yorkers get their evil hands on them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is nothing new for New Yorkers to swarm to sports
events in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Knicks come down here, the crowd is half New
Yorkers,'' said Carl Liddelow, now working in Atlanta but
originally from Manhattan. ``The Giants play here this season. I
can hardly wait to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was born in Georgia and attended Morehouse College, has
returned for Knicks games, but the combined Braves-Hawks management
finally had to draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike called me before one game and said he needed to sit in
the front row,'' recalled Stan Kasten, the president of both clubs.
``I said it was not in my best interests to help him be in the
front row. So he found somebody and got in the second row.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball being a more democratic sport, it was much easier for
New York types to get into Turner Field Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on the phone the first day tickets went on sale,'' said
Phil Mentnech from Charleston, S.C., originally from the Catskills,
who was seated down the right-field line. ``This was the best I
could do after three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees fans admitted they were not pummeled or taunted, the
way the occasional foolhardy Braves or Red Sox fan is bullied in
Shea or Yankee Stadium. But Kasten would not concede that New York
has a monopoly on viciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine percent of the fans are fine,'' Kasten said. ``But
you have to draw the line. There are things your neighbors and the
players have the right not to hear. There is a form of assault, not
battery, and we will throw people out if they cross that line.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was not making it up when he accused Shea Stadium fans of
shouting vile things at the Braves. His problem was that he made
some weird link between the small proportion of ugly Shea fans with
assorted ethnic and racial and social groups in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After his bigoted feelings hit print in Sports Illustrated
during the off-season, he was suspended for two weeks. The team was
barely putting up with him this spring even before his earned run
average soared to 4.41. Asked if Rocker was still his stopper,
Bobby Cox said slowly, ``Yeah, sure, I guess,'' which told it all.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night a feisty minority of New Yorkers reminded Rocker
there are more where they came from.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Eleven years ago, when a plane carrying Rep.
Mickey Leland of Texas on a hunger relief mission crashed in
Ethiopia, Rodney Ellis, a young Democratic councilman in Houston,
was grief stricken and shaken.
</P>
<P>
   He had not only lost his mentor, but he was supposed to have
been on that plane and had even fumed at Leland for bumping him
from the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Urged by Leland's widow to run for his seat in Congress, Ellis
gave it some thought before deciding instead to seek the state
Senate seat that Leland had once held.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since then, Ellis has become perhaps the leading
political force behind the decidedly unpopular efforts in Texas to
slow the state's speedy executions and erase what he said are the
inequities that often keep black, Hispanic and indigent defendants
from a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem an unusual role for a man who, like almost every
influential Texas politician, said that he supports the death
penalty. But Ellis' deep reservations about the system, and his
occasional clashes with Gov. George W. Bush, earned him the
spotlight this week.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush's campaigning in California and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a
Republican, in Europe, Ellis, as the Senate president pro tem,
became the acting governor and was left to decide whether to grant
a reprieve for convicted murderer Ricky McGinn. Bush announced on
Thursday in Sacramento, Calif., that he had recommended a 30-day
reprieve, which Ellis had accepted.
</P>
<P>
   But actually, Ellis had mostly made up his mind five days
earlier, having conferred with his staff and read an order by a
state judge imploring an appeals court to postpone the execution to
allow DNA tests; defense lawyers said the tests might exonerate
McGinn of raping his 12-year-old stepdaughter. McGinn was convicted
of murdering the girl, but prosecutors could not have asked for a
death sentence without also getting the rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said that the case kept him awake until 3 a.m. Monday
night, thinking, ``What if I disagree with Governor Bush? How would
we resolve that?'' His wife told him to call Bush's aides first
thing on Tuesday, which he did, so Bush would have the chance to
return to Texas to make sure the execution was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   But to his surprise, Ellis said, Bush's aides said they were
already seriously considering a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   To Ellis, a 46-year-old Democrat, McGinn's case highlights only
some of the state's criminal justice problems: Ellis said it is
outrageous that there was no process allowing the new DNA tests to
be conducted, as the state's highest criminal appeals court,
without explanation, refused to postpone the execution.
</P>
<P>
   In the Legislature, Ellis has advocated banning executions of
the mentally retarded; giving juries the option of sentencing
murderers to life without parole, thus making it easier for jurors
to forego the death penalty; and putting control of court-appointed
lawyers in the hands of county governments, not the local judges
who, Ellis said, often favor lawyers who speed cases along instead
of fighting tooth-and-nail for their client.
</P>
<P>
   That last proposal was vetoed by Bush because, Ellis said,
judges worried that it took away a piece of their patronage. Bush
said that power should be left to judges because they were better
qualified to select lawyers for defendants who need them.
</P>
<P>
   Texas courts are ``essentially a system of judicial apartheid,''
Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus tends to be on the law-and-order, lock-them-up,
throw-away- of-the-key stuff, and a refusal to look at the
inequities of the system,'' he said. ``Part of the problem is that
our governor and a number of my conservative colleagues somehow
have the view that if you show compassion, you can be perceived as
weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, maintains that all 131 inmates executed
while he has been governor were unquestionably guilty of murder and
had had appropriate access to the courts. And few legislators share
Ellis' view.
</P>
<P>
   ``People commit crimes because of bad values, not because of
their race or status,'' said state Sen. David Sibley, a Waco
Republican and Bush ally.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ellis may not be in sympathy with legislative leaders on
some things, he has still been quite effective on many issues,
including indigent health care and voter registration. He has
earned a place among the elite of the state's Senate, a place
where, Texas Monthly once said, ``toughness is good, shrillness and
criticism are not, and humor is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to put together coalitions,'' Sibley said, before
adding: ``I don't think he's one that says half a loaf is better
than none. He says, `I'll take half a loaf now, and come back for
the rest later.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley and Ellis have already discussed legislation that would
make it easier for prisoners to obtain post-trial DNA testing that
might prove exculpatory. Without commenting on specifics, Sibley
said such legislation might stand a chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis already has some specifics in mind: Giving inmates the
right to get DNA testing of evidence from their case, requiring
that biological evidence be preserved, setting up a commission to
review and investigate cases of possible wrongful convictions, and
providing more compensation to people wrongfully imprisoned and
later exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, the son of a yardman, grew up in Houston, attended
college at Texas Southern University, and earned a law degree and a
master's degree in public affairs at the University of Texas in
Austin. After serving as Leland's chief of staff, he was elected to
the Houston City Council at the age of 29. He now works in the
Houston office of a New Orleans law firm, and is married with three
children.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush and Perry both expected to travel out of state at
times later this year, the final approval for executions could fall
to Ellis again. One inmate scheduled to die soon, Gary Graham, has
drawn a lot of support from those who insist he is innocent. What
would Ellis do if that case were left up to him? Not sure yet, he
said, ``but if I were a guessing man, I would guess the governor or
lieutenant governor will be in town.''

NASDAQ SOARS, OTHER INDEXES ALSO GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to note in 2nd graf that Nasdaq was up 19 percent for the
week.)  
(Eds: See also ECON-REPORT, STOCKS-ASSESS) 
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index soared 6.44 percent
Friday, ending its best week ever, as investors cheered data
suggesting that the nation's economy is slowing and the Federal
Reserve may be almost done raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in many technology stocks echoed the wild trading seen
in January and February, with many big technology companies rising
10 percent or more on heavy volume. Overall, the Nasdaq rose 230.88
points, to 3,813.38, continuing its extraordinary volatility. For
the week, it was up 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other indexes also gained, though less than the Nasdaq. The Dow
Jones industrial average increased 142.56 points, or 1.34 percent,
to 10,794.76, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index jumped
28.45 points, or 1.96 percent, to 1,477.26.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment in May rising unexpectedly and wages nearly
flat, Wall Street strategists believe that the Federal Reserve is
no longer likely to raise short-term interest rates later this
month and may not have to push rates much higher this year. To slow
the economy and keep inflation down, the Fed has already raised
short-term rates six times since June 1999, and until this week
many economists thought at least two more increases were likely.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are usually considered bad for stocks,
because a slower economy hurts corporate profits. Now, whether
right or wrong, investors, who are convinced that rates will remain
relatively stable, are eagerly seeking out shares in many of the
companies they fled earlier this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The buying spree, which began in earnest Wednesday, accelerated
Friday as many stocks jumped at the opening bell and stayed strong
through the close of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is fairly clear that investors, after believing
that there would be at least one more Fed tightening, have
concluded that would not be the case,'' said Ed Yardeni, chief
economist and global investment strategist with Deutsche Bank
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni said he believed that the Fed, whose primary mandate is
to keep the U.S. economy growing steadily with low inflation, ran
the risk of embarrassing itself if it continued to raise rates this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a spike in energy prices and scattered indications that
wage inflation is rising, ``the latest inflation indicators suggest
that inflation isn't even close to being a problem,'' Yardeni said.
``The Fed is just going to have to chill out and enjoy
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief investment strategist for Goldman,
Sachs, said the breadth of this week's rally impressed her. While
the Nasdaq's frantic gains in January and February came largely at
the expense of old-economy stocks in the S&AMP;P 500, the gains this
week included both the Nasdaq and the S&AMP;P, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation where investors are taking a look at the
economic data and deciding the situation was not quite as ugly as
they had assumed,'' Cohen said. ``The economy is still growing, but
more slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Friday's action had more than a touch of last winter's
speculative fever to it. Many big Nasdaq stocks rose 10 percent or
more, with JDS Uniphase up 12 1/8, to 110 3/8, and Broadvision
gaining 10 1/8, to 53 5/8. Bellwether Cisco Systems, the
second-largest stock on the Nasdaq, continued to rally, gaining 3
7/16, to 64 3/8. Cisco has now gained almost 30 percent in just
over a week, adding $100 billion to its market valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Other big winners included financial stocks, which often gain
when interest rates are falling. Merrill Lynch rose 4, to 108,
while Citigroup jumped 2 15/16, to 66\.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Levy, the chief economist at Banc of America Securities,
said he expected financials to continue to gain. ``Financial stocks
always outperform prior to an inflection point,'' when the Federal
Reserve stops raising interest rates, Levy said. ``They've been
rallying in the last few weeks. They've outperformed. As analysts
soften their expectations for the Fed to tighten even more, the
rotation into financials will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone believes the Fed is done raising rates. Stephen
Slifer, the chief U.S. economist for Lehman Brothers, said he still
expects the bank to increase short-term rates by one-quarter of a
percentage point at the end of June and another quarter point in
August. In the wake of Friday's unemployment report, which showed
joblessness rose from 3.9 percent in April to 4.1 percent in May,
Lehman lowered its estimates for U.S. economic growth for the
second quarter from 6.3 percent to 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Slifer expects the economy to expand at 5.2 percent for
all of this year and another 3.7 percent next year, levels that are
extremely high by the standards of the last two decades. With the
economy growing so fast, the Fed must continue to be wary of
inflation, Slifer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any sort of recent historical standards, growth is just off
the charts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has publicly worried
about the potential inflationary effect of a rising stock market.
As the market rises, investors who feel flush may increase their
spending, overheating the economy and causing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Coming along with the broader economic slowdown, the nearly 40
percent drop in the Nasdaq between March 10 and Tuesday, which
erased more than $2 trillion in investor wealth, may have
alleviated some of the Fed's concerns, Slifer said. But if the
Nasdaq regains its losses too quickly, it could once again overheat
the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of months from now, if the Fed doesn't do anything,
they could be right back worrying about the economy overheating
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices were mixed Friday. The price of the 30-year Treasury
bond fell 2/32, to 104 9/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.94
percent. The price of the 10-year note rose 4/32, to 104 9/32. The
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell
to 6.16 percent from 6.17 percent on Thursday.

SMITH TWO FATHERS AWAIT JUDGE'S RULING ON RELEASE OF A MURDERER  
</HEADLINE>
 RULING-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Al Smith and Gary Rawlings Sr. sat on
opposite sides of a Jackson County courtroom again Friday. They've
done that many times in the 13 years since Rawlings' son murdered
Smith's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   They sat silently as a judge heard arguments that Rawlings' son,
Gary Rawlings Jr., 41, was fit to go free.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Gary Rawlings Jr. shot his girlfriend, Terri Smith, 23,
in the head while she slept. Smith, he said, had been trying to
kill him with microwaves. Doctors diagnosed him a paranoid
schizophrenic. In 1989, a judge found him not guilty by reason of
insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gary Rawlings Jr. is in a state mental hospital. Circuit
Judge Jay A. Daugherty heard arguments Friday on whether to release
him, and said he would rule on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the judge's decision, grief and horror have eaten away
at the two families. The murder made the elder Rawlings and Smith
advocates for opposite positions on the criminally insane.
</P>
<P>
   Both men spoke of it Friday, though not to each other.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gary Rawlings Sr., 67, of Kansas City, said
schizophrenia first hit his son at age 24, four years before the
murder. The disease helped break up his son's marriage and his own,
Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
   His son was put on antipsychotic medication. He recovered, but
then stopped taking the medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary thought it was like a cold,'' Rawlings said. ``You just
took the medicine when you were sick. He understands now he has no
life without it.''
</P>
<P>
   His son stopped talking to him shortly before the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was mad because I told him he needed to see a doctor _ he
was ill again,'' Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Rawlings called Smith regularly to get news of his
son. She said she could handle him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so sweet and good to him,'' Rawlings said. ``She was
the last person who should have gotten hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   After the murder, Rawlings spoke to his son in prison as he was
starting to recover. His son told him that he wouldn't have hurt
Smith, that he loved her.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Then who did? ' I asked him,'' Rawlings said. ``His face got
real white and he left. He was sick again for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rawlings, a retired banker, supports the rights of the
mentally ill and easier release of criminally insane persons who
are controlled by medication.
</P>
<P>
   Al Smith has been active in legal changes that have made such
releases more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Murder has put them each in a place where they must be, Rawlings
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this wouldn't have happened, we would have become
friends,'' he said. ``Our kids loved each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 73, also of Kansas City, told the court about the impact
of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our other daughter, who was eight years older than Terri and
who was especially close to her sister, attempted suicide three
times. She felt guilty because she had introduced Rawlings to
Terri.''
</P>
<P>
   One son's wife of nine years left him ``because she could not
handle the cloud of death which hung over our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Another son, who was schizophrenic but stabilized by medication,
started drinking heavily after his sister's death and suffered a
relapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``His health took an extreme turn for the worse and he died last
fall as a result of contracting pneumonia while hospitalized for a
broken hip,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The family's problems forced Smith to retire early from his job
at Bendix and his wife to retire from her job as a psychiatric
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, our subsequent retirement income has been
severely reduced and we have had to change our standard of living
considerably,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gary Rawlings Jr., Smith told the judge he should not be
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has demonstrated he is dangerous and surely one murder
should be enough to convince the court that caution should be in
favor of public safety,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Smith said his daughter was about to leave Gary
Rawlings Jr. when he killed her. He also said there was no point in
talking to the elder Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on different sides,'' he said. ``There's no way around
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men listened Friday as lawyers argued points the men knew
by heart.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Rawlings Jr. won his first conditional release in 1990 and
successfully completed seven releases. Medical officials confined
him in 1997 after he didn't take his medication. At that time he
lived at a Kansas City group home.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is asking to be released again and to live in the same
group home. Two medical experts testified that Gary Rawlings Jr.
was not a danger to the community.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors countered that he might kill again if he stopped
taking his medication.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, both fathers will learn Gary Rawlings Jr.'s future.
