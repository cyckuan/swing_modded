<HEADLINE> Education Remains Top Priority  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elementary and secondary school workers
accounted for almost 40 percent of the country's 14.7 million state
and local government employees in 1999, Census Bureau figures show.
</P>
<P>
   An agency report being released Friday said there were 5.76
million full-time school workers, or 39.2 percent of the state and
local government total. In 1998, they accounted for 39.7 percent,
or 5.72 million of the 14.4 million total.
</P>
<P>
   Higher education employees were next, at 1.7 million in 1999,
followed by hospital employees at 952,301.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries last year for elementary and secondary school workers
took up 37 percent of the payroll for nonfederal government
workers, or $16.2 billion of the $43.7 billion total. More than
$5.3 billion in salaries was paid to higher education workers while
the salaries of hospital employees came to more than $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   About 4.09 million of the school workers in 1999 were listed as
instructors, compared with 4.01 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The increases in education are slight despite hiring efforts
driven by teacher shortages nationwide. Over the decade, nearly a
million teachers will retire, the Education Department predicts,
while an estimated 2.2 million will have to replaced, due to
teachers quitting and increased enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings by the Census Bureau:
</P>
<P>
   --There were 849,063 law enforcement workers in 1999, compared
with 817,941 in 1998, while fire protection accounted for 289,590,
compared with 281,922.
</P>
<P>
   --Police accounted for more than $3 billion in salaries in 1999,
and fire protection more than $1.1 billion, compared with from $2.7
billion and $1.05 billion, respectively, in 1998.

   SUMPANGO, Guatemala (AP) -- It's after midnight in the soggy
woods when Mario Raveria takes the makeshift stage, delighting
hundreds of swaying Protestant evangelicals in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready to open our hearts!'' crows the closest thing
Guatemala has to Mick Jagger, twisting his torso and contorting his
neck to keep time with the music blaring from brass instruments at
his back. ''We are all here together and that is a miracle. We are
living a miracle!''
</P>
<P>
   Raveria, the most energetic of more than 50 pastors from 15
evangelical church congregations that hold outdoor worship here
every Saturday from 5 p.m. until dawn, says he lives for moments
like these.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's how I serve God,'' says the 48-year-old from Guatemala
City, about 20 miles from this hilly region of tomato fields and
soaring pine trees. ''I just get to do it in a way that is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, Guatemala has experienced a kind of
Protestant revolution. In their effort to win over Roman Catholics
who make up the majority here, Protestant evangelicals have argued
that they ''have more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument seems to be working, with new congregations popping
up all over the countryside. Liberal estimates now report that 3
out of 10 Guatemalans are Protestant evangelicals -- a figure
especially high for Catholic-dominated Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Efrain Rios Montt, an ordained evangelical minister, thrust the
faith in the spotlight for the first time here after taking over as
president in an August 1982 coup.
</P>
<P>
   During his term, Rios Montt often gave televised addresses to
the nation in which he went from passionate whispers to
podium-pounding bellows in a style not unlike that of the Rev.
Billy Graham. Rios Montt is now president of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the faith stronger than in Sumpango, where on a good
day 3,000 people show up for the revival.
</P>
<P>
   The site has about 15 tents, each set up by an individual church
and each with its own stage, its own musicians, its own preachers.
Each has its own huge generator used to power microphones,
synthesizers, mammoth concert speakers and hundreds of light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks, their beds teeming with dozens of poor farmers in
cowboy hats, arrive for the festivities behind sports cars and
station wagons packed with families and pets. Two commuter buses
have made the trip up the lone muddy road and are parked for the
night behind a clump of motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get here any way we can,'' says Byron Faustino Lopez, who
drove a moving van filled with 40 worshipers from his church in
nearby Chimaltenango to a recent revival. ''No one should miss
this.''
</P>
<P>
   They stream in from all over Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa
Rica to enjoy this religious free-for-all, guided by pastors who
sometimes spend eight hours at a time on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Mansilvia Baquet passes easily from joy to pain in her
music and has mastered a tearful wail that somehow does not fill
her congregation's tent with microphone feedback. Dancing and
singing, tears and prayers are nonstop: The scene is so intense
that it leaves many gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd, women in the pastel colors of traditional Mayan
clothing dance next to men in suits and silk ties and children
whose parents can't afford to buy them shoes.
</P>
<P>
   In another, more subdued church's tent, Pastor Melvin, who does
not use a last name, gives a sermon to mariachi music in Spanish
and two Mayan languages where the only common word is ''Dios,'' or
God.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a personal experience for each church and each
person,'' says Cristobal Quistinaya, an illiterate former drifter
who says he became the organizer of the weekly party after securing
permission to use the two-acre hilly stretch of forest that
Guatemala's largest religious gathering calls home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked for a spot to have this for seven years,'' Quistinaya
said. ''When I found this land last year I went to the mayor of the
region and told him that God wanted us to use it. He said, 'Who am
I to disagree with that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Quistinaya said each church pays weekly fees to rent the revival
site, which once served as training grounds for a rebel Indian army
during Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Quistinaya said initially skeptical Catholic neighbors have come
to accept the evangelists' late-night activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We work hard for God Monday through Friday, working for him
and loving him,'' Quistinaya said. ''Saturday we come to have a
good time, and no one can get mad at us for that.''

<HEADLINE> Uncle sentenced in slaying of 4-year-old nephew  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) - A Queens man was sentenced Thursday to 10
years in prison for his part in the murder of his 4-year-old nephew
on Christmas Eve 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk Circuit Judge Lydia C. Taylor spent five hours examining
evidence and listening to testimony before imposing the sentence on
Kyle K. Morton Sr., of Far Rockaway. She sentenced Morton to 20
years, with 10 of them suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence exceeded the state's recommended guidelines calling
for a maximum of six years, five months. Prosecutor Linda F.
Connell said the departure was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was an aggravated case of felony murder that warranted a
complete departure from the guidelines,'' Connell said after the
sentencing. ''There was a period of psychological torture and
terror here from the man who had custody of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton and his wife, Alison, 28, were arrested in March by New
York authorities. They were charged with murdering the boy, Kenze
Morton, who had been placed in their custody after a New York court
determined his mother provided inadequate care.
</P>
<P>
   Kenze was killed after ''acting up'' in a Norfolk apartment,
according to the Mortons' confessions. Alison Morton said she tied
him up and shoved him into a cupboard when she lost patience. Kyle
Morton stuffed a skull cap into Kenze's mouth, according to
investigators' notes, and Alison Morton later strangled the child
and went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the couple put Kenze into a weighted duffel bag
and threw his body into the Chesapeake Bay. The Mortons moved back
to New York soon after, and their crime wasn't discovered until
Kenze's jawbone washed up on the beach a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The Mortons both pleaded guilty to murder, and Alison Morton was
sentenced in March on a first-degree murder charge to 30 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Gordon Zedd told Taylor on Thursday that Kyle
Morton denied placing a skull cap in Kenze's mouth before his
death. Kyle Morton also said that he told his wife to untie Kenze
before the couple fell asleep on Christmas Eve, Zedd said.

<HEADLINE> TV Sets Stage for Bush's Speech  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The final image of the Republican National
Convention showed a podium laden with the sizable Bush clan and a
diverse display of the candidate's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a picture-perfect end to George W. Bush's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And for Dan Rather, it brought to mind the founding fathers who
had gathered there in Philadelphia two centuries ago. Since that
time, said the CBS anchor, the political process ''has gone from
James Madison to Madison Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, in recent election years, the conventions
increasingly have seemed like infomercials meant to sell a
candidate to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   And to exasperate journalists. For TV correspondents, the
Republican gathering in its final day remained a toy they had
wearied of right out of the box, as they looked ahead to more of
the same at the Democratic Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But first, there was The Speech. Gov. Bush's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just hours away from the most important speech of his life,''
began Tom Brokaw at the top of ''NBC Nightly News.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the mantra of convention coverage Thursday, although soon
Bush introduced his own: his oft-repeated applause lines, ''They
have not led; we will'' and ''It won't be long now.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bush began speaking about 10 p.m. Eastern, all the
networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS plus cable networks CNN, Fox News
Channel, MSNBC and C-SPAN -- were on board.
</P>
<P>
   And by that time, everyone, it seemed, had already expressed
themselves on what Bush should or shouldn't say.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on NBC from the Minnesota governor's mansion, former
pro wrestler Jesse Ventura, a political independent, body-slammed
both parties for their rhetoric: ''They cite a problem. They blame
the other side for it. Then they tell you they're going to fix it.
But they never tell you how.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Bush had begun, even the staging of his speech was
deconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   NBC News analyst Howard Fineman pointed out how decorative ferns
had been repositioned on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Former Republican speech writer Peggy Noonan marveled at the
downsized, college-classroom sort of lectern the nominee would use.
''It's utterly exposed, it's utterly undefended, it's utterly
observed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few minutes later, Noonan was on Fox News Channel, where
she blamed the media for the convention's mild-mannered tone.
Republicans, she said, ''don't want to give any excuse for the ...
electronic media to come at them saying, 'You're mean! You're
harsh!'''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's unexpected hospitalization of former President Ford
from a stroke had given the media a few hours' break from the
boilerplate convention. Through an accident of time and place, the
illness of a man who left the White House a quarter-century ago was
upstaging the man who wants to be its next resident.
</P>
<P>
   But as the networks supplied updates Thursday on Ford's
improving condition, viewers might have wondered if they were
learning more about the medical cause of strokes than how the
candidate aimed to improve education.
</P>
<P>
   Political humorists were happy to fill the gap. On CNN, Al
Franken cracked that, ''Thanks to George W., 60 percent of high
school seniors in Texas now read at a higher level than the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the Internet, the Modern Humorist's Web site
posted an ''advance'' copy of Bush's speech, titled ''United I
Stand'':
</P>
<P>
   ''To my parents, Dad and Bar, great parents, only a so-so
president. Just kidding, Dad, but you still don't get to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   And interviewed on CNN, E! fashion commentator Joan Rivers
declared that politicians' couture is fun to lampoon. ''You know
these women had to think: 'What can I wear to look good, and yet
not offend anybody?'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Rivers had just explained politics.

Bush Reaches Out to America
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- George W. Bush appealed to the nation Thursday night to
''grant me a mandate'' to lead and break the cycle of partisan Washington
feuding. Bush told cheering delegates he would help ''end the politics of fear''
and promised to work together with Democrats on pressing problems, including
shoring up the Social Security system and more accountability in education
policy. The cheers grew loudest when he vowed to pursue tax fairness and
anti-abortion laws. The Texas governor began his acceptance speech with a small
salute to the audience.
</P>

Bush Accepts Republican Presidential Nomination
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- George W. Bush accepted the Republican presidential
nomination Thursday night, presenting himself as an outsider who will return
''civility and respect'' to Washington politics. ''They have not led,'' he said
of the incumbent Democrats. ''We will.'' Republicans ended their 37th National
Convention in a mood of exuberant optimism, but Bush warned of a hard fight
ahead. ''I believe this will be a tough race, down to the wire,'' he said. Four
times, the two-term Texas governor said the Democrats had failed leadership
tests -- on tending to the military, on education, on Social Security and
Medicare and moral leadership.

Alaska Airlines Grounds 18 Jets
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alaska Airlines is grounding up to 18 Boeing MD-80
airliners for inspections of a part implicated in last January's crash that
killed 88 people, federal regulators said Thursday. The airline reported to the
Federal Aviation Administration that tools used to check jackscrews may have
produced incorrect readings. The jackscrew assembly consists of a nut that rides
up and down a screw as it turns to lift and lower the stabilizer. There are no
indications of problems, the FAA said, but the agency is alerting other airlines
using MD-80 planes -- as well as DC-9 jets, which are also affected -- to check
their planes.

Massachusetts and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. House Democratic leader Dick
Gephardt and New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen round out the short list, a
Democratic source familiar with the vice president's thinking said. Both have

<HEADLINE> Bill Parcells among friends posting bail for disgraced financier  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Former penny-stock tycoon Robert E. Brennan,
scrambling to make $500,000 bail on bankruptcy fraud charges, got
some help from former NFL coach Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, now director of football operations for the New York
Jets, was among those who gathered Thursday at the federal
courthouse here to post cash or securities for the disgraced
financier.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells chatted about deep-sea fishing with three other
associates of Brennan while waiting for a receipt at the court
clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speak to a reporter about Brennan, who had just
pleaded innocent to the charges at his arraignment at federal court
in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells posted $150,000 of the $500,000 federal bail set
Tuesday after Brennan's arrest, according to a legal source who
requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   About $236,000 will be posted in the form of mutual funds, said
defense lawyer Michael Critchley. He declined to say who owns those
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, of Sea Girt, coached the New York Giants to two Super
Bowl victories, and also coached the New England Patriots and the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   He is among the members of a private golf course developed at
Brennan's former horse farm in Colts Neck, Due Process Stables,
according to people familiar with the bankruptcy case.
</P>
<P>
   The property is among the assets seized to satisfy Brennan's
creditors, although Brennan still has an apartment in a gated
community there.
</P>
<P>
   He has been under house arrest at the property since Tuesday,
aside from court appearances, while awaiting the posting of the
$500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan arrived at the Newark courthouse to finalize his bail
shortly after Parcells left.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a lot of nice friends,'' said Brennan, a New Jersey
native whose official residence is in Juno Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed optimism about his case: ''I'm just going to deal
with it responsibly and bring it to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he drove away in a green Audi convertible with Florida
plates.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 56, was also charged Tuesday by state authorities in
connection with his bankruptcy, and was released on $250,000 bail
soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley declined to say who posted that money.
</P>
<P>
   Once the federal bail is complete, Brennan is allowed to stay in
New Jersey, New York or Florida, but must use a commercial carrier,
not a private aircraft, for travel.
</P>
<P>
   The two indictments unsealed with his arrest charge that Brennan
attempted to hide from creditors over $500,000 he got from cashing
casino chips less than a month after he filed for bankruptcy in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   They are the first criminal charges ever faced by Brennan after
two decades of clashes with stock regulators.
</P>
<P>
   He became publicly known in the 1980s through his television
commercials for his former flagship brokerage, First Jersey
Securities Inc., stepping off a helicopter and urging viewers to
''come grow with us.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his bankruptcy proceeding, he had to sell his
interest in and resign as chairman of International Thoroughbred
Breeders Inc., which operated two New Jersey horse tracks, Garden
State Park and Freehold Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   During his arraignment in Trenton, U.S. District Court Judge
Garrett E. Brown Jr. allowed Brennan to waive his right to change
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose after prosecutors asserted that Critchley has a
conflict of interest because he is one of Brennan's creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan quietly answered the judge's questions, saying he
understood that Critchley's interests could run counter to his own
and he that he knowingly waived his right to change counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Critchley said Brennan owes him about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley said the government's case is based solely on
documents from a Las Vegas casino, The Mirage. Those documents, he
contends, are wrong and ''fundamentally flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Trial dates have not been set.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 3, Rangers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Frank Castillo won his seventh straight decision
as the Toronto Blue Jays ended their six-game losing streak, 3-1
over the Texas Rangers on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo (8-5) hasn't lost since June 1. The right-hander
allowed just one run on four hits in seven innings. He struck out
four and didn't walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing consecutive singles to lead off the sixth,
Castillo turned a double play by making a sprawling catch in front
of the mound on a ball hit by Dave Martinez. He then threw to
second to double up Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, who barely made the club out of spring training, has
been Toronto's second best starter this season. He's won seven of
his last nine starts, and has gone at least seven innings in six of
those starts.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Woodward, who entered the game hitting .188, hit a
tiebreaking two-out single off Kenny Rogers in the sixth to give
Toronto a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (10-9) allowed two runs on seven hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Jays went ahead 3-1 on Shannon Stewart's RBI infield single
in the eighth off Jeff Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Guthrie, acquired by Toronto on Monday from Tampa Bay,
struck out Chad Curtis -- the only batter he faced -- to end the
eighth inning. Billy Koch pitched the ninth for his 25th save in 29
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler's 10th homer, a solo shot in the second gave Texas a
1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Rogers allowed a double to Jose Cruz, and a walk to Darrin
Fletcher in the bottom half, Marty Cordova tied it with a single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Castillo was 1-5 after 11 starts. ... Toronto DH Brad
Fullmer broke two bats on consecutive swings in the fifth inning.
... Toronto's Raul Mondesi, on the 15-day disabled list with
ligament damage in his right elbow, played catch before the game.
... Kapler has six home runs in his last 15 games. He extended his
hitting streak to 17 games. ... Guthrie took the loss in his Blue
Jays debut Wednesday at Oakland.

<HEADLINE> Raul Mondesi May Be Lost for Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Raul Mondesi's injured right elbow might cost him
the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to lose my career for two months,'' said the Blue
Jays star outfielder, who has ligament damage and chips in the
elbow. ''I want to help the team win but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi has been told by three doctors that he needs surgery.
The 29 year-old right-fielder, hitting .272 with 24 homers and 67
RBIs, can't even straighten out his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi said he can either have the surgery now, and not miss
the start of next season, or wait until after the season and be out
until May.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would see how it feels in a week and then decide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to play 10 more years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, on the 15-day disabled list, played a light game of
catch before the game. He just returned from a Florida visit with
Dr. John Uribe, who works with the Miami Dolphins
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi already saw team doctor Allan Gross and orthopedic
surgeon Dr. Frank Jobe of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays have struggled since Mondesi was injured in a July
21 game. Toronto ended their six-game losing streak Thursday with a
3-1 over Texas. They began the day 5&AMP;frac12; games behind the first-place
New York Yankees in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi was acquired from the Los Angeles Dodgers last November
for Shawn Green.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Patient Shoots Doctor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALISBURY, N.C. (AP) -- An 83-year-old patient shot and wounded a
doctor at a Veterans Affairs hospital before the gunman was killed
by police.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Reid of Rowan, a patient at the W.G. Hefner VA Medical
Center, was being examined by Dr. Charles Flynn when Reid pulled
out a small-caliber handgun Thursday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn was shot once in the chest, authorities said. Another
physician and two nurses escaped and called for the hospital's
police.
</P>
<P>
   Salisbury Police Deputy Chief Mark Wilhelm said Reid shot at the
officers, who fired back and struck Reid. He died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, 42, of Lexington, was flown to Wake Forest University
Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, where he was in critical
condition early Friday, said Barbara Lee, a nursing official.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how Reid got a handgun into the VA hospital or
why family members had requested he be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will look into this situation to find out what happened and
how it happened,'' VA hospital spokeswoman Nancy Martino said.

<HEADLINE> Baby Poisoned by Rockies' Key Chain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A 10-month-old child got lead poisoning after
handling and sucking on a Colorado Rockies key chain given out at a
1998 game, health officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Keely Walton did not show any symptoms of lead poisoning, and
the high lead levels in her blood were discovered during routine
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Keli McGregor of the Rockies said the team is cooperating with
health officials and will exchange any of the key chains for safe
ones. About 40,000 key chains were distributed as promotions during
the 1998 and 1999 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The key chains had a miniature metal baseball glove attached
them. Laboratory tests showed they had high lead content.

Bush Reaches Out to Americans
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- George W. Bush appealed to the nation Thursday night to
''grant me a mandate'' to lead and break the cycle of partisan Washington
feuding. Bush told cheering delegates he would help ''end the politics of fear''
and promised to work together with Democrats on pressing problems, including
shoring up the Social Security system and more accountability in education
policy. The cheers grew loudest when he vowed to pursue tax fairness and
anti-abortion laws. The Texas governor began his acceptance speech with a small
salute to the audience.

Bush Accepts GOP Presidential Nomination
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Presenting himself as an outsider who will return
''civility and respect'' to Washington politics, George W. Bush accepted the
Republican presidential nomination Thursday night. ''They have not led,'' he
said of the incumbent Democrats. ''We will.'' Republicans ended their 37th
National Convention in a mood of exuberant optimism, but Bush warned of a hard
fight ahead. ''I believe this will be a tough race, down to the wire,'' he said.
Four times, the two-term Texas governor said the Democrats had failed leadership
tests -- on tending to the military, on education, on Social Security and
Medicare and moral leadership.

Education Remains Top Priority
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elementary and secondary school workers accounted for
almost 40 percent of the country's 14.7 million state and local government
employees in 1999, Census Bureau figures show. An agency report being released
Friday said there were 5.76 million full-time school workers, or 39.2 percent of
the state and local government total. In 1998, they accounted for 39.7 percent,
or 5.72 million of the 14.4 million total. Higher education employees were next,
at 1.7 million in 1999, followed by hospital employees at 952,301.

Ford Plays It Safe With Larger SUVs
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. might have promised to increase the
fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles, but a new version of the Ford
Explorer was built using the formula the world's No. 2 maker of cars and trucks
has found lucrative so far -- bigger and stronger. The 2002 version of the
Explorer, the industry's top-selling SUV, offers a more powerful engine and more
interior space over the current model. Ford made few stylistic changes to the
popular SUV, though, having learned a costly lesson a few years ago, when a
jarring redesign of the Taurus sedan drove many customers away.

Alaska Airlines Grounds 18 Jets
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alaska Airlines is grounding up to 18 Boeing MD-80
airliners for inspections of a part implicated in last January's crash that
killed 88 people, federal regulators said Thursday. The airline reported to the
Federal Aviation Administration that tools used to check jackscrews may have
produced incorrect readings. The jackscrew assembly consists of a nut that rides
up and down a screw as it turns to lift and lower the stabilizer. There are no
indications of problems, the FAA said, but the agency is alerting other airlines
using MD-80 planes -- as well as DC-9 jets, which are also affected -- to check
their planes.

<HEADLINE> Museums Seek Convention Collectables  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE FEINSILBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- To the Republican convention of political
junkies, the Smithsonian Institution dispatched two political junk
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of Harry Rubenstein and Larry Bird, curators at the
Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington,
was to procure memorabilia to add to the 90,000 objects already in
the museum's political history collection.
</P>
<P>
   Funny hat? Larry and Harry wanted it. Screaming poster? They
snagged it. Catchy button? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   They left for home loaded with stuff. They snagged one of the
green signs carried by farm state delegates that showed a tractor
and played on the George Bush's baseball background. ''Bush Farm
Team,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   They got a rattle noisemaker with a pompom on it, a promise from
a Delaware delegate that he'd mail them a tri-corner hat worn on
the convention floor, a red ''sponge noodle'' -- a long piece of
foam rubber that is shaken in the air. And a poster saluting Bush's
wife (''Laura 4 First Lady'').
</P>
<P>
   They were impressed that delegates brought plank cardboard onto
the floor and made signs to suit the moment. Massachusetts
delegates who had been pledged to John McCain before he released
them made signs reading, ''Massachusetts McCainiacs for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   They failed, though, to snag a Bush-Cheney banner that was
rolled up but unfurled from a huge balloon upon Dick Cheney's
nomination. The balloonmeister was afraid if he let them cut free
one of the banners others would get the same idea.
</P>
<P>
   Their prize catch, the one item that, in a hundred years, will
say to museum visitors, ''Republicans in the year 2000,'' was one
of the 360-degree interactive cameras that provided convention
coverage for the Pseudo.com web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the first Internet convention,'' said Bird.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, at the GOP conclave in San Diego, Calif., the prize was
simpler: a handmade Dole hat. Everyone in the Ohio delegation wore
one.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had gone to the trouble of covering a balloon with
papier mache, spray painting it yellow, then pasting on green
cardboard fronds. The result was a hat that looked like a
pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   Pineapple. ... Dole pineapple. ... Dole. ... Bob Dole. Get it?
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the pineapple hat is now a Smithsonian artifact.
Before showing it off to a visitor, Bird carefully pulled on white
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading a delegate to give up a piece of political
memorabilia isn't always easy. If they can't snag it on the spot,
the curators hand a business card to the possessor and hope he'll
mail it to them after the convention. Sometimes it works.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much of this stuff is ephemeral, designed for the moment,''
said Rubenstein. ''We're there for the moment between the
convention and the trash can.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late they learned about a protest sign that Texas delegates
painted and waved while Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., an announced
homosexual, addressed the convention. ''There Is A Way Out,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sighed Bird: ''That sign is now in a landfill somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The curators aren't interested only in homemade stuff. They
haunted vendors' tables, bagging elephants in every manifestation.
Later this month they'll go to Los Angeles, when the Democrats
meet, to harvest donkey stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Bird says political paraphernalia plays a role in conventions
beyond levity. The delegates have no direct way to communicate with
the party leaders, he said. So what they wear speaks for them.
</P>
<P>
   He illustrates with a yellow scarf what abortion-rights
delegates wore in 1996 in opposition to the GOP plank that called
for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion. ''Yank the
Plank,'' said the scarves.
</P>
<P>
   Splotches of waving yellow made the point that year that not
everyone liked the platform's anti-choice plank. ''A kind of subtle
debate,'' said Bird.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian holds far more in its collection than it could
possibly put on display, but the best of what the curators captured
here will go into an exhibition, ''The American Presidency,''
opening in November.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Moving To West Bank  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALMON, West Bank (AP) -- Last week, just days after Israeli
negotiators discussed handing this part of the West Bank over to
the Palestinians, Orly Tel-Kar and her husband moved to a tiny
Jewish settlement near the Palestinian city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the intensifying peace talks, they are among about 560
families that have settled in the West Bank this summer, according
to the head of a regional council.
</P>
<P>
   Some are there as a political statement, demonstrating their
belief that the West Bank belongs to the Jews, not the
Palestinians. Others are lured by subsidized housing prices and
open spaces away from crowded cities.
</P>
<P>
   All could lose their new homes if the Israelis and Palestinians
reach a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But many settlers, including Tel-Kar, are betting that will not
happen. They took heart from the failure of the Israeli-Palestinian
summit at Camp David outside Washington last month, when Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were
unable to agree on a peace framework.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we moved in the Camp David talks had already collapsed,''
Tel-Kar said. ''Who knows, maybe Barak's next attempt will fail,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 Israelis live in 144 settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. Barak favors keeping blocs of settlements under
Israeli control, while carving up the West Bank so the Palestinians
would get more than 90 percent of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The future of settlements like Talmon, near Palestinian cities,
would be cloudy under Barak's plan. Either they would be dismantled
or the settlers would have to live under Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians demand that all the settlements be removed.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,300 housing units are under construction in the West
Bank, according to Peace Now, a dovish watchdog group. About 4,200
others are completed but empty.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Cohen, a landscape architect living in this hilltop
settlement, said people here are aware of the plan to evacuate
isolated settlements.
</P>
<P>
   But they have an ideological commitment to settling in the West
Bank coupled with a desire for quality of life, said Cohen, 31,
wearing the crocheted skullcap characteristic of the Orthodox
Jewish settlers who lead the drive to retain the territory for
religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of settlers come to the West Bank for earthly
reasons. ''They don't want to live in the urban sprawl of greater
Tel Aviv,'' Cohen said. ''They are looking for clear mountain air,
a fine view, a crime-free community and good schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of government subsidies, settlement housing is a
fraction of the cost of city apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Pinhas Wallerstein, the head of Binyamin Regional Council, said
that in his region -- which includes Talmon -- 3,000 housing units
have been started this year and 1,400 have been completed. The
Housing Ministry confirmed the figures.
</P>
<P>
   Six families have settled in Talmon in the past two months and
nine more are due to move in by September, said Meira Dolev, a
member of the absorption committee at Talmon. That is a 15 percent
increase in single summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people expected a drop in the numbers due to the Camp
David negotiations,'' Dolev said, ''but it just didn't happen.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Confident Heading To L.A.  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It's crunch time for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Los Angeles, the challenge for Al Gore is to match
the boost in the polls that the Republicans received from their
just-concluded convention. Leaving Philadelphia, Bush has a
double-digit lead and has moved ahead among key groups like women
and independents.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Democrats have repeated the mantra that it's too
early to worry about polls and voters aren't yet paying attention.
But with the Democratic National Convention set to begin 10 days
from now, those days are just about over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Campaigns use issues, positions, principles and the
personality of the candidate to add brushstrokes to the picture by
Election Day,'' said Republican pollster Ed Goeas. ''The picture is
beginning to be painted.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Philadelphia went to great lengths to portray
their party as more diverse, more tolerant and more positive than
in past years. The convention seemed to play well across the
country, even if the TV audience was limited.
</P>
<P>
   Polls bore that out. The Bush lead over Gore grew to 14 points
by Thursday in a bipartisan tracking poll, with significant gains
among two groups where the two had been tied -- independents (now an
18-point Bush lead) and women (now a 6-point lead.)
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were incensed by the GOP's efforts to present a more
diverse image by asking blacks, Hispanics and a gay congressman,
among other minorities, to address the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're using these people as props,'' said Joe Andrew,
Democratic national chairman. ''We don't have to go out and find
African-American and Hispanic kids to put on our stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rendell, general chairman of the Democrats, called it a
charade engineered by Karl Rove, a senior adviser to Bush. ''It has
no connection to reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, the Bush campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These attacks are indicative of the fact that they have
legitimate concerns that Governor Bush is making inroads with new
constituencies,'' said spokesman Dan Bartlett. ''The governor has
proven it in the state of Texas, getting almost half the Hispanic
vote in 1998. He has backed up his words with results.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are working to change the dynamics of the race, which
has wavered all year between a Bush advantage and a close contest.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gore chooses a running mate and the two will hit the
campaign trail for the rest of the week, with the states they pick
dependent on his choice. Then they will stop through several
battleground states on the way to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In 17 battleground states, surrogates will contrast Democratic
policies and accomplishments with the Republican claims and their
record.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention Aug. 14-17, President Clinton and wife,
Hillary, will speak, along with Caroline Kennedy, Bill Bradley, Ted
Kennedy and Jesse Jackson. The full schedule has not been
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our convention will show that Al Gore is on their side, ready
to be president and he's got the right ideas to build on our
progress,'' said Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.
Polls suggest Democrats have the advantage on the issues of health
care, the environment and Social Security. Gore has not yet
convinced voters he is stronger than Bush on the economy, despite
the financial boom of the last eight years, or education, a top
voter priority.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to whittle away at the Bush lead in the polls could
be tricky for Democrats, and especially Gore. Polls suggest many
people have grown weary of partisan squabbling in the wake of the
impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''About 40 percent of Americans don't like Gore,'' said Merle
Black, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. ''The
more he makes these attacks, the higher his negatives could go.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Republican advantages from holding their convention
first, he sees opportunities for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''By going second, Gore has an opportunity to recover,'' Black
said. He's got to unify the Democrats, while reaching out to
independents. This will be a test of leadership.''

<HEADLINE> Twins Days Marks 25th Year  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN DIMAURO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TWINSBURG, Ohio (AP) -- Once just a simple ceremony honoring twin
brothers, the Twins Days festival has doubled and doubled and
doubled -- literally.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 25th year, the annual event is expected to attract
3,000 sets of twins, triplets and quadruplets to this city just
southeast of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea it would be this big,'' Tom Garaghan, who was
parade marshal for the first festival in 1976, said Thursday. ''I
thought, maybe, it would go to 150, 200 twins. The twins are who
made it big.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 event drew 2,798 sets, earning a place in the Guinness
Book of Records for the world's largest gathering of twins. But the
event was dethroned last November when 3,961 pairs converged in
Taipei, Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The annual celebration began in 1976, when 36 pairs of twins
gathered to honor Aaron and Moses Wilcox with a parade and the
dedication of the Wilcox Twins Monument on the square. Originally
called Millsville, the town was renamed for the brothers, who
donated land toward a town square and money for the village's first
school.
</P>
<P>
   The first celebration almost became the last.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1977, the idea of hosting a festival fell dormant until
about May,'' said Andrew Miller, executive director of the festival
committee and the father of twins. ''Then a group of planners
decided they'd better do something because it would be hard to get
re-established in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival was opened to the public the following year,
drawing researchers and scientists interested in genetic research.
It garnered national attention in 1981 after the Public
Broadcasting Service aired footage from the event on the science
show ''Nova.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's celebration begins Friday and runs through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   LaVona and LaVelda Richmond, of Aurora, Ill., have come to the
festival every year since 1977, when they first visited while
honeymooning with their husbands, twin brothers Alwin and Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in matching straw hats adorned with silk flowers, the
66-year-old twin sisters were back in town Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a place to come and let your hair down,'' LaVona Richmond
said. ''And no one will criticize you for who you are, whether you
look alike or dress differently.''

<P>
   SUNDANCE, Utah (AP) -- Kathy Hammons is ready for a wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   She just put a new metal roof on her house and spent the last
few weeks clearing brush between her aspen trees. The dry grass
along the road is cut short and she knows exactly how long nearby
hydrants can hold out.
</P>
<P>
   In this summer of fire, Hammons and everyone else across the
West cannot be too careful. It is the worst fire season in decades,
with more than 3.7 million acres burned so far.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Hammons drove the narrow roads that lead to the
resort's 350 homes, all tucked between dry pines and oak and that
haven't burned for at least a century. In the background, smoke
billows from a fire smoldering in the next canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're going to artificially keep fire from doing what
Mother Nature wants it to do, then we have to take
responsibility,'' Hammons said.
</P>
<P>
   Sundance, about 45 miles outside Salt Lake City, has been cited
as a model for fire protection. It makes good use of ''defensible
space,'' ample room around a building for crews to safely fight off
fire.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds simple. But defensible space can mean giving up the
things homeowners treasure -- the forest at the doorstep, with tall
pines hanging over the house and a narrow, wooded driveway. For
firefighters, such luxuries are deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have several multimillion-dollar homes that are absolutely
non-defensible, so that we would not even send a firefighter in
there if the fire was in close,'' said Rick Lynsky, a district
chief in the Park City Fire District, where new homes are springing
up on the hillsides every day -- like they are across much of the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Lynsky said firefighters have long declared homes winners or
losers on sight. In California, he said, wildfire crews have even
run out ahead of the engines to mark doomed homes with bands of red
tape.
</P>
<P>
   Hammons, who co-chairs the North Fork Fire &AMP; Safety Advisory
Council, pointed out a few winners -- and losers, with their old
wood-shingled roofs, log piles on the front porch and underbrush
stacked like kindling.
</P>
<P>
   Her group has fought since its foundation a year ago to swing
the balance. The council informs property owners what they should
do to help stave off fires, from clearing empty lots to installing
new roofs. The group has raised money for emergency alert systems
and designed an evacuation plan if fire ever hits the narrow
canyon.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a statewide team formed by the Forest Service,
Bureau of Land Management and others. The National Interagency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho, has sent teams of fire education officers
around the West, including Utah, Nevada and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hammons is keeping watch on the fire nearby and another about 20
miles up the road that has burned 800 acres and forced the
evacuations of 11 homes. Her bags are packed, her neighbors' cat
carrier is at the ready and the escape route through the narrow
canyon has been coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all moved in and thought, someone else will take of it,''
she said. ''Now we know better.''

<HEADLINE> GOPs Look Towards Local Races  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Maybe it's just the flush that comes from a
smooth convention, a healthy bounce in the polls and days of
partying.
</P>
<P>
   But state Republican leaders leave their national convention
Friday with hopes, even expectations, that the Bush-Cheney ticket
will push them to victory in uphill and tight local races.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to happen,'' said Morton Blackwell, a national
committeeman from Virginia, likening George W. Bush to Ronald
Reagan for his personality and ability to bring together opposing
wings of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Take Indiana, where GOP Rep. David McIntosh hopes to topple a
sitting governor, Democrat Frank O'Bannon. The challenger is
getting help on the campaign trail from Bush, Blackwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana race is just one of scores of competitive battles
across the nation -- for Congress, control of legislatures, even
referendums.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the top of the ticket is someone you really believe in and
you have faith that they are doing the right thing, that buoys
everyone in the campaigns,'' said Matt Denny, Montana's state
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the latest results: polls that show Bush went from a
dead heat with Al Gore to a double-digit lead; and a remarkably
unified Republican Party, in sharp contrast to divisions in 1992
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some went so far to hope for the nationwide coattails that
Ronald Reagan brought in 1980; others were more cautious, saying
it's far too early for such expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, many conservatives and moderates say, their
differences seem less important than the goal of taking back the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   If the unity and energy here can translate into enthusiasm among
GOP voters at home, that will benefit tight state races, said Paul
Helmke, the former GOP mayor of Fort Wayne, Ind. He blamed his
unsuccessful Senate bid in 1998, in part, on a lack of energy among
Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have to change anybody's mind from 'D' to 'R,'''
Helmke said. Just get your supporters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Republicans are really energized, as they say they are,
they might turn out and vote, and vote for the lower races as
well,'' said Roger Hartley, who teaches American politics at
Roanoke College in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Republican hope in the race for governor in Indiana,
in Sen. Rod Grams' re-election effort in Minnesota, in a South
Carolina fight against a lottery pushed by a Democratic governor.
And in Washington state, where the fight is on for control of the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a numbers man,'' said Mike Gaston, a chemical engineer and
Washington state committeeman. ''A 2 or 3 percent Bush bump, which
we fully expect, will turn the House to a Republican majority and,
more importantly, take back the state Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this affair in Philadelphia is just one side of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a week, Democrats convene in Los Angeles,
hoping to counter the GOP bounce and energize their voter base.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm guessing that the Democratic delegates will be saying the
same thing,'' said Professor June Speakman, who teaches politics at
Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I. She's also active in
local Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans here remained cautious. ''It could change
yet,'' Helmke said. ''Elections aren't won in August.''
</P>
<P>
   But as leaders and candidates return home, the message came
clear.
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh tried it out with his supporters at a reception speech:
''We can say to the people of Indiana, you can have the same great
leadership you have with George W. Bush in the White House.''

<HEADLINE> Convention Protest Leaders Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Even their critics admit the Philadelphia
police force did a pretty good job handling protests surrounding
the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have the worst of what happened in Seattle,'' said
Stefan Presser, legal director of the local American Civil
Liberties Union. ''We didn't have mace. We didn't have tear gas. We
didn't have people swept up who had nothing to do with the
demonstrators.''
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a change for the often criticized force, which was
embarrassed just last month when several officers were caught on
videotape kicking and beating suspect Thomas Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm certainly not proud of them, but they were more subdued
than I expected compared to the reputation of Philadelphia,''
protester Bernadette Moreno, 18, of Pittsburgh said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That's high praise from a protester for a force with a history
of brutality, corruption and racism dating back to the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was obvious they knew what they were doing. That's a big
change for Philadelphia,'' said Temple University professor James
Fyfe, a former New York City police officer. ''In a way the Jones
situation had a good effect because the cops were very concerned of
the criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia NAACP President J. Whyatt Mondesire agreed that
police officers seem to have taken a lesson from the videotaped
beating.
</P>
<P>
   ''As incredible as it sounds, the beating of Thomas Jones
probably saved these kids a couple of beatings, a couple of
lumps,'' said Mondesire, one of the most vocal critics of police
for the Jones' beating.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesire said he told Commissioner John Timoney, injured in a
clash with protesters, that he was impressed by police this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hugged him and said you are now known as John 'Rambo'
Timoney,'' Mondesire said.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested more than 300 protesters Tuesday during
sometimes-violent brawls with officers, 15 of whom were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Presser accused police of partially inciting Tuesday night's
violence by raiding a warehouse that protesters had used as a
staging area. About 70 people were arrested at the site, which
organizers said was used for making signs and puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney dismissed Presser's accusation and defended the
warehouse arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been assured we have probable cause to make those
arrests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Rev. Al Sharpton led a march of about 50
protesters in front of the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office,
criticizing the Jones beating. Sharpton, a civil rights activist,
said the officers who hit and kicked Jones should be arrested.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Bypasses Hill With Move  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton took advantage of a
congressional recess to make Bill Lann Lee his assistant attorney
general for civil rights, a move that could further deepen his
standoff with the Senate over judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announcement, made without comment while Clinton
was playing golf Thursday, comes nearly three years after the
president named Lee as his main civil rights enforcer on an acting
basis to circumvent heavy Republican opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action allows Lee to hold the post through the end of
Clinton's term in January without sending his nomination to
Congress for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., ranking Democrat on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said Republican recalcitrance forced Clinton
to give Lee a recess appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way they have treated Bill Lann Lee has been petty and
steeped in partisan vinegar,'' Leahy said. ''It has been a direct
insult to him and to all who care about civil rights enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, whose committee
would have sat in judgment on a Lee nomination, said Clinton was
the one playing partisan politics by installing Lee during the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing of this decision serves as further evidence of what
we have come to know is true: The Clinton-Gore White House is
intent on dividing our people rather than uniting us for the common
good,'' Hatch said. He added that he personally likes Lee and
''would support him in any number of positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno praised Lee's record during the
three years he served in an acting capacity, saying many of his
cases were resolved through settlements or consensual agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill believes very strongly that how we resolve a matter is
sometimes as important as what the particular resolution is,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton notified Senate leaders late last year that he might
install 13 languishing nominees through recess appointments, which
don't require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's nomination was among five that were vigorously opposed by
a group of Republicans who indicated they might retaliate against
recess appointments by blocking all judicial nominees for the rest
of Clinton's term, which ends Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   A leader in the GOP opposition, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said
Thursday he was irked that Clinton did not deliver a list of
proposed appointments well in advance of the congressional recess
as he had promised.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, I think we can stop these,'' he said. ''I oppose the
action. We're going to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a total of 13 appointments Thursday, the majority
to non-controversial positions. The president also appointed
another of the five opposed nominees Thursday, making Sally Katzen
deputy director for management at the Office of Management and
Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has groused publicly that some of his judicial
nominations -- notably, those of minorities and women -- are hung up
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said Lee's situation is part of a four-year pattern under
which Clinton's nominees, ''especially women and minorities, have
been subjected to anonymous and humiliating delays before they get
a vote, if they ever get a vote at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first nominated Lee, a former lawyer for the NAACP Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, on July 21, 1997. In December 1997,
Clinton installed Lee as acting assistant attorney general for
civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Lee an indefinite hold on the job and was considered
less confrontational than invoking constitutional power for a
recess appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nominated Lee again in January and March 1998, but no
action has been taken since.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, the president can temporarily bypass the
Senate confirmation process by giving an individual an appointment
during a congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Clinton used a recess appointment to install San
Francisco businessman James Hormel, who is homosexual, as
ambassador to Luxembourg. Hormel's nomination had been blocked in
Congress for two years.

<HEADLINE> Bush Accepts GOP Nomination  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Opening a 95-day countdown to the election,
Republicans George W. Bush and Dick Cheney charge side-by-side into
Midwest battleground states Friday pledging to ''use these good
times for great goals'' if they succeed in winning the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor claimed the GOP nomination Thursday night in
a deafening convention celebration and deluge of balloons and
confetti. There was a mood of exuberant optimism about Bush's
chances -- he is ahead in the polls -- but he cautioned that ''this
will be a tough race, down to the wire'' with Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing his rival of trying to scare Americans about his
proposals for Social Security, Medicare and tax reform, Bush said
Gore ''now leads the party of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. But the
only thing he has to offer is fear itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and running mate Cheney will try to build on the
convention's momentum by campaigning together in a three-day train
ride across Ohio, Michigan and Illinois -- states carried by Bill
Clinton and Al Gore in 1992 and 1996 but now prime targets for both
sides. Together, the three states offer 61 of the 270 electoral
votes needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before a convention eager for a partisan edge, Bush was
unforgiving in assessing President Clinton, the man who pushed
Bush's father from the White House eight years ago. He said the
Clinton-Gore administration failed to take advantage of the
nation's prosperity to solve tough problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our current president embodied the potential of a generation.
So many talents. So much charm. Such great skill,'' Bush said.
''But in the end, to what end? So much promise, to no great
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a time for third chances,'' he said of Gore's bid
to succeed Clinton. ''It is a time for new beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton and Gore, he said, ''We have seen a steady erosion
of American power and an unsteady exercise of American influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Four times he brought the convention to its feet by declaring:
''They had their chance. They have not led. We will.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising a subject that other speakers had avoided as too
controversial, Bush expressed support for anti-abortion laws but
acknowledged that ''good people disagree on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Reciting campaign pledges, Bush promised in broad terms to
''strengthen Social Security and repair Medicare'' and make
prescription drugs ''available and affordable for every senior who
needs them.'' He said he would abolish the federal estate tax,
which affects about 2 percent of Americans in the highest income
brackets, cut income tax rates and double the child tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Give me a mandate,'' he said, ''and I will use it.''
</P>
<P>
   On a key military issue, Bush pledged to deploy a missile
defense system -- despite opposition from Russia and American allies
who fear it will trigger a nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Poking fun at both Clinton and Gore, Bush said, ''I do not need
to take your pulse before I know my own mind. I do not reinvent
myself at every turn. I am not running in borrowed clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that's a man. You can be tough but tender,'' said North
Carolina state Rep. Jean Preston.
</P>
<P>
   ''Home run after home run,'' intoned Arizona delegate Don
Ascoli.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders praised Bush's speech. ''He has a different
attitude, and that came through loud and clear,'' said
Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci. ''People are tired of
divisiveness. I think they see he's a different kind of
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert said, ''I think our members are so
pumped up, we're going to get out of here and just start really
rolling.'' Rep. George Nethercutt of Washington said, ''He's got
great vision. We'll get to the details later.''
</P>
<P>
   Former New Hampshire Gov. Walter Peterson raised an eyebrow
about Bush's delivery. ''I noticed his stern demeanor and a lack of
a smile, which was attributed to natural nervousness,'' Peterson
said. ''I didn't see him smile once. It was a well-crafted speech.
I don't doubt regular Republicans were very united behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Democrats did not like Bush's address.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all the happy rhetoric, despite all the smiling faces,
despite all the scripted displays of 'inclusion,' Bush-Cheney is
the same old mean-spirited and divisive Republican ticket,'' the
Democratic National Committee charged.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's convention opens Aug. 14 when Democrats gather in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A two-term governor who tried his hand in the oil business and
ran a baseball team, Bush presented himself as an outsider without
a stake in Washington's long-running political battles. He said he
may ''lack the polish of Washington. Then again, I don't have a lot
of things that come with Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Portraying himself as a leader who can deal with Democrats, Bush
said, ''I want to change the tone of Washington to one of civility
and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   After his train ride in the Midwest, Bush heads to the West
Coast, where Sen. John McCain is to join him for campaigning in
California, Oregon and Washington state. The Arizona senator won
seven primaries last winter and demonstrated a strong appeal to
independent voters whose votes will be critical in November.

<HEADLINE> Convention Talk Delivers Amusement  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- George W. Bush has been known to stumble
over words on occasion, but having that happen during his big
speech would not do.
</P>
<P>
   So the script he was reading from a screen took special care to
help him through one tricky word: nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   The script spelled it: nuke-lee-er.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to be the only word spelled phonetically in the
rolling script.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the New Hampshire primary campaign, Bush spoke about the
need for ''tackular'' nuclear weapons instead of tactical ones, and
praised single mothers who work hard ''to put food on your
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Two Georgia delegates smuggled 60 bottles of children's soap
bubbles and a half dozen bubble launchers into the convention hall
for Thursday night's final session.
</P>
<P>
   ''Call it operation luminescent translucent orb,'' quipped B.J.
Van Gundy of suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy and his co-conspirator, state Rep. Gene Callaway,
spent the afternoon in their hotel room peeling the tin foil tops
off all 60 bottles so they wouldn't set off the metal detectors at
the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, Van Gundy and Callaway passed out their bubble
launchers and wands to fellow Georgia delegates. Before long, the
air near the podium was filled with bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The balloons came down in such great numbers that Tennesseans
were up to their knees in them -- when they were standing on chairs.
People on parts of the floor were up to their waist. Indoor
fireworks also fired up the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Indiana and Kentucky vied for basketball bragging rights. New
Jersey laid claim to Ellis Island and New Yorkers booed in
response.
</P>
<P>
   Such were the mini-disputes when state delegations announced
their votes during the roll call making Bush the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basketball capital of the world,'' Indiana claimed. Indiana
University is one of the nation's top basketball teams and the
National Basketball Association Pacers reached the finals earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Kentucky, where the University of Kentucky in recent
years has been more successful than Indiana. ''The real basketball
capital of the world,'' thundered Sen. Mitch McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boooooooo,'' came the response from Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey announced itself as the home of Ellis Island. The
Supreme Court ruled, over the objections of New York, that most of
the island, indeed, was in New Jersey. But the Garden State
announcement drew a round of boos from the New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   All right, it was a blast. Great balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's blow this town. (Or rather, this convention center out
here among the oil refineries.)
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I have a highlight, '' Maryland Rep. Wayne
Gilchrest said, ''except mid-afternoon when I get home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilchrest, it has to be said, came with a bad attitude.
</P>
<P>
   He thought it was going to be ''a coming root canal ... a
heartburn without Tums.'' A moderate, he worried the right would be
divisive. But he left happier than he came.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Out with wedge politics. In with wedgie politics.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush aired the family's laundry when he
announced his state delegation's votes on behalf of his brother,
George W. Bush, at the Republican National Convention on Thursday
night. He touched on a ''unique aspect'' of his state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor of the state, and perhaps the governor of the
state of Texas, is the only person on this floor that has had his
mouth washed out by the greatest, most popular woman in the
world,'' Jeb Bush said, meaning mom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Been spanked by a president of the United States,'' he went
on, meaning dad.
</P>
<P>
   ''And gotten a wedgie from the next president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention featured a lot of talk about ending the politics
of division -- or wedge politics -- but very little about underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Over the four days, the stanchion identifying the delegation
from Hawaii got more colorful and crowded. First came flowers. Then
pink stickers. Then green ferns. On Thursday, purple leis.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier shipment of 300 leis was damaged, but a second batch
arrived Thursday afternoon, just in time for delegates to share
them with representatives of other states and attach a few to the
Hawaii sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''People really notice us because of all the flowers,'' said
state Rep. Barbara Marumoto, delegation chief. ''Of course, we
Hawaiians are pretty friendly too.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Two lifelong conventioneers from Ohio sized up the happenings
differently. One is a grown-up, the other is in the single digits,
as pollsters like to say.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Moore of Columbus, who's attended every GOP convention
since 1952, was disheartened by all the delegates who mugged for
the TV cameras or chattered with each other while people spoke from
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have good people speaking, and here's this babble
going on, it's rude of course,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Caroline Shinkle of Xenia loved the balloons. She's 7&AMP;frac12; and
Philadelphia marked her third convention, in a way.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was in utero in Houston,'' her mother, Carolyn Shinkle,
said of the 1992 convention. ''They wheeled me onto the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of dozens of state and local GOP events, Caroline says
of her future: ''I want to be an actor and I want to be a dentist.
And I want to be president.''

<HEADLINE> Businesses Try To Cash in on Boomers  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Message to aging baby boomers: Lorain, Ohio,
wants you. Or at least your money.
</P>
<P>
   The city hopes to revitalize its downtown economy by enticing
prosperous members of the baby-boom generation to spend some of
their money on waterfront townhouses that cost as much as $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Erie city is not alone in trying to cash in on the
wealth of graying boomers, who find themselves with much more green
in their wallets than their parents had in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do have a sense of newfound income, not having to take
care of two or three kids,'' said Frank DiTillio, president of the
Lorain County Chamber of Commerce. ''This is the time of their life
when, after 20 or 30 years of hard work, they can enjoy the money
on themselves now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You have people who are trying out expensive new beauty
products, and others who are trying out new technology,'' said Ken
Dycthwald, founder of Age Wave IMPACT, an Emeryville, Calif.-based
marketing firm that focuses on middle-aged and older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 1990s were incredibly prosperous times for these adults.
They are becoming the power consumer in this millennium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are about 78 million baby boomers, typically
defined as people born between 1946 and 1964. The oldest boomers
will be 54 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predicted that boomers would not be so successful
as their parents, simply because so many were competing for what
was then thought to be scarce jobs, said Lori Keister, sociology
professor at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures tell a different story: the median family income
for a household headed by someone between 45 and 54 rose from
$3,440 in 1947 to $61,833 in 1998. Accounting for inflation, the
1947 figure equates to $23,170 in 1998 dollars, Census officials
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see a real contrast between people in the first half of
productive life investing and running up debts'' to get their
children through school, ''and in the second half, reaping and
harvesting the benefits,'' said demographer Martha Farnsworth
Riche, former head of the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Citing today's robust economy, good salaries and pension plans,
Ohio State's Keister said, ''Social Security won't be a major
concern for boomers on average. If they don't have Social Security
(when they retire), it's probably not going to matter much.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said boomers are more likely than their parents to have
more wealth than income, meaning they have more than a year's worth
of salary in savings. That also holds true for liquid financial
assets and home equity, but boomers also have fewer other financial
assets and more debt.
</P>
<P>
   Only now is the advertising industry, dominated by people in
their 20s and 30s, trying to target older generations en masse for
things beside luxury cars, said Beth Barnes, advertising professor
at Syracuse University. She says it will take Madison Avenue a
while to change.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you talk about messages that appeal to older groups, ...
it's a problem that agencies are trying to address,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all boomers will benefit from the good economic times. Some
are taking care of elderly parents even after their kids have left.
</P>
<P>
   Income distribution also is not evenly distributed, and great
disparities exist between the poorest and richest baby boomers.
Many boomers delayed child-rearing until their late 20s and 30s and
are only now saving up for their children's college.
</P>
<P>
   After getting divorced nine years ago, and with her children out
of the house, Linda Cheney of Bryantown, Md., needed something to
fill her newfound time and shore up her finances. She went back to
school and graduated after eight years with a bachelor's degree in
information services technology from the College of Southern
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm 50, a baby boomer, and I look proudly back on that time
when I grew up,'' she said. ''But this is a totally different
situation to where I expected I'd be at this point in my life.''

<HEADLINE> Ron Reagan Jr. Ignores Convention  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Republican convention tribute to his
father wasn't exactly required viewing for Ron Reagan Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was driving to the market and flipped on NPR and heard my
father's voice coming out of the radio,'' said Reagan, a Seattle
resident who was briefly in Philadelphia Thursday to moderate a
panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
   He knew the tribute was coming up, but didn't want to watch it
on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been the most exciting convention,'' he said. ''I
can be forgiven for going to the market. The frozen food section is
more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion on arts funding for the schools was organized by
the Creative Coalition. Among the panelists was rapper Chuck D of
Public Enemy, who paused while complaining about the Reagan and
Bush administrations when he realized who was there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt a little awkward,'' Chuck D said.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan smiled and waved it off.

   A year ago, MTV's John Norris was in Rome, N.Y., covering the
fires and blaring music of Woodstock '99. This year, he's at the
GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference between the events?
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather's the same,'' a sweaty Norris said. ''Bathroom
facilities? Comparable. Food and drink? I guess the GOP wins in a
photo finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock had Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, Insane
Clown Posse, Metallica, Sheryl Crow and Bush. Republicans imported
the Temptations, Hank Williams Jr., the Shirelles, Brooks &AMP; Dunn
and the Neville Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I plead the fifth on the music,'' Norris said.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, a network that knows how to have a good time, has a
newfound respect for the GOP, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans definitely know how to party,'' Norris said.

   Best known for his roles in ''Boogie Nights'' and ''Magnolia,''
Hoffman is working on a documentary about his experiences at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask him to discuss it.
</P>

<P>
   Stop it, Ken.
</P>

   No, wait. He's just getting warmed up.

<HEADLINE> Ford Investigating Tire Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost 100 years ago, Henry Ford chose Harvey
Firestone to supply tires for America's first mass-produced
automobiles. It was the beginning of an enduring friendship and
fortunes that would outlive them both.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that grew out of the relationship are trying to
maintain their solidarity in the face of a government investigation
into whether Firestone tires used on Ford Motor Co.'s popular
Explorer have caused people to die.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has 193
complaints, including reports of 21 deaths, that Firestone tires
peel off their casings, sometimes as the car they are on is
barreling down the road at speed.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Firestone ATX, ATX II and Wilderness tires are
original equipment on Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Nissan and
Subaru SUVs and pickups, but most accidents reported to the traffic
safety agency have involved the Ford Explorer, the industry's
top-selling sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA's investigation is in its preliminary stages, but
sometimes such investigations lead to a recall by the manufacturer,
which in this case is Firestone's parent company, Nashville,
Tenn.-based Bridgestone/Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is looking into the case on its own. Company officials say
it's too soon to say how they might respond, but spokesman Ken Zino
said Ford's decision probably would not involve dropping its
longtime tire supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can envision no response to a problem, if there is one, that
doesn't involve working closely with Bridgestone/Firestone,'' Zino
said. ''I think it's extremely unlikely that this long-standing
supplier would not work closely with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone has involved Ford in its crisis
communications plan since the investigation began in May, said
Christine Karbowiak, spokeswoman for the tire company.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a relationship with Ford. We've cherished it since
1906,'' she said in an interview from Akron, Ohio, where the
company was celebrating the 100th anniversary of Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure our customer is happy, whether it's Ford
or it's somebody coming in to buy five tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Karbowiak said consumers had been ''unduly concerned'' by media
reports of the investigation, but the company is using the coverage
as an opportunity to educate people about tire safety.
</P>
<P>
   The company is encouraging owners to go to a Firestone Tire and
Service Center for free inspections of their tires.
</P>
<P>
   ''These things aren't indestructible,'' Karbowiak said. ''They
are made out of rubber. Every passenger car sold in the United
States is sold with a spare tire, and they're sold with a spare
tire for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Florida families sued Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone on July
24, alleging tire treads on their Ford Explorers separated and
caused fatal accidents. Similar suits concerning the tires have
been filed since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based Public Citizen advocacy group alleges that
as many as 30 deaths have been caused by tire separation. Strategic
Safety, an Arlington, Va.-based group that does research for
plaintiffs' attorneys, is recommending to Ford and
Bridgestone/Firestone that they recall tires on 1991 through 2000
models.
</P>
<P>
   According to NHTSA, 28 of the reports of tread separation noted
that the tire remained inflated, sometimes even after a crash. In
two cases, the tire tread wrapped around the rear axle and locked
up the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Tread failure was reported at a speed of 20 mph, but 55 mph to
75 mph was typical. Some tires that failed had been used fewer than
2,000 miles, agency records show.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the complaints came from Texas and southern and
southwestern states with warmer climates. Heat can affect tire
tread bonding and may be associated with an increased rate of tread
separation.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has replaced Firestone tires for free on vehicles sold in
Venezuela, Ecuador, Thailand, Malaysia, Colombia and Saudi Arabia
after tires failed in those countries. It did not accept blame, but
Ford said it swapped tires ''as a customer satisfaction issue.'' It
has not made a decision on replacing tires for U.S. customers.

<HEADLINE> 15 To Get Medal of Freedom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three senators, an economist, a general, an
admiral and the Rev. Jesse Jackson will be among 15 Americans to
receive the nation's highest civilian honor next week from
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Established by President Truman as a wartime honor, the
Presidential Medal of Freedom was reintroduced by President Kennedy
as way to honor civilian service.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will recognize the individuals at a White House ceremony
on Wednesday, he announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The award recipients are:
</P>
<P>
   --Sen. John Chafee, who died last year, served as a Marine
lieutenant in the World War II battle at Guadalcanal and fought in
the Korean War. He was a state representative in Rhode Island,
governor of Rhode Island and secretary of the Navy. In the Senate,
Chafee was a champion of environmental legislation and worked to
expand health care and reform foster care.
</P>
<P>
   --Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, who as supreme allied commander of
NATO led the alliance to victory in Kosovo. Clark graduated first
in his class at West Point, served in Vietnam and helped negotiate
the Bosnia peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   --Jackson, considered both an asset and a pest by the Clinton
administration, frequently is invited to White House events even
though he flirted briefly with the idea of running for the
Democratic presidential nomination. Jackson was with the Clinton
family after the president told the nation of his extramarital
affair with Monica Lewinsky, but drew the ire of Clinton advisers
last year when he ignored their warnings and went to Yugoslavia to
retrieve three American soldiers held as prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   --Retired Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, who also served as commander of the Middle East Force in
the Persian Gulf, head of Navy plans and policy and commander in
chief of the U.S. Pacific Command.
</P>
<P>
   --Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense
Fund. She was the first black woman admitted to the Mississippi bar
and first black woman elected to the Yale University Corp.
</P>
<P>
   --John Kenneth Galbraith, a leading economist, taught economics
for nearly 30 years and has written more than 30 books. During
World War II, he was largely responsible for the Office of Price
Administration's record in controlling inflation. He advised
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and also served as U.S. Ambassador
to India.
</P>
<P>
   --Monsignor George Higgins, adjunct lecturer at Catholic
University, has spent more than 50 years working to ensure worker
justice. He has been honored several times by labor groups and once
was described as the ''labor movement's parish priest.''
</P>
<P>
   --Mildred ''Millie'' Jeffrey, a women's labor and Democratic
Party activist, was the first female to direct a department of the
United Auto Workers. She worked for the UAW from 1945 to 1976 and
served on commissions during the Kennedy and Carter
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   --Mathilde Krim, who founded the AIDS Medical Foundation in 1983,
was one of the earliest leaders in the effort to find a cure for
AIDS. She has worked on topics ranging from cancer research to
human genetics and her foundation, which joined with the American
Foundation for AIDS Research in 1985, has poured millions of
dollars into AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   --George McGovern, a Democratic nominee for president in 1972,
currently is the U.S. representative to the United Nations' Food
and Agricultural Organization, where he is helping to develop a
plan to address the food needs of 500 million people -- half the
world's underfed -- by 2015. He was elected to the House in 1956. In
the Senate, he led the expansion of the food stamp program.
</P>
<P>
   --Cruz Reynoso, a private lawyer, teaches law and serves as vice
chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. In 1982, after six
years on the California Court of Appeals, he became the first
Latino to serve on the California Supreme Court. He also has served
as a U.S. delegate to the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   --The Rev. Gardner Taylor, an author and early civil rights
supporter, has been called the ''dean of the nation's black
preachers.'' Under his leadership, his church, Concord Baptist
Church of Christ in New York City, became the most prestigious
black church in America.
</P>
<P>
   --Simon Wiesenthal, a Nazi concentration camp survivor, has
devoted his life to finding evidence to prosecute Nazi war
criminals. In 1977, he founded the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which
works to fight bigotry and anti-Semitism. President Carter
presented him with the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal in 1980 and he
received the French Legion of Honor in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   --Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan has represented New York in the
Senate since 1977. A strong supporter of Social Security, he is the
only person to serve in the Cabinet or sub-Cabinet, including two
ambassadorial appointments, of four successive presidential
administrations, Kennedy through Ford.
</P>
<P>
   --James Edward Burke, former chairman of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, is
chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. He has helped
develop the National Youth Media Campaign and worked to discourage
young people from using drugs.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Said Scared of Elections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says the
opposition to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must present a
united front for next month's national elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is for the opposition to solidify, present
a single candidate and get on with the elections,'' Albright said
Thursday at a joint press briefing with Spanish Foreign Minister
Josep Pique.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is acting illegally and provocatively because the
elections have him ''running scared,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Milosevic changed the constitution of the Yugoslav
federation to allow himself to run for two more four-year terms. He
called the upcoming elections under conditions that favor him and
his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome earlier this week, Albright sought unsuccessfully to
persuade opposition groups from Serbia and Montenegro to compete in
the elections. They are boycotting, partly because they consider
the process unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt in anybody's mind that this election is
going to take place ... and that it will take place in unfair
circumstances where the media is under control and the opposition
is being intimidated,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And yet it is very evident that the bulk of the opposition,
even with this threat, is going to participate in the elections,
and we support them in this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Among others, Albright has discussed the issue with Milo
Djukanovic, the president of Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in
the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   She said they discussed how Djukanovic's party could be helpful
to the opposition without participating in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 8, Braves 4  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Luis Gonzalez drove in five runs in his second
two-homer game in four days and the Arizona Diamondbacks ended Andy
Ashby's five-game winning streak with an 8-4 victory Thursday night
over the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had a three-run home run in the first, an RBI double in
the third and a solo homer in the fifth, all off Ashby (7-8), as
the Diamondbacks took two of three from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Conti, in his third game since being recalled from
Triple-A Tucson, was 3-for-4 with a two-run single in the fifth. He
also threw out Brian Jordan at third base from right field for the
second night in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Conti threw him out Thursday when Jordan tagged from second in
the second inning. On Wednesday, Jordan was caught trying to go
first to third on B.J. Surhoff's single.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack stole four bases to tie his career-best, set with
Pittsburgh in 1997, and break the Diamondbacks team record. He had
not stolen more than one base in a game all season.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan hit a three-run homer off starter Brian Anderson and
pinch-hitter Wally Joyner had a solo home run into the swimming
pool beyond the right field fence off reliever Johnny Ruffin.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (9-4) got his first victory since June 26, ending a
frustrating stretch when he was 0-2 with four no-decisions despite
giving up no more than three runs in five of his six July starts.
Anderson allowed three runs on eight hits in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin relieved Anderson with runners at first and third and two
outs in the sixth, and Andres Galarraga grounded into a fielder's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Mantei extended his strikeout streak to eight, tying
Byung-Hyun Kim's club record, by fanning the first two batters in
the ninth. Mantei retired Surhoff on a fly ball to complete his
perfect inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby allowed seven runs, six earned, on eight hits while
pitching four innings plus two batters in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't allowed more than two earned runs in any of his
previous five starts. Since coming to Atlanta in a trade from
Philadelphia, Ashby was 3-0 with two complete games and a 0.78 ERA.
But he was in trouble from the start this time.
</P>
<P>
   Womack reached on a fielding error by first baseman Galarraga to
start the game. Jay Bell walked before Gonzalez homered to right on
a 2-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Bell singled and scored on Gonzalez's double to make it 4-0 in
the third, then Jordan's homer cut it to 4-3 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Womack's two-out RBI single in the bottom of the fourth
increased the lead to 5-3, then the Diamondbacks scored three more
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez led off the inning with his 24th home run of the
season. Matt Williams doubled and Terry Mulholland relieved Ashby.
Finley singled, then Alex Cabrera was hit by a pitch to load the
bases for Conti, who singled on an 0-2 pitch to drive in two runs.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Anderson's pickoff of Chipper Jones in the first inning was
the lefty's ninth of the season and Arizona's 19th. ... In eight
at-bats against Ashby this season, Gonzalez has five hits, three of
them homers. ... Atlanta's Javy Lopez grounded into his 15th double
play to end the fourth inning. ... Gonzalez has driven in eight of
Arizona's last 14 runs. ... Devon White stole three bases for the
Diamondbacks on May 17, 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Congo Violating Peace Accord  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Congo is failing to live up to its
commitments under a year-old peace agreement and thereby preventing
deployment of thousands of U.N. observers, the United States told a
special envoy of Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Congo's Human Rights Minister Leonard She Okitundu said the
government wants the U.N. force deployed -- but only in conflict
areas where it can monitor the cease-fire and withdrawal of Rwandan
and Ugandan troops.
</P>
<P>
   With last year's cease-fire shattered by heavy fighting, and the
Congolese government accused of stonewalling on implementing the
peace accord, Okitundu flew to New York to address a closed-door
Security Council meeting Thursday on behalf of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The council has authorized a U.N. force of 5,537 troops and
observers with a mandate to oversee the cease-fire, the withdrawal
of foreign troops and the disarming of Rwandan Hutu militiamen. The
Hutu militiamen are responsible for the 1994 Rwanda genocide and
have been fighting alongside Congolese government troops.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, only about 200 U.N. military observers have
been deployed, mainly because of security problems. Last week,
Kabila refused to allow the first armed U.N. peacekeepers in the
capital, Kinshasa, and Mbandaka, a key river port.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.N. force's mandate due to expire Aug. 31, and the
United Nations reviewing its role in the country, Okitundu's visit
gave Security Council members a chance to express their frustration
at what U.S. deputy ambassador Nancy Soderberg called the greatest
crisis in Africa today.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila and his allies, Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe, signed the
cease-fire agreement last year in Lusaka, Zambia. So did Rwanda and
Uganda, which back rebels who took up arms in August 1998 to oust
Kabila from power.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese government troops recently launched a major offensive,
Soderberg noted, and rebels have also advanced beyond the
cease-fire line. The government has also failed to make any
progress on initiating an inter-Congolese dialogue, as called for
in the accord, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Until the signatories recognize that the peace accord isn't
working, Soderberg warned, the United Nations can do little to move
forward with the deployment of U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Okitundu said in an interview that he told the council it should
separate the issue of external aggression against Congo from the
country's internal problems -- and not make democratization a
prerequisite for the withdrawal of foreign forces.
</P>
<P>
   He also called the allegations of cease-fire violations
''unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Okitundu said Congo asked for the U.N. mission to come to the
country to help recover its sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and to accompany Rwandan and Ugandan troops to the border to ensure
that they leave.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila is expected to meet Annan's special representative Kamel
Morjane in the next few days to decide whether armed U.N.
peacekeepers can deploy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Activists Support Malaysia's Anwar  </HEADLINE>
By ALVIN UNG
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- About 500 supporters of jailed
politician Anwar Ibrahim gathered Friday outside the Kuala Lumpur
High Court to protest the postponement of the verdict in the sodomy
case against the former deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Holding portraits of Anwar and shouting ''Reformasi,'' the Malay
word for political reform, the protesters scuffled with police who
tried to push them away from the main street in front of the
courthouse. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders said at least three protesters were arrested.
Police declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The postponement of Anwar's verdict has been influenced by the
cowardly political masters,'' said Mohamed Ezam Mohamed Nor, a
leader of the opposition National Justice Party.
</P>
<P>
   He and other protesters demanded that Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad heed growing dissatisfaction with his 19-year rule and
resign.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise move Thursday, the High Court announced that Judge
Ariffin Jaka's verdict was not ready.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition activists say the decision not to announce the
verdict in the yearlong trial Friday was driven by fear of a
massive anti-government rally near the courthouse. The government
denied that had anything to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Local rights activists, opposition leaders and supporters of
Anwar had announced plans to assemble outside the court during the
verdict, which would have capped a trial that has raised concerns
about the Malaysian judiciary and the country's politics.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old politician was fired by Mahathir in September
1998. He was soon arrested and put on trial on charges of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him during his two
trials since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His imprisonment -- including a beating in custody by the
then-police chief -- has catalyzed calls for reform, opened a window
on human rights abuses and brought the opposition to band together
in elections last year.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations have rocked Kuala Lumpur sporadically since
Anwar's sacking and arrest as his supporters have tried to keep
alive his campaign for more liberal politics in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   A guilty verdict could add several years to the six-year jail
sentence that Anwar was given for corruption last year. Under
Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by maximum imprisonment of 20
years and whipping by a rattan cane.

<HEADLINE> Philly Police Lauded For Security  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Even their critics admit the Philadelphia
police force did a pretty good job handling protests surrounding
the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have the worst of what happened in Seattle,'' said
Stefan Presser, legal director of the local American Civil
Liberties Union. ''We didn't have mace. We didn't have tear gas. We
didn't have people swept up who had nothing to do with the
demonstrators.''
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a change for the often criticized force, which was
embarrassed just last month when several officers were caught on
videotape kicking and beating suspect Thomas Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm certainly not proud of them, but they were more subdued
than I expected compared to the reputation of Philadelphia,''
protester Bernadette Moreno, 18, of Pittsburgh said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That's high praise from a protester for a force with a history
of brutality, corruption and racism dating back to the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was obvious they knew what they were doing. That's a big
change for Philadelphia,'' said Temple University professor James
Fyfe, a former New York City police officer. ''In a way the Jones
situation had a good effect because the cops were very concerned of
the criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia NAACP President J. Whyatt Mondesire agreed that
police officers seem to have taken a lesson from the videotaped
beating.
</P>
<P>
   ''As incredible as it sounds, the beating of Thomas Jones
probably saved these kids a couple of beatings, a couple of
lumps,'' said Mondesire, one of the most vocal critics of police
for the Jones' beating.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesire said he told Commissioner John Timoney, injured in a
clash with protesters, that he was impressed by police this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hugged him and said you are now known as John 'Rambo'
Timoney,'' Mondesire said.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested more than 300 protesters Tuesday during
sometimes-violent brawls with officers, 15 of whom were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Presser accused police of partially inciting Tuesday night's
violence by raiding a warehouse that protesters had used as a
staging area. About 70 people were arrested at the site, which
organizers said was used for making signs and puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney dismissed Presser's accusation and defended the
warehouse arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been assured we have probable cause to make those
arrests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Rev. Al Sharpton led a march of about 50
protesters in front of the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office,
criticizing the Jones beating. Sharpton, a civil rights activist,
said the officers who hit and kicked Jones should be arrested.

<HEADLINE> Giants 10, Pirates 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jeff Kent drove in six runs, leading the
San Francisco Giants to a 10-2 victory Thursday night over the
Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Kent hit a two-run homer in the first and added two-run doubles
in the third and fourth, all against Pittsburgh starter Francisco
Cordova. Kent walked with two runners on in the sixth and struck
out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, with 96 RBIs, passed Ken Griffey, Jr. and Sammy Sosa for
the NL lead. He was one shy of his career-best RBI game.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Ortiz (6-10) overcame a shaky start to win. He allowed one
run on five hits and struck out 10 in 6 2-3 innings for the Giants,
who won for the third time in four games to remain one percentage
point ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz allowed the first three batters to reach in the first, but
gave up just one run on Kevin Young's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova (6-8) lasted just 3 1-3 innings, his second-shortest
outing of the season. He gave up a season-high seven runs and 11
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard led off the first with a double. Two outs later,
Kent hit a 1-0 pitch from Cordova into the left-field bleachers for
his 26th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mueller and Barry Bonds opened the third with singles and
scored on Kent's double to the left-field gap. He doubled home
Benard and Bonds in the fourth. Ellis Burks hit a sacrifice fly in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added a run in the sixth on J.T. Snow's sacrifice
fly. Armando Rios hit a two-run homer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Meares hit his ninth homer in the ninth for the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kent drove in seven runs against Cincinnati on July 24,
1998. ... RHP Rich Loiselle was activated from the 15-day disabled
list before Thursday's game. INF Luis Sojo was designated for
assignment to make room on the roster. ... RHP Joe Nathan allowed a
run on four hits in three-plus innings of a rehab start Wednesday
at Triple-A Fresno. ... Benard rejoined the team after missing the
three-game series in Milwaukee due to a death in the family. ...
... Ortiz struck out 10 or more hitters on five occasions in his
career, three this season. ... Cordova is 2-5 in 10 career
appearances against the Giants with an ERA of 7.06 (34 runs in 43
1-3 innings), his worst against any team.

<HEADLINE> Greystone counselor accused of sexually assaulting patient  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) - A counselor at Greystone Park
Psychiatric Hospital charged with sexually assaulting a female
patient claims he and the woman had a consensual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Jared Alford, 43, of Newark, was arrested Wednesday and charged
with sexual assault and officials misconduct. Police said the
nine-year veteran employee had sex with a 50-year-old patient from
Bergen County just over a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual relationships are forbidden between patients and
employees at state mental institutions and are considered sexual
assault under state law.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient told police about the situation, and authorities
said Alford admitted to the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alford claims he had a real relationship with this woman, that
he had strong feelings for her,'' Pam Ronan, a spokeswoman for the
state Department of Human Services, told The Star-Ledger of Newark
for Friday's editions. ''But that is improper conduct; an employee
cannot have sexual relations with a patient under any
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Alford, a residential living specialist at the institution,
helped patients nearing discharge to relearn living skills before
returning home, Ronan said. The woman, who was civilly committed to
Greystone in March, lived in the hospital's cottage for recovering
patients, where Alford worked.
</P>
<P>
   Greystone, scheduled to be closed in three years, has faced
harsh criticism for a series of sex-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a policy prohibiting patients at Greystone Park
Psychiatric Hospital from having sex, at least 12 mentally impaired
patients have become pregnant while being treated at the Parsippany
facility since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And in the early 1990s, a series of sexual attacks on patients
by employees led to a state Senate hearing about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman in April ordered that the hospital be
closed in three years, after decades of problems that included
attacks on patients, patient suicides and overcrowding.

<HEADLINE> Queen Mother Has 100th Birthday  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Queen Mother Elizabeth, the nation's favorite
royal, celebrates her 100th birthday Friday with all the pomp and
ceremony due a life that spanned a century.
</P>
<P>
   For the Queen Mother, that means a horse-drawn carriage ride
from her Clarence House home to Buckingham Palace, a 41-gun salute
and a private luncheon with members of the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Since Thursday, royal watchers have staked out front-row seats
at Buckingham Palace and along the parade route to personally wish
the Queen Mother a happy birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''She came to visit us in Hornsey Rise during the Blitz,'' said
Terry Hutt, who was 5 when he first saw his favorite royal in his
north London neighborhood during World War II. ''She was my queen.
That's why I am here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Like countless others, Hutt remembers her as Queen Elizabeth,
consort of King George VI at a time when Britain faced Hitler's
forces virtually alone, enduring heavy bombing and years of
deprivation. Vivid, youthful memories link many of the wartime
generation to the Queen Mother.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's newspapers were among the first to salute the Queen
Mother on Friday with photo tributes. The Daily Telegraph featured
100 pictures of the Queen Mother dating back to 1900, while The
Times carried a 28-page pullout section illustrating her life
throughout the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands were expected to gather along the broad avenue of The
Mall, but they will have only a few minutes to catch a glimpse of
the Queen Mother.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by eldest grandson Prince Charles, she is to leave
her home at Clarence House by horse-drawn carriage at noon and make
the short trip up The Mall to Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her daughters, Queen Elizabeth II and Princess
Margaret, she is to appear on the palace balcony and hear a 41-gun
salute before a private luncheon celebration with 30 members of her
family.
</P>
<P>
   While at the palace, the postman will hand-deliver a centenary
card from the queen, who traditionally sends birthday wishes to
everyone in Britain who turns 100. This one, for her mother, will
have an additional personal message.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven other centenarians will receive similar cards on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Carter, who will be waiting patiently on The Mall for a
wave from the Queen Mother, may not have the same birthday, but she
never forgets the Queen Mother's.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to come down every year,'' she said Thursday in between
rain showers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been here since yesterday evening. I can't wait to get a
glimpse of the Queen Mum. I am a true royalist and I reckon she's
the best of the bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Queen has also issued a special honors list to mark her
mother's 100th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people are to be honored, including five who helped stage
the Queen Mother's centenary pageant on London's Horse Guards
parade ground in July.
</P>
<P>
   Security for the Queen Mother's 100th birthday was expected to
be tight, amid fears that dissident Irish republicans could disrupt
the celebrations with violence.
</P>
<P>
   During the Queen Mother's centenary pageant July 19, police
detonated a bomb left on the tracks of a west London subway station
after receiving a coded warning that the government said bore the
mark of dissident Irish terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   A senior security source told Britain's Press Association that
police suspected terrorists would continue their campaign of
violence Friday.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Grounds 18 Jets  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines is grounding up to 18 Boeing
MD-80 airliners for new inspections of a part implicated in last
January's crash that killed 88 people, federal regulators said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The airline reported to the Federal Aviation Administration that
the tool used to check jackscrews may have produced incorrect
readings. The jackscrew assembly consists of a nut that rides up
and down a screw as it turns to lift and lower the stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   There are no indications of problems, the FAA said in a
statement. But the agency is alerting other airlines using MD-80
planes -- as well as DC-9 jets, which are also affected -- to check
their planes.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines Flight 261 plunged into the ocean off Southern
California on a flight from Mexico to San Francisco on Jan. 31. All
88 people aboard the plane, an MD-83 -- an MD-80 variant -- died.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal investigation into the crash focused on a mechanic's
decision not to replace a jackscrew assembly. The jackscrew had
been tested repeatedly and found to be nearly worn out, but was put
back into service after a second crew retested it a few days later.
Two Alaska Airlines mechanics insisted in an interview with The
Seattle Times that they were not at fault.
</P>
<P>
   The tool in question measures the amount of space between the
thread on the jackscrew and the nut that holds it in place.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's tests, conducted in the course of the National
Transportation Safety Board investigation of the fatal crash,
indicated that ''endplay'' measurement could vary. According to the
MD-80 maintenance manual, airlines can measure jackscrew
''endplay'' using a tool made by the aircraft manufacturer or an
equivalent substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska owns tools made by the manufacturer, but it also uses
several that were made in its own machine shop. In side-by-side
testing by the airline, using either tool produced the same
measurements, the airline said. However, the airline found the
measurements could vary if its own tool was improperly positioned.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's own tool was used to measure the jackscrew on
Flight 261, airline President Bill Ayer told a news conference
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is up to the U.S. Attorney's Office and the NTSB to
determine if this tool is a problem in their investigation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ayer said it was a common practice among airlines to make their
own maintenance tools. He also declared the MD-80s to be safe:
''There's no more inspected airplane in the world than the MD-80,
especially the Alaska MD-80s.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, which has 500 departures daily, has a fleet of 92
planes, 34 of which are MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
   The new inspections resulted in about 20 flight cancellations
Thursday night with an unspecified number of additional
cancellations expected Friday, airline spokesman Greg Witter said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline hoped to complete the inspections by late Friday but
service disruptions were expected to last at least through Saturday
and possibly through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The airline verified that the manufacturer's tool was used to
measure the jackscrews on 16 of its 34 MD-80s, so Alaska decided to
reinspect the remaining 18 planes.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the FAA announced that Alaska Airlines had made
sufficient improvements to continue doing maintenance on its
planes. Previously, the agency had threatened to strip the airline
of the right to do maintenance -- a step that could have eventually
grounded all its planes -- unless its programs were improved.

<HEADLINE> Speight Charges Almost Finalized  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Prosecutors worked feverishly Friday to
finalize charges against Fiji's arrested coup leader George
Speight, trying to beat a deadline that could see him released from
his island jail by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and a group of key advisers have been jailed for more
than a week without facing a magistrate, and a legal extension
allowing the military to hold them without appearing in court
expires at 10 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to bring Speight to court came as the military
extended a deadly crackdown on his supporters on Fiji's
second-largest island, Vanua Levu. One rebel supporter was killed
Thursday in a gunfight with soldiers, 76 others were arrested and a
search continued Friday for rebels who fled into the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Director of Public Prosecutions Josaia Naiglulevu said
Friday his staff was preparing evidence to support charges against
Speight before his arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Security concerns may mean a magistrate is taken to the prison
island off Suva where the group is being held, rather than Speight
being brought to the courthouse in downtown Suva, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's Daily Post newspaper quoted from a letter purportedly
written by Speight to his lawyers in which he claimed he was beaten
by soldiers while in custody and feared he was going to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The abuse included slapping, punching, kicking and the use of
rifle butts to the head, face, neck, back, chest and stomach,'' the
paper cited Speight's letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The military had no comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   Speight was arrested more than a week ago and charged with
unlawful assembly, minor offenses relating to firearms and the
unlawful burial of one of his followers on the grounds of Fiji's
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A treason investigation is under way. Speight faces a death
sentence if found guilty on that charge, although nobody has been
executed in Fiji since independence from Britain in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, a failed businessman, led a group of gunmen into
Parliament on May 19 and held dozens of officials for two months
until the military met rebel demands for an amnesty, discarding the
multiracial constitution and ousting the hostage government.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claimed that ethnic Indian Fijians have too much power
and threaten indigenous Fijian culture. Ethnic Indian Fijians --
whose ancestors were brought to Fiji in the 1870s by British
colonialists as indentured laborers -- make up 44 percent of the
nation's 814,000 people and dominate business and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The raid cast Fiji into turmoil and sparked international
condemnation of the South Pacific nation's abandonment of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Raids, hostage-taking, theft, beatings and arson have become
commonplace in small ethnic Indian-dominated rural communities
across Fiji since the coup. The military has vowed to track down
those responsible for the attacks.

   VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- Three men have pleaded innocent to
charges that they tried to extort $310,000 from Erin Brockovich,
the outspoken legal secretary and environmental advocate.
</P>
<P>
   The case revolves around Brockovich's ex-husband Shawn Brown,

   The complaint alleges the men threatened to tell tabloid media
that Brockovich and her boss, Ed Masry, had a sexual relationship
and that she was a bad mother -- neither of which was true,
according to officials.

<P>
   The men have steadfastly maintained they are innocent and
entered their pleas Thursday after many delays in the arraignment.

   Brockovich's work on a toxic waste case was the basis of a hit

<HEADLINE> Couric Picks Up Southern Accent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Katie Couric has begun picking up
different speech patterns since she hired two Birmingham natives as
personal assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been saying 'y'all' and 'hey' a lot lately,'' said
Couric, host of NBC's ''Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Allsbrook, 25, handles Couric's scheduling and other
professional chores. Marlowe Mitchell, 24, handles Couric's
correspondence. Both are from the Birmingham suburb of Mountain
Brook.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as Katie met Marlowe, she was like, 'Oh my gosh,
here's my Southern team,''' Allsbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Couric's great-grandfather was from Eufaula, Ala. An 1850 Greek
Revival house in Eufaula -- the Couric-Smith House -- recently was
featured on a ''Today'' segment in which Couric went searching for
her roots.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are smart, hardworking and fun to be around,'' Couric
said of her assistants. ''And, obviously, the Alabama connection is
a plus. I think everybody in New York who calls my office enjoys
their Southern accents.''

<HEADLINE> Bush the Main Act for TV Convention  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It all depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Humorist Bill Maher began ABC's ''Politically Incorrect''
Thursday with rousing words. ''We finally had the big moment
tonight that America was waiting for at the Republican National
Convention,'' he said. ''The end.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, NBC News' Tim Russert left the convention
genuinely psyched. ''It's going to be a great campaign,'' he said,
a broad grin on his face. ''You can feel it already!''
</P>
<P>
   As for Dan Rather, the CBS anchor signed off thinking of the
founding fathers who had gathered there in Philadelphia two
centuries ago. Since that time, he said, the political process
''has gone from James Madison to Madison Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the convention's final image showed a podium laden
with the sizable Bush clan and a diverse group of the candidate's
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Add cascading balloons and confetti, and you had a
picture-perfect end to George W. Bush's coming out party.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, of course, he had delivered The Speech. His
acceptance speech. ''The most important speech of his life,'' as
NBC's Tom Brokaw said in what became the mantra of the day's
convention coverage.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bush began speaking about 10 p.m. Eastern, all the
networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS plus cable networks CNN, Fox News
Channel, MSNBC and C-SPAN -- were on board. Everyone listened.
</P>
<P>
   But for hours already, unseen and unheard, Bush's speech was
Topic A among correspondents and pundits.
</P>
<P>
   Even the staging for his speech was deconstructed in advance.
NBC News analyst Howard Fineman pointed out how decorative ferns
had been strategically repositioned on the podium, from rear center
to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   On MSNBC, former Republican speech writer Peggy Noonan marveled
at the downsized, college-classroom sort of lectern the nominee had
chosen. ''It's utterly exposed, it's utterly undefended, it's
utterly observed.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Noonan was on Fox News Channel, where she blamed the media
for the convention's choreographed, happy-face style. Republicans,
she said, ''don't want to give any excuse for the ... electronic
media to come at them saying, 'You're mean! You're harsh!'''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hospitalization of former President Ford from a
stroke had introduced surprise into the scripted proceedings.
Through this quirk of time and place, the illness of a man who left
the White House a quarter-century ago briefly upstaged the man who
wants to be its next resident.
</P>
<P>
   But as the networks supplied updates Thursday on Ford's
improving condition at a Philadelphia hospital, viewers might have
wondered if they were learning more about the medical cause of
strokes than about the candidate's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech was designed to fill in some of the gaps. After he
gave it, TV analysts generally approved.
</P>
<P>
   What did the audience at home think? As Bush spoke, the Web site
Speakout.com gauged moment-to-moment feedback from the viewers
logged on. But participation was limited -- those using Macs, for
instance, weren't welcome.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the sort of inclusiveness that Bush was calling for.

George W. Bush Accepts GOP Presidential Nomination
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Opening a 95-day countdown to the election, Republicans
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney charge side-by-side into Midwest battleground
states Friday pledging to ''use these good times for great goals'' if they
succeed in winning the White House. The Texas governor claimed the GOP
nomination Thursday night in a deafening convention celebration and deluge of
balloons and confetti. There was a mood of exuberant optimism about Bush's
chances -- he is ahead in the polls -- but he cautioned that ''this will be a
tough race, down to the wire'' with Democrat Al Gore.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have informed a major Republican

Texas that date back five years, officials familiar with the investigation said.
The case against Koch Petroleum promises to open a window on the relationship
between oil companies and Texas regulators amid an election in which Democrats

U.S.: Congo Violating Peace Accord
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Congo is failing to live up to its commitments under a
year-old peace agreement and thereby preventing deployment of thousands of U.N.
observers, the United States told a special envoy of Congolese President Laurent
Kabila. Congo's Human Rights Minister Leonard She Okitundu said the government
wants the U.N. force deployed -- but only in conflict areas where it can monitor
the cease-fire and withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops. With last year's
cease-fire shattered by heavy fighting, and the Congolese government accused of
stonewalling on implementing the peace accord, Okitundu flew to New York to
address a closed-door Security Council meeting Thursday on behalf of Kabila.

the state and local government total. In 1998, they accounted for 39.7 percent,
or 5.72 million of the 14.4 million total. Higher education employees were next,
at 1.7 million in 1999, followed by hospital employees at 952,301.

Ford Plays It Safe With Larger SUVs
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. might have promised to increase the
fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles, but a new version of the Ford
Explorer was built using the formula the world's No. 2 maker of cars and trucks
has found lucrative so far -- bigger and stronger. The 2002 version of the
Explorer, the industry's top-selling SUV, offers a more powerful engine and more
interior space over the current model. Ford made few stylistic changes to the
popular SUV, though, having learned a costly lesson a few years ago, when a
jarring redesign of the Taurus sedan drove many customers away.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Paperwork To Be Filed Monday  </HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- An indictment alleging massive
corruption by former dictator Suharto will be filed in a Jakarta
court on Monday, prosecutors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, prosecutors formally charged Suharto, 79, with
skimming off $570 million in state funds through a complex network
of charities that he controlled during his 32-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   They allege the money bankrolled huge business empires for his
family and cronies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The indictment and a dossier detailing the case will be
submitted to a judge in the South Jakarta District Court on
Monday,'' said Yushar Yahya, a spokesman at the attorney general's
office.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was not certain whether Suharto, who is under house
arrest, would attend Monday's hearing, which will be largely
procedural.
</P>
<P>
   Yahya said prosecutors hope a trial can start within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's defense attorneys maintain he is too ill to go before
a judge and raised doubts that a trial would start soon.
</P>
<P>
   They claim a series of strokes have damaged Suharto's brain and
impaired his memory and ability to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who was forced to quit office in May 1998 amid bloody
student protests and riots, has denied any wrongdoing. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Current President Abdurrahman Wahid has offered to pardon
Suharto if the stolen money is surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the case holds immense symbolic importance as a test of
Indonesia's resolve to fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Some estimates put the wealth of Suharto's relatives at $40
billion -- a figure his family denies. They also say there is no
Suharto family fortune stashed abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Marzuki Darusman, a human rights activist
during Suharto's reign, has said the former autocrat must face
trial, and cited recent independent medical tests that declared
Suharto fit enough to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's court hearing will coincide with the start of a
potentially stormy session of the People's Consultative Assembly,
Indonesia's supreme legislative body.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid is expected to face a hostile reception from lawmakers who
accuse him of failing to fix Indonesia's massive economic and
social problems.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Suharto's legal team, Juan Felix Tampubolon, has
said court proceedings against his client have been timed to
bolster Wahid's flagging popularity.

<HEADLINE> Gray: Hurricane Season Not as Bad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- Hurricane forecaster William Gray
said Thursday the 2000 season will not be as bad as first
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In his June forecast, the Colorado State University professor
predicted 12 named storms, eight hurricanes and four major
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Data received since the official start of the season June 1 have
convinced Gray there will be only 11 named storms, seven hurricanes
and three major hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   He said cooler Atlantic Ocean surface water temperatures and a
weakening La Nina are responsible for the declining threat. The
season still will be busier than the average of 9.3 named storms,
5.8 hurricanes and 2.2 major hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   The late onset of storms is not a factor in his decision to
revise his forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that we haven't had an early season storm doesn't
mean anything,'' Gray said. ''There is no correlation between June
and July storms and what may take place later in the season; in
fact, there's some evidence for a slight negative correlation
(i.e., the absence of early season storms is made up for by
late-season activity.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects the main season to occur more or less on
scheduled during the 60 days starting Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we had verification that La Nina would continue
relatively strong throughout the season, but it appears to be
fading a little more rapidly than we expected,'' Gray said. ''Under
those circumstances, we're reducing our early June forecast numbers
a little, although people should remember that there still is the
possibility of this being a very active season, especially compared
with the 1970-1994 period.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray has warned that a decline in hurricanes from 1970-94 has
lulled southeastern coastal dwellers into a false sense of
security, particularly with the population boom in the region.
</P>
<P>
   What coastal dwellers should anticipate, Gray said, is an active
hurricane season but slightly weaker than those that occurred in
1995, 1996, 1998 and 1999. The five years beginning in 1995
constitute the five most active consecutive years of hurricane
activity in history, producing 65 named storms, 41 hurricanes and
20 major hurricanes.

<HEADLINE> Ford Said Eager To Get Home  </HEADLINE>
By HOPE YEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A recovering and alert Gerald Ford was
eagerly awaiting a quick hospital release and a return to work,
said his children, who admitted fearing the worst when a stroke
sidelined him.
</P>
<P>
   The 87-year-old former president, visited by three of his four
children Thursday, asked about his grandchildren and said he was
looking forward to a rest in Colorado. But he was also already
promising to hit the campaign trail in support of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''The old sort of competitive juices got him going,'' said Jack
Ford on CNN's ''Larry King Live'' Thursday night. ''He was walking
the hall through the hospital. The nurse was saying, 'Slow down,
you're going too fast for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was listed in fair condition at Hahnemann University
Hospital, and doctors said he would recover fully without needing
rehabilitation therapy. They were doing tests to determine the
cause of some painful swelling in the tongue that was unrelated to
the stroke.
</P>
<P>
   His children said they worried after seeing their father looking
sluggish and sick on television after a Republican tribute to him
Tuesday night during the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't look well,'' said Michael Ford. ''I thought he
looked tired and was a little under the weather. So I was quite
scared, and we made arrangements to get here as quickly as we
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they declined to question whether doctors adequately
examined their father after he arrived at the hospital late Tuesday
complaining of facial pain. He was diagnosed as having a sinus
condition and left the hospital after refusing doctors'
recommendations that he take a CT scan.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bush and former Sen. Robert Dole paid separate
visits to Ford at the hospital. ''I thought he looked pretty
good,'' Dole said. ''He's anxious to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Neurological exams showed Ford suffered at least one stroke and
may have had more, doctors said. They were giving him an oral
blood-thinning medicine, Coumadin, to prevent another stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a stroke standpoint, he is progressing exactly as we
would expect for someone in his condition,'' said Dr. Carole
Thomas, director of the neurological intensive care and stroke
program at the hospital. ''It was a fairly minor stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's speech remains slurred, but he had regained the use of
his left hand and has been sleeping well, doctors said.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Reunion Canidates Delayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea on Friday delayed by one
day the selection of the final 100 people to be reunited with
long-lost relatives in North Korea this month, Red Cross officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Park Ki-ryun, secretary-general of the South Korean Red Cross,
said officials need more time to ensure the fairness of the choice.
The selection, originally scheduled to be made Friday, was delayed
until Saturday, Park said.
</P>
<P>
   The family reunions were a key part of an agreement negotiated
at a historic summit of leaders of the two Koreas in June. The
accord calls for the two Koreas to exchange 100 people each for
four days of temporary family reunions starting Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas had exchanged the names of 200 candidates each in
late June to check whether their families on the other side were
alive and could be found.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has confirmed the whereabouts of 198 of the 200
families whose names were given by the North. North Korea confirmed
138.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first round of family reunions since 1985, when
50 people from each side were allowed to cross the border to visit
their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people fled North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean
War. Thousands of South Koreans are believed to have gone to the
North voluntarily or after being inducted into the North's army.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean border is the world's most heavily fortified. There
is no inter-Korean telephone, mail and other direct means of
communications for private citizens.

<HEADLINE> Man Removed From Airplane Wheel Well  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man found in the wheel well of an Air
France jet at Los Angeles International Airport late Thursday may
have been a stowaway who survived an overseas flight, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could see him secreted in the (main wheel) well,'' Fire
Department spokesman Jim Wells said. ''He was extricated from an
area that's not big enough to get comfortable in.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said the man thrashed about as firefighters pulled him
out. He was taken to UCLA Medical Center with severe hypothermia
and was in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear how he could have survived a high-altitude
flight in the wheel well or if he might have been secreted in a
safer part of the plane during flight before climbing down after
landing.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 747 originated in Papeete, French Polynesia. A call
placed to Air France was answered by a recording.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names Lee, Bypasses GOP  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton took advantage of a
congressional recess to make Bill Lann Lee his assistant attorney
general for civil rights, a move that could further deepen his
standoff with the Senate over judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announcement, made without comment while Clinton
was playing golf Thursday, comes nearly three years after the
president named Lee as his main civil rights enforcer on an acting
basis to circumvent heavy Republican opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action allows Lee to hold the post through the end of
Clinton's term in January without sending his nomination to
Congress for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., ranking Democrat on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said Republican recalcitrance forced Clinton
to give Lee a recess appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way they have treated Bill Lann Lee has been petty and
steeped in partisan vinegar,'' Leahy said. ''It has been a direct
insult to him and to all who care about civil rights enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, whose committee
would have sat in judgment on a Lee nomination, said Clinton was
the one playing partisan politics by installing Lee during the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing of this decision serves as further evidence of what
we have come to know is true: The Clinton-Gore White House is
intent on dividing our people rather than uniting us for the common
good,'' Hatch said. He added that he personally likes Lee and
''would support him in any number of positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno praised Lee's record during the
three years he served in an acting capacity, saying many of his
cases were resolved through settlements or consensual agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill believes very strongly that how we resolve a matter is
sometimes as important as what the particular resolution is,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton notified Senate leaders late last year that he might
install 13 languishing nominees through recess appointments, which
don't require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's nomination was among five that were vigorously opposed by
a group of Republicans who indicated they might retaliate against
recess appointments by blocking all judicial nominees for the rest
of Clinton's term, which ends Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   A leader in the GOP opposition, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said
Thursday he was irked that Clinton did not deliver a list of
proposed appointments well in advance of the congressional recess
as he had promised.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, I think we can stop these,'' he said. ''I oppose the
action. We're going to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a total of 13 appointments Thursday, the majority
to non-controversial positions. The president also appointed
another of the five opposed nominees Thursday, making Sally Katzen
deputy director for management at the Office of Management and
Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has groused publicly that some of his judicial
nominations -- notably, those of minorities and women -- are hung up
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said Lee's situation is part of a four-year pattern under
which Clinton's nominees, ''especially women and minorities, have
been subjected to anonymous and humiliating delays before they get
a vote, if they ever get a vote at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first nominated Lee, a former lawyer for the NAACP Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, on July 21, 1997. In December 1997,
Clinton installed Lee as acting assistant attorney general for
civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Lee an indefinite hold on the job and was considered
less confrontational than invoking constitutional power for a
recess appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nominated Lee again in January and March 1998, but no
action has been taken since.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, the president can temporarily bypass the
Senate confirmation process by giving an individual an appointment
during a congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Clinton used a recess appointment to install San
Francisco businessman James Hormel, who is homosexual, as
ambassador to Luxembourg. Hormel's nomination had been blocked in
Congress for two years.

<HEADLINE> Paul Newman's Plane Has Problem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. (AP) -- The plane carrying Oscar-winning actor and
philanthropist Paul Newman made an unscheduled landing after it
developed a minor electrical problem.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, 75, was flying from the Glens Falls airport late Monday
afternoon after visiting the camp for seriously ill children he
co-founded called Double H Hole in the Woods camp in Lake Luzerne.
</P>
<P>
   The electrical problem forced the pilot to land the private jet
about 45 miles to the south at Albany International Airport. Newman
and his group that included Tom Indoe, chief executive officer of
Newman's Own food company, continued to White Plains by car.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kinds of events happen all the time,'' said Jim Peters,
spokesman for the FAA's Eastern Region in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot took the plane back to Connecticut, where Newman
lives, the Albany Times Union reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who also has raced cars in New York state for decades,
has said he will act in one more movie before retiring. He appeared
in ''Where the Money Is'' this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's food company has donated millions of dollars to
charities each year and established five camps for seriously ill
children.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher. The Dow Jones
industrial average is up 4 points in today's early going. Advancing
issues on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 3-2 lead over
decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 52 points and the S&AMP;P 500
index is up 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   The market is taking today's unemployment report and running
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Just how far it will run remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   But, the July report showed a decline in payroll jobs of
108,000, when many analysts were looking for a small increase.
</P>
<P>
   So, the report certainly doesn't add to the pressure on the Fed
to raise interest rates at its meeting this month.
</P>
<P>
   And there's some hope on the Street that it will alleviate any
of the remaining pressure, and allow for another soft landing of
the economy.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher on Employment Data  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher Friday on employment data
that offered cautious optimism that an extremely tight job market
was loosening slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average, after retracing a quick surge following the release of the
employment figures, was up a modest 2.20 at 10,708.78.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was up 71.20 at
3,831.08. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index was up 7.63 at 1,460.19.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment rate was unchanged at 4 percent in
July, close to a three-decade low, despite the loss of 108,000
payroll jobs during the month, the biggest setback in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the losses resulted from 290,000 temporary government
workers laid off in July because their work on the census was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department report showed private payrolls actually
rose by 138,000 during the month. However, analysts noted that last
month's gain in private sector jobs was down significantly from a
jump of 242,000 in June.
</P>
<P>
   Employment figures are watched closely because they are a key
barometer for inflationary pressures. Employers must pay higher
wages when demand for workers is high. Higher wages leads to higher
consumer prices and the onset of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board has raised interest rates six times
since last summer in an effort to stave off inflation, and
investors hope the latest figures are a sign that strategy is
working.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday on employment data that
offered cautious optimism that an extremely tight job market was
easing slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 21.98 at 10,684.60, having fallen back from a
quick upward move after the release of U.S. employment figures for
July.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 1.24 at 1,453.84, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 13.77 at 3,773.65.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment rate was unchanged at 4 percent in
July, close to a three-decade low, despite the loss of 108,000
payroll jobs during the month, the biggest setback in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the losses resulted from 290,000 temporary government
workers laid off in July because their work on the census was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department report showed private payrolls actually
rose by 138,000 during the month. However, analysts noted that last
month's gain in private sector jobs was down significantly from a
jump of 242,000 in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's probably going to be viewed as the most important
evidence that the Federal Reserve Board won't increase interest
rates at the end of August,'' said James Meyer, director of
research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But the optimism was limited to a narrow list of sectors, namely
banking and financial services stocks. J.P. Morgan led the way,
rising $4.875 to $139.875.
</P>
<P>
   Employment figures are watched closely because they are a key
barometer for inflationary pressures. Employers must pay higher
wages when demand for workers is high. Higher wages leads to higher
consumer prices and the onset of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board has raised interest rates six times
since last summer in an effort to stave off inflation, and
investors hope the latest figures are a sign that strategy is
working.
</P>
<P>
   If Fed members feel the same, they are more likely to leave
interest rates alone at their next meeting Aug. 22.

   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered decliners on the New York

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- This year's Great American Post Office is
Chautauqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The western New York office topped 150 local offices entered in
the contest that rates offices according to historical
significance, service and architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very difficult decision for the judges,'' said James
Bruns, Director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Postal
Museum, which runs the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Chautauqua, located in New York State southwest of Buffalo, was
the site where the Chautauqua movement was founded in the late
1800s. The movement organized series of lectures and other
educational programs, eventually spreading to other areas of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, Mich., was the runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   There were also first place prizes for winners in each category:
Muncy, Pa. for service; Galveston, Texas for architecture and
Topeka, Kan. for history.
</P>
<P>
   The Chautauqua Post Office will be awarded a brass plaque for
prominent display in their lobby during a special upcoming
presentation ceremony. Last year's top winner was Galena, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Chautauqua is not Chappaqua, the village at the other end of the
state where the President and Mrs. Clinton are making their home.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Grounds 18 Jets  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines has completed 12 of an expected
17 inspections of MD-80 aircraft, one day after announcing that a
tool used to measure stresses on the jets' tail sections may have
given the wrong readings.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska said the tool in question, made by the airline itself,
could give incorrect measurements of stresses on the jackscrews in
the MD-80s' horizontal stabilizers. The same part has been
implicated in the Jan. 31 crash of Alaska Flight 261 off the
California coast that killed all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska spokesman Jack Evans said Friday that of the 12 aircraft
inspected overnight, the stress measurements were correct and did
not show any additional wear and tear. The company was expected to
inspect five more MD-80s later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the company said 18 jets would be grounded for the
inspections, but Evans said one of those was found to have been
inspected with a different tool -- made by plane manufacturer
McDonnell Douglas -- and was back in service.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials told the Federal Aviation Administration on
Thursday that its tool used to check jackscrews may have produced
incorrect readings. The assembly consists of a nut that rides up
and down a screw as it is turned to raise and lower the stabilizer,
a winglike part of the tail that is used to raise or lower the nose
of the plane in flight.
</P>
<P>
   There are no indications of problems, but other airlines also
have been told to check MD-80 and DC-9 planes, according to an FAA
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The scramble resulted in cancellation of 18 Alaska Airlines
flights late Thursday, including eight from the company's principal
hub at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. An additional 29
flights were canceled Friday, Evans said, far below the 72 flights
the company had estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, the dominant carrier on north-south routes
along the West Coast, normally operates about 500 flights a day
with a fleet of 90 planes, including 34 MD-80s. The company was
providing meal vouchers, rebooking some passengers and offering
others hotel rooms overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. took over production of the MD-80, which is based
on the DC-9 airframe, after absorbing McDonnell Douglas in a $16.3
billion merger in 1997. Out of about 2,000 MD-80-series and DC-9
jetliners worldwide, more than 1,100 are flown by U.S. carriers.
</P>
<P>
   After the Alaska Flight 261 crash, the FAA inspected the
airline's maintenance facilities and found more than 150 instances
of improper or missing paperwork. The probe found that maintenance
had been done correctly, however.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal investigation into the crash has focused on a
mechanic's decision not to replace a jackscrew assembly. The
jackscrew had been tested repeatedly and found to be nearly worn
out but was returned to service after a second crew retested it a
few days later. Two Alaska Airlines mechanics from that second crew
insisted in an interview with the Times that they were not at
fault.

<P>
   The Palm Vx handheld is ultra-slim, ultra-light and holds
thousands of names, addresses, phone numbers, appointments and
e-mail messages. There are several add-on accessories, including
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Schiffer is personally selecting her favorite add-on software
applications to include on a CD that customers can use to install
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to become as essential in pop culture as we are in
tech culture,'' Palm chief marketing officer Satjiv Chahil said.

<HEADLINE> Blacklisted Writers Credited  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Writers Guild of America has corrected
the credits of eight blacklisted writers on 14 films released
between 1951 and 1964, including seven by the late Dalton Trumbo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very pleased that the WGA has done this,'' Trumbo's son,
Christopher, said Thursday. ''It's worth noting that many of the
movies are ones that I don't believe he would have worked on had
there not been a blacklist. It reflects that he had to write
whatever was available.''
</P>
<P>
   The films written by Trumbo, who died in 1976, include ''Terror
in a Texas Town,'' ''The Boss,'' ''The Green-Eyed Blonde,'' ''He
Ran All the Way,'' ''The Brave One,'' ''Cowboy'' and ''The
Prowler.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous writers, directors, actors and producers were
blacklisted by Hollywood during the McCarthy era if they were known
or suspected communists or ''fellow travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the union began corrections in 1986, there have been
revisions to the writing credits on 95 films.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gordon, who received a revised story credit for 1964's
''Circus World,'' said it was the 10th credit he has received from
work he performed while on the blacklist. Three others are still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very difficult and complicated process because you're
talking about things that happened 40 and 50 years ago,'' Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   In other corrections, Carl Foreman received credit for ''Born
for Trouble,'' Ben Barzman for ''It Happened in Paris'' and
''Stranger on the Prowl,'' Cyril Endfield for ''The Master Plan,''
Hugo Butler along with Trumbo for ''The Prowler'' and ''He Ran All
the Way,'' Butler and Ring Lardner Jr. for ''The Big Night,'' and
Paul Jarrico for ''The Man Who Watched Trains Go By.''

<HEADLINE> US Prepares for Flu Shot Shortage  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Worried about a possible shortage of this
winter's flu vaccine, federal health officials are studying whether
it would be safe to stretch supplies by giving some healthy
Americans half a dose, reserving full-strength vaccine for the
elderly and ill who need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Experts won't know until October if such a plan would work.
That's when they expect results of a clinical trial to measure
whether half a vaccine dose revs up certain people's immune systems
enough to protect them. Six hospitals will start recruiting 840
volunteers for the study next week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government is warning doctors and clinics that
flu shots will be shipped late this year -- meaning the healthy will
have to delay their shots a little while the elderly and others at
high risk of dying from the flu get vaccinated first.
</P>
<P>
   The government probably won't know until September if there also
will be a significant shortage of vaccine doses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear there will be a delay in availability of
influenza vaccine,'' Dr. Nancy Cox of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said Friday. But, ''we don't know for sure
how much vaccine will be available.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem: Manufacturers had trouble growing one of the
influenza strains used in this year's vaccine. Because different
flu strains circle the globe each year, a new flu vaccine must be
brewed annually. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration
earlier this year ordered two of the nation's four vaccine makers
to correct manufacturing problems in their factories, delaying
production.
</P>
<P>
   The flu kills about 20,000 people every year. Most at risk are
people over age 64, and people of any age who have chronic heart or
lung diseases, including asthma, or who have diabetes, kidney
disease or a weakened immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect there would be enough vaccine to go around for those
who are at highest risk,'' Cox stressed.
</P>
<P>
   But because lots of healthy adults want flu shots too, the CDC
is urging health groups to ensure that high-risk patients get the
first available vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   If a doctor happens to get an early shipment of flu shots in
September or October, go ahead and vaccinate high-risk patients as
soon as possible, Cox advised.
</P>
<P>
   But companies, civic groups and others should postpone until
November -- a month late -- the annual mass-vaccination campaigns and
''flu-shot fairs'' that attract healthy, younger adults, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the half-dose vaccine theory, the National Institutes of
Health-funded study will begin recruiting healthy volunteers, ages
18 to 49, next week. Scientists will measure whether people given
half a dose of flu vaccine produce as many flu-fighting immune
cells as those who get a full vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Only healthy adults can test the half-dose theory -- and even if
a half-dose works for them, people at high risk of dying from flu
still would get the full dose, experts stressed.
</P>
<P>
   The study will be conducted at the University of Rochester, St.
Louis University, Baylor College of Medicine, University of
Maryland, Cincinnati Children's Hospital and the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Information on how to volunteer for the study will be posted
Tuesday on the following Internet site: http://clinicaltrials.gov.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Frank Lashes Out At Armey  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- House Majority Leader Dick Armey is in hot water
again over a remark about openly gay Rep. Barney Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, a Texas Republican who called Frank ''Barney Fag'' in
1995, made a joke about Frank at a party Wednesday night in
Philadelphia at the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The comment was made during a conversation with humorist Dave
Barry and several reporters. Barry said he jokingly asked Armey:
''Are you the real Dick Armey?''
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Yeah, I'm afraid I am' and then he kind of obliquely
referred to all the trouble he got into before, and then he made a
joke about his name,'' Barry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The joke was a reference to a vulgar meaning for Armey's name
and referred to Frank, who is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Armey spokeswoman Michele Davis said a group of journalists
started joking about Armey's name, and Armey made the comment about
Frank in a ''sarcastic tone'' to cut them off and let them know
he'd heard the jokes before about his name.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was making the point that these jokes are offensive and old
and unnecessary. That's how he has always treated those jokes,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said Armey's comment was ironic in light of the tolerant
message the party tried to convey in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just interesting that as hard as George W. Bush is trying
to disguise the real nature of that party, it's beyond his
capacity,'' said Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''You still have one of the most important figures in the
Republican Party, the majority leader of the House, making these
kinds of remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barry defended Armey, saying the joke was entirely
self-deprecating.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was making fun of himself and the trouble he got into one
time,'' Barry said, referring to the fallout from the 1995 comment,
which Armey has said was an accidental slip of the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dick Armey is not stupid enough that he's going to get up and
make a joke about minority groups in front of the press,'' Barry
said. ''I'm not a fan of Dick Armey, but it's blown totally,
grotesquely out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Campaign, a gay and lesbian political group,
called on Armey to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left with the Bush campaign and with the Log Cabin
Republicans, a group of gay members of the Republican party, were
not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Makes Recess Appointments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Friday made another round
of appointments with Congress not in session, including one that
drew opposition in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appointed John D. Holum as undersecretary of state for
arms control and international security. Holum's nomination had
been pending since March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The president also appointed George T. Frampton Jr. as chairman
of the Council on Environmental Quality, and Robert S. LaRussa as
an undersecretary for international trade at the Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Holum, a lawyer who previously served as legislative director
for former Sen. George McGovern, was among five Clinton nominees
considered unacceptable by a core group of GOP senators.
</P>
<P>
   The president gave recess appointments on Thursday to two of the
five: Bill Lann Lee, assistant attorney general for civil rights,
and Sally Katzen, deputy director for the Office of Management and
Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, the president can temporarily bypass the
Senate confirmation process by giving an individual an appointment
during a congressional recess.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 61; Nasdaq Gains 27  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fluctuated for a second straight day
Friday, eventually closing higher on employment data that may point
to easing in the extremely tight job market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose in early trading but fell
just as abruptly in response to the July employment figures. A
buying spree late in the session allowed blue chips stocks to close
up 61.17 at 10,767.75. For the week, the Dow rose 256.58.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index closed up 27.48 at 3,787.36, slipping
from a gain of more than 70 points earlier in the session. The
technology heavy index also swung wildly on Thursday; it ended the
week up 124.36.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.37 at 1,462.93, and
had a 43.04-point gain for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed Friday's volatility to indecisive investors
who don't know what to make of conflicting economic signals.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment rate was unchanged at 4 percent in
July, close to a three-decade low, despite the loss of 108,000
payroll jobs during the month, the biggest setback in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But all the losses resulted from 290,000 temporary government
workers laid off in July because their work on the census was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department report showed private payrolls actually
rose by 138,000 during the month. However, analysts noted that last
month's gain in private sector jobs was down significantly from a
jump of 242,000 in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's probably going to be viewed as the most important
evidence that the Federal Reserve Board won't increase interest
rates at the end of August,'' said James Meyer, director of
research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Broad-based investor optimism was limited to a narrow group of
sectors, however, namely banking and financial services stocks.
J.P. Morgan led the way, rising $8.25 to $143.25, and Merrill Lynch
shares rose $4.937 to $135.75.
</P>
<P>
   Banks will benefit if interest rates remain stable because
higher rates tend to curb lending and the lucrative business of
underwriting stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of widely held technology stocks also saw gains,
helping to lift the Nasdaq stock market. Fiber optics company Ciena
was up $6.75 to $148.688, software maker Oracle was up $4.125 at
$81.563, and Internet giant Yahoo! was up $2.75 at $133.938.
</P>
<P>
   But those gains were offset by losses to such bellwethers as
Intel, down $2.50 at $62.563, and drug maker Merck, down $1.187 at
$73.813.
</P>
<P>
   Employment figures are watched closely because they are a key
barometer for inflationary pressures. Employers must pay higher
wages when demand for workers is high. Higher wages lead to higher
consumer prices and the onset of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates six times since last summer in
an effort to stave off inflation, and investors hope the latest job
figures are a sign that strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
   If Fed members feel the same, they are more likely to leave
interest rates alone at their next meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5 to 3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.12 billion shares,
down from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 4.18 at 503.63.
</P>
<P>
   In overseas trading, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.93 percent. In
London, the FT-SE 100 index rose 0.73 percent, while Paris' CAC
index gained 1.67 percent and Germany's DAX fell 0.30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Make Trip To Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will travel to Colombia on
Aug. 30 to show solidarity with President Andres Pastrana in his
efforts to defeat narcotics traffickers and end the country's
36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has strongly supported Colombia's
counternarcotics effort, persuading the Congress to approve $1.3
billion in assistance last month. The funding is being used mostly
to equip and train Colombian military units assigned to anti-drug
duty.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Clinton's first trip to Colombia. He will fly to the
port city of Cartagena for his meetings with Pastrana, returning to
Washington the same day. A U.S. official, asking not to be
identified, said an overnight stay was ruled out for security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The visit mirrors a trip former President George Bush made in
February, 1990 when, highlighting his administration's anti-drug
campaign, he spent four hours in Cartagena. Bush was joined there
by Colombia's president and leaders from other Andean countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a statement that it is ''profoundly in the
interest of the United States'' for Colombia to succeed in its
efforts to seek peace, fight illicit drugs, build its economy and
protect democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He will be joined on the trip by House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del. Under Secretary of State
Thomas Pickering will travel to Colombia next week to help lay the
groundwork for the trip and also to speak to a conference of
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also signed a Presidential Decision Directive on
Colombia, calling for an intensified U.S. effort to assist the
Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. assistance package is earmarked solely to aid in
counterdrug efforts but some lawmakers are concerned that the
United States might get bogged down in the war the Colombian army
has been waging against two leftist guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Antonio Lozada, a spokesman for one of the groups, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, said Friday that Clinton's
stopover was ''clear evidence'' that the United States was using
the guise of the war on drugs to violate Colombia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe this is a visit by a president who is a
friend of the Colombian public but exactly the opposite,'' said
Lozada, whose rebel army is believed to be about 20,000 strong.
''It's a visit by a head of state that ... comes ready to grossly
intervene in the internal affairs of our country.'' He spoke in a
telephone interview from southern Colombia's guerrilla-controlled
demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
   For the Clinton administration, the situation is complicated
because the narcotic traffickers receive protection from both the
guerrillas and paramilitary units. The drug growing areas for the
most part are located in guerrilla-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton signed the aid package in July, there has been a
marked increase in guerrilla activity, often against remote hamlets
with minimal protection. The State Department's top counterdrug
official, Randy Beers, said in an interview Friday that the large
death toll during these offensives ''underscores the nature of this
movement. It is difficult to think of it other than as a criminal
organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that it would be ridiculous not to take action against
a group involved in drug trafficking just because they are part of
a political movement.

<HEADLINE> Task Force Rounds Up Drug Dealers  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A four-month effort to round up fugitive
drug-trafficking suspects netted 1,015 arrests and $1 million in
seized property, federal authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, led by the Marshals Service with state and other
federal agencies, targeted suspects considered some of the most
elusive. Many were alleged high-level drug dealers from the United
States and the Caribbean who had been indicted but never were
arrested or who had jumped bail.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were lost for as long as they were because they are good
at it,'' said U.S. Marshals Service Director John Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Among those captured were an alleged drug trafficker suspected
in the deaths of two government informants; an alleged marijuana
supplier accused of setting up an elaborate indoor farm and a man
charged with using drug money to provide automatic weapons to
Colombian dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are not your low-level street dealers,'' said U.S.
Attorney Donna Bucella. ''These are the distributors.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the arrested fugitives now in custody are from
Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and other parts of the Caribbean
and several U.S. states.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marshals Services began the intensive searches four
months ago after compiling a list of their most elusive fugitives.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Charles Laquidara signed off the air Friday,
ending an era on Boston radio that helped revolutionize FM
listening.
</P>
<P>
   Laquidara, who was the host of the hugely popular ''The Big
Mattress'' on WBCN-FM for the better part of 25 years, devoted his
farewell program on WZLX-FM to reminiscences and a sampling of his
favorite music -- an eclectic mix ranging from Grateful Dead to the
heavy metal band Metallica to Tony Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   His final song was Bennett's ''The Best is Yet To Come.'' He
plans to move to Maui and may explore Internet opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Laquidara was a struggling young actor in Hollywood in the 1960s
when he took his first job in radio, as an announcer for classical
music station KPPC-FM in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   When the station changed its format to what was then referred to
as ''underground rock,'' Laquidara began to develop a reputation as
a pioneer in a radio movement that was closely linked to the
protest culture of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he was hired at WBCN to replace disc jockey Peter Wolf,
who would go on to become the lead singer of the J. Geils Band. In
1972, he was named host of the station's morning-drive show.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site, www.bigmattress.com, Laquidara explains how he
came up with the unusual name for the show:
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed to conjure up images of thousands of listeners, from
hundreds of different towns in New England, all on this huge,
imaginary mattress -- all waking up to the sounds of rock and roll
from their radios before they went off to school or work.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, WBCN replaced Laquidara in the morning with Howard
Stern. Laquidara moved to sister station WZLX, and that station's
''classic rock'' format featured many of the same songs he played
when the music was new and considered ''underground rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Laquidara's final week was marked with a series of events around
the city, including the presentation by Boston Mayor Thomas M.
Menino of a walk-of-fame star outside the city's Tower Records.

<HEADLINE> 300 Blank US Passports Scattered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 300 blank U.S. passports fell from a
government vehicle Friday and were scattered on the ground after
the box in which were they were contained was struck by a car, the
State Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The passports were being transported to the Passport Agency near
downtown Washington. The precise location of the mishap was not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the passports were recovered but others were picked up
by passersby, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the State Department has electronically canceled all
passports involved in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher encouraged anyone in possession of blank passports to
turn them in to the State Department or to the Metropolitan Police
Department.

<HEADLINE> Lazio makes Clinton an offer: a moratorium on soft money  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON, N.Y. (AP) - Rick Lazio made Hillary Rodham Clinton
an offer she's already made: If she pledges not to use soft money
in her campaign, he'll do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Arizona Sen. John McCain, known for pushing
campaign finance reform, the Republican candidate for New York's
Senate seat spoke during a visit Friday to a Long Island housing
project, saying he agreed with his fellow Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said that if soft money isn't taken out of all Senate
campaigns, the result will be ''an avalanche of negative ads which
the people of New York and the people of Arizona and the people of
this country don't want.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former presidential candidate, said an
''out-of-control'' election system discourages Americans from
voting.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio claimed at least four soft-money accounts are financing
the Clinton campaign, and suggested there could be more.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign said there were only two accounts, and it
responded to Lazio's offer by pointing out that advisers to the
first lady had said in May that she would consider renouncing soft
money if her opponent did the same. But noting that Democrats had
already spent soft money on her behalf, the Lazio camp at the time
said the offer was nothing more than a political gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   On May 22, federal records showed that $542,000 in unregulated
campaign donations had been collected in two months for a special
Democratic account to help Clinton's Senate bid, bringing to more
than $1.2 million the amount of ''soft money'' taken in at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign manager Bill de Blasio charged that Lazio has
his own soft-money committee called Friends of Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming week, the Republican congressman from Long Island
will embark on an out-of-state fund-raising campaign, while Clinton
went to Martha's Vineyard for a weekend of fund-raising of her own,
with President Clinton at her side.

<HEADLINE> Shelton: All Army Divisions Ready  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREA CAVANAUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said Friday that all of the Army's 10 divisions
are ready to meet their wartime requirements despite peacekeeping
commitments in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton was responding to a question at a public forum about a
comment made by Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, who
said in his acceptance speech at the GOP convention that two Army
divisions were not combat ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''If called on by the commander-in-chief today, two entire
divisions of the Army would have to report, 'Not ready for duty,
sir,''' Bush said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused the Clinton administration of allowing U.S.
military might to erode.
</P>
<P>
   In October the commanders of the 1st Infantry Division and the
10th Mountain Division downgraded the readiness of their units
because portions of each division were deployed on peacekeeping
missions in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Those divisions have since reported that they are fully combat
ready, Shelton told an audience during questioning after a speech
to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, who did not mention the issue in his speech, said he
was reluctant to comment on Bush's remarks, but added, ''National
security is so important it should be above politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials contacted Friday said the most current
readniess reports show all 10 of the Army's active divisions are
ready -- and have been for the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   In a report made public late last year, commanders of the two
divisions downgraded their units' readiness to C-4, the lowest of
four readiness ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The rating means that in a worst-case scenario of one major war
breaking out almost immediately after another in separate parts of
the world, these divisions could not get their troops to the fight
in the time prescribed by the Defense Department's war plan.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, elements of the 1st Infantry were in Kosovo and a
portion of the 10th Mountain Division was in Bosnia. Commanders
were concerned that the peacekeeping troops could not quickly
extract themselves and their equipment, return to their home bases,
retrain and then ship off to a major war in the allotted time.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton acknowledged that cuts in Pentagon budgets and personnel
during the past decade have taxed the military. Defense spending
and resources have been cut by 40 percent while commitments around
the world have increased 300 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are doing much more than we were doing 10 years ago, and we
are doing it with much less,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> One of OTHER Democratic U.S. Senate candidates drops out of race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - One of the five candidates challenging Hillary
Rodham Clinton in the upcoming Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate
candidate has dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Ruano Melendez, a little-known civil engineer from New
York, announced his withdrawal Friday and instead endorsed the
first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she's the best candidate for this election and I don't
want to polarize my party,'' Melendez said.
</P>
<P>
   Melendez said that he intends to run for state senate against
Serphin Maltese in the general election instead.
</P>
<P>
   Melendez's departure from the race leaves Irving Gelb, Peter
Ruane, Dr. Mark McMahon, and Jimmy McMillan contesting with Clinton
in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The state Democratic primary is scheduled for Sept. 12.

<HEADLINE> Police arrest suspect wanted in six Brooklyn killings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Police on Friday arrested a homeless man they
believe has killed six women in Brooklyn over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, identified as Vincent Johnson, who also goes by the
first name of Vinceny, was arrested Friday evening walking toward
Brooklyn on the Williamsburg Bridge, Detective John Giammarino
said. The 31-year-old man had not been charged as of late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday police announced that a connection had been made
in the cases and were looking for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''A connection was made through forensic evidence, witness
accounts and the modus operandi of the victims that were killed,''
Deputy Chief Joseph Cuneen said.
</P>
<P>
   In all of the cases, the victims were strangled with whatever
their killer could find: two were strangled with their own
shoelaces, two with electrical cord, one with the drawstring from a
pair of sweatpants, and one with a piece of cloth.
</P>
<P>
   All the women had been arrested before for prostitution or
drug-related offenses, and all were found nude or partly clothed.
Their bodies were found in either Williamsburg or
Bedford-Stuyvesant.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Caraballo, 26, was the first victim - her body was found
on Aug. 26, 1999. Joanne Feliciano, 35, was found on Sept. 16,
1999. Rhonda Tucker, 21, was found on Sept. 25, 1999. In these
cases, DNA evidence suggested that the same man had had sex with
all these women, police have said. Cuneen would not discuss such
evidence on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth victim, Katrina Niles, 34, was found on Oct. 4, 1999.
A Jane Doe, believed to be 43, was found dead on Feb. 21, 2000. And
the last victim, Patricia Sullivan, 49, was found on June 22, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been arrested seven times in the city for various
offenses, including drug possession, criminal trespassing and theft
of services, Cuneen said.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Hits Russian Island  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A powerful earthquake struck the Russian island of
Sakhalin off the eastern coast of Siberia on Saturday, Russian and
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of injuries, the Emergency
Situations Ministry in Moscow said.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake, which had a preliminary magnitude of 7.0, hit at
8:13 a.m. Saturday (5:13 p.m. EDT Friday), about 920 miles north of
Tokyo, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Because the quake occurred on land, detection centers have not
issued a tsunami warning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a temblor registering 7.5 occurred about 240 miles
north of the latest earthquake. It killed almost 2,000 people and
caused severe damage. USGS spokeswoman Trudi Harlow said the latest
quake was much less forceful in terms of energy released.
