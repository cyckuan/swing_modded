<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Stresses Importance of "Three Emphases" Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAOZHOU, GUANGDONG PROVINCE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Jiang
Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee, said here today the "Three Emphases" education
stressing theoretical study, political awareness, and good conduct,
will continue to be a top priority for party building this year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also president and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, made the remark while attending a leadership meeting
here. Gaozhou is a county-level city in southwestern Guangdong
Province in south China, where Jiang was making an inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the meeting that cities and counties are important
foundations for maintaining good social order, developing the
national economy, and strengthening political power.
</P>
<P>
County and city government leaders shoulder the important
responsibility for carrying out the guidelines and policies of the
Party at the grassroots, and they are closest to the general
public, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore they should fully realize the importance of the "
Three Emphases," and work hard to add to their achievements,
overcome their shortcomings, improve their work, and make greater
contributions.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee attaches great importance to the "
Three Emphases" among county officials, and the Political Bureau
Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee has decided to
send its members to several cities and counties in Jiangsu, Hebei,
Zhejiang, Sichuan, Liaoning, and Shaanxi provinces to mobilize the
officials and conduct research.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said it is a major move for party building in the new
century to conduct "Three Emphases" education among the Party and
government leadership at the county level to deal with outstanding
problems related to the Party's work style.
</P>
<P>
"Three Emphases" education will prepare the Party ideologically,
politically, and organizationally to carry forward the socialist
cause comprehensively in the new century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said members of the Political Bureau Standing Committee
of the CPC Central Committee seriously participated in "Three
Emphases" education last December, practicing criticism and self-
criticism. They summed up the work practice and basic experience
over the past decade and discussed major issues in the reform and
development at present and for the future.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 Gaozhou Party and government officials were at
today's meeting, which was also attended by CPC Guangdong
Provincial Committee Secretary Li Changchun and Governor Lu Ruihua.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Belarussia Hold Meetings on Trade, Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi-Belarussian Joint
Committee for Trade and Economic Committee started its first
session here Monday in a bid to promote bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was co-chaired by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Hikmet al-Azzawi and Belarussian Vice Premier
Vladimir Zamitalin who arrived here Monday morning at the head of a
trade and economic delegation, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the means of developing and strengthening
bilateral trade and economic cooperation between the two countries
were discussed.
</P>
<P>
Azzawi said Iraq is very keen to continue and develop bilateral
cooperation with Belarussia in all fields through increasing trade
exchange between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Zamitalin said all countries should take serious
and effective steps to lift the embargo imposed on Iraq, because
the embargo affects not only Iraq, but also all other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said his country is keen to maintain friendly relations with
Iraq and will stay as a partner with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed bilateral cooperation within the
framework of the oil-for-food program which allows Iraq to sell oil
and use the revenue to buy humanitarian goods for its people who
are the hardest hit by the decade-old U.N. sanctions imposed on
Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Belarussia is to supply Iraq with engines and equipment for its
electricity sector under the oil-for-food program, and to
participate in the annual Baghdad International Fair, said INA.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Israel Cuts Interest Rate to Two-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The governor of Israel's
central bank announced Monday an interest rate cut of 0.4
percentages as of March, reducing the benchmark rate to its lowest
since August 1998.
</P>
<P>
David Klein said the interest rate cut, the second time in two
months, is part of a process to lower the interest rate gradually
in view of the stabilization of inflation expectation.
</P>
<P>
After the cut, the interest rate will stand at 9.9 percent, the
lowest since August 1998, when the rate was 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Klein took the decision after a latest survey published Sunday
by the Central Bureau of Statistics showed that inflation has
dropped to an annual rate of 0.3 percent, the lowest in the past 32
years and much lower than the official target of 3-4 percent for
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"The decision fits in with our efforts to establish price
stabilization, which forms the basis for sustained growth", Klein
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's business circle welcomed the interest cut, saying it
will stimulate economic growth by encouraging investments. However,
some still believe the interest rate is too high and should be cut
more quickly.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Calls for Enhancing Arab Cooperation and Coordination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika Monday called for enhancing and unifying Arab efforts in
the face of the challenges of globalization and fast-developing
technologies.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in his address to the opening session of the
ninth session of Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union (AIPU), according
to the Algerian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The major areas of challenges at present are represented in the
economic system and technological and cultural developments that
are inseparable, Bouteflika said.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the progress made in the area of Arab cooperation
and said that Arabs should have a common stance on their position
in this fast-developing world.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs should attach importance to the joint ventures at this
particular time when various regions worldwide are grouping
together to form economic blocs, Bouteflika added, noting that
without such blocs, the Arabs would have no say in international
talks.
</P>
<P>
He urged also for Arab reconciliation to create a common ground
and bridge the gaps among them.
</P>
<P>
The Arab reconciliation is an expression of Arab solidarity, the
Algerian president said. He called on the Arab parliamentarians to
be the mainstay of Arab rapprochement and an effective force in
implementing the giant projects of which the Arabs kept dreaming
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bouteflika cautioned against dangers posed by the new
world order in absence of the Arab bloc.
</P>
<P>
The advantages of the Arab world laid it subject to world
competition, blackmail and interference in various forms, the
Algerian leader warned.
</P>
<P>
The two-day session of the AIPU attracted participants from 20
member states.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arab Gets Two Life Sentences for Killing Israelis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli Arab Monday
received two consecutive life sentences for stabbing two Israelis
to death last year and plotting a car bombing attack against
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The defendant, Abdullah Akbariya, confessed before the Nazareth
District Court to murdering the 26-year-old Yehezkel Shai Fuenfter
and his 21-year-old girlfriend Sharon Steinmetz on August 29, 1999
while the young couple were on a hiking trip in the Megiddo forest
near the northern border of the West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Akbariya also admitted that he stole the couple's car to launch
a car bombing attack later in an Israeli city, which was aborted
after the police found the car at his home and arrested him.
</P>
<P>
He said he killed Jews deliberately to protest against economic
and other forms of discrimination against the Israeli Arab
minority, adding he felt no sorry for what he had done and what he
had planned to do.
</P>
<P>
The judges ruled that the two life sentences he got should be
served consecutively, which means he had very little legal chance
to be commuted and bailed out during the remainder of his life.
</P>
<P>
Akbariya's murder case, along with two botched car bombings by
Israeli Arabs in last September, raised concern that a new source
of threat to the peace process and Israeli security emerged from
Israeli Arabs, who traditionally distance themselves form the
extremist Palestinians in the self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Over one million Arabs, comprising some 20 percent of Israel's
population, live in self-contained towns and villages in Israel.
They are usually poor and politically untouchable, having no rights
to serve in Israeli army.

HARARE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The tropical cyclone affecting
Mozambique is approaching the eastern half of Zimbabwe at 60
kilometers an hour, Zimbabwean Ministry of Information, Posts and

<HEADLINE> Large Sum of Fake Money Found in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have discovered
a large sum of fake money, both local and foreign, in the capital
city of Kampala and more counterfeit money is suspected in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
Kampala Police Commander Benjamin Namanya told reporters at a
press conference that a total of 35 million Ugandan shillings and
24,000 U.S. dollars in fake money has been grabbed by the police.
</P>
<P>
Two suspects including a former student of social sciences in
Makerere University have been netted, he said, adding that

fake money.

<P>
The police commander appealed to the public to be more careful
when handling large amounts of money and to report to police once
any useful clues on suspected fake money are discovered.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Choose Right Political System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandans have been urged to
choose the right political system in the coming referendum
scheduled for June 2000.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Minister of Justice and Constitutional
Affairs Mayanja Nkangi at a referendum sensitization seminar,
Radio Uganda reported on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The referendum is stipulated in Constitution and it is the most
 democratic way to decide on the country's future, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He refuted allegations that the ruling National Resistance
Movement (NRM) has been intimidating multipartists in their
campaigns, saying that the opposition parties are free to vote.
</P>
<P>
Under Uganda's 1995 Constitution, a referendum should be held
to decide on the country's political system after the NRM rules
the country for five years.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports saying that the opposition parties are
to boycott the referendum because, they say, they are not treated
equally with the NRM.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials have been calling on the
multipartists not to boycott the referendum because it is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
The NRM came into power in 1986 and it is widely believed that
it would win in the forthcoming referendum.

<HEADLINE> Boat Services in Southern Mozambique Suspended for Cyclone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The regular boat links between
the cities of Inhambane and Maxixe across Inhambane bay in
southern Mozambique were suspended on Monday because of Cyclone
Eline, which is drawing closer to the Inhambane coast, causing
high winds and heavy seas.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Radio Mozambique, the Inhambane
provincial government is taking measures to minimize the effects
of the phenomenon, and urging local residents to stay on "maximum
alert".
</P>
<P>
People should stay indoors with the doors and windows shut, the
local authorities warned, suggesting that they should avoid the
groves of palm trees that fringe much of the Inhambane coast, lest
they be struck by falling coconuts or dislodged by strong winds.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the National Meteorological Institute
(INAME) said the winds in Inhambane are becoming stronger and are
accompanied by thunder and heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
It said "the sea has been stormy, with waves reaching a height
of four metres."
</P>
<P>
"The speed of the wind on the periphery of the cyclone reaches
about 100 kilometers an hour," the release said.
</P>
<P>
The areas most likely to be severely affected are the north of
Inhambane and the south of Sofala Province. These are areas which
have already suffered severe flooding, notably in the valley of
the Save river.
</P>
<P>
Conditions off the Inhambane coast are now regarded as highly
dangerous, and INAME has advised all boats in the area to head for
the nearest port as quickly as possible.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Keen to Promote Mideast Peace Process:PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is keen to push forward
the deadlocked Middle East peace process on all tracks to achieve a
just, durable and comprehensive peace in the region, Prime Minister
Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a meeting with Italian Trade Minister
Piero Fassino who is visiting the kingdom on bilateral economic
cooperation and the developments in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh said Jordan enjoys strong relations with parties
concerned in the peace process, which will help the kingdom play a
constructive role in overcoming obstacles facing the peace talks
between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed Jordan, which takes peace as its strategic option,
is keen to see developments in peace negotiations on all tracks,
including Israel's talks with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also called on European countries to play a
key role in advancing the peace process, and expressed appreciation
about Italy's efforts in this regard, Jordan's official news agency
Petra said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian leader also briefed Fassino on trade and
investment opportunities in the kingdom, and called on Italian
businessmen to invest in key industries as telecommunications,
cement production, and the mineral water industries.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Fassino expressed his appreciation for Jordan as a
major peace broker in the region after it signed a peace treaty
with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein had said he would visit
Israel in February to help break the deadlock in the Israeli-Syrian
peace talks, which were suspended indefinitely after Syria demanded
a written commitment from Israel to handing back in full the Golan
Heights it captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian officials said the visit is "no longer in the
offing" after Israel's massive air raids on Lebanon, where Syria
has been a major power broker, nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians also failed to meet a February 13
deadline to lay down the framework for a final peace agreement by
September.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Discuss Transport Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein and visiting Israeli Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
agreed on Monday to work on removing obstacles impeding the flow of
commodities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Abdullah stressed a just and comprehensive
peace in the region should be materialized through setting up
profitable ventures in the region, Jordan's official news agency
Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mordechai stressed Israel is determined to set up
joint ventures with the kingdom. Bilateral agreements concerning
transport between the two countries will be implemented in the near
future, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Mordechai and his Jordanian counterpart Issa
Ayub had agreed to set up sub-committees under the bilateral
transport committee to discuss technical problems facing the
transport of goods between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors since a peace treaty was signed between Jordan and Israel
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, anti-Israeli sentiment can be easily felt among the
Jordanian public, and critics of the 1994 peace treaty claimed that
Jordan has hardly got any peace dividends from the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian businessmen said Israel is still blocking their goods
from reaching Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas by
imposing unnecessary security checks on Jordanian trucks.
</P>
<P>
The security checks also hindered the increase of trade volume
between the two countries, currently standing at 20 million U.S.
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli side agreed in late 1999 to stop asking
Jordanian drivers to download their goods for security checks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials also vowed to increase the trade volume to
some 100 million dollars annually in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> 11 Candidates to Vie for Russian Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Eleven Russian politicians have
been officially registered as candidates in the upcoming
presidential elections, the Central Elections Commission (CEC)
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The final three candidates registered Monday were suspended
Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov, head of Moscow's Presidential
Programs Foundation Yevgeny Savostyanov, and advisor to the
general director of the Intourist-Radamer Hotel and Business
Center company Umar Dzhabrailov, according to Alexander Veshnyakov,
chairman of the CEC.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates include Acting President Vladimir Putin,
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, and Grigory Yavlinsky, leader
of the liberal Yabloko party.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who became acting head of state following Boris Yeltsin'
s abrupt resignation on December 31, remains the most popular
candidate that leads in opinion polls, far ahead of Zyuganov and
Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll shows Putin won 48 percent, short of the 50
percent needed for outright victory on the first ballot, with
Zyuganov a distant second on 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The candidates will be allowed to start campaigning in the
print media from February 23 and in the broadcast media from March

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Reaffirms "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba reaffirmed here on Monday that his country will continue
pursuing "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting with Chinese Vice-minister of
Foreign Affairs Wang Guangya who arrived here Sunday for a
three-day visit to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chiluba described China as an all-weather
friend of Zambia, saying bilateral relations are becoming "warmer
and warmer".
</P>
<P>
He said he is very happy over China's active participation in
Zambia's economic development, especially over China's involvement
in its copper mine privatization process.
</P>
<P>
The mining industry is key to his country's economy and once
the mine sector is fully developed it will create more employment,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba noted that there are great potentials in Zambia's
agriculture and tourism but it lacks the technology to fully
utilize them.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China would play more active roles
in these sectors.
</P>
<P>
Wang appreciated Zambia's political stability and economic
growth under the leadership of Chiluba and spoke highly of its
efforts to promote regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang thanked Zambia for its consistent support for
China's reunification endeavor.
</P>
<P>
China will do everything possible to make the projects that it
is undertaking in Zambia operational, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Wang held talks with his Zambian counterpart
Valentine Kayope on how to further promote bilateral cooperation
in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, an agreement was signed, under which China
will provide Zambia with goods worth one million yuan (about
121,000 U.S. dollars).

JOHANNESBURG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Nelson Mandela, former
South African President and chief mediator for Burundi's civil
war, Monday urged Burundi's two main rebel groups to join the
forthcoming peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to bring peace in Burundi, these rebel groups have
to be included," he was quoted by South African Press Association
as saying in Arusha, Tanzania, where seven African heads of state
are having a meeting on how to end the conflict in Burundi.
</P>

"It was not enough to invite all Burundi's 18 political
parties, the armed groups also had to be at the table," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two main rebel groups in Burundi, namely the Forces of the
Defense of Democracy and the National Liberation Forces, have not
confirmed that they will attend the talks between the government
and the opposition parties due to start on Tuesday and end on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> OPEC not to Increase Output, Says Iranian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan
Namdar Zanganeh predicted on Monday the crude oil output of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will not be
raised in the second quarter of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA),
Zanganeh said no change has appeared in the oil market in terms of
basic factors to justify possible increase in the OPEC oil output.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian minister, an increase in the OPEC's
output under the current circumstances will deal a strong blow to
the oil market.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh said a fair price in the oil market is one that will
guarantee the interests of the consumers and that of the producers.
</P>
<P>
A fair price should not cause inflation or fluctuation in order
to help the consumer nations proceed with their economic growth
through stable supply of oil in the long run, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fluctuations in the crude oil prices dealt a blow to the
Iranian economy and that of the oil producing countries as well, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He demanded the oil consuming nations exercise "self-restraint,"
saying the oil prices are not on a growing trend and an increase in
the OPEC output will not be a wise move under the current
situation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the OPEC could stabilize the oil market through
political will and consensus.
</P>
<P>
He said the OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna in March on
policy-making will be very important and that a sense of
understanding and solidarity exists among the OPEC members to
safeguard the achievements the organization has already made.
</P>
<P>
However, some OPEC members have reportedly decided to raise oil
output to cool down the market which has seen prices triple in the
last year due to concerted output curbs of OPEC and non-OPEC oil
producers.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, an influential OPEC member, has suggested an increase
of 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in OPEC production for the
rest of the year to stabilize the oil market.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, said the "ideal"
crude oil price, which recently surpassed 30 U.S. dollars per
barrel in the United States market, was between 20 to 25 dollars
per barrel.

OTTAWA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada is getting its first
premier of Indian origin after Attorney-General Ujjal Dosanjh won
the ballot at Sunday's New Democratic Party leadership convention
in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Dosanjh will become the 33rd premier of British Columbia when

Timbers.
</P>
<P>
"A new chapter in history is being written today, and we are

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Monday met in a closed meeting to discuss the current
situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) while African
nations are lobbying to get thousands of U.N. peace-keepers into
the central African country to save the peace process in the war-
torn country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, following the one held Friday, came as the 15-
nation body is expected to vote this week on the draft resolution
which intends to send 500 military observers and more than 5,000
peace-keepers into the African country.
</P>
<P>
Security Council members neared agreement on sending military
observers to Congo but were still negotiating an arms embargo on
rebel groups and measures to protect civilians.
</P>
<P>
However, some Security Council members, including the United
States, want to be certain that fighting has stopped and there
really is a peace to keep.
</P>
<P>
Despite a cease-fire agreement signed last summer in Lusaka,
capital of Zambia, by warring parties, repeated violations have
been reported from the country, formerly known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
As an initial step, the Security Council last August
authorized the deployment of 90 military liaison officers to
countries involved in the conflict: Congo and its backers --
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, and its opponents, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
However, it took months to get 79 officers in the field, and
many have been barred from key sites, especially in government-
held areas.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to vote on the long-awaited
draft resolution, which, sponsored by the United States, calls for
military observers to monitor implementation and lay the
groundwork for possible deployment of a much larger U.N. peace-
keeping force, which is called for in the Lusaka Agreement.
</P>
<P>
But there is still uncertainty about when the military
observers will arrive in DRC. And the Security Council was very
vague about the deployment of peace-keepers, saying in late
January that it intends to consider preparations "at appropriate
time."

<HEADLINE> UNIDO Official on Africa's Industrialization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Africa's industrialization
process should be underpinned by the acquisition of knowledge and
skills and not by natural resources endowment.
</P>
<P>
This is because the determinants of competitiveness change
rapidly, said Carlos Magarinos, director-general of the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), in the latest
issue of "Industrial Africa" released here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said African countries must establish a new pact to advocate
for the relevance of industrial development in poverty alleviation
and sustained economic development.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary General of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Vijay Makhan said Africa faces three challenges, the
first of which is globalization in which Africa should be an
active protagonist to avoid being marginalized or even excluded
from the mechanisms of modern economy.
</P>
<P>
The other challenges, he said, are political and social
cohesion, which can only be achieved by greater political
stability with good governance and the rule of law and unity and
integration to develop and enlarge economic areas and markets.
</P>
<P>
"To meet these challenges, Africa needs to renew its unity,
resolve its foreign debt problem, reverse the trend of capital
flight abroad, build an effective physical infrastructure and
develop its national and regional stock markets," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cape Verde's Ruling Party Loses Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Cape Verdean ruling Movement
for Democracy has lost its control of the capital city Cidade de
Praia and other four municipalities in the on-going local
elections, partial results showed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This setback suffered by the ruling party will surely cast
shadow over its campaign for winning the general elections in the
archipelago country to be held in a year, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
However, Cape Verdean Prime Minister Carlos Veiga downplayed
the losses to the rival opposition African Party for the
Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV) and independent candidates,
saying that his party has gained, among others, three city halls
formerly out of its control, namely Boavista, Maio and Paulo.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, heavy voter abstention is the
main cause of the ruling party's setback. Statistics showed that
in some districts, only 50 percent of the voters went to polls.
</P>
<P>
"A certain erosion" of the ruling party, which has been in
power for nine years, also impeded the Movement for Independence
from gaining a sweeping victory, he said.
</P>
<P>
Three parties and groups of independents fielded 46 slates of
candidates for the 10-island archipelago's 17 city halls.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Air Force Capable of Defending Airspace: Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese military
official said here Monday that the Chinese Air Force is capable of
effectively dealing with a local warfare against China under high-
tech conditions and defending the country's airspace in
maintaining state sovereignty, marine rights and unity of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Liu Shunyao, commander of the Air Force of
the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), stressed that China
will never invade or threaten any sovereign state, but it will
definitely not allow any other country to invade itself.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks at the "Millennium Air Power Conference"
hosted by Singapore and attended by more than 500 air force
delegates from 36 countries and areas.
</P>
<P>
Liu briefed the conference on China's defense policy and
national military strategy and spelt out his view on the new
features of air wars and new trends in air power development in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese PLA Air Force will do as Chairman of the
Central Military Commission Jiang Zemin requires and endeavor to
build the people's air force into a strong and modern one
combining defense with offense.
</P>
<P>
He added that this goal is guided by the state's defense policy
and active defense strategy and the basic principle of
subordinating national defense construction to and serving the
nation's economic construction as well as the government's
decision of building a stronger but leaner military with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese PLA Air Force is shifting from
national air defense toward defense plus offense in order to
better implement the national military strategy of active defense
and has embarked on the road of "streamlining the military the
Chinese Way."
</P>
<P>
Liu also said the Chinese PLA Air Force is resolved to
resolutely defend the country's territorial sovereignty in regard
to land, airspace and sea and its maritime rights and maintain the
country's unity and security. It will also remain committed to
keeping world peace and promoting the progressive cause of mankind,
he declared.
</P>
<P>
He also put forth the idea that with the prerequisite of
enhancing peace and development, air forces of all countries
should strengthen exchanges among themselves, expand areas of
cooperation and increase mutual visits by air force personnel of
all levels so as to promote understanding, trust and friendship.
</P>
<P>
Liu's speech drew warm applause from the participants.
</P>
<P>
Air force chiefs of staff or commanders from Singapore,
Indonesia,France, Australia, Chile and Israel, the commander of
the U.S. Pacific Air Force and four presidents or chief executive
officers of defense industry groups also gave their presentations
at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, LT. Gen. Liu met with U.S. Pacific Air Force
Commander General Patrick Gamble at the latter's request later
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Liu arrived here Saturday to visit Asia's premier aerospace and
defense technology exhibition and air show Asian Aerospace 2000
and to attend the conference. This is the first time that the
Chinese PLA Air Force commander has visited the biennial Asian
aerospace exhibition and delivered a speech at the air power
conference in tandem with the exhibition.

<HEADLINE> PCB Threatens Killer Whales Off Canada, U.S. West Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists believe
that killer whales are being threatened by polychlorinated
biphenyl (PCB)in the waters off the West Coast of Canada and the
northern United States.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was reached in a latest research by scientists
from the Institute of Ocean Sciences, the Pacific Biological
Station and the University of British Columbia, the country's
National Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
After analysing skin and blubber from 47 killer whales in the
area,scientists found the marine mammals to have four times more
PCB than those living in other areas.
</P>
<P>
A consequence is the decline in the number of the animals in
the past four years. In 1995, for example, there were 98 animals
in Puget Sound, Washington. The number has been reduced to the
current 83, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Other animals like seals, sea lions, walruses and even polar
bears are also at risk because they are at the top of the food
chain and absorb concentrated doses of pollutants from the
creatures they eat.
</P>
<P>
The toxic chemicals found in the bodies of the whales are
manufactured for use in generators and insulating fluid and do not
break down easily, scientists were quoted as saying.

<P>
BRUSSELS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday it has decided to open a full investigation into the
proposed merger between telecommunication companies MCI WorldCom
and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
The EU's executive arm will make a specific assessment of the
impact of the transaction in various areas of the
telecommunication industry.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has raised serious doubts over the compatibility
of the proposed merger between MCI WorldCom and Sprint mainly
because of its impact on competition in the market for top-level
Internet connectivity.
</P>
<P>
The investigation will focus on the provisions of top-level
connectivity services in the Internet, global telecommunication
services to multinational companies and termination of
international voice telephony calls in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
MCI WorldCom, a global telecommunication company, provides a
wide range of telecommunication services to businesses and
consumers, including local, long distance and international calls,
freephone calling card and debit card service. It also provides,
mainly through its subsidiary UUnet, Internet services.
</P>
<P>
Sprint provides local, long-distance, wireless communications
and Internet services in the U.S. Sprint's activities in Europe
are largely conducted through its participation in Global One, a
joint venture with Deutsche Telecom and France Telecom.

<TEXT>
<P>
KULAR LUMPUR, February 21 (Xinhua) -- China stands as an
insurmountable summit as its men's team crushed Canada and
Yugoslavia with its women players routing Lithuania and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guozheng, the singles winner at the ITTF Pro Tour Finals
last month, paced China to a 3-0 win over Canada, a replacement
for Romania which withdrew because of financial reason.
</P>
<P>
Liu, ranked 11th in the world, beat world No. 24 Johnny Huang
21-18, 21-10. Kong Linghui and Wang Liqin snatched the following
two games easily.
</P>
<P>
China then recorded its third straight win in two days, beating
Yugoslavia 3-0.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women trio -- world No. 4 Sun Jin, world singles
runner-up Zhang Yining and defensive player Wang Hui, blanked
Lithuania in three to nil.
</P>
<P>
Later, Chinese Wang Nan, Li Ju and Zhang Yining downed Belarus
3-0.
</P>
<P>
"Our rivals fielded bench players," said Chinese head coach Cai
Zhenhua. "We had an easy day today, but we won't tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's squad will take on Belgium and Austria on
Monday. Belgium is led by former world No. 1 Jean-Michael Saive
and Austria has Werner Schlager, a world championships bronze
medalist and World Cup runner-up. The Chinese women face Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Rigging in Parliament Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Iranian
Interior Ministry denied on Monday there has been any rigging in
the country's sensitive parliamentary election, which has shown a
definite victory of reformists.
</P>
<P>
About 83 percent of a total of 38.7 million eligible voters cast
their votes across Iran last Friday to elect the sixth Majlis
(parliament) for a four-year term.
</P>
<P>
"The state election headquarters is fully supervising over the
vote counting and the possibility of any rigging is ruled out,"
said Jahanbakhsh Khanjani, who is in charge of publicity and
information of the election headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is more important for the officials than respecting the
vote of the people," the official Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said it will take "a few days" to announce the final results
of the election because the number of candidates doubled compared
with the fifth Majlis election, and the number of people
participating in the poll also increased considerably.
</P>
<P>
About 5,700 candidates representing more than 100 parties and
political groups competed for 290 seats in the new expanded
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The parties and groups are divided into two major camps, namely
the pro-reform camp which supports President Mohammed Khatami's
policy of social and cultural opening, and the conservative camp
led by clerics who emphasize the values and principles of the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Most Iranians, especially young people, hope reformers can win
the election so that the conservatives who currently control the
parliament will no longer hinder President Khatami's reform
policies.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported Monday more than 170 candidates have
been declared winners in the first round of election for the new
parliament, of which nearly 70 percent are reformists.
</P>
<P>
The battle for parliament has actually ended with a definite
victory of reformers, Tehran Times suggested.
</P>
<P>
Attention is now focused on the capital city of Tehran, the
center of political struggle, which shares 30 seats in the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest results announced by the Interior
Ministry, 472,945 votes have been counted in the capital, where
about 3 million voters cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
The initial results show that 26 out of a total of 866
candidates from the Tehran constituency have won 25 percent of
votes to find their ways to the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Of Tehran's leading candidates, President Khatami's younger
brother Seyed Mohammad Reza Khatami, leader of the major reformist
party Islamic Iran Participation Front, now has won the largest
number of votes.
</P>
<P>
Other front runners include such key reformists as Jamileh
Kadivar and Alireza Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is chasing the
post of parliament speaker, currently only ranks 27th in the Tehran
constituency.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who poses as a centrist but is reportedly close to
the conservatives, might have to end his political career if he
fails in the election, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the senior politician, who currently heads the
powerful State Expediency Council, may also lead to political
turmoil in the country, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
Iran's elections laws stipulate that only those who win at least
25 percent of the votes can become Majlis members in the first
round, while those who cannot will have to compete in a run-off.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects Pak Offer to Resume Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- India Monday turned down the
latest offer by Pakistan to resume the Lahore peace process
between the two countries, claiming that "our position remains
unchanged."
</P>
<P>
"Frequent repetition is not going to change our position," an
Indian Foreign Office spokesman said when asked to comment on
Pakistan Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar's remarks that Islamabad
was prepared to re-launch the derailed peace process.
</P>
<P>
For such a dialogue, he said, Pakistan has to create the right
atmosphere and the right environment, including the cessation of
what he called cross-border terrorism and a stop to hostile
propaganda against India. The spokesman described both as in
violation of the 1972 Simla Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said at a public
rally on Sunday that the only agenda for talks on Kashmir with
Pakistan was vacation of "Pakistan-occupied Kashmir."

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Returns From Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen returned home Monday after a five-day visit to India and
Myanmar from February 17 to 21 at the invitation of leaders from
both countries.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen was accompanied by a 32-member high-level delegation
including Foreign Minister Hor Namhong, Cabinet Minister Sok An,
Commerce Minister Cham Prasidh, Industry Minister Suy Sem, Tourism
Minister Veng Sereyvuth and other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
Upon their arrival at the airport, Sok An briefed reporters on
the results of Hun Sen's two-country tour. "The visit was very
successful as it further strengthened the friendly relations
between us," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in India from Thursday to Saturday, Hun Sen
held wide-ranging talks with President K R Narayanan and Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
India agreed to extend a credit of 10 million U.S. dollars to
Cambodia for agriculture-related projects.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed four agreements, including one on
establishing a joint commission on trade, science and technology
cooperation and another on a cultural exchange program.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they firmed up a memorandum of understanding on
cooperation in agriculture and another one on tourism.
</P>
<P>
While in Myanmar, Prime Minister Hun Sen met his Myanmar
counterpart, Senior-General Than Shwe, and the two discussed their
two countries' relations and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both sides signed an agreement on visa exemption for
holders of diplomatic and service passports.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for Hun Sen to visit the two countries
after he became the prime minister of the coalition government in
November 1998.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Vows to Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada renewed his pledge Monday to reduce the country's poverty
rate from 32 percent to at most 25 percent when his term ends in
2004.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a multi-sectoral assembly in Isabela Province in
the northern Philippines, the president said his administration
aims to save at least 2 million Filipinos from poverty each year
before 2004.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his administration aims not only to provide
the poor with basic services, but opportunities as well to improve
their lives, such as housing, more jobs, more access to credit and
greater access to education and new skills.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing all these because my administration wants to end
poverty in our country. That's why I and my cabinet will not stop
until we have attained economic prosperity and improved the living
conditions of every Filipino family," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he wants the country to attain self-
sufficiency in rice by the year 2002 and regain the Philippines'
status as a chief exporter of the food staple before his term ends.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada stressed anew that the government alone cannot win
the war against poverty since it needs the cooperation of the
entire citizenry to fight this scourge.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot win this war alone. I need the help of the entire
citizenry," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"That's why I am calling on all Filipinos to join us in our
fight against poverty. Let us prove to the whole world that
Filipinos can rise above poverty through self-reliance,
perseverance and cooperation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Phase 2 of Philippine-U.S. War Games Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The armed forces of the
Philippines and the United States began the second phase of their
"Balikatan (shoulder to shoulder) 2000" joint military exercises
on Monday amid protests from some Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
At the Clark Air Base, one of the major sites for Balikatan,
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon said the joint
exercises are aimed at improving the "inter-operability and combat
readiness" of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of Balikatan, opened on January 28, was
seminars and workshops for the participating troops while the
second stage is the exercise proper wherein combat maneuvers will
be conducted across the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,500 American troops and an equal number of their
Filipino counterparts will hold simultaneous air, ground and sea
cross-training exercises.
</P>
<P>
The war games were last held in 1995 and suspended the
following year for the absence of a legal framework for the
visiting troops.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine Senate ratified a Visiting Forces
Agreement which gives the United States jurisdiction over U.S.
soldiers who commit crimes while on official duty.
</P>
<P>
Some Filipinos and the influential Roman Catholic Church are
against the war games, which they said would lead to an increase
in social crimes and destabilize the security situation in Asia.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that the military exercises violate one
of the country's constitutional provisions banning the entry of
nuclear weapons as the United States follows a policy of neither
confirming nor denying the presence of such weapons aboard its
ships.

JOHANNESBURG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) said on Monday that the government
will cut jobless rate by making conditions for expanding
employment.
</P>
<P>
"The state can only create a conducive environment and provide
the necessary tariffs for those in the private sector who can
introduce jobs, but the government itself cannot create jobs," ANC
spokesman Smuts Ngonyama told South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Ngonyama said, however, that the government's role in "creating
an enabling environment for the creation of jobs" can not be
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to the opposition parties criticism that the
 government lacks method to tackle the high unemployment rate in

<HEADLINE> Crisis Management Exercise Useful: NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO General Secretary George
Robertson said Monday the current exercise on crisis management
led by the Western European Union (WEU) was very important and
useful.
</P>
<P>
Robertson told a joint press conference with the WEU that the
exercise was very important and useful for it was the first test
of the crisis management capability of the Europeans with the use
of NATO assets and capabilities.
</P>
<P>
He said the exercise was going on smoothly and demonstrated
NATO's long-standing support for the WEU and dovetailed the
alliance's concept of assisting WEU to foster a capability of
dealing future crises.
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, former NATO chief and now secretary general of
the Western European Union, said that the current exercise,
codenamed CMX/CRISEX 2000, was the first ever opportunity to test
the mutually reinforcing arrangements between the WEU and NATO and
that the exercise tested the concept of using NATO assets and
capabilities for WEU-led operations, which, he added, was
essential in future for the effectiveness of the EU's Common
European Security and Defense Policy.
</P>
<P>
The European Union was observing the exercise and would draw
relevant lessons from the exercise so as to better prepare itself
for exercising its future responsibility as projected in the
concept of the European Security and Defense Identity, Solana said.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans have long aspired to coping with crises without
the necessary participation of their north American allies. The
establishment of the concept of a rapid reaction force by the
Europeans was the first step toward the building of the European
Security and Defense Identity.
</P>
<P>
The WEU-led exercise was being conducted in the WEU and NATO
headquarters with the participation of the member states of both
organizations. It was also held in the NATO strategic commands and
in the capitals of the 30 WEU and NATO nations.
</P>
<P>
The exercise would cover a stage of decision-making after the
NATO had agreed in principle to provide assets and capabilities
for a WEU-led peacekeeping operation on an imaginary island of
Kiloland in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The island state was suffering from internal disorder and
humanitarian problems and a political settlement had been reached
between the parties but an international force was needed to
stabilize the situation and allow delivery of humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
The island state had addressed a request to the United Nations
for an international peacekeeping force and the WEU operation was
based on a U.N. resolution mandate.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Truckers Block Traffic Against Price Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- About 500 Canadian truckers
staged blockades early Monday at the bordering area of the eastern
provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to protest rising fuel
prices.
</P>
<P>
Commercial traffic has been blocked with mail, food and other
goods being held up. But the truckers allowed cars and pickup
trucks to pass through, said local media.
</P>
<P>
The blockades were set up hours after hundreds of other
truckers in the province of Ontario launched a protest for the
same reason. They decided to park their rigs away from the highway
in what they promised to be a peaceful and legal way.
</P>
<P>
The truckers are complaining about a steep rise in the price of
diesel fuel, which was raised to 70 cents (about 0.48 U.S. dollars)
a liter last week from 35 cents (0.24 U.S. dollars) recorded in
January 1999, local reports said.

the number of people employed in privately owned enterprises
increasing by 590,000 last year and the registered capital of
individual enterprises totalling 66.3 billion yuan, the governor
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Market Arrow 2 Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel Aircraft Industries
(IAI) has been allowed to engage in marketing its advanced Arrow 2
anti-ballistic missile system.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post daily Monday quoted IAI officials as saying
that the Israeli Defense Ministry approved in principle in the past
few weeks the marketig of the defense shield missile by IAI, the
major contractor of the system.
</P>
<P>
The company's current task, said the officials, is to seek sale
permission from the U.S. government which covered about 55 percent
of the program's total costs and therefore had the final say on any
sale of the system.
</P>
<P>
Once all restrictions lifted, IAI will try to find a serious
partner to market and sell the Arrow missile to the U.S. military
and other countries. At least IAI will cooperate with an aviation
giant in the U.S., said an IAI official.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Britain, Turkey, Japan, South Korea had all
expressed interest in the missile defense system and some even sent
delegations to Israel to listen to briefs on the project.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow 2 rocket is currently on display in the Asian
Aerospace Exhibition, which opened in Singapore on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The "sophisticated and accurate" missile defense system consists
of radar, fire control and early warning components. It was jointly
manufactured by Israel and the United States, with a total

<HEADLINE> Ankara Fears HADEP to Become Political Wing of PKK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The detentions of three pro-
Kurdish mayors highlighted the growing concern of Ankara that the
People's Democracy Party (HADEP) is becoming a "legal political
wing" of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), local press
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Three mayors from the HADEP, a legitimate party in Turkey which
groups some Kurdish intellectuals, were taken into custody on
Saturday in southeastern provinces on charge of colluding with the
PKK.
</P>
<P>
They are Feridun Celik, mayor of Turkey's biggest Kurdish city
Diyarbakir, Bingol Mayor Feyzullah Karaaslan and Selim Ozalp, mayor
of Siirt.
</P>
<P>
Intensive contacts between HADEP mayors and foreign officials
have for some time fueled concerns that HADEP is intended to
replace the PKK as the leading "separatist force" under a
legitimate cover, Turkish Daily News quoted an observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Feridun Celik, mayor of Turkey's biggest
Kurdish city Diyarbakir, had met a delegation at the Canadian
Embassy on Saturday just prior to his detention. There were claims
that Celik had met with PKK sympathizers and PKK officials during
his trips abroad.
</P>
<P>
The flux of foreign visitors to the detained mayors has
reportedly irked the Turkish authorities, which allegedly believed
that HADEP was targeting at replacing the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Ankara's concerns about HADEP surfaced earlier in the week when
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit criticized the party's mayors for
prompting separatism in their municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Kurdish HADEP was swept into power in last April's
national elections in more than 35 cities and towns in the
southeast.
</P>
<P>
Turkey worries that as militants of the imprisoned Abdullah
Ocalan, the chieftain of the PKK, have renounced their armed
struggle, HADEP may ask European nations to pressure Ankara into
granting more rights to its citizens of Kurdish origin.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, which has been fighting since 1984 for an independent
Kurdish state in the southeast, has soften its stance by saying
that it is now only struggling for cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, who visited Turkey
recently, said that Kurds should have the rights to speak,
broadcast and be educated in Kurdish.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want the issue to be used politically by foreigners,"
Turkish Justice Minister Hikmet Turk said.

<HEADLINE> India Calls Pak Expulsion of Diplomats "Unjustified" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- India reacted sharply on
Monday to Pakistan's expulsion of three officials of the Indian
High Commission in Islamabad, calling this move "retaliatory and
entirely unjustified."
</P>
<P>
"It is clearly a reflexive action in retaliation and entirely
unjustified," an Indian Foreign Office spokesman commented.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan declared on Sunday the Indian High Commission
officials -- Gopal Chandra Roy, Asit Baran Das and R
Sankaranayanan -- as persona non grata and asked the three to
leave Pakistan before February 27.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad's action came two days after India asked three staff
members of the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi to be withdrawn
for "indulging in activities incompatible with their official
status."
</P>
<P>
The Indian side noted that no specific charges were brought
against the three expelled Indian diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Russia Registers Sharpest Population Drop in Eight Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia's population dropped 0.5
percent, or 784,500 people, last year, the sharpest decline since
1992, the State Statistics Committee said Monday.
</P>
<P>
As a whole, the country's population has decreased by 2.8
million people, or nearly 2 percent, over the past eight years,
the Interfax news agency quoted the committee as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary estimates, there are 145.5 million
people living in Russia as of January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists attributed the population drop to economic
decline, lower standard of living and the absence of sense of
security, which deterred many couples from having babies. A high
divorce rate of 50 percent was also seen as one factor.
</P>
<P>
The number of people immigrated to Russia also went down last
year to 379,700 from the previous year's 513,500. Meanwhile, 214,
900 Russians emigrated from the country during the period, 28,600
more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the end of January, 9.12 million Russians were listed as
unemployed, 9.7 percent less than a year ago, although the figure
still accounted for 12.3 percent of the country's population at
employment age.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday it has known from media a new outbreak of listeriosis in
France and urged the French government to take necessary steps to
avoid any new outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, at least seven people have
died from the outbreak of Listeriosis and 20 people have been ill
so far.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said the
French authorities are investigating the scourge of the outbreak
and have warned consumers, especially those belonging to so-called
vulnerable groups, including elderly, pregnant, immuno-
compromised, to avoid products like cheeses made from raw milk,
meat products and smoked fish.
</P>
<P>
France has detected two outbreaks of listeriosis this year.
Regarding the outbreak as very serious, the European Commission
called on the French authorities to do their utmost to detect the
source of the outbreak in prevention of further spread.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer
Protection David Byrne said the organization has already requested
scientific advice on the source of listeria, which has caused
general concerns.
</P>
<P>
"Pursuing the scientific opinion last year, the Commission will
shortly propose enhanced controls to prevent Listeria in food," he
said.

<HEADLINE> HK's Unemployment Rate Posts Notable Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong posted a 5.7-
percent provisional seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate and a 2.
7-percent underemployment rate for November 1999-January 2000,
according to the statistics released Monday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in a year that the unemployment rate
dropped below 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
For October-December 1999, the seasonally-adjusted unemployment
rate and the underemployment rate were confirmed to be the same as
the previously released provisional figures of 6 percent and 2.8
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Government Economist K.Y.Tang attributed the drop in the
unemployment rate to the continued pick-up in overall economic
activity as well as an usual surge in demand for labor closer to
the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Deputy Secretary for Education and Manpower Philip
Chok said statistics from the Local Employment Services of the
Labor Department indicated that labor market conditions had
continued to improve.
</P>
<P>
"In January, the Labor Department successfully found jobs for
some 4,800 job seekers. This figure represents the highest number
of successful placements for the month of January since the
service was launched in 1967 and a 59-percent increase over
January 1999," Chok said.
</P>
<P>
The department also secured some 12,000 vacancies during the
month, representing a 50-percent increase over January last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tourism sector has continued to rebound with the
total visitor arrivals for 1999 growing 11.5 percent over 1998 to
10.6 million and the average hotel occupancy for 1999 rising three
percentage points over 1998 to 79 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Looking into the coming months, we expect the improvement to
continue in the labor market. That is in line with the continuing
improvement in overall economic conditions," Tang said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Turkish Parliament Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met here
today with a delegation from the Grand National Assembly (GNA) of
Turkey led by Speaker Yildirim Akbulut.
</P>
<P>
Li recalled his visit to Turkey last April and expressed
gratitude for the warm hospitality he received there.
</P>
<P>
He noted the traditional friendship between China and Turkey,
and said bilateral ties have progressed smoothly since diplomatic
ties were forged nearly 30 years ago, citing the frequent exchange
of high-level visits, development of trade and economic relations,
and the expansion of contacts between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed sympathy to Turkey for the deaths and injuries and
the economic losses it suffered in the devastating earthquake
which struck the country last year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the NPC's willingness to further increase
communication and cooperation with the GNA, noting that increased
contacts are in the fundamental interest of both parliaments and
peoples. Parliamentary leaders and special committees should
expand their contacts to promote the overall progress of bilateral
ties, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also elaborated on China's view of world multi-
polarization and economic globalization, noting that Turkey,
spanning across two continents, enjoys a special geographic
advantage, and will play a more active role in both regional and
world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed the guests on China's reform and opening up, and the
socialist modernization drive, as well as the NPC system and the
building of democracy and the legal system.
</P>
<P>
Akbulut said the GNA and Turkish government attach great
importance to relations with China. Turkey sets great store by
China's role in the international and regional affairs as is
demonstrated by the current visit of the delegation which
comprises representatives from five parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Akbulut expressed the hope that bilateral ties will advance in
the new century to benefit the people of both countries and help
safeguard regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced admiration for China's achievements in economic
construction, and spoke highly of the resumption of the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao under the "one country,
two systems" policy. He also expressed the wish that China will
achieve its complete reunification at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Akbulut said that the GNA puts great emphasis on its contacts
with the NPC, and invited the Sino-Turkish Friendship Committee of
the NPC to visit Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Akbulut is here as guest of Li for an official goodwill visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, tomorrow will publish an editorial hailing
today's issuance of a white paper on the Taiwan issue by the
Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Adhering to the One-China Principle to
Achieve Early Peaceful Reunification," calls the white paper a
declaration by the Chinese government explaining its position and
policy on the One-China principle, as well as a demonstration of
the Chinese people's determination to resolve the Taiwan issue and
realize the complete reunification of the motherland as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong and Macao returned to the motherland, the cause
of resolving the Taiwan issue and achieving complete reunification
has entered into a new stage, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the development of cross-Straits relations faces new
opportunities and challenges as the Chinese people deepen the
ongoing struggle against Lee Teng-hui's "two states" statement,
and as the international community adopts a common stance adhering
to the One China policy, it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that the white paper is of great
importance for further implementing the principle of "peaceful
reunification, and one country, two systems" and President Jiang
Zemin's well-known eight proposals on reunification, opposing the
secessionist activities in Taiwan with Lee Teng-hui as the
representative, and helping the international community further
recognize the falsehood and danger of Lee Teng-hui's "two states"
statement.

China, and explains how the One China principle originated and its
fundamental meaning, the People's Daily says.
</P>
<P>
The white paper reiterates the One China principle as the basis
for peaceful reunification, highlighting the Chinese government's
firm attitude in safeguarding this principle.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also notes that the Chinese government, since
publishing its Taiwan policy of "peaceful reunification, and one
country, two systems" in 1979, has exercised utmost sincerity and
tried by every means to secure peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Before reunification, the One China principle must be adhered
to in cross-Straits affairs, especially in cross-Straits talks,
which means adhering to the position that there is only one China
and Taiwan is part of China, and that the sovereignty and
territory of China is inalienable, the People's Daily says.
</P>
<P>
"We advocate that cross-Straits talks be held on the basis of
the One China principle, without mentioning 'talks between central
and local governments,' in order to allow the two sides to
negotiate reunification on an equal footing," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
With this principle as the premise, any issues, including those
of concern to the Taiwan side, are negotiable; but if the One
China principle is damaged, the prospects for peaceful
reunification would be threatened, according to the People's Daily.

At present, cross-Straits relations are at a crucial stage, it
says, adding that Lee Teng-hui's "two states" statement has been
condemned by the Chinese people at home and abroad and has failed
to win the approval or support of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also accuses some separatists in Taiwan who, on
the one hand, are shouting "Long Live Taiwan Independence," and on
the other claim they want "friendly reconciliation, active
cooperation, and permanent peace" with the mainland, in an attempt
to deceive Taiwan people with beautiful words.
</P>

means going to a war. "We believe the Taiwan compatriots who
prefer a peaceful reunification are able to recognize the lies and

The People's Daily condemns some foreign forces who do not want
to see China's reunification and are trying to sell advanced
weapons and sell or transfer relevant technologies for the so-
called TMDS under various premises, while some forces are
attempting to turn the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act into law.
</P>
<P>
These things once again remind people to be on high alert by
adhering to the One China principle, firmly opposing "Taiwan
independence" and the plots of secessionist forces in Taiwan, and
opposing interference in the Taiwan issue and China's internal
affairs by foreign forces, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that in order to complete the great cause of
the reunification of the motherland at the earliest possible date,
the mainland "will continue implementing the principle of '
peaceful reunification and one country, two systems' and the eight
proposals raised by President Jiang Zemin, further develop cross-
Straits relations in a comprehensive manner, be more active in
pushing forward cross-straits personnel exchanges in the economic
and cultural fields, and establish direct links in trade,
transport, and postal services as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The paper calls for an exchange of views with all Taiwan-based
parties, groups, and individuals who advocate developing cross-
Straits relations in order to create conditions for cross-Straits
talks and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The editorial asks Taiwan compatriots to join hands with
compatriots on the mainland to prevent the splitting of the
motherland and the plotting for "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
The editorial concludes with the hope that the U.S. government
will abide by the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and keep its
promises on the Taiwan issue.

<HEADLINE> Barak Expects New Package to Break Deadlock in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak on Monday expressed hope that Israel and the Palestinians
would work out new proposals in the next few days to break an
impasse in the peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before meeting a group of U.S. Jewish leaders, Barak
said he hoped Israel and the Palestinians would "shape some kinds
of package" that will help revive the peace talks on a permanent
peace which broke off early this month.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this is in the interests of both sides, so I
believe that it will somehow happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks ground to a halt on February
3 after a summit meeting between Barak and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat failed to resolve disputes
over an overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was angered by the Israeli refusal to include Arab
villages close to Jerusalem in the scheduled withdrawal from 6.1
percent of the West Bank, which should have been carried out on
January 20 under the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed last
September.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the stalemate, the two sides missed the self-
imposed February 13 deadline for reaching a framework agreement on
final status issues such as the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly cabinet meeting Sunday, Barak came up with a new
timetable for the framework deal, saying he intends to reach such a
deal by May.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Palestinians for the impasse, saying they had
turned down an Israeli offer to hold two series of 10-day intensive
talks in January.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat dismissed Barak's
criticism, saying the Palestinian side had laid out questions over
the Israeli troop withdrawal and presented a suggestion regarding
the need for the framework agreement in early February, but Israel
did not respond.
</P>
<P>
He said the main reason for the stalemate was that Barak did not
focus his efforts on the Palestinian track of peace making.
</P>
<P>
Barak is reportedly devoting much of his effort to revive the
peace talks with Syria, which broke off last month, with an aim of
reaching an agreement which would help him fulfil a key promise to
pull Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon by July. Syria is the
main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross is due to arrive in the
region later Monday in an effort to narrow the gaps between Israel
and the Palestinians and revive the troubled talks.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Maariv reported Monday that Barak would offer a "
package of gestures" to revive the negotiations. As part of the
package, the paper said, Israel would include better land in the 6.
1 percent transfer.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the Sunday cabinet meeting that he would reconsider
the maps for the withdrawal, but ruled out the possibility of
including areas adjacent to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a sign seemly signaling a change of attitude, Palestinian
Minister of Planning Nabil Sha'ath reportedly said Sunday that if
Israel commits itself to implementing the third and final interim
withdrawal, the Palestinians may show flexibility on the maps for
the 6.1 percent pullback.
</P>
<P>
According to the interim agreement signed in 1995, Israel should
carry out the third stage of redeployment before the final status
talks. But the two sides have yet to agree upon the time and range
of the withdrawal.

</P>
<P>
Officials from Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain opened a two-day
seminar on Saturday at the Kuwaiti stock market headquarters within
an ambitious plan to boost full-fledged cooperation and
coordination among them.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic-language Al-Haiyat daily said experts are currently
working on getting Gulf markets closer in preparation for a future

</P>
<P>
JIDDAH -- The Jiddah International Food and Beverages Fair
opened here with the participation of over 200 domestic and foreign
firms from many countries around the world, the Arabic-language
daily Al-Haiyat reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and the European Union (EU)will soon sign a
partnership agreement which will help boost bilateral cooperation
in all domains, The Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between Egypt and the EU member states
accounted for 46 percent of the union's total trade with the rest
of the world, said the report.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The National Bank of Egypt maintained its leading

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Rejects Palestinian Proposal to Bypass Framework Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy on Monday rejected the Palestinian suggestion that the
two sides skip over a framework agreement on a permanent peace and
instead focus on reaching a final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
It is essential for Israel and the Palestinians to set an agenda
for the peace talks by reaching a framework agreement before
clinching a detailed final treaty, Levy said during a meeting with
visiting European Parliament President Nicole Fontaine.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to remarks made by Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and other senior officials in the
last few days doubting about the need for reaching a framework
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said that since the two sides had missed the
February 13 deadline for reaching a framework deal, they should
concentrate their efforts on the final peace treaty to be sealed by
September according to the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed last
September.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have never favored the idea of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak that the two sides reach a framework agreement
first in the negotiations over final status issues such as the fate
of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks over these issues ground to a halt on February 3
after a summit meeting between Barak and Arafat failed to resolve
disputes on an overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was angered by Barak's refusal to include Arab villages
close to Jerusalem in the scheduled withdrawal from 6.1 percent of
the West Bank, which should have taken place on January 20 under
the Sharm el Sheikh agreement.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the stalemate, the February 13 deadline passed
without anything agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly cabinet meeting Sunday, Barak came up with a new
timetable for the framework deal, saying he intends to reach such a
deal by May.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Monday that he hoped Israel and the
Palestinians would work out new proposals in the next few days to
break the current deadlock. He did not elaborate.

region later Monday in an effort to narrow the gaps between the two
sides and revive the troubled talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the first leg of Fontaine's five-day visit starting
Sunday to the region, which will also take her to the Palestinian
self-ruled areas, Jordan and Lebanon. She is accompanied by
European Union peace envoy Miguel Moratinos.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Vows to Win Parliamentary Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has ruled out that the victory for the opposition in the
referendum would be repeated in the parliamentary elections, which
are due in the second week of April.
</P>
<P>
He also warned on Sunday that the government would not
backtrack on the land reform, even though the draft constitution
was rejected in last weekend's referendum.
</P>
<P>
About 54 percent of the 1.3 million people who voted in the
referendum rejected the draft constitution while 46 percent
approved it.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe admitted in an interview with the Zimbabwe Broadcasting
Corporation on the eve of his 76th birthday that the result was a
reflection of the hardships inflicting the people.
</P>
<P>
"The people wanted to express their own dissatisfaction over
the current economic problems. That rejection was not based on
the analysis of the draft constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the opposition would, of course, try to continue to
use the economic situation and hammer the issue of corruption in
the government.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe ruled out any plans to retire soon as had been
speculated in both the party and social circles following the
example of former South African President Nelson Mandela's
departure from office.
</P>
<P>
"I did not provide any opportunity for that retirement and it
became clear that I was not retiring," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had no plans to handpick a successor as he felt the
people should choose their own leader.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Fails to Reach Revenue Collection Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is facing
difficulties to realize the targeted revenue collection in the
current financial year, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Only 777.2 billion Tanzanian shillings (971.5 million U.S.
dollars) will be collected against the estimated 810.298 billion
shillings (1.013 billion dollars), the Minister for Finance Daniel
Yona was quoted as saying at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Parliamentary Economic and Financial Affairs
Committee on the country's financial situation, the minister said
although revenue collection in the first half of this financial
year reached the target, external aid, particularly from balance
and payment support, was below target.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister disclosed that the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) initiative to be endorsed by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank next month is set to
attract a debt relief of about 40 million dollars for Tanzania
each year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show Tanzania's debt burden increased from
five billion dollars in 1988 to eight billion dollars in 1998, or
about 266 dollars per capita.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Seeks Funds to Fight Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has sent out an
international appeal for 5.56 billion shillings (about 76 million
U.S. dollars) to combat famine, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The request by the Head of Kenya's Public Service Richard
Leakey is contained in a report to donor organizations and
foreign governments outlining the emergency facing most parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled Kenyan Government Appeal for Local and
International Assistance to Combat the Current Drought Stress,
says virtually the entire country is gripped by famine. The
hardest hit provinces including Eastern, North Eastern, Coast,
Rift Valley and parts of Central.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the funds the country needed include
some 50 million dollars for food items, 17 million dollars for
"immediate mitigation" and 5.7 million dollars for logistics and
supervision.

<P>
The report estimates that from February onward, an average of
220,000 90-kg bags of cereals will be required monthly to May or
June.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has spent on average two billion
shillings over the past four years fighting hunger and some
310,950 bags of cereals have been distributed to the affected
districts between July and October of 1999 alone.
</P>
<P>
The funds sought will also be used to move food from harvest
areas to those in distress, the report says.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Sugar Production to Be Rehabilitated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Angola's annual sugar output is
expected to reach some 215,000 tons in ten years as the government
has decided to start a program on the rehabilitation and
amplification of its sole sugarhouse, official source said here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to an official document, the Angolan government had
just approved the program on the rehabilitation of the Sugarhouse
Dombe Grande, located in the central-coast province of Benguela.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the program, the annual sugar output of
Dombe Grande is estimated at some 83,000 tons, which will increase
in the following years to 132,000 tons as the sugarhouse is fully
rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, the sugarhouse will be amplified and the annual
output will hit 215,000 tons, said the document.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of sugar production is estimated to cost
some 66.8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the program indicates that the government is
convinced that the war is close to end and the economic
rehabilitation is imminent, said local analysts.
</P>
<P>
Since the Dombe Grande Sugarhouse was shut down in 1990, Angola
had to spend annually some 45 million U.S. dollars on the export
of some 100,000 tons of sugar for serving the population's need of
225,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Niger State to Apply Sharia Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Niger State will start
 implementing the Islamic Sharia legal system on May 4, Nigerian
News Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The state governor Abdulkadir Kure made the announcement on
Sunday at a large gathering in the mid-west state's capital Minna.
</P>
<P>
Niger State will be the second state after Zamfara to introduce
the controversial Sharia law in the Africa's most populous
country divided almost evenly between Moslems and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Under Sharia, men and women will be segregated in public places
like buses and schools. Prostitution, which is wide-spread in
Nigeria, will also be banned.
</P>
<P>
Some states in the south of the country, where Christian
population dominates, had protested in the past months at the
adoption of Sharia, which they charged with violating the
country's constitution by imposing religious rules as state laws.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Putin Vows to Pursue Chechen Operation to Completion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President
Vladimir Putin said Monday that the operation against Chechen
rebels in the North Caucasus would be brought to its logical
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"Recent months have been decisive for the country's defense
and its authorities," Putin told a meeting of senior defense and
security officials in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The choice was between defending the country or succumbing to
terrorists, the Interfax news agency quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya would
continue until the republic has been liberated from terrorists and
Russia's territorial integrity and federal control are restored
there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security has been heightened around the country
amid Chechen threats of terrorist acts to mark the anniversary on
Wednesday of the mass deportation of ethnic Chechens to Central
Asia during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Fighting continues in the southern mountainous areas of the
breakaway republic, but the federal forces are tightening their
grip on the rebels, seizing dominant heights and blocking possible
maneuver routes, Interfax said, citing Russian military sources.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, acting in small groups and resisting the advance
of federal units, are preparing for an all-round defense of Shatoi,
the last heavily populated locality under their control, the
sources said. Some 3,000-5,000 rebels are gathered in the Shatoi
area.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, the Chechen capital, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
commended federal servicemen for their valor in the Chechen
campaign and read out a presidential decree promoting several
commanders.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops have seized much of Chechnya and driven
out the rebels into the southern mountains, but there were still
sporadic rebel guerrilla attacks in the areas under federal
control.
</P>
<P>
The federal command estimates that there are about 5,000
rebels continuing resistance in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the rebels are hiding in the mountains while one-
third remain in populated areas, Interfax reported, quoting
Interior Troop Commander Vyacheslav Tikhomirov.
</P>
<P>
Moscow launched the military campaign last September following
two waves of armed Chechen incursions into the Daghestan republic
and a series of apartment blasts, also blamed on Chechen militants,
that left over 300 people dead in Moscow and two other Russian
cities.

<HEADLINE> No.2 Subway Line Under Construction in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Construction started today
on the second subway line in downtown Guangzhou, the capital of
south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Workers from the Shanghai Tunnel Shareholding Co., which is in
charge of the project, operated digging equipment in the drizzling
rain today at Haizhu Square station, in the first phase of
building a subway tunnel through the Pearl River, which runs
through the city.
</P>
<P>
The 22-stop subway line will cost 11.3 billion yuan, said Lu
Guanglin, manager of Guangzhou Metro Co.
</P>
<P>
The line will be 23.27 km long, with the first phase project to
be finished by 2002, and completion slated for 2004, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the design plans, buildings on a 51,800 sq.m. area
will be bulldozed to make way for the project.
</P>
<P>
The project will use more than 1.14 million cu.m. of concrete
and 180,000 tons of steel.
</P>
<P>
The subway's tunnel construction under the 190-meter-wide river
bed demands high technology and advanced construction techniques,
according the construction team. The complicated network of
underground pipes and high-rise groundwork in the bustling
downtown have also created difficulties for the workers.
</P>
<P>
The city opened the No. 1 subway line on February 16 last year,
just in time for the annual Chinese Spring Festival. That line is
18.48-kilometer long, has 16 stations and can haul up to 1.13
million passengers daily.

LHASA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Monasteries and temples in the
capital city of the Tibet Autonomous Region are overflowing with
people celebrating the annual lamp festival today, the last day of
the Tibetan New Year.
</P>
<P>
Since early this morning, local Buddhists went to holy places

</P>
<P>
More than 800 lamas gathered at the Zhebung Monastery today and

</P>
<P>
A worker at the monastery, named Dazhen, gave a gift of one
yuan to each lama, telling each, "We pray for social stability and
prosperity in Tibet and happiness for all families."
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the final day of the new year holiday, many
parents in Lhasa took their children to Longwangtan Park where
they rowed boats on a pond and played Tibetan games.

<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-based Tricon Global
Restaurants Inc., one of the largest international food chain
companies, has announced it will open more Kentucky Fried Chicken
and Pizza Hut restaurants in China.
</P>
<P>
The plan was revealed today by Andrall Pearson, chairman of the
Tricon Co., David Novak, the company's president and Pete Bassi,
president of the Tricon Restaurants International Inc., who
arrived in China today.
</P>
<P>
Novak said the purpose of their visit is "to see the
outstanding progress achieved by the company in China and to
explore new investment prospects."
</P>
<P>
The company will open more Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut
restaurants in major Chinese cities, as well as in Hainan, Henan,
Shanxi and other provinces to meet the demand of Chinese consumers,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky-based fast food giant now has 30,000 chain

<HEADLINE> Boeing Runs Demo Flights in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 757-300, the world's
latest model of single aisle jetliner, made two demonstration
flights in Beijing today, as part of the company's move to explore
the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The 54.4-meter-long plane took off from Beijing's Capital
International Airport and flew around the city in the slightly
foggy sky.
</P>
<P>
"It's comfortable," said Fu Baoxin, vice-president of Air China,
who took a 50-minute spin in the plane.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have more than 40 Boeing airplanes, we do not have
any Boeing 757s or Boeing 717s," Fu told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the Boeing 757-200, the Boeing 757-300 is 7.1
meters longer and has 40 more seats, but its flight range is 900
kilometers less.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 757 family has exceptionally low cost-per-seat
mileage, especially the Boeing 757-300, which has the lowest seat-
mile cost of any single-aisle plane, said Jack Gucker, Vice
President of Boeing Commercial Airlines Group.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, the Civil
Aviation Administration of China, and journalists were invited to
board the plane for an air tour.
</P>
<P>
Fu said Air China is reviewing its fleet to make sure that the
company will have planes covering all segments of the market, from
130 to 400 seats.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Air China may sublease or sell several of its
planes to other airlines so that it can get more new planes.
</P>
<P>
Air China has not decided if it will buy Boeing 757-300s, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 757-300 has a maximum travel capability of 6,420
kilometers, or from Beijing to Colombo in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
It is also spacious and comfortable, saves fuel and is noise-
restricted, Gucker told reporters while showing them around in the
cabin.
</P>
<P>
China's airlines currently have 49 Boeing 757-200s.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration flight is part of a Boeing 757-300 world tour
that started from the United States on February 3. Earlier, the
plane visited Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and other
places.
</P>
<P>
In China, the plane chose Urumqi, Chengdu, Beijing and
Guangzhou as sites for demo flights. Last week, when it toured
Urumqi in northwest China and Chengdu in the southwest, officials
with Xinjiang Airlines and China Southwest Airlines said they were
impressed with the Boeing 757-300.
</P>
<P>
The event is believed to be one of the strategies for Boeing, a
leading aircraft manufacturer based in Seattle of the United
States, to explore the market, especially at a time when its
European rival, a four-nation Airbus consortium, tries to expand
its influence worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Boeing's strategy is to continuously introduce new-model
airplanes to its customers," said Tom Mclean, public relations
director of Boeing China Inc.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has purchased 503 jetliners, 67 percent of which
came from the Boeing family.
</P>
<P>
The last Boeing demonstration flight in China was last October,
when the company showcased its Boeing 717, targeting the branch-
line market in the cities of Beijing, Kunming, Wuhan and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Condor airlines of Germany, the launch customer of Boeing 757-
300s, said it has become more competitive since it bought
airplanes of this model in March of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Boeing started co-operation with China in 1972 when China
purchased 10 Boeing 707s.

<HEADLINE> Chief Executive Outlines Long-term Goals for HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong must meet a number
of long-term economic and social goals if it aspires to become
Asia's World City, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Forum on Hong Kong's Long-Term Development Needs
and Goals, Tung believed that to become Asia's World City, as New
York is for America and London for Europe, Hong Kong must, first
of all, continue to be outstandingly successful in economic terms,
ranking as one of the most prosperous cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
"To do this, we must continue to increase our per capita income
while ensuring that all members of our society have the
opportunity to benefit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The second goal is to make Hong Kong widely recognized as the
most attractive city in Asia in which to live and work,
particularly judged in terms of overall quality of life, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung stressed the necessity to maintain a socially cohesive and
stable society, increasingly affluent and well educated, proud of
the Chinese heritage, and at the same time assimilate the best
cultures and values of the East and West.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, China's effort in reform has brought
about unprecedented prosperity to the nation, Tung said, noting
that Hong Kong must aim to continue to contribute to this effort,
recognizing fully well the benefit to its own long-term
development in China's modernization.
</P>
<P>
Tung believed that the process of political development must
meet the needs and aspirations of the Hong Kong community and is
in line with the pace and provisions outlined in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He promised to retain and further enhance those distinctive
features which have been critical to Hong Kong's vitality and
success, including a society underpinned by the rule of law, the
independence of the judiciary, protection of freedom of the press
and rights of individuals, all of which, is institutionalized in
the basic law.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong must continue to move forward with free market
economy with level playing field, clear, unobstructed and
transparent business regulation, a clean and effective civil
service and an outward looking society, Tung added.

<HEADLINE> HK Aims to Become World City in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Strategic Development
Commission of Hong Kong, a high-level advisory group comprising
leaders from the SAR government, the business sector, the academia
and others, outlined on Monday a strategic framework to make Hong
Kong Asia's World City as well as a major city in China.
</P>
<P>
The framework is included in a document called "Bringing the
Vision to Life, Hong Kong's long-term Development Needs and Goals",
which was released Monday by the Commission at a seminar that
brought together hundreds of public and private-sector
representatives to discuss the long-term goals for Hong Kong's
strategic development.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, chaired by SAR Chief Executive Tung, believes
that Hong Kong must strengthen its links with the mainland,
enhance its competitiveness, improve its quality life and
reinforce its identity and image if it is to realize its long-term
vision.
</P>
<P>
In strengthening Hong Kong's links with the mainland, the
Commission believes that Hong Kong should build on its strong role
as a service provider, trader and major investor in the mainland's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Commission believes Hong Kong should strengthen its long-
term links with other cities in the Pearl River Delta Region while
expanding its links with other regions in the mainland such as the
Yangtze Delta and Basin Region and the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
The Commission believes Hong Kong's long-term competitiveness
rests on its ability to maintain the highest quality human
resources, a supportive environment for innovation and technology,
excellent physical infrastructure, the freest and most open
economy, a favorable business environment and respected and
effective public institutions, the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The Commission proposed a range of measures to improve Hong
Kong's quality of life, including areas as housing, the
environment, health and welfare, as well as arts and culture, as a
way to stimulate Hong Kong's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Commission also defines seven key industrial sectors and
focus areas that will support Hong Kong's positioning as Asia's
World City. They include financial and business services,
attracting and retaining the regional headquarters of
multinational corporations, tourism, information services and
telecommunications, innovation and technology, trade,
transportation and logistics, as well as creative and cultural
activities.
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Strategic Development was established two
years ago by the SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa to advise him
on Hong Kong's long-term development needs and goals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- China will announce a special
phone number for maritime emergencies and will conduct rescue
drills this year, according to a working conference on maritime
navigation which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Gongchen, vice-director of the Maritime Safety
Administration, told the meeting that the country has designated
this year as the "year for management on marine transport safety."
</P>
<P>
To minimize the possibility of maritime accidents, the country
will try to improve the quality of the personnel in charge of boat-
checking and tighten supervision on boat registration, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, the country will train all
crew members for passenger ships, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country also plans to improve its maritime patrol system,
to ensure that vessels will always be prepared for emergency
situations.
</P>
<P>
Liu also noted that the administration will strengthen the
management of navigation and will use new technology for better
communication.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in 1999, the administration dealt with some 1,800
maritime safety violations and more than 94 percent have been
resolved. In emergency rescues, the administration saved the
lives of nearly 2,500 people in marine waters and the Yangtze
River last year.

<HEADLINE> China Prohibits Building Memorials for Late Leaders (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (
CPC) Central Committee and the State Council issued a circular
today reiterating the ban on building memorials for late leaders.
</P>
<P>
Since last May, when the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council initiated the ban, many localities have grown lax in the
implementation of the ban, and in some places the rule has been
completely ignored, the circular says.
</P>
<P>
The Party and governments at all levels should understand the
importance of the ban, the circular notes.
</P>
<P>
Building a memorial for a late leader is unnecessary, as
leaders at or above the provincial and ministerial levels joined
the revolutionary ranks only to serve the public -- not for public
recognition, it says.
</P>
<P>
Building memorials for them without authorization from the CPC
Central Committee and the central government runs counter to their
intentions and is disrespectful to the thousands upon thousands of
revolutionary martyrs, the circular says.
</P>
<P>
Since the country has limited land resources, memorial building
on farmland, in forested areas and even in scenic spots is a huge
waste and sets a bad precedent for future generations, it points
out.
</P>
<P>
The circular notes that despite the calls from some localities
to build memorials for late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who
passed away in 1997, his family has repeatedly asked the CPC
Central Committee not to okay the requests.

management system for cultural programs which is compatible with
the market economy.
</P>
<P>
In its five-year (2001-2005) plan on culture work, the Ministry
of Culture explains how the country will establish a vibrant,
unique cultural sector embodying ethnic traditions and scientific
ideas.
</P>
<P>
Li Yuanchao, Vice Minister of Culture, said that during the
five years the country plans to complete the National Theater,
start to build the National Museum, expand the China Arts Gallery
and complete the trunk network of a nationwide digital library.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Chinese cultural centers will be
established in some developed countries such as France.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also promises to increase its total
investment in culture by 0.1 percentage point annually from 2001
to 2005, Li said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that the total disbursement on culture would reach one
percent of the state's yearly expenditure in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The state also will set aside special funds for encouraging
cultural development, relics protection and academic research.
</P>
<P>
In addition to hosting at least three international arts
festivals and contests, China is scheduled to organize overseas
performance tours for domestic arts groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry officials warned that the ministry will
continue to crack down on relics smuggling and pirated
publications.

<HEADLINE> Confidence Crisis Between Barak, Mubarak Made Public: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A crisis of confidence
between Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has opened up, with Mubarak doubting about Barak's
intention on peace, local daily Haaretz said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last week that
Barak had repeated his commitment in a recent telephone call to
moving forward the peace talks with the Palestinians, but "I do not
believe him," Haaretz said, quoting a Palestinian source.
</P>
<P>
Up until last week, Mubarak was careful not to criticize Barak
in public, and indeed had used his political leverage on the
Palestinians in order to prevent crises, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
But Cairo has stepped up its criticism of Israel in recent days
after both the Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Syrian talks hit an
impasse, and especially after the escalation of conflicts between
the Israeli army and Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented visit to Beirut on Saturday, the first of
its kind by an Egyptian head of state since 1952, Mubarak expressed
solidarity with Hezbollah and its resistance to the Israeli
occupation in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's stepped-up criticism was meant to signal Barak that
Cairo is increasingly disappointed at the pace of events, Haaretz
said. Mubarak fears that a freeze in the peace process could create
regional instability, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has expressed concern over the recent criticisms leveled
by Egypt and other Arab countries. Barak warned Sunday that the "
incitement campaign" would harm the peace process, and Foreign
Minister David Levy called Mubarak's remarks backing Hezbollah
guerrillas "worrisome".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak moved Sunday to mend the fence with Egypt,
sending two high-level envoys to Cairo to explain Israel's policy
on Lebanon and clear the air between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Barak's
chief of staff Danny Yatom, and his counterpart in Levy's office,
Alon Pinkas, explained that the Israeli cabinet is opposed to any
strikes at civilians.
</P>
<P>
They said the recent bombing of Lebanese infrastructure by
Israel, during which more than 20 Lebanese civilians were wounded,
came only after Hezbollah fired at Israeli army outposts in
southern Lebanon from inside Lebanese villages in violation of a
cease-fire agreement signed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel has always complained that two decades after the signing
of a peace treaty with Egypt, no mutually warm relationship has
evolved between the two countries.

<P>
KHARTOUM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of Sudan's
ruling National Congress Party Hassan al Turabi has implicitly
criticised remarks by President Omar el-Bashir that the rule by two
heads in Sudan is over.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the president means since we do not have two
presidents or two governments in Sudan," said Turabi, quoted by the
Al-Sahafi Al-Dawli daily on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bashir, who is currently on a visit to Saudi Arabia, had told
the Saudi daily Okaz that the rule by two heads in Sudan is over.
</P>
<P>
Bashir dissolved Sudan's parliament and declared a three-month
state of emergency last December, as a result of power struggle
with Turabi, the powerful parliament speaker and secretary general
of the ruling National Congress Party as well. The two have ever
since been trading accusations on each other.
</P>
<P>
Political sources in Khartoum are raising speculations about the
dissolution of the National Congress Party. And they said Turabi
was awaiting a "divorce certificate" from Bashir who was empowered
to dissolve the parliament under the country's constitution.

LUANDA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Angola on Monday denied the
allegation contained in an European Parliament's recent resolution
that 20 Angolan journalists are imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
"Its content is based on false information and a wrong

referring to the European Parliament's resolution.
</P>
<P>
"There is not even a single journalist in prison at the moment

</P>
<P>
The statement also said that "only one journalist has been
taken to court, in an absolutely transparent, regular and
impartial process in line with the laws".
</P>
<P>
It was reported last week by certain western news organizations
that the Angolan police had detained three opposition party
leaders and a local journalist in Luanda in a bid to avoid the
staging of a street demonstration against recent fuel price hikes.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni left here on Monday morning for Arusha in northern
Tanzania to attend a regional summit aimed at pushing the peace
process in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Hope Kivengere, press secretary to the President, told Xinhua
that the summit is expected to be attended by leaders from Kenya,
Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Former South African President Nelson Mandela will chair the
meeting as the facilitator of the Burundi peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was chosen as new mediator after former Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere died last October.
</P>
<P>
Many believed that the fresh round of peace talks in Arusha to
bring an end to Burundi's six-year civil war are unlikely to
conclude a quick settlement since the divisions are too
deep-seated.

KAMPALA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda said Monday that it has
been supporting all efforts toward the restoration of peace in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, Minister for Presidency
Rukahana Rugunda said that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni would
continue to work for realization of national dialog in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Museveni would attend the summit on February
23 in the Zambian capital Lusaka, involving six heads of state
whose countries were sucked in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda sent troops to help the rebel groups soon
after the civil war broke out in August 1998 while Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia were fighting alongside the DRC President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The parties involved in the conflict signed a peace agreement
in Lusaka last year, but both sides have been accusing each other
of violating the ceasefire since then.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of Lusaka peace accord is expected to top on
the agenda of the forthcoming summit.

<P>
LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's inflation rate stood
at 6.6 percent last December, the lowest of the year, indicating a
slowdown of inflation in the country, said the country's
statistics officials.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Monday quoted
analysts with the Federal Office of Statistics as saying in Abuja
that the December's inflation figure was 1.1 percent down from
that in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The December figure also concluded a successive six-month
decelerating growth trend of inflation, which had hit 12.4 percent
last May immediately before current civil government assuming
power.
</P>
<P>
The right and strict fiscal and monetary policies of the new
government, among others, contributed to the declining trend of
the inflation growth, said the analysts.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Positive CPI This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer price index (
CPI), which had been falling for 21 consecutive months by the end
of 1999, is expected to take an upswing this year, a senior
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yang, deputy director of the State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC), said China's current low price levels reflect
the country's economic operations in term of price.
</P>
<P>
Wang regarded the performance of the national economy this year
as the reason behind the price changes.
</P>
<P>
As the country's price regulatory authorities, the SDPC will
enhance confidence in investment and spending as well as curb
deflation by setting a reasonable price level this year, in a bid
to boost China's economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting the end of declining prices and a positive
consumer price index in 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will continue its pro-active fiscal
policy to maintain a steady growth in fixed-asset investment, and
will take measures to explore the domestic consumer market, which
may help prices pick up.
</P>
<P>
Price readjustment in sectors including transportation and
education will also be carried out nationwide to facilitate
infrastructure construction and boost the service industry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an improving global economy might gradually push
the prices in the international market back to the former levels,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to improve its price regulations to lift
restrictions on consumption this year, Wang said, adding that new
policies favoring investment will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Wang thought it unlikely that the Chinese market will be
flooded with imported goods should the country enter the World
Trade Organization this year, and the price level will
consequently withstand any negative predictions.

<HEADLINE> Spring Festival Boosts Road Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The week-long Chinese Spring
Festival period significantly pushed up the country's road
transportation statistics this year, with the daily ridership
exceeding 30 million.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Communications said today that the
total riderahip traveling between January 21 and February 9, the
busiest time of the season, hit 689 million, up 4 percent from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yingjia, an official with the Ministry, attributed the
surge to several factors: First, as the Year of Dragon marked the
first year of the new millennium, more migrant workers returned
home to join their family members to celebrate it. Second, the
ticket prices for long-distance train travel were slightly higher,
prompting some travelers to take to the road; third, the water
transportation service was short of demand as many ships were
ordered to undergo overhaul.
</P>
<P>
During the holiday, a total of 750,000 buses were put into use,
assuring 120,000 to 130,000 runs per day, and more than 158,000
administrative personnel worked around the o'clock.

BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The total added value of China
's industry grew to 164.3 billion yuan in January, 8.9 percent
more than in the same 1999 period, official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS), industrial companies with non-government shares
and enterprises with overseas funds saw a faster growth rate of
output than state-owned and collective enterprises.
</P>

Meanwhile, heavy industry grew faster than light industry.
</P>
<P>
In January, exports from Chinese industrial enterprises jumped
up by 19.1 percent over the same period of last year to 82.5
billion yuan, showing a strong growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
The NBS attributed the growth of exports to the Chinese
government policy of encouraging and supporting exports and to a
relatively small export volume in January, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises sold 94.52 percent of the products they
turned out in January, an improvement of 1.39 percentage points
over the same period of last year.

BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng today expressed
confidence in the potential of Sino-Indian bilateral trade, saying
that bilateral trade volume can double with efforts from both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume stood at two billion U.S. dollars last
year, which is not enough to meet the needs of both sides and far
lower than the level that could be achieved, Shi said at the sixth
session of the Sino-Indian Science and Technology Economic Group,
which convened here today.
</P>
<P>
Shi and visiting Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry
Murasoli Maran co-presided over the session.
</P>
<P>
China and India are large developing countries that have
similar economic situations, and therefore should further promote
bilateral trade ties on the basis of equality and mutual-benefit,
stressed Shi.
</P>
<P>
Shi suggested that a smooth channel for the two-way information
flow be established to promote mutual understanding between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also called for continued effort to boost contract labor and
mutual investment, while promising that a favorable policy
environment be created for border trade.
</P>
<P>
Maran hoped that both sides will enhance cooperation in fields
of mutual interest to expand bilateral trade. India hopes that
China will enter the World Trade Organization as soon as possible,
he said, adding that China's accession not only benefits the
organization, but can help promote global trade as well.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Science, Technology Program to Develop Western Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Science and
Technology has launched a major program focusing on science and
technology to boost the development of the country's western
region.
</P>
<P>
The first group of projects, including quality vegetable seed
planting in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, have already began.
</P>
<P>
The program, absorbing 50 million yuan (about 6 million U.S.
dollars) in funding, is part of the strategic plan to develop the
west, train personnel and local officials, and establish major
laboratories in local universities.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the ministry said the program also
includes the building of university and science parks in the
western areas, state engineering research centers, and a data bank
and an early warning system for monitoring the ecological
environment of the key western spots.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is to build demonstration projects for boosting
new-tech and ecological technology industries, set up an
agricultural information network, and encourage solar energy, new
materials, biological pharmaceuticals and other high-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation farming projects are also on the development
list.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also urge that the western region be involved
in the Sino-EU sustainable agricultural, fishery and forestry
development programs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the ministry has allocated a total of 280
million yuan (about 33 million U.S. dollars) between 1996 and 2000
for a number of projects, including water conservation and
ecological development plans in dry areas, and sustainable use of
water from the Yellow River.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Boost Trade With Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government has
planned to send trade delegations to Iraq, Iran and Syria in an
effort to boost the country's exports to neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The delegations will visit Iraq in March, Iran in April and
Syria in May. And the government will stage promotional fairs in
these countries to improve trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's trade volume with its neighbors has declined since
1980. Turkey saw its trade share with neighbors drop from 11.8
percent in 1980 to 8.1 percent in 1990 and 3.7 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decline was mainly attributed to political instability both
at home and abroad, tensions in Turkey's relations with these
neighbors and southern neighboring countries' comparatively low
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and its southern neighbors Iraq, Iran and Syria have been
at odds over territory, water resources and separatist activities
by the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Turkey accused the three countries of supporting the PKK, which
has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria, the downstream countries of the Tigris and
Euphrates Rivers, opposed to Turkey's plan to build dams across the
rivers for fears that Turkey, the upstream country of the rivers,
may use water as weapons against them in case of tension.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Turkey has been working on improving regional
security to pave the way for the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said that Turkey should learn from European
countries which trade most actively with their neighbors so as to
further tap commercial potential with its neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP for 1999 Expected to exceed 4.3 Percent: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's gross domestic
product (GDP) for 1999 is expected to exceed the 4.3 percent
forecast made in the 2000 Budget.
</P>
<P>
"There may be a possibility of achieving slightly more than
that," Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 budget, tabled on October 29, 1999 but aborted due to
the dissolution of parliament for the 10th general elections in
last November, would be re-tabled as it was on February 25, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told a press conference that the upcoming budget
presentation would not contain new announcements and this would
include no further cut in corporate tax, now at 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
To a question on foreign investment on the back of existing
selective exchange control measures, he said foreign investors
should take advantage of the fixing of the ringgit at 3.80 per U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Advising foreign investors to invest while the ringgit was low,
Mahathir said that Malaysia has no intention to change the value
of the ringgit.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the existence of the exchange controls,
Malaysia did quite well in attracting foreign investment compared
to other countries in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank (Exim)
of the United States announced here Monday plans to guarantee
loans denominated in the Indian rupee to the tune of one billion U.
S. dollars to facilitate greater bilateral commercial transactions
between exporters in India and the Unite States.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Exim Bank Chairman James Harmon, who arrived here for a
visit, said, "The rupee guarantee is going to be a powerful tool
for helping Indian business of all sizes to access U.S. goods and
services."
</P>
<P>
Harmon said the bank expected to facilitate exports from the U.
S. to India worth one billion dollars during the current year.
</P>
<P>
The decision to approve loan guarantee in the local currency,
initiated under Exim Bank's Foreign Currency Guarantee Program,
will provide U.S. exporters flexibility to offer their buyers a
guarantee in Indian rupees.

<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Jia Qinglin, a member of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee,
met here today with Ikuo Hirayama, chairman of the Japan-China
Friendship Association, and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
Jia, also secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party, praised the Japan-China Friendship
Association for its substantial effort to push forward the
normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, concluding the Sino-
Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, and advancing bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Beijing and Tokyo are friends and have maintained
sound cooperation over the years; however, erroneous remarks and
wrongdoings of Governor of Metropolitan Tokyo Ishihara Shintaro
have affected the relationship between the two capital cities.
</P>
<P>
"We regret this," Jia said.
</P>
<P>
Hirayama spoke highly of Beijing's achievements in various
fields in recent years, and said that Shintaro's words and
behavior do not represent the masses, and residents in Tokyo hope
to develop friendship with Beijing people throughout the years.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that Beijing will succeed in its bid
for the Olympic Games in 2008.

Al-Ahram:

energy.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Cairo is due to host an annual meeting of the international

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Reports that Israel plans to evacuate 37 settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip and hand over the land to the Palestinians
in the final-status agreement were denied Sunday by Israeli Deputy
Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh, who called settler leaders to calm
their fears.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Office also
contacted settler leaders and denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
However, the Council of Jewish Communities in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip decided Sunday night to launch an aggressive building
and marketing campaign in all the settlements reportedly to be
slated for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A crisis of confidence between Barak and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak has opened up, with Mubarak telling the Palestinians
that he doubts Barak intends to reach a deal with them.
</P>
<P>
According to a source close to the Palestinian Authority,
Mubarak expressed hard feelings toward Barak in a Cairo meeting
last Thursday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Up until last week, Mubarak was careful not to criticize Barak
in public, and indeed had used his political leverage on Arafat in
order to prevent crises.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu was questioned for
six hours at the National Fraud Squad headquarters on Sunday,
apparently for the last time.
</P>
<P>
Police refused to respond to reports that they plan to recommend
charging Netanyahu with three counts -- taking bribes from
contractor Avner Amedi, attempting to extract public funds from the
Prime Minister's Office, and stealing gifts received while he was
in office.
</P>
<P>
Deputy police spokesman Ofer Sivan said recommendations to State
Attorney Edna Arbel would be submitted by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak on Sunday came up with a new timetable for a final-
status framework, assuring his ministers the he intends to reach an
agreement with the Palestinians by May.
</P>
<P>
He added that he was still convinced that he will sign the final
deals by October, 15 months after he took office last July.
</P>
<P>
Barak claimed that it was the Palestinians who were inflexible
in the talks. However, Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
rejected Barak's claims, saying "everyone knows that Barak is not
focused on us, and that is the problem."

<P>
JAKARTA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) signed here Monday a memorandum
of understanding on the increasing of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was signed by Indonesian Minister of Trade and
Industry Jusuf Kalla and the DPRK Trade Minister Kang Jong Mo.
</P>
<P>
Kalla said he was confident that the DPRK will become a
potential market for Indonesian products in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Although the DPRK is still facing economic problems, there is
no reason for Indonesia not to improve its trade ties with it,"
Kalla said after the signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
It also reported that the DPRK wants to import fertilizer, oil
and vegetable oil from Indonesia and export phosphate, machinery,
oil processing equipment and fishing boats to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Trade balance between the two countries in 1994-1998 tipped in
favor of the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
And Indonesia suffered a deficit of 25.94 million U.S. dollars
in its trade with the DPRK in 1996, but gained a surplus of 90.6
million dollars in January to September 1999.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Semiconductor Firms to Invest More This Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The investments by South Korean
semiconductor companies for this year are estimated at 4.15
billion U.S. dollars, up 58 percent from last year, the Commerce
Industry and Energy Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A survey of six leading companies -- Samsung Electronics,
Hyundai Electronics, Anam Anam Semiconductor, Chippac Korea,
Fairchild Korea and ASE, shows that investments are focused on the
improvement of existing facilities rather than on new production
lines, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Of the total investments, new projects are estimated to account
for 760 million dollars, down 4 percent from last year whereas
improvement of existing facilities will top 2.86 billion dollars,
up 102 percent.
</P>
<P>
Research and development investments are expected to rise 25
percent to 530 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a survey by the marketing agency IC Insights
predicted that facility investments by the world semiconductor
industry will jump to 38.7 billion dollars this year, 26 percent
over last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 38.7 billion U.S. dollars, the United States will
account for 12.3 billion, up 15 percent; Japan 8.6 billion, up 39
percent; Taiwan 7.7 billion, up 31 percent; Europe four billion,
up 11 percent; South Korea 4.3 billion, up 39 percent; and other

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean financial
institutions last year registered a total loss of 450 million U.S.
dollars from their offshore fund operations, down from the
previous year's 1.19 billion, the Financial Supervisory Service (
FSS) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They suffered losses of 510 million dollars from their offshore
funds, but gained 60 million dollars from equity participation.
</P>
<P>
Of the losses, 480 million dollars went to securities companies,
15 million to insurers, 10 million to investment trusts and four
million to merchant banks.
</P>
<P>
The number of offshore funds stood at 93 last year, down 59
from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Valuation losses plunged as domestic financial institutions
liquidated money-losing funds while the value of assets held by
offshore funds rose due to a bullish stock market.
</P>
<P>
Following the financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies
and bad loans of financial institutions in late 1997, South Korea
tightened regulations on offshore funds.
</P>
<P>
Offshore funds are required to obtain approval from the central
Bank of Korea for payment guarantees and additional collateral.
</P>
<P>
Brokerage houses were also banned from making payment
guarantees for offshore funds and had to disclose equity
investment in offshore funds.

<HEADLINE> Rafter, Philippoussis may Miss Davis Cup Tie with Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia may have to face
Germany in their Davis Cup tennis quater-final tie in Adelaide,
Australia in April this year without dual U.S. Open champion
Patrick Rafter and world No.9 Mark Philippoussis, captain John
Newcombe said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Newcombe worried about Rafter's fully recovery from a shoulder
injury so as to play doubles in the tie. But he might need to
build himself up through some leadup events.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis' fitness was also under doubt after he had to
withdraw from the St Jude tournament in Memphis last week with a
knee injury. He is set to undergoes scan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Newcombe was preparing for his team to be without both top-
liners for the April 7-9 tie on grass.
</P>
<P>
But he could put his hope on teenager Lleyton Hewitt and big-
serving Wayne Arthurs, who could play singles if Rafter and
Philippoussis were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt and Arthurs were on the Australian team when it beat
Russia in last year's Davis Cup semi-final in Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
Rafter had some shoulder problems with his sliced backhand
about 10 days ago which had since subsided but he was experiencing
some back stiffness through lack of playing, Newcombe said.
</P>
<P>
Rafter plans to make his comeback next week at Delray Beach, in
Florida, where Philippoussis is also expected to play.

<HEADLINE> Rare Tiger Species Can Exist in the Wild: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese zoologists believe
that frequent sightings of traces left by wild South China tigers
in the past two years prove that the most endangered tiger species
is able to exist in the wild.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of four tiger pawprints in the Heishan Mountain
Reserve in central China's Hunan Province earlier this year has
been confirmed by Deng Xuejian, a senior South China tiger
research expert with Hunan Teacher's University. The prints were
preserved intact under a block of crusted snow.
</P>
<P>
"The clearest one was the left hind paw mark with four toe
prints measuring 18 cm in width, left by a 170-kg South China
tiger," Deng said. His team members made a plaster mold of the
print for further research.
</P>
<P>
An elderly hunter, Yan Changlin, and several local villagers
told the team that they saw a big tiger together with a small one
in the area recently.
</P>
<P>
Based on the evidence and eyewitness reports, experts now
believe that at least one tiger family lives in the 5,000-ha
reserve. They have advised related authorities to promote Black
Mountain to a state-level reserve.
</P>
<P>
The mountain is located in the southern part of the Hupingshan
State South China Tiger Nature Reserve, which in the early 1990s
was listed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as an ideal natural
habitat for tigers.
</P>
<P>
Liao Xiansheng, the only warden at the reserve for over a dozen
years, has reported a score of tiger clues since 1998, compared
with two sightings between 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
His specific accounts of tiger traces, such as claw marks on
trees, tiger growls and droppings, have been recognized by Chinese
forestry officials and international wildlife protection
organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to the expert, some six to ten tigers may live in
Hupingshan.
</P>
<P>
His research, which suggests the existence of a sustainable
tiger population, contradicts the view that the South China tiger
has become extinct in the wild.
</P>
<P>
A number of renowned tiger experts agree with him. Lei
Guangchun, a professor with Beijing University and a consultant
with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), said that the well-preserved
highland provides a favorable shelter for enlarging the tiger
group.
</P>
<P>
A "living corridor" has been created by merging the two natural
reserves in Hunan with the one in Houhe Mountain, Hubei Province,
to give the tigers more breeding space, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to tigers, other carnivores, such as the clouded
leopard and black bear, have grown in number under the state
protection, said Liao.
</P>
<P>
To save the South China tiger, a species unique to China, the
country has approved several nature reserves since the 1980s,
including Hupingshan, Mangshan in Hunan, Meihuashan in
southeastern Fujian and Chebaling in Guangdong. The efforts have
gradually paid off, since a growing number of eye-witness reports
and traces of the tiger have been confirmed by experts in Hunan,
Jiangxi and Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
The animal protection authorities want to set up other
corridors in central, eastern and southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Chinese zoologists estimated that there survive some 20-30
South China Tigers in the wild. Another 53 are in captivity around
the country.

<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Commenting on the detentions of three Kurdish mayors in
southeastern Turkey, President Suleyman Demirel said on Sunday
that "law exists in Turkey. No one needs to fear. If they have not

opened from inside the embassy. The Swiss government demanded those
who opened fire to be put on trial, a request turned down by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't not to Change its oil Price Assumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
not change its oil price assumption in its budget for the fiscal
year 2000 starting from April to December despite mounting calls
from the House of Representatives (DPR).
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Bambang Sudibyo said on Monday that the
price assumption of 18 U.S. dollars per barrel in international
market is quite realistic.
</P>
<P>
"Determining of oil price assumption at 18 U.S. dollars per
barrel is a realistic assumption, if (we) will use assumption at
the level 20 U.S. dollars per barrel during the year 2000, (such
an assumption) is too optimistic," Sudibyo told a joint hearing
with budget committee of the House.
</P>
<P>
A lot of members of the committee, however, have urged the
government to change its assumption of the crude oil price
following the rising crude oil price in international market
mounting to 30 U.S. dollar per barrel recently.
</P>
<P>
"The fixity of oil price which is envisaged at 18 U.S. dollars
per barrel is too conservative," Chairman of the budget committee
Sukowalujo Mintohardjo said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, some member of budget committee also
urged the government to increase the country's oil production,
saying such increment will bring benefit to the country and will
boost its 2000 fiscal year budget.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil production during the fiscal year 2000 is
projected to reach 1.46 million barrel a day.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is one of the OPEC members and also one of big oil
producers in the world.

V. Several Questions Involving Adherence to the One-China
Principle in the International Community
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has expressed its appreciation to the
international community for widely pursuing a one-China policy. In
August 1993, we published the white paper The Taiwan Question and
Reunification of China. In Chapter V of this document, "Several
Questions Involving Taiwan in International Relations," we
explained our position and policy on a number of issues, including
relations between Taiwan and countries maintaining diplomatic ties
with China, relations between international organizations and
Taiwan, aviation services between Taiwan and countries having
diplomatic relations with China, and arms sales to Taiwan by
countries having diplomatic relations with China. Here, we would
like to reaffirm our related position and policy.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is ineligible for membership of the United Nations and
other international organizations whose membership is confined to
sovereign states. The United Nations is an inter-governmental
international organization composed of sovereign states. After the
restoration of the lawful rights of the PRC in the United Nations,
the issue of China's representation in the UNO was resolved once
and for all and Taiwan's re-entry became totally out of the
question. The Taiwan authorities have asserted that Resolution
2758 of the UN resolved only "the problem of China's
representation," but not "the problem of Taiwan's representation,"
and demanded participation in the UN. We will never permit such a
separatist act of creating "two Chinas' or "one China, one Taiwan.

 Conclusion
</P>
<P>
China has a long history of 5,000 years. The Chinese people
have lived and multiplied on this land where all ethnic groups
have mixed together, in the course of which they have evolved
powerful cohesiveness, and the values of cherishing and
safeguarding unity. Over the long course of history, the Chinese
nation has witnessed changes of dynasties, transfers of
governments, local separatist regimes, and foreign invasions,
especially the untold invasions and dismemberment by foreign
powers in modern history. However, unity has always been the main
trend in the development of Chinese history. After every
separation, the country was invariably reunified, only to be
followed in its wake by rapid political, economic, cultural,
scientific and technological development. Our compatriots in
Taiwan have a glorious tradition of patriotism, and have performed
brilliant exploits in the struggles against foreign invasions of
Taiwan. Since the founding of the PRC, the Chinese people have
particularly valued their hard-earned national independence,
firmly upheld state sovereignty and territorial integrity and
struggled unswervingly for reunification of the motherland. The 5,
000-year history and culture have been implanted deeply in the
minds of the Chinese people, sprouting the strong national
consciousness of the need for national unification.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government hopes that the international community
will follow the principle of one China now and always and that the
U.S. government will earnestly fulfil all the principles
concerning the Taiwan issue in the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques, and its solemn promise to uphold the One-China
Principle.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese government has successively resumed the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, the people of
the whole of China are eager to resolve the Taiwan issue as early
as possible and realize the total reunification of the country.
They cannot allow the resolution of the Taiwan issue to be
postponed indefinitely. We firmly believe that the total
reunification of China will be achieved through the joint efforts
of the entire Chinese people including compatriots on both sides
of the Taiwan Straits and those living overseas.

Separatist forces in Taiwan are bent on violating the One-China
Principle. In 1988, after Lee Teng-hui became the leader of the
Taiwan authorities, he publicly stated time and again that the
basic policy of the Taiwan authorities was that "there is only
one China, not two," and "we have always maintained that China
should be reunited, and we adhere to the principle of 'one China.'
"
</P>
<P>
However, since the early 1990s, Lee Teng-hui has gradually
deviated from the One-China Principle, trumpeting "two
governments,""two reciprocal political entities," "Taiwan is
already a state with independent sovereignty," and "At the
present stage the Republic of China is on Taiwan and the People's
Republic of China is on the mainland." Moreover, he went back on
his words, saying that "I have never said that there is only one
China." In addition, he has connived at and provided support for
the separatists who advocate "Taiwan independence" and their
activities, thus helping the rapid development of the "Taiwan
independence" forces and the spread of the "Taiwan independence"
ideology. Under the direction of Lee Teng-hui, the Taiwan
authorities have adopted a series of measures toward actual
separation. In matters of Taiwan's form of government, the Taiwan
authorities are seeking to transform Taiwan into an "independent
political entity" through a "constitutional reform," so as to
suit the needs of creating "two Chinas." In foreign relations,
the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort to carry out the
activities for "expanding the international space of survival,"
with the aim of creating "two Chinas." Since 1993, for seven
years running, the Taiwan authorities have maneuvered for
participation in the United Nations. In military affairs, the
Taiwan authorities have bought large quantities of advanced
weapons from foreign countries and sought to join the Theater
Missile Defense System (TMDS), in an attempt to establish a
military alliance of a disguised form with the United States and
Japan.

<HEADLINE> "Two German States Formula" Can't Settle Taiwan Issue: White Paper( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
stressed here today in a white paper that the"two German states
formula"can't be copied to settle the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, entitled "The One-China Principle and the
Taiwan Issue," was released by the Taiwan Affairs Office and the
Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Some people in Taiwan have suggested that cross-Straits
relations should be dealt with according to the "two German states
formula," since Germany was divided into two states after the
Second World War, and was later reunified.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal shows a misunderstanding of history and reality,
" the white paper noted, adding that "the division of Germany
after the war and the temporary division between the two sides of
the Straits are questions of a different nature."
</P>
<P>
The difference lies mainly in three aspects. The first is the
reasons for, and the nature of, the division, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
After its defeat in the Second World War in 1945, Germany was
divided into zones occupied separately by the four victorious
nations of the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The reunification of Germany became a focus of the
confrontation in Europe between the United States and the Soviet
Union during the cold war.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic
Republic were established in the zones occupied by the U.S.,
Britain and France, and that occupied by the Soviet Union. Thus
Germany was divided into two states.

In ideology and culture, the Taiwan authorities have endeavored
to obliterate the Chinese awareness of Taiwan compatriots,
especially young people, and their identification with the
motherland, in order to create misunderstanding of the motherland
among Taiwan compatriots and estrange them from her, thus cutting
off the ideological and cultural ties between the compatriots on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Since 1999, Lee Teng-hui has stepped up his separatist
activities. In May, he published the book The Road to Democracy,
which advocates the division of China into seven regions, each
enjoying "full autonomy." On July 9, he went so far as to
publicly distort the inter-Straits relations as "state to state
relations, or at least special state to state relations," in an
attempt to fundamentally change the status of Taiwan as a part of
China, sabotage the relations between both sides of the Taiwan
Straits, especially the basis for cross-Straits political
dialogues and negotiations, and wreck the foundation for peaceful
reunification. Lee Teng-hui has become the general representative
of Taiwan's separatist forces, a saboteur of the stability of the
Taiwan Straits, a stumbling-block preventing the development of
relations between China and the United States, and a troublemaker
for the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government firmly defends the One-China Principle.
The Chinese government and people have always maintained sharp
vigilance and fought resolutely against the secessionist
activities of the Taiwan separatists, represented by Lee Teng-hui.

Nevertheless, separatists in Taiwan are still attempting to
detach Taiwan "de jure"from China in the name of the "Republic of
China" by various forms, including "formulating a new constitution,
" "amending the constitution," and "explaining the constitution"
or through "legislation." Special vigilance should be maintained
to the fact that the Taiwan separatists are continually scheming
to disrupt the Sino-U.S. relations and provoke conflicts and
confrontation between the two nations to achieve their aim of
dividing China.
</P>
<P>
Facts prove that a serious crisis still exists in the situation
of the Taiwan Straits. To safeguard the interests of the entire
Chinese people including compatriots in Taiwan and maintain the
peace and development of the Asia-Pacific region, the Chinese
government remains firm in adhering to "peaceful reunification"
and "one country, two systems"; upholding the eight propositions
put forward by President Jiang Zemin for the development of cross-
Straits relations and the acceleration of the peaceful
reunification of China; and doing its utmost to achieve the
objective of peaceful reunification. However, if a grave turn of
events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in
any name, or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign
countries, or if the Taiwan authorities refuse, sine die, the
peaceful settlement of cross-Straits reunification through
negotiations, then the Chinese government will only be forced to
adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of force,
to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and
fulfill the great cause of reunification. The Chinese government
and people absolutely have the determination and ability to
safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will
never tolerate, condone or remain indifferent to the realization
of any scheme to divide China. Any such scheme is doomed to
failure.

After Lee Teng-hui's "private" visit to the United States in
June 1995, the Chinese government has waged a resolute struggle
against separation and against "Taiwan independence," and made
strong protests and representations to the U.S. government for
openly allowing Lee Teng-hui to visit the U.S., violating its
promises made in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, and
seriously prejudicing China's sovereignty. This struggle has shown
the Chinese government and people's firm resolve and ability to

an important and far-reaching influence. Compatriots in Taiwan
have further realized the serious harm "Taiwan independence" can
cause. Lee Teng-hui has received a heavy blow for his separatist
activities in the international community, so that some of the "
Taiwan independence" protagonists have had to abandon certain
extremist propositions aimed at division. The international
community has further realized the necessity of upholding the one-
China policy. The U.S. government has explicitly undertaken not to
support "Taiwan independence," not to support "two Chinas" or
"one China, one Taiwan," and not to support Taiwan joining any
international organization whose membership is restricted to
sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people have fought more
unremittingly after Lee Teng-hui cooked up his "two states"
theory. The relevant department of the Chinese government has
clearly stated that the attempt of the Taiwan separatists to
implement the "two states" theory in "legal" form was an even
more serious and dangerous step toward division and a grave
provocation against peaceful reunification. Were the attempt to
succeed, it would be impossible for China to achieve peaceful
reunification. The struggle against this attempt has grown in
momentum with Chinese both at home and abroad condemning the "two
states" theory with one voice. Most countries in the world have
reaffirmed their position of upholding the One-China Policy. The U.
S. government has also reasserted its adherence to the One-China
Policy and its commitment to the "Three Non-supports" for Taiwan.
Finally, the Taiwan authorities have been compelled to announce
that they will not amend their "constitution" and "laws"
according to the "two states" theory.

Chinese territory and sovereignty has not been split, and the
two sides of the Straits are not two states. The Taiwan
authorities support their position on "two Chinas," including
the "two states" theory proposed by Lee Teng-hui, with the
following arguments: Since 1949, the territories on either side of
the Straits have been divided and governed separately, with
neither side having jurisdiction over the other; the government of
the PRC has never ruled Taiwan; and since 1991 Taiwan has
witnessed a form of government that has nothing to do with that of
the Chinese mainland. These arguments are absolutely untenable,
and can never lead to the conclusion that Taiwan may declare
itself a state under the name of the "Republic of China," or
that the two sides of the Straits have been divided into two
states. Firstly, state sovereignty is inseparable. The territory
is the space in which a state exercises its sovereignty. In the
territory of a country there can only be a central government
exercising sovereignty on behalf of the state. As we have already
said, Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory and,
after replacing the government of the Republic of China in 1949,
the government of the PRC has become the sole legal government of
China, enjoying and exercising sovereignty over the whole of China,
including Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Although the two sides of the Straits have not been reunified,
Taiwan's status as a part of Chinese territory has never changed,
neither, therefore, has China's sovereignty over Taiwan ever
changed. Secondly, the international community recognizes that
there is only one China, that Taiwan is a part of China, and that
the government of the PRC is the sole legitimate government of
China. Thirdly, the reason that the Taiwan question has not been
settled for such a long period of time is mainly due to the
intervention of foreign forces and the obstruction of the
separatist forces in Taiwan.

Although the two sides of the Straits remain to be reunified,
the long-term existence of this abnormal situation has not imbued
Taiwan with a status and rights in international law, nor can it
change the legal status of Taiwan as a part of China. The problem
now is that the separatists in Taiwan and some foreign anti-China
forces seek to change this state of affairs, and it is this that
the Chinese government and people are firmly against.
</P>
<P>
We firmly oppose changing Taiwan's status as a part of China by
referendum. The Taiwan separatists'attempt to change Taiwan's
status as a part of China by referendum on the pretext that "
sovereignty belongs to the people" is futile. Firstly, under both
domestic and international laws Taiwan's legal status as a part of
Chinese territory is unequivocal, and there can be no premise for
using referendum to decide any matter of self-determination.
Secondly, the phrase "sovereignty belongs to the people" refers
to all the people of a state, and not certain people or the people
of a certain area. The sovereignty over Taiwan belongs to all the
Chinese people including Taiwan compatriots, and not to some of
the people in Taiwan. Thirdly, at no time in history has Taiwan
been a state in its own right, and since 1945 Taiwan has not been
a foreign colony, nor has it been under foreign occupation. The
issue of national self-determination, therefore, does not exist.
In short, from the time that China recovered Taiwan in 1945, there
has been no question at all of changing Taiwan's status as a part
of China by holding a referendum. The only future for Taiwan is
reunification with the China mainland, and certainly not
separation. Any attempt to separate Taiwan from China through so-
called referendum would only lead the Taiwan people to disaster. (

The "two German states formula" cannot be applied to the
settlement of the Taiwan issue. Some people in Taiwan have
suggested that cross-Straits relations should be dealt with
according to the "two German states formula," since Germany was
divided into two states after the Second World War, and was later
reunified. This proposal shows a misunderstanding of history and
reality. The division of Germany after the war and the temporary
division between the two sides of the Straits are questions of a
different nature, the difference lying mainly in three aspects.
The first is the reasons for, and the nature of, the division.
After its defeat in the Second World War in 1945, Germany was
divided into zones occupied separately by the four victorious
nations of the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union
according to a declaration on the defeat of Germany and the
assumption of supreme authority and the subsequent Potsdam
Agreement. The reunification of Germany became a focus of the
confrontation in Europe between the United States and the Soviet
Union during the cold war. The Federal Republic of Germany and the
German Democratic Republic were established in the zones occupied
by the U.S., Britain and France, and that occupied by the Soviet
Union. Thus Germany was divided into two states. Obviously, the
German question arose entirely from external factors, while the
Taiwan issue, left over by China's civil war, is a matter of China
's internal affairs. The second aspect is the difference in status
between the two under international law. Germany was divided
according to a series of international treaties during and after
the Second World War, while the Taiwan question involves
provisions of the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation and
other international treaties, stating that Japan must return
Taiwan, which it had stolen from China, to the Chinese. The third
is the difference between the two in their actual conditions of
existence.

Against the backdrop of the confrontation between the U.S. and
the Soviet Union, the two German states had foreign troops
stationing in their territories and so were compelled to recognize
each other and co-exist in the international community. The
Chinese government has always persisted in the principle of one
China. Before Lee Teng-hui assumed power, and during his early
days in office, the Taiwan authorities recognized only one China
and opposed "two Chinas," and the One-China Principle has also
been widely accepted by the international community. For these
reasons, the Taiwan issue and the German issue cannot be placed in
the same category, nor can the "two German states formula" be
copied to settle the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Any question can be discussed under the One-China Principle.
The Chinese government advocates that the final purpose of cross-
Straits negotiations is to achieve peaceful reunification; and
that to achieve this purpose, talks should be held based on the
principle of one China. However, the proposals for " Taiwan
independence," "two Chinas" and "two states," aiming for
separation instead of reunification, violate the One-China
Principle, and are naturally unacceptable to the Chinese
government. Provided that it is within the framework of one China,
any question can be discussed, including the various issues that
are of concern to the Taiwan side. The Chinese government believes
that Taiwan's international space for economic, cultural and
social activities compatible with its status, the political status
of the Taiwan authorities and other questions can be finally
settled in the process of peaceful reunification through political
negotiations within this framework.

The so-called controversy about democracy and system is an
excuse for obstructing the reunification of China. In recent years
the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly declared that "
democratization on the China mainland is the key to the
reunification of China" and that "the real essence of the cross-
Straits issue is a contest between systems." This is an excuse
for postponing and resisting reunification, as well as a scheme to
deceive compatriots in Taiwan and world opinion. The CPC and the
Chinese government have consistently striven to achieve socialist
democracy. To achieve peaceful reunification in the form of "one
country, two systems," and to allow the two different social
systems on both sides of the Straits to coexist without imposing
them on one or the other--this is best able to embody the wishes
of compatriots on both sides of the Straits and is itself
democratic. The different social systems across the Straits,
therefore, should not constitute any barrier to peaceful
reunification. Moreover, the Chinese government acknowledges the
differences between Taiwan on the one hand and Hong Kong and Macao
on the other and, after peaceful reunification, is prepared to
apply a looser form of the "one country, two systems" policy in
Taiwan than in Hong Kong and Macao. It is totally unreasonable and
undemocratic for the Taiwan authorities to seek to obstruct
reunification on the pretext of the "controversy about democracy
and system" and to force the more than 1.2 billion people living
on the Chinese mainland to practice the political and economic
systems in Taiwan. The demand for democracy should not be used as
a reason for refusing reunification. The essence of the difference
between the two sides of the Straits on this question lies by no
means in the controversy over whether to practice democracy or in
the controversy over what system to practice, but rather a
controversy over the choice between reunification and separation.

II. The One-China Principle--the Basis and Prerequisite for
Achieving Peaceful Reunification
</P>
<P>
The One-China Principle is the foundation stone for the Chinese
government's policy on Taiwan. On Comrade Deng Xiaoping's
initiative, the Chinese government has, since 1979, adopted the
policy of peaceful reunification and gradually evolved the
scientific concept of "one country, two systems." On this basis,
China established the basic principle of "peaceful reunification,
and one country, two systems." The key points of this basic
principle and the relevant policies are: China will do its best to
achieve peaceful reunification, but will not commit itself to rule
out the use of force; will actively promote people-to-people
contacts and economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits, and start direct trade, postal, air and
shipping services as soon as possible; achieve reunification
through peaceful negotiations and, on the premise of the One-China
Principle, any matter can be negotiated. After reunification, the
policy of "one country, two systems" will be practiced, with the
main body of China (Chinese mainland) continuing with its
socialist system, and Taiwan maintaining its capitalist system for
a long period of time to come. After reunification, Taiwan will
enjoy a high degree of autonomy, and the Central Government will
not send troops or administrative personnel to be stationed in
Taiwan. Resolution of the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of
China, which should be achieved by the Chinese themselves, and
there is no call for aid by foreign forces. The afore-mentioned
principles and policies embody the basic stand and spirit of
adhering to the One-China Principle, and fully respect Taiwan
compatriots' wish to govern and administer Taiwan by themselves.
On May 1, 1995, President Jiang Zemin put forward eight
propositions on the development of relations between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits and the promotion of peaceful reunification
of China, explicitly pointing out: "Adhering to the One-China
Principle is the basis and prerequisite for peaceful reunification.

Only by adhering to the One-China Principle can peaceful
reunification be achieved. The Taiwan issue is one left over by
the Chinese civil war. As yet, the state of hostility between the
two sides of the Straits has not formally ended. To safeguard
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and realize the
reunification of the two sides of the Straits, the Chinese
government has the right to resort to any necessary means.
Peaceful means would be favorable to the common development of the
societies on both sides of the Straits, and to the harmony and
unity of the compatriots across the Straits. Peaceful means is
therefore the best means. The Chinese government's declaration in
1979 on implementing the principle of peaceful reunification was
based on the premise that the Taiwan authorities at that time
upheld the principle that there is only one China in the world and
Taiwan is a part of China. Meanwhile, the Chinese government took
into account the fact that the U.S. government, which for many
years had supported the Taiwan authorities, had accepted that
there is only one China in the world, Taiwan is a part of China
and the government of the PRC is the only legitimate government of
China, and saw this acknowledgment as being beneficial to the
peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue. While carrying out the
policy of peaceful reunification, the Chinese government always
makes it clear that the means used to solve the Taiwan issue is a
matter of China's internal affairs, and China is under no
obligation to commit itself to rule out the use of force. This is
by no means directed against Taiwan compatriots, but against the
scheme to create an "independent Taiwan" and against the foreign
forces interfering with the reunification of China, and is
intended as a necessary safeguard for the striving for peaceful
reunification. Resort to force would only be the last choice made
under compelled circumstances.

As for Taiwan, upholding the principle of one China indicates
that it acknowledges that China's sovereignty and territory are
inalienable. In this way, both sides of the Taiwan Straits will
have a common basis and premise and may find ways to solve their
political differences and realize peaceful reunification through
consultation on an equal footing. If Taiwan denies the One-China
Principle and tries to separate Taiwan from the territory of China,
the premise and basis for peaceful reunification will cease to
exist.
</P>
<P>
As for the United States, if it promises to follow a one-China
policy, it should earnestly implement the three communiques
between the Chinese and U.S. governments and fulfill the series of
promises it has made. It should maintain only cultural, commercial
and other non-governmental relations with Taiwan; oppose "Taiwan
independence," "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and not to
stand in the way of the reunification of China. Acting otherwise
will destroy the external conditions necessary for the Chinese
government to strive for peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
As for countries in the Asia-Pacific region and other regions
in the world, the situation across the Taiwan Straits has always
been closely linked with the stability of the Asia-Pacific region.
Adherence to the policy of one China by countries concerned will
be beneficial to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region
and favorable for China to develop friendly relations with other
countries, and therefore conforms to the interests of the Asia-
Pacific region and other countries in the world.

The Chinese government is actively and sincerely striving for
peaceful reunification. To achieve peaceful reunification, the
Chinese government has appealed time and again for cross-Straits
negotiations on the basis of equality and the One-China Principle.
Taking Taiwan's political reality into full account and out of
consideration for the Taiwan authorities' request for the
negotiations to be held on an equal footing, we have put forward
one proposal after another, such as that the negotiations should
be held between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese
KMT on a reciprocal basis and that the talks between the two
parties may include representatives from all parties and mass
organizations of Taiwan, and we have never spoken of negotiations
between the "central and local authorities." The Chinese
government has also proposed that dialogues may start first,
including political dialogues, which may gradually move on to
procedural consultations for political talks to solve the name,
the topics for discussion and the forms of official talks before
political talks are held. Political talks may be carried out step
by step. First, negotiations should be held and an agreement
reached on an official end to the state of hostility between the
two sides under the principle of one China so as to jointly
safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and work
out plans for the development of the future inter-Straits
relations. In January 1998, to seek and expand the political basis
for relations between the two sides, the Chinese government
explicitly proposed to the Taiwan side that before the realization
of reunification and in handling affairs concerning inter-Straits
relations, especially during the talks between the two sides, the
One-China Principle should be upheld, namely that there is only
one China in the world, Taiwan is a part of China and China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity is not to be separated. The
Chinese government hopes that on the basis of the One-China
Principle, the two sides will hold consultations on an equal
footing and discuss national reunification together.

To strive for peaceful reunification, the Chinese government
has adopted a series of positive policies and measures to promote
the comprehensive development of cross-Straits relations. From the
end of 1987, when the state of isolation between the two sides was
terminated, to the end of 1999, the number of Taiwan compatriots
coming to the mainland of China for visiting their relatives,
sightseeing or exchanges reached 16 million by turnstile count.
The total indirect trade volume between the two sides of the
Straits has exceeded US$ 160 billion; the agreed capital to be
invested by Taiwan business people in the mainland has exceeded US$
44 billion, of which US$ 24 billion has been actually used. Great
progress has been made in the exchange of mail and
telecommunications across the Straits; and some progress has been
made in the exchange of air and shipping services too. The NPC and
its Standing Committee, the State Council, and local governments
have worked out a sequence of laws and regulations to safeguard
the legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots. To
properly solve the concrete issues arising from the people-to-
people contacts between the two sides through consultations, in
November 1992 the mainland's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation reached
the common understanding during talks on routine affairs that each
of the two organizations should express verbally that "both sides
of the Taiwan Straits adhere to the One-China Principle." On this
basis, the leaders of these two organizations successfully held
the "Wang Daohan-Koo Chen-fu talks" and signed several agreements
on protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the
compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits in April 1993. In
October 1998, the leaders of the two organizations met in Shanghai,
starting political dialogue across the Straits. The talks between
the two organizations were carried out on an equal footing.
Practice has proved that on the basis of the One-China Principle,
it is entirely possible to find a proper way for holding talks,
based on equality, between the two sides. Since Hong Kong and
Macao's return to China, people-to-people contacts and exchanges
between Hong Kong and Taiwan and between Macao and Taiwan have
continued and developed on the basis of the One-China Principle. (

<HEADLINE> White Paper on Upholding One-China Principle in International Community (1) </HEADLINE>

BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
expressed its appreciation today to the international community
for pursuing a one-China policy and reaffirmed its position and
policy on several questions involving adherence to the one-China
principle in the international community in a white paper entitled
"The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue" released this
afternoon by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and
the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is ineligible for membership of the United Nations and
other international organizations whose membership is confined to
sovereign states," the white paper says.
</P>
<P>
After the restoration of the lawful rights of the PRC in the
United Nations, the issue of China's representation in the UN
organizations was resolved once and for all and Taiwan's re-entry
became totally out of the question, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities have asserted that Resolution 2758 of
the UN resolved only "the problem of China's representation," but
not "the problem of Taiwan's representation," and demanded
participation in the UN.
</P>
<P>
"We will never permit such a separatist act of creating 'two
Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan'," the paper stresses.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the one-China principle, the Chinese government
has made arrangements for Taiwan's participation in some inter-
governmental international organizations which accept region
membership in an agreeable and acceptable way according to the
nature, regulations and actual conditions of these international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The paper reiterates that no country maintaining diplomatic
relations with China should provide arms to Taiwan or enter into
military alliance of any form with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan question is the most crucial and most sensitive
issue in the relations between China and the U.S., the paper says.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, the U.S. has repeatedly contravened its solemn
undertakings to China made in the August 17 Communique and
continued its sale of advanced arms and military equipment to
Taiwan," it said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some people in the U.S. Congress have cooked up the
so-called Taiwan Security Enhancement Act and are attempting to
include Taiwan in the TMD system.

On the basis of the principle of one China, the Chinese
government has made arrangements for Taiwan's participation in
some inter-governmental international organizations which accept
region membership in an agreeable and acceptable way according to
the nature, regulations and actual conditions of these
international organizations. As a region of China, Taiwan has
participated in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) respectively in the names of "
Taipei, China" and "Chinese Taipei." In September 1992, the
chairman of the council of the predecessor of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (
GATT), stated that Taiwan may participate in this organization as
"a separate Taiwan-Penghu-Jinmen-Mazu tariff zone" (abbreviated as
Chinese Taipei) after the PRC's entry to GATT. The WTO should
persist in the principle defined in the afore-said statement when
examining the acceptance of Taiwan's entry to the organization.
This is only an ad hoc arrangement and cannot constitute a model
applicable to other inter-governmental international organizations
or international gatherings.

The Taiwan question is the most crucial and most sensitive

U.S. joint communiques are the basis for the healthy and stable
development of relations between the two countries. For over
twenty years, the U.S. has promised to adhere to a One-China
Policy, which has brought to itself benefits such as the
establishment of diplomatic relations with China, the development
of Sino-U.S. relations and the relative stability of the Taiwan
situation. Regrettably, the U.S. has repeatedly contravened its
solemn undertakings to China made in the August 17 Communique and
continued its sale of advanced arms and military equipment to
Taiwan. Recently, some people in the U.S. Congress have cooked up
the so-called Taiwan Security Enhancement Act and are attempting
to include Taiwan in the TMDS. This is gross interference in China
's internal affairs and a grave threat to China's security,
obstructing the peaceful reunification of China and jeopardizing
the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and the world
at large. The Chinese government is firmly against such actions.

The Chinese government adheres to the One-China Principle in
dealing with Taiwan's contacts with the outside world. The Taiwan
authorities have spared no effort to promote "pragmatic diplomacy"
in the international arena and enlarge their "international space
of survival," the essence of these being to create "two Chinas" or
"one China, one Taiwan." It is only natural that the Chinese
government should firmly oppose these. Meanwhile, considering the
needs of Taiwan's socio-economic development and the actual
benefits of compatriots in Taiwan, the Chinese government has no
objection to Taiwan's non-governmental economic and cultural
contacts with foreign countries; in fact, on the premise of one
China, it has adopted many flexible measures to make Taiwan's
economic, trade and cultural contacts with foreign countries more
convenient. For example, Taiwan may stay on the International
Olympic Committee in the name of "Chinese Taipei." As a matter of
fact, Taiwan has maintained extensive economic, trade and cultural
relations with many countries and regions in the world. Every year,
a million Taiwan compatriots go abroad for travel, business or
study, as well as for academic, cultural or sports exchanges, and
Taiwan's annual import and export trade volume has exceeded the US$
200-billion mark. This has demonstrated that adhering to the One-
China Principle has not prevented Taiwan compatriots from engaging
in non-governmental international exchanges or affected the needs
of Taiwan's normal economic, trade and cultural activities.

lawful rights and interests abroad. Chinese embassies and
consulates stationed abroad have always considered it their duties
to strengthen their ties with Taiwan compatriots, listen to their
suggestions and requests and safeguard their interests, and done
everything they can to help them overcome their difficulties.
During the Gulf War, the Chinese embassy helped Taiwanese labor
service personnel stranded in Kuwait pull out of dangerous places
safely. After the big earthquakes in Osaka and Kobe, Japan, the
Chinese embassy and consulate there promptly extended their
sympathies to stricken Taiwan compatriots. When the civil war in
Cambodia broke out, the Chinese embassy lost no time in helping
Taiwanese business people and tourists whose lives and property
were seriously imperiled by the war to move to safe places. All
the above-mentioned facts reflect the Chinese government's care
for Taiwan compatriots. When both sides of the Taiwan Straits are
reunified, Taiwan compatriots will, together with people of all
ethnic groups in the country, have more possibilities to fully
enjoy the dignity and honor of the PRC in the world.

<HEADLINE> "Two German States Formula" Can't Settle Taiwan Issue: White Paper (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second aspect is the difference in status between the two
under international law, it said.
</P>
<P>
Germany was divided according to a series of international
treaties during and after the Second World War, while the Taiwan
question involves provisions of the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam
Proclamation and other international treaties, stating that Japan
must return Taiwan, which it had stolen from China, to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The third is the difference between the two in their actual
conditions of existence, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of the confrontation between the U.S. and
the Soviet Union, the two German states had foreign troops
stationing in their territories and so were compelled to recognize
each other and co-exist in the international community, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has always persisted in the principle
of one China. Before Lee Teng-hui assumed power, and during his
early days in office, the Taiwan authorities recognized only one
China and opposed 'two Chinas,' and the One-China Principle has
also been widely accepted by the international community," the
paper noted.

"This is gross interference in China's internal affairs and a
grave threat to China's security, obstructing the peaceful
reunification of China and jeopardizing the peace and stability of
the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, " the paper says,
adding that "the Chinese government is firmly against such actions.
"
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the Chinese government adheres to the one-
China principle in dealing with Taiwan's contacts with the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Considering the needs of Taiwan's socio-economic development
and the actual benefits of compatriots in Taiwan, the Chinese
government has no objection to Taiwan's non-governmental economic
and cultural contacts with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
In fact, on the premise of one China, the Chinese government
has adopted many flexible measures to make Taiwan's economic,
trade and cultural contacts with foreign countries more convenient.
</P>
<P>
This has demonstrated that adhering to the one-China principle
has not prevented Taiwan compatriots from engaging in non-
governmental international exchanges nor affected the needs of
Taiwan's normal economic, trade and cultural activities, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper reiterates that the Chinese government safeguards all
the justified and lawful rights and interests of Taiwan
compatriots abroad.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Taiwan are of the same flesh and blood with us.
The Chinese government has always worked for safeguarding their
justified and lawful rights and interests abroad," it says.

"When both sides of the Taiwan Straits are reunified, Taiwan

The fifth part of the white paper, "Several Questions Involving
Adherence to the One-China Principle in the International
Community", makes it a point that Taiwan is not eligible for
membership of the United Nations and other international
organizations whose membership is confined to sovereign states.
All members of the UN should adhere to the purpose and principles
of the Charter of the United Nations and related UN resolutions,
abide by norms governing international relations, including mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-
interference in each other's internal affairs, and never, in any
form, support Taiwan's joining the UN or other international
organizations whose membership is confined to sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the principle of one China, the Chinese
government has made arrangements for Taiwan's participation in
some inter-governmental international organizations which accept
region membership in an agreeable and acceptable way according to
the nature, regulations and actual conditions of these
international organizations. In September 1992, the chairman of
the council of the predecessor of the World Trade Organization (
WTO), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), stated
that Taiwan may participate in this organization as "a separate
Taiwan-Penghu-Jinmen-Mazu tariff zone" (abbreviated as Chinese
Taipei) after the PRC's entry to GATT. The WTO should persist in
the principle defined in the afore-said statement when examining
the acceptance of Taiwan's entry to the organization. This is
only an ad hoc arrangement and cannot constitute a model
applicable to other inter-governmental international organizations
or international gatherings.
</P>
<P>
No country maintaining diplomatic relations with China
should provide arms to Taiwan or enter into military alliance of
any form with Taiwan. The U.S. has repeatedly contravened its
solemn undertakings to China made in the August 17 Communique and
continued its sale of advanced arms and military equipment to
Taiwan. Recently, some people in the U.S. Congress have cooked up
the so-called Taiwan Security Enhancement Act and are attempting
to include Taiwan in the TMDS. This is gross interference in China
's internal affairs and a grave threat to China's security,
obstructing the peaceful reunification of China and jeopardizing
the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and the world
at large. The Chinese government is firmly against such actions. (

The Chinese government adheres to the One-China Principle in
dealing with Taiwan's contacts with the outside world. The Taiwan
authorities have spared no effort to promote "pragmatic diplomacy"
in the international arena and enlarge their "international space
of survival", the essence of these being to create "two Chinas"
or "one China, one Taiwan". It is only natural that the Chinese
government should firmly oppose these. Meanwhile, considering the
needs of Taiwan's socio-economic development and the actual
benefits of compatriots in Taiwan, the Chinese government has no
objection to Taiwan's non-governmental economic and cultural
contacts with foreign countries; in fact, on the premise of one
China, it has adopted many flexible measures to make Taiwan's

CANBERRA -- United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Monday the transition to the U.N. control was going well in East
Timor, where he visited last week.
</P>
<P>
"We have again achieved an incredible seamless transition from
the Australian-led Interfet (International Force in East Timor) to
UNTAET (U.N. Transitional Authority in East Timor)," Annan told
reporters. At a joint press conference after his talks with
Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Annan said East Timor would
need the continued help of Australia and the rest of the world. "
With a bit of help and sustained effort I think East Timor can
make a go of it," he said. (Australia-Annan)

I. The Basis for One China, de Facto and de Jure
</P>
<P>
The One-China Principle has been evolved in the course of the
Chinese people's just struggle to safeguard China's sovereignty
and territorial integrity, and its basis, both de facto and de
jure, is unshakable.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. All the facts and laws
about Taiwan prove that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese
territory. In April 1895, through a war of aggression against
China, Japan forced the Qing government to sign the unequal Treaty
of Shimonoseki, and forcibly occupied Taiwan. In July 1937, Japan
launched an all-out war of aggression against China. In December
1941, the Chinese government issued the Proclamation of China's
Declaration of War Against Japan, announcing to the world that all
treaties, agreements and contracts concerning Sino-Japanese
relations, including the Treaty of Shimonoseki, had been abrogated,
and that China would recover Taiwan. In December 1943, the Cairo
Declaration was issued by the Chinese, U.S. and British
governments, stipulating that Japan should return to China all the
territories it had stolen from the Chinese, including Northeast
China, Taiwan and the Penghu Archipelago. The Potsdam Proclamation
signed by China, the United States and Britain in 1945 (later
adhered to by the Soviet Union) stipulated that "The terms of the
Cairo Declaration shall be carried out." In August of that year,
Japan declared surrender and promised in its instrument of
surrender that it would faithfully fulfill the obligations laid
down in the Potsdam Proclamation. On October 25, 1945, the Chinese
government recovered Taiwan and the Penghu Archipelago, resuming
the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan.

was proclaimed, replacing the government of the Republic of China
to become the only legal government of the whole of China and its
sole legal representative in the international arena, thereby
bringing the historical status of the Republic of China to an end.
This is a replacement of the old regime by a new one in a
situation where the main bodies of the same international laws
have not changed and China's sovereignty and inherent territory
have not changed therefrom, and so the government of the PRC
naturally should fully enjoy and exercise China's sovereignty,
including its sovereignty over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Since the KMT ruling clique retreated to Taiwan, although its
regime has continued to use the designations "Republic of China"
and "government of the Republic of China," it has long since
completely forfeited its right to exercise state sovereignty on
behalf of China and, in reality, has always remained only a local
authority in Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
The formulation of the One-China Principle and its basic
meaning. On the day of its founding, the Central People's
Government of the PRC declared to governments of all countries in
the world, "This government is the sole legitimate government
representing the entire people of the People's Republic of China.
It is ready to establish diplomatic relations with all foreign
governments that are willing to abide by the principles of
equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for each other's
territorial integrity and sovereignty." Shortly afterwards, the
Central People's Government telegraphed the United Nations,
announcing that the KMT authorities had "lost all basis, both de
jure and de facto, to represent the Chinese people," and therefore
had no right to represent China at all. One principle governing
New China's establishment of diplomatic relations with a foreign
country is that it recognizes the government of the PRC as the
sole legitimate government representing the whole of China, severs
or refrains from establishing diplomatic relations with the Taiwan
authorities.

These propositions of the Chinese government met with
obstruction by the U.S. government. On January 5, 1950, the U.S.
President Truman issued a statement, saying that the U.S. and
other Allied countries recognized China's exercise of sovereignty
over Taiwan Island in the four years since 1945. However, after
the start of the Korean War in June 1950, to isolate and contain
China the U.S. government not only sent troops to occupy Taiwan,
but it also dished out such fallacies as "the status of Taiwan has
yet to be determined" and later, step by step, lobbied for "dual
recognition" among the international community in order to create
"two Chinas." Naturally, the Chinese government resolutely opposed
this, insisting that there is only one China in the world, Taiwan
is a part of China and the government of the PRC is the sole legal
government representing the whole of China. China has evolved the
One-China Principle precisely in the course of the endeavor to
develop normal diplomatic relations with other countries and the
struggle to safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The above propositions constitute the basic meaning of the One-
China Principle, the crucial point being to safeguard China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
During the 30 or 40 years after 1949, although the Taiwan
authorities did not recognize the legitimate status of the
government of the PRC as the representative of the whole of China,
they did insist that Taiwan is a part of China and that there is
only one China, and opposed "two Chinas" and "Taiwan independence.
" This shows that for a long time there has been a common
understanding among the Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan
Straits on the fundamental question that there is only one China
and Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory. As far back as October
1958, when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was engaged in the
battle to bombard Jinmen, Chairman Mao Zedong declared to the
Taiwan authorities, "There is only one China, not two, in the
world. You agree with us on this point, as indicated in your
leaders' proclamations." In January 1979, the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC) issued a Message to Taiwan
Compatriots, pointing out that "the Taiwan authorities have always
stood firm on the one China position and opposed the independence
of Taiwan. This is our common stand and our basis for cooperation.

The Chinese government's solemn and reasonable stand for the
One-China Principle has gained the understanding and support of
more and more countries and international organizations, and the
One-China Principle has been gradually accepted by the
international community at large. In October 1971, the United
Nations General Assembly adopted at its 26th session Resolution
2758, which expelled the representatives of the Taiwan authorities
and restored the seat and all the lawful rights of the government
of the PRC in the United Nations. In September 1972, China and
Japan signed a Joint Statement, announcing establishment of
diplomatic relations between the two countries, and that Japan
recognizes the government of the PRC as the only legitimate
government of China, fully understands and respects the Chinese
government's position that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the
territory of the PRC, and promises to adhere to the position as
prescribed in Article 8 of the Potsdam Proclamation. In December
1978, China and the U.S. issued the Joint Communique on the
establishment of diplomatic relations, in which the U.S. "
recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China as the
sole legal government of China" and "acknowledges the Chinese
position that there is but one China and Taiwan is a part of China.
" Up to now, 161 countries have established diplomatic relations
with the PRC; they all acknowledge the One-China Principle and
promise to handle their relations with Taiwan within the one-China
framework.

<HEADLINE> China Firmly Committed to "One-China" Principle: White Paper (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The white paper issued today
by the Chinese government said the Chinese government unswervingly
safeguards the "One-China" principle.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, jointly issued by the Taiwan Affairs Office
and the Information Office of the State Council, said a serious
crisis exists in the situation of the Taiwan Straits, but the
Chinese government is still doing its utmost to achieve the
objective of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
The paper warned that "however, if a grave turn of events
occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name,
or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries, or if
the Taiwan authorities refuse, sine die, the peaceful settlement
of cross-Straits reunification through negotiations, then the
Chinese government will only be forced to adopt all drastic
measures possible, including the use of force, to safeguard China'
s sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfill the great
cause of reunification."
</P>
<P>
The paper accused separatist forces in Taiwan of being bent on
violating the One-China Principle.
</P>
<P>
"Since the early 1990s, Lee Teng-hui has gradually deviated
from the One-China Principle, trumpeting 'two governments,' 'two
reciprocal political entities,' 'Taiwan is already a state with
independent sovereignty,' and 'At the present stage the Republic
of China is on Taiwan and the People's Republic of China is on
the mainland'", said the paper.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, he went back on his words, saying that 'I have never
said that there is only one China.' In addition, he has connived
at and provided support for the separatists who advocate 'Taiwan
independence' and their activities, thus helping the rapid
development of the 'Taiwan independence' forces and the spread of
the 'Taiwan independence' ideology. Under the direction of Lee
Teng-hui, the Taiwan authorities have adopted a series of measures
toward actual separation."

<HEADLINE> Two Sides of Straits not Two Countries: White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese territory and
sovereignty has not been split, and the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits are not two states, according to the White Paper on the
One-China principle and the Taiwan Issue.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper was released today by the Taiwan Affairs Office
and the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Taiwan authorities support their
position on "two Chinas," including the "two states" theory
proposed by Lee Teng-hui, with the following arguments: Since 1949,
the territories on either side of the Straits have been divided
and governed separately, with neither side having jurisdiction
over the other; the government of the PRC has never ruled Taiwan;
and since 1991 Taiwan has witnessed a form of government that has
nothing to do with that of the China mainland.
</P>
<P>
These arguments are absolutely untenable, and can never lead to
the conclusion that Taiwan may declare itself a state under the
name of the "Republic of China," or that the two sides of the
Straits have been divided into two states.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, state sovereignty is inseparable. The territory is the
space in which a state exercises its sovereignty. In the territory
of a country there can only be a central government exercising
sovereignty on behalf of the state. Although the two sides of the
Straits have not been reunified, Taiwan's status as a part of
Chinese territory has never changed, neither, therefore, has China
's sovereignty over Taiwan ever changed.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the international community recognizes that there is
only one China, that Taiwan is a part of China, and that the
government of the PRC is the sole legal government of China.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the reason that the Taiwan question has not been
settled for such a long period of time is mainly due to the
intervention of foreign forces and the obstruction of the
separatist forces in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that although the two sides of the
Straits remain to be reunified, the long-term existence of this
abnormal situation has not imbued Taiwan with a status and rights
in international law, nor can it change the legal status of Taiwan
as a part of China. The problem now is that the separatists in
Taiwan and some foreign anti-China forces seek to change this
state of affairs, and it is this that the Chinese government and
people are firmly against.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The One-China Principle has
been evolved in the course of the Chinese people's just struggle
to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and
its basis, both de facto and de jure, is unshakable, said a White
Paper issued Monday by the Taiwan Affairs Office and the
Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
According to the White Paper titled The One-China Principle and
the Taiwan Issue, all the facts and laws about Taiwan prove that
Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
In April 1895, through a war of aggression against China, Japan
forced the Qing government to sign the unequal Treaty of
Shimonoseki, and forcibly occupied Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In July 1937, Japan launched an all-out war of aggression
against China.
</P>
<P>
In December 1941, the Chinese government issued the
Proclamation of China's Declaration of War Against Japan,
announcing to the world that all treaties, agreements and
contracts concerning Sino-Japanese relations, including the Treaty
of Shimonoseki, had been abrogated, and that China would recover
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In August 1945, Japan declared surrender. On October 25, 1945,
the Chinese government recovered Taiwan and the Penghu Archipelago,
resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, 1949, the Central People's Government of the PRC
was proclaimed, replacing the government of the Republic of China
to become the only legal government of the whole of China and its
sole legal representative in the international arena, thereby
bringing the historical status of the Republic of China to an end.

<HEADLINE> China Firmly Opposes Changing Taiwan's Status by Referendum: White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
stressed here today that China firmly opposes changing Taiwan's
status as a part of China by referendum.
</P>
<P>
This is stated in a white paper entitled "The One-China
Principle and the Taiwan Issue", which was issued today by the
Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and the Information
Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan separatists' attempt to change Taiwan's status as a
part of China by referendum on the pretext that "sovereignty
belongs to the people" is futile, said the White Paper.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, under both domestic and international laws, Taiwan's
legal status as a part of Chinese territory is unequivocal, and
there can be no premise for using referendum to decide any matter
of self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the phrase "sovereignty belongs to the people"
refers to all the people of a state, and not certain people or the
people of a certain area. The sovereignty over Taiwan belongs to
all the Chinese people including Taiwan compatriots, and not to
some of the people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, at no time in history has Taiwan been a state in its
own right, and since 1945 Taiwan has not been a foreign colony,
nor has it been under foreign occupation. The issue of national
self-determination, therefore, does not exist.
</P>
<P>
In short, from the time that China recovered Taiwan in 1945,
there has been no question at all of changing Taiwan's status as a
part of China by holding a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The only future for Taiwan is reunification with the Chinese
mainland and certainly not separation, reiterated the White Paper.
Any attempt to separate Taiwan from China through the so-called
referendum would only lead the Taiwan people to disaster.

<HEADLINE> Any Question Can be Discussed Under One-China Principle: White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
stressed here today that any question can be discussed under the
One-China Principle.
</P>
<P>
This is stated in a white paper entitled "The One-China
Principle and the Taiwan Issue", released today by the Taiwan
Affairs Office of the State Council and the Information Office of
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government advocates that the final purpose of
cross-Straits negotiations is to achieve peaceful reunification;
and to this end, talks should be held on the basis of the One-
China Principle.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposals for "Taiwan independence," "two Chinas"
and "two states," aiming at separation instead of reunification,
violate the One-China Principle, and are naturally unacceptable to
the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Provided that it is within the framework of one China, said the
White Paper, any question can be discussed, including the various
issues that are of concern to the Taiwan side.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government believes that Taiwan's international
space for economic, cultural and social activities compatible with
its status, the political status of the Taiwan authorities and
other questions can be finally settled in the process of peaceful
reunification through political negotiations within this framework.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper also said that the so-called controversy about
democracy and system is an excuse for obstructing the
reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly declared
that "democratization on the Chinese mainland is the key to the
reunification of China" and that "the real essence of the cross-
Straits issue is a contest between systems." This is an excuse for
delaying and resisting reunification, as well as a scheme to
deceive compatriots in Taiwan and world opinion.
</P>
<P>
To achieve peaceful reunification in the form of "one country,
two systems," and to allow the two different social systems on
both sides of the Straits to coexist without imposing them on one
or the other -- this is best able to embody the wishes of
compatriots on both sides of the Straits and is itself democratic.
The different social systems across the Straits, therefore, should
not constitute any barrier to peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
The essence of the difference between the two sides of the
Straits on this question lies by no means in the controversy over
whether to practice democracy or in the controversy over what
system to practice, but rather a controversy over the choice
between reunification and separation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Affairs Office and
the Information Office of the State Council Monday issued a White
Paper, pointing out the One-China Principle is the basis and
prerequisite for achieving peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
According to the White Paper on the One-China Principle and the
Taiwan Issue, the One-China Principle is the foundation stone for
the Chinese government's policy on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On Deng Xiaoping's initiative, the Chinese government has,
since 1979, adopted the policy of peaceful reunification and
gradually evolved the scientific concept of "one country, two
systems." On this basis, China established the basic principle of
"peaceful reunification, and one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
The basic principle and the relevant policies embody the basic
stand and spirit of adhering to the One-China Principle, and fully
respect Taiwan compatriots' wish to govern and administer Taiwan
by themselves, the White Paper said.
</P>
<P>
On May 1, 1995, President Jiang Zemin put forward eight
propositions on the development of relations between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits and the promotion of peaceful reunification
of China, explicitly pointing out: "Adhering to the One-China
Principle is the basis and prerequisite for peaceful reunification.
"
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said, only by adhering to the One-China
Principle can peaceful reunification be achieved.

<P>
The Taiwan issue is one left over by the Chinese civil war. As
yet, the state of hostility between the two sides of the Straits
has not formally ended, it said.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and
realize the reunification of the two sides of the Straits, the
Chinese government has the right to resort to any necessary means,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful means would be favorable to the common development of
the societies on both sides of the Straits, and to the harmony and
unity of the compatriots across the Straits. Peaceful means is
therefore the best means, the White Paper said.
</P>
<P>
While carrying out the policy of peaceful reunification, the
Chinese government always makes it clear that the means used to
solve the Taiwan issue is a matter of China's internal affairs,
and China is under no obligation to commit itself to rule out the
use of force, it added.
</P>
<P>
As for Taiwan, upholding the principle of one China indicates
that it acknowledges that China's sovereignty and territory are
inalienable. In this way, both sides of the Taiwan Straits will
have a common basis and premise and may find ways to solve their
political differences and realize peaceful reunification through
consultation on an equal footing, the White Paper said.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan denies the One-China Principle and tries to separate
Taiwan from the territory of China, the premise and basis for
peaceful reunification will cease to exist, it said.

<P>
As for the United States, if it promises to follow a one-China
policy, it should earnestly implement the three communiques
between the Chinese and U.S. governments and fulfill the series of
promises it has made. It should maintain only cultural, commercial
and other non-governmental relations with Taiwan; oppose "Taiwan
independence," "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and not to
stand in the way of the reunification of China. Acting otherwise
will destroy the external conditions necessary for the Chinese
government to strive for peaceful reunification, the White Paper
said.
</P>
<P>
As for countries in the Asia-Pacific region and other regions
in the world, adherence to the policy of one China by countries
concerned will be beneficial to peace and stability in the Asia-
Pacific region and favorable for China to develop friendly
relations with other countries, and therefore conforms to the
interests of the Asia-Pacific region and other countries in the
world, it added.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper pointed out that to achieve peaceful
reunification, the Chinese government has appealed time and again
for cross-Straits negotiations on the basis of equality and the
One-China Principle.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has put forward one proposal after
another, such as that the negotiations should be held between the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese KMT on a reciprocal
basis and that the talks between the two parties may include
representatives from all parties and mass organizations of Taiwan,
and we have never spoken of negotiations between the "central and
local authorities."

The Chinese government has also proposed that dialogues may
start first, including political dialogues, which may gradually
move on to procedural consultations for political talks to solve
the name, the topics for discussion and the forms of official
talks before political talks are held, the White Paper said.
</P>
<P>
To strive for peaceful reunification, the Chinese government
has adopted a series of positive policies and measures to promote
the comprehensive development of cross-Straits relations, it said.
</P>
<P>
To properly solve the concrete issues arising from the people-
to-people contacts between the two sides through consultations, in
November 1992 the mainland's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation reached
the common understanding during talks on routine affairs that each
of the two organizations should express verbally that "both sides
of the Taiwan Straits adhere to the One-China Principle." On this
basis, the leaders of these two organizations successfully held
the "Wang Daohan-Koo Chen-fu talks" and signed several agreements
on protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the
compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits in April 1993. In
October 1998, the leaders of the two organizations met in Shanghai,
starting political dialogue across the Straits. The talks between
the two organizations were carried out on an equal footing.
Practice has proved that on the basis of the One-China Principle,
it is entirely possible to find a proper way for holding talks,
based on equality, between the two sides, the White Paper stressed.

BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of the white paper entitled "The One-China Principle and the
Taiwan Issue", which was released by the Taiwan Affairs Office and
the Information Office of the State Council:
</P>
<P>
 Foreword
</P>
<P>
On October 1, 1949, the Chinese people won a great victory in
the new democratic revolution and founded the People's Republic of
China (PRC). The Kuomintang (KMT) ruling clique retreated from the
mainland to entrench in China's Taiwan Province in confrontation
with the Central Government with the support of foreign forces.
This is the origin of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Settlement of the Taiwan issue and realization of the complete
reunification of China embodies the fundamental interests of the
Chinese nation. The Chinese government has worked persistently
toward this goal in the past 50 years. From 1979, the Chinese
government has striven for the peaceful reunification of China in
the form of "one country, two systems" with the greatest sincerity
and the utmost effort. Economic and cultural exchanges and people-
to-people contacts between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits
have made rapid progress since the end of 1987. Unfortunately,
from the 1990s, Lee Teng-hui, the leader of the Taiwan authorities,
has progressively betrayed the One-China Principle, striving to
promote a separatist policy with "two Chinas" at the core, going
so far as to openly describe the cross-Straits relations as "state
to state relations, or at least special state to state relations."
This action has seriously damaged the basis for peaceful
reunification of the two sides, harmed the fundamental interests
of the entire Chinese nation including the Taiwan compatriots, and
jeopardized peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. The
Chinese government has consistently adhered to the One-China
Principle and resolutely opposed any attempt to separate Taiwan
from China. The struggle between the Chinese government and the
separatist forces headed by Lee Teng-hui finds its concentrated
expression in the question of whether to persevere in the One-
China Principle or to create "two Chinas" or "One-China, one
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
In August 1993, we issued a white paper entitled "The Taiwan
Question and Reunification of China," which systematically
expounds the fact concerning Taiwan as an inalienable part of
China, the origin of the Taiwan issue and the Chinese governments
basic principles and related policies regarding resolution of the
Taiwan question. We deem it necessary here to further explain to
the international community the Chinese government's position and
policy on the One-China Principle.

<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- China issued today a white
paper titled "The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue".
</P>
<P>
The 11,000-word white paper, released by the Taiwan Affairs
Office and the Information Office of the State Council, is
composed of five parts. The excerpts of the white paper go as
follows:
</P>
<P>
 The settlement of the Taiwan issue and realization of the
complete reunification of China embodies the fundamental interests
of the Chinese nation. The Chinese government has worked
persistently toward this goal in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, however, since the 1990s, Lee Teng-hui, the
leader of the Taiwan authorities, has progressively betrayed the
One-China Principle, striving to promote a separatist policy with
"two Chinas" at the core, going so far as to openly describe the
cross-Straits relations as "state to state relations, or at least
special state to state relations." This action has seriously
damaged the basis for peaceful reunification of the two sides,
harmed the fundamental interests of the entire Chinese nation
including the Taiwan compatriots, and jeopardized peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region. The Chinese government has
consistently adhered to the One-China Principle and resolutely
opposed any attempt to separate Taiwan from China. The struggle
between the Chinese government and the separatist forces headed by
Lee Teng-hui finds its concentrated expression in the question of
whether to persevere in the One-China Principle or to create "two
Chinas" or "One-China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, it is necessary to further expound the Chinese
government's position and policy on the One-China Principle.
</P>
<P>
 The first part of the white paper, "The Basis for One
China, de Facto and de Jure", points out that the One-China
Principle has been evolved in the course of the Chinese people's
just struggle to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and its basis, both de facto and de jure, is unshakable.
</P>
<P>
All the facts and laws about Taiwan prove that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of Chinese territory. On October 1, 1949, the
Central People's Government of the PRC was proclaimed, replacing
the government of the Republic of China to become the only
legitimate government of the whole of China and its sole legal
representative in the international arena, thereby bringing the
historical status of the Republic of China to an end. This is a
replacement of the old regime by a new one in a situation where
the main bodies of the same international laws have not changed
and China's sovereignty and inherent territory have not changed
therefrom, and so the government of the PRC naturally should fully
enjoy and exercise China's sovereignty, including its sovereignty
over Taiwan.

<P>
Since the KMT ruling clique retreated to Taiwan, although
its regime has continued to use the designations "Republic of
China" and "government of the Republic of China," it has long
since completely forfeited its right to exercise state sovereignty
on behalf of China and, in reality, has always remained only a
local authority in Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
On the day of its founding, the Central People's Government
of the PRC declared to governments of all countries in the world,
"This government is the sole legal government representing the
entire people of the People's Republic of China. It is ready to
establish diplomatic relations with all foreign governments that
are willing to abide by the principles of equality, mutual benefit
and mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and
sovereignty." One principle governing New China's establishment of
diplomatic relations with a foreign country is that it recognizes
the government of the PRC as the sole legitimate government
representing the whole of China, severs or refrain from
establishing diplomatic relations with the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government insists that there is only one China
in the world, Taiwan is a part of China and the government of the
PRC is the sole legal government representing the whole of China.
China has evolved the One-China Principle precisely in the course
of the endeavor to develop normal diplomatic relations with other
countries and the struggle to safeguard state sovereignty and
territorial integrity. The above propositions constitute the basic
meaning of the One-China Principle, the crucial point being to
safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's solemn and reasonable stand for the
One-China Principle has gained the understanding and support of
more and more countries and international organizations, and the
One-China Principle has been gradually accepted by the
international community at large. Up to now, 161 countries have
established diplomatic relations with the PRC; they all
acknowledge the One-China Principle and promise to handle their
relations with Taiwan within the one-China framework.

<P>
The second part of the white paper, "The One-China Principle--
the Basis and Prerequisite for Achieving Peaceful Reunification",
points out that the Chinese government has, since 1979, adopted
the policy of peaceful reunification and gradually evolved the
scientific concept of "one country, two systems". On this basis,
China established the basic principle of "peaceful reunification,
and one country, two systems". This basic principle and the
relevant policies embody the basic stand and spirit of adhering to
the One-China Principle, and fully respect Taiwan compatriots'
wish to govern and administer Taiwan by themselves. On May 1, 1995,
President Jiang Zemin put forward eight propositions on the
development of relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits and the promotion of peaceful reunification of China,
explicitly pointing out: "Adhering to the One-China Principle is
the basis and prerequisite for peaceful reunification."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is one left over by the Chinese civil war.
As yet, the state of hostility between the two sides of the
Straits has not formally ended. To safeguard China's sovereignty
and territorial integrity and realize the reunification of the two
sides of the Straits, the Chinese government has the right to
resort to any necessary means. Peaceful means would be favorable
to the common development of the societies on both sides of the
Straits, and to the harmony and unity of the compatriots across
the Straits. Peaceful means is therefore the best means. The
Chinese government's declaration in 1979 on implementing the
principle of peaceful reunification was based on the premise that
the Taiwan authorities at that time upheld the principle that
there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of China.
Meanwhile, the Chinese government took into account the fact that
the U.S. government, which for many years had supported the Taiwan
authorities, had accepted that there is only one China in the
world, Taiwan is a part of China and the government of the PRC is
the only legal government of China, and saw this acknowledgment as
being beneficial to the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue.
While carrying out the policy of peaceful reunification, the
Chinese government always makes it clear that the means used to
solve the Taiwan issue is a matter of China's internal affairs,
and China is under no obligation to commit itself to rule out the
use of force. This is by no means directed against Taiwan
compatriots, but against the scheme to create an "independent
Taiwan" and against the foreign forces interfering with the
reunification of China, and is intended as a necessary safeguard
for the striving for peaceful reunification. Resort to force would
only be the last choice made under compelled circumstances.

<HEADLINE> China Releases White Paper on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- China released a white paper
on the issue of Taiwan here today, detailing its position on the "
one-China" principle as well as the stand the international
community should take on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The 11,000-word white paper, titled "The One-China Principle
and the Taiwan Issue," is composed of five parts, a foreword and a
conclusion and was issued by the Taiwan Affairs Office and the
Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The basis for "one-China," in principle and according to law,
constitutes the first part of the white paper, which relates how
the policy was formulated, its basic meaning, and the fact that
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
The second part dwells on the one-China principle -- the
prerequisite for achieving peaceful reunification in the country.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that the one-China principle is the cornerstone of
the Chinese government's policy on Taiwan, that only by adhering
to the one-China principle can peaceful reunification be achieved,
and that the Chinese government is actively striving for peaceful
reunification.
</P>
<P>
The paper notes in its third part that the Chinese Government
is the staunch advocate of the one-China principle and that
separatist forces in Taiwan are bent on violating the one-China
policy.
</P>
<P>
The fourth part deals with several questions involving the one-
China principle in the cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly oppose changing Taiwan's status as a part of China
by referendum," it said, adding that the "two German states
formula"cannot be applied to the settlement of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
In its fifth part, the paper expounds on several issues
involving the international community's adherence to the one-China
principle.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is not eligible for membership in the United Nations
and other international organizations whose membership is confined
to sovereign states, it stresses.
</P>
<P>
This white paper is the second issued by the Chinese
government on the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In August, 1993, a white paper titled "The Taiwan Question and
Reunification of China" was released by the Taiwan Affairs Office
and the Information Office of the State Council.

To strive for peaceful reunification, the Chinese government
has adopted a series of positive policies and measures to promote
the comprehensive development of cross-Straits relations. In
November 1992 the mainland's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation reached
the common understanding during talks on routine affairs that each
of the two organizations should express verbally that "both sides
of the Taiwan Straits adhere to the One-China Principle." On this
basis, the leaders of these two organizations successfully held
the "Wang Daohan-Koo Chen-fu talks" and signed several
agreements on protecting the legitimate rights and interests of
the compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits in April 1993.
In October 1998, the leaders of the two organizations met in
Shanghai, starting political dialogue across the Straits. The
talks between the two organizations were carried out on an equal
footing. Practice has proved that on the basis of the One-China
Principle, it is entirely possible to find a proper way for
holding talks, based on equality, between the two sides.

The third part of the white paper, "The Chinese Government--
Staunch Advocate for the One-China Principle", points out that
since the early 1990s, Lee Teng-hui has gradually deviated from
the One-China Principle and, in addition, he has connived at and
provided support for the separatists who advocate "Taiwan
independence" and their activities, thus helping the rapid
development of the "Taiwan independence" forces and the spread
of the "Taiwan independence" ideology. Under the direction of
Lee Teng-hui, the Taiwan authorities have adopted a series of
measures toward actual separation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1999, Lee Teng-hui has stepped up his separatist
activities. In May, he published the book The Road to Democracy,
which advocates the division of China into seven regions, each
enjoying "full autonomy." On July 9, he went so far as to
publicly distort the inter-Straits relations as "state to state
relations, or at least special state to state relations," in an
attempt to fundamentally change the status of Taiwan as a part of
China, sabotage the relations between both sides of the Taiwan
Straits, especially the basis for cross-Straits political
dialogues and negotiations, and wreck the foundation for peaceful
reunification. Lee Teng-hui has become the general representative
of Taiwan's separatist forces, a saboteur of the stability of the
Taiwan Straits, a stumbling-block preventing the development of
relations between China and the United States, and a troublemaker
for the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people have always maintained
sharp vigilance and fought resolutely against the secessionist
activities of the Taiwan separatists, represented by Lee Teng-hui.

<P>
After Lee Teng-hui's "private" visit to the United States in
June 1995, the Chinese government has waged a resolute struggle
against separation and against "Taiwan independence", and made
strong protests and representations to the U.S. government for
openly allowing Lee Teng-hui to visit the U.S., violating its
promises made in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, and
seriously prejudicing China's sovereignty. This struggle has shown
the Chinese government and people's firm resolve and ability to
safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity, and exerted
an important and far-reaching influence. Compatriots in Taiwan
have further realized the serious harm "Taiwan independence" can
cause. Lee Teng-hui has received a heavy blow for his separatist
activities in the international community, so that some of the "
Taiwan independence" protagonists have had to abandon certain
extremist propositions aimed at division. The international
community has further realized the necessity of upholding a one-
China policy. The U.S. government has explicitly undertaken not to
support "Taiwan independence", not to support "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan", and not to support Taiwan joining any
international organization whose membership is restricted to
sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people have fought more
unremittingly after Lee Teng-hui cooked up his "two states" theory.
The relevant department of the Chinese government has clearly
stated that the attempt of the Taiwan separatists to implement the
"two states" theory in "legal" form was an even more serious and
dangerous step toward division and a grave provocation against
peaceful reunification. Were the attempt to succeed, it would be
impossible for China to achieve peaceful reunification. The
struggle against this attempt has grown in momentum with Chinese
both at home and abroad condemning the "two states" theory with
one voice. Most countries in the world have reaffirmed their
position of upholding the One-China Policy. The U.S. government
has also reasserted its adherence to the One-China Policy and its
commitment to the "Three Non-supports" for Taiwan. Finally, the
Taiwan authorities have been compelled to announce that they will
not amend their "constitution" and "laws" according to the "two
states" theory.
</P>
<P>
 To safeguard the interests of the entire Chinese people
including compatriots in Taiwan and maintain the peace and
development of the Asia-Pacific region, the Chinese government
remains firm in adhering to "peaceful reunification" and "one
country, two systems"; upholding the eight propositions put
forward by President Jiang Zemin for the development of cross-
Straits relations and the acceleration of the peaceful
reunification of China; and doing its utmost to achieve the
objective of peaceful reunification. However, if a grave turn of
events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in
any name, or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign
countries, or if the Taiwan authorities refuse, sine die, the
peaceful settlement of cross-Straits reunification through
negotiations, then the Chinese government will only be forced to
adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of force,
to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and
fulfil the great cause of reunification.

<P>
The fourth part of the white paper, "Several Questions
Involving the One-China Principle in the Cross-Straits Relations",
points out that Chinese territory and sovereignty has not been
split, and the two sides of the Straits are not two states.
Firstly, state sovereignty is inseparable. The territory is the
space in which a state exercises its sovereignty. In the territory
of a country there can only be a central government exercising
sovereignty on behalf of the state. As we have already said,
Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory and, after
replacing the government of the Republic of China in 1949, the
government of the PRC has become the sole legal government of
China, enjoying and exercising sovereignty over the whole of China,
including Taiwan. Although the two sides of the Straits have not
been reunified, Taiwan's status as a part of Chinese territory has
never changed, neither, therefore, has China's sovereignty over
Taiwan ever changed. Secondly, the international community
recognizes that there is only one China, that Taiwan is a part of
China, and that the government of the PRC is the sole legal
government of China. Thirdly, the reason that the Taiwan question
has not been settled for such a long period of time is mainly due
to the intervention of foreign forces and the obstruction of the
separatist forces in Taiwan. Although the two sides of the Straits
remain to be reunified, the long-term existence of this abnormal
situation has not imbued Taiwan with a status and rights in
international law, nor can it change the legal status of Taiwan as
a part of China.
</P>
<P>
The white paper goes on to stress that the Chinese
government firmly opposes changing Taiwan's status as a part of
China by referendum. Firstly, under both domestic and
international laws Taiwan's legal status as a part of Chinese
territory is unequivocal, and there can be no premise for using
referendum to decide any matter of self-determination. Secondly,
the phrase "sovereignty belongs to the people" refers to all the
people of a state, and not certain people or the people of a
certain area. The sovereignty over Taiwan belongs to all the
Chinese people including Taiwan compatriots, and not to some of
the people in Taiwan. Thirdly, at no time in history has Taiwan
been a state in its own right, and since 1945 Taiwan has not been
a foreign colony, nor has it been under foreign occupation. The
issue of national self-determination, therefore, does not exist.
In short, from the time that China recovered Taiwan in 1945, there
has been no question at all of changing Taiwan's status as a part
of China by holding a referendum. The only future for Taiwan is
reunification with the China mainland, and certainly not
separation. Any attempt to separate Taiwan from China through so-
called referendum would only lead the Taiwan people to disaster.

<P>
The "two German states formula" cannot be applied to the
settlement of the Taiwan issue. The division of Germany after the
war and the temporary division between the two sides of the
Straits are questions of a different nature, the difference lying
mainly in three aspects. The first is the reasons for, and the
nature of, the division. Obviously, the German question arose
entirely from external factors, while the Taiwan issue, left over
by China's civil war, is a matter of China's internal affairs. The
second aspect is the difference in status between the two under
international law. Germany was divided according to a series of
international treaties during and after the Second World War,
while the Taiwan question involves provisions of the Cairo
Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation and other international
treaties, stating that Japan must return Taiwan, which it had
stolen from China, to the Chinese. The third is the difference
between the two in their actual conditions of existence. Against
the backdrop of the confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet
Union, the two German states had foreign troops stationing in
their territories and so were compelled to recognize each other
and co-exist in the international community. The Chinese
government has always persisted in the principle of one China.
Before Lee Teng-hui assumed power, and during his early days in
office, the Taiwan authorities recognized only one China and
opposed "two Chinas," and the One-China Principle has also been
widely accepted by the international community. For these reasons,
the Taiwan issue and the German issue cannot be placed in the same
category, nor can the "two German states formula" be copied to
settle the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Any question can be discussed under the One-China Principle.
The Chinese government advocates that the final purpose of cross-
Straits negotiations is to achieve peaceful reunification; and
that to achieve this purpose, talks should be held based on the
principle of one China. Provided that it is within the framework
of one China, any question can be discussed, including the various
issues that are of concern to the Taiwan side. The Chinese
government believes that Taiwan's international space for
economic, cultural and social activities compatible with its
status, the political status of the Taiwan authorities and other
questions can be finally settled in the process of peaceful
reunification through political negotiations within this framework.
</P>
<P>
The so-called controversy about democracy and system is an
excuse for obstructing the reunification of China. To achieve
peaceful reunification in the form of "one country, two systems,"
and to allow the two different social systems on both sides of the
Straits to coexist without imposing them on one or the other--this
is best able to embody the wishes of compatriots on both sides of
the Straits and is itself democratic. The different social systems
across the Straits, therefore, should not constitute any barrier
to peaceful reunification. Moreover, the Chinese government
acknowledges the differences between Taiwan on the one hand and
Hong Kong and Macao on the other and, after peaceful reunification,
is prepared to apply a looser form of the "one country, two
systems" policy in Taiwan than in Hong Kong and Macao. The
essence of the difference between the two sides of the Straits on
this question lies by no means in the controversy over whether to
practice democracy or in the controversy over what system to
practice, but rather a controversy over the choice between
reunification and separation.

<HEADLINE> Anwar's Sodomy Trial Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The High Court here
Monday postponed the ongoing sodomy trial of former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim on defense request to March 6 to give the
defense time to prepare its arguments for the relevancy of calling
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to give evidence.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's leading defense counsel Christopher Fernando made an
application for a postponement of the ongoing case, saying the
defence needs time to prepare an affidavit to state the relevance
of Mahathir's testimony.
</P>
<P>
Fernando told the court that the defence was also preoccupied
with preparations for Anwar's appeal on his corruption case which
is to be heard by the Appeals Court on February 28.
</P>
<P>
High Court Judge Arifin Jaka allowed the application to which
Senior Deputy Public Prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail did not object.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir had been subpoenaed to testify in the Anwar sodomy
trial but the court has yet to rule on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"To be fair to both parties, I will postpone the case to March
6,"Arifin said.

Anwar, 52, and his adopted brother Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat
Madja,39, are charged with sodomizing Azizan Abu Bakar, 39, the
former driver of Anwar's wife.
</P>
<P>
Sukma had applied to the court in October last year to subpoena
Mahathir to appear as his witness in his personal capacity and on
February 16, Anwar also applied to call the Prime Minister as his
witness. But the court on the prosecution's appeal ordered the
defence to state the relevancy of Mahathir's testimony.
</P>
<P>
Arifin said the court would fix another date to hear the case
if the appeal for stating the relevancy is not settled before
March 6 and reminded both parties to inform the court on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sentenced by the High Court to six years' jail on
April 14 last year on each of four charges of corrupt practice,
but the court ruled the sentences run concurrently beginning on
that day.
</P>
<P>
Anwar filed the petition of appeal on May 22 last year which
contained 29 grounds.

<HEADLINE> MILF Postpones Talks with Philippine Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) said Monday that it has postponed the
second round of formal talks with the Philippine government,
saying it has to assess the direction of the negotiations with the
latter.
</P>
<P>
This came after four days of clashes last week between the
government and the MILF in the Southern Philippines which left 89
people dead and dozens of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
MILF spokesman Mohaqher Iqbal said in a statement that the MILF
postponed the talks because of military attacks on a strategic
MILF base in Maguindanao province, adding that he does not know
yet when the talks would resume.
</P>
<P>
Formal peace negotiations were opened this year and the second
round of talks were supposed to take place in Cotabato City Monday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting erupted in amid a ceasefire and the ongoing
peace talks between the government and the MILF, which has been
fighting for an independence state in Mindanao during the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Before the fighting, government troops accused the MILF of
harassment, particularly probing attacks on their army detachments.
But government troops launched a counter-offensive last Tuesday to
stop the harassment.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF also launched two major offensives in
last January and September, which were both frustrated by
government troops, forcing the MILF to sign a ceasefire agreement
with the government.

<P>
DHAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Monday observes
International Mother Language Day, paying homage to the martyrs of
the historic Language Movement of 1952 who sacrificed their lives
to uphold the glory of their mother tongue Bangla.
</P>
<P>
President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina placed wreaths at the Central Shaheed Minar, the altar of
the martyrs' monument at zero hour. Floral wreaths were also
placed by different foreign missions and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
National flags were hoisted half-mast at all government and
private buildings and Bangladesh Missions abroad as a mark of
respect to the language martyrs on this public holiday.
</P>
<P>
On this day 48 years ago, four valiant sons of Bangladesh laid
down their lives on the streets of Dhaka, to make Bangla one of
the state languages of the erstwhile Pakistan. The Language
Movement eventually led to the freedom struggle.
</P>
<P>
The Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization of the
United Nations proclaimed February 21 as International Mother
Language Day on November 17, 1999, glorifying the Bengalis' fight
for the right to express themselves in their mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan Sunday conveyed his
greetings on the occasion of the launch of the first International
Mother Language Day with a call for upholding the diversity of all

<HEADLINE> Nepal, Bhutan to Continue Talks on Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and Bhutan will hold
another round of secretary-level talks on the issue of Bhutanese
refugees early next month in Kathmandu, the Rising Nepal reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The talks on the refugee issue that ended last week in Thimpu,
capital of Bhutan, decided to hold another round of secretary-
level talks as Bhutan demanded time to discuss the different
aspects of the refugee-verification process, the English daily
quoted a Foreign Ministry official back from the dialogue as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The further discussion to be held in Kathmandu will take place
on modalities, terms of reference composition and pro-forma of the
verification process of the refugees," said Foreign Secretary
Murari Raj Sharma, who headed the Nepalese delegation to Thimpu on
February 14 for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks on the issue held in Thimpu had focused on four
papers confined to technical component of the verification process,
which will divide the refugees into four categories -- bonafide
Bhutanese citizens, Bhutanese who have emigrated, Bhutanese who
have committed crimes and non Bhutanese.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been living in eastern
Nepal since they were evicted in the 1990's. Bhutan had agreed
only to take back refugees of the first category, but the Nepali
side did not accept the stand.
</P>
<P>
Eight rounds of ministerial talks between the two Himalayan
kingdoms have so far failed to reach any agreement on the refugee
issue.

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Transition to U.N. Control Going Well: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan said Monday the transition to the U.N. control
was going well in East Timor, where he visited last week.
</P>
<P>
"We have again achieved an incredible seamless transition from
the Australian-led Interfet (International Force in East Timor) to
UNTAET (U.N. Transitional Authority in East Timor)," Annan told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after his talks with Australian
Prime Minister John Howard, Annan said East Timor would need the
continued help of Australia and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"With a bit of help and sustained effort I think East Timor can
make a go of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he and Howard agreed that crises like those in East
Timor made it essential that the U.N. be able to deploy forces
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of U.N. member nations had proposed a rapid
response scheme where each raises a high-readiness brigade which
could be contributed to future operations.
</P>
<P>
"That high readiness brigade will be essential for future U.N.
operations but we did not get into the development of a standing U.
N. army as such," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard praised the U.N. for its action over East Timor and said
his talks with Annan focused on events in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations performed with very great skill and great
distinction," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He said he and Annan also discussed the transition of East
Timor from the U.N. control to independence.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly discussed the desirability of a measured orderly
transfer. We both agree it should not be time specific," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said meeting Howard for the first time was like catching
up with an old friend after the time spent in telephone
conversations over East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"It was as if we had known each other for a long time because
we spent so much time on the phone and when we met today it was
like old friends coming together," Annan told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Liberalize Financial Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
soon to introduce new measures to further liberalize its financial
sector in a bid to woo much-needed foreign investment, the
official Daily News said Monday.
</P>
<P>
There will be relaxation of restrictions for foreign equity
holdings in banking and insurance, permitting foreigners to hold
100 percent stakes in stock broking firms and activating
investments in unit trusts, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Foreign equity holdings in banking and insurance will be
further eased by allowing foreign ownership up to 60 percent in
banking institutions and 90 percent in insurance, subject to
standard regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>
However, permission is restricted only to companies which have
a credible international reputation and are regulated in the
country of registration with a proven record of successful trading
and good turnover.
</P>
<P>
Those companies will also be required to indicate their
willingness to transfer skills and technology that would enhance
customer-oriented services.
</P>
<P>
To activate investment in unit trusts, nonresidents will be
permitted in units of equity-growth unit trusts where the relevant
trust deeds do not permit more than 20 percent investment in
government securities, the report added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ecologist Warns of Adverse Side of Green Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. ecologist warned
here Sunday of the danger of decreasing species diversity and more
catastrophes like the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The warning was sounded by David Tilman, a University of
Minnesota ecologist, as other nations continue to adopt the U.S.
style of agriculture, and the growing global food demand is
expected to triple the use of nitrogen fertilizers by 2050.
</P>
<P>
"In the last 35 years, global food production doubled, but
required seven times more nitrogen," Tilman said. "We're assuming
efficiencies in agriculture will continue to increase. If so, the
most optimistic scenario is we'll still need three times more
nitrogen to produce enough food for the population in 2050."
</P>
<P>
In the future, the increase in worldwide nitrogen depositions
will lead to significant loss of terrestrial plant diversity,
Tilman told the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS) held from February 17 to 22.
</P>
<P>
He likened the role of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems to
the role of phosphorus on lakes and rivers: As the nutrient is
added, certain species thrive, others die off, and the entire
ecosystem becomes less diverse and stable.
</P>
<P>
To combat the problem, Tilman said more efficient ways of using
nitrogen in agriculture must be found. Timing the application of
nitrogen in accordance with crops' needs could cut nitrogen use.
So could planting crops that use nitrogen more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
"The Green Revolution basically used cheap nitrogen to increase
food production," said Tilman. "Decreasing world hunger was a
wonderful achievement, but now we must find ways to prevent
potentially massive environmental damage caused by the escalating
use of nitrogen fertilizer."
</P>
<P>
Tilman was one of ten scientists who met in May 1999 to
consider the impacts likely to be felt in 2050 as a result of
human activity in such areas as agriculture nitrogen applications,
introduction of exotic species, destruction of natural habitats
and pesticide use.
</P>
<P>
In 18 years of experiments at the University of Minnesota's
Cedar Creek Natural History Area, Tilman and his colleagues have
studied the effects of applying nitrogen to plots of prairie land.
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen applications at a rate equal to what currently comes
in from the atmosphere resulted in a loss of 25 percent of plant
species.

<HEADLINE> Peace Forces Raid Serb Residence in Kosovska Mitrovica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and German peacekeeping
forces in Kosovo burst into residence and schools in the Serb-
dominated north of Kosovska Mitrovica in search of weapons Sunday,
but met protest by stone-hurling Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said dozens of armored vehicles and jeeps
carrying U.S. and German peacekeepers forced their way into a Serb
inhabitation center around 6:00 a.m. local time (0500GMT) and
sealed off the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Spokespersons from the KFOR peacekeeping troops were quoted as
saying the soldiers were also hunting paramilitary criminals in
the search.
</P>
<P>
The fully-armed peace forces crashed into the office buildings,
lecture buildings and dormitory buildings in a technical institute
there as well as the residents' houses nearby, destroying doors,
windows, computers and many other facilities, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
At about 10:30 a.m. (0930GMT), about 2,000 angry Serb residents
hurled stones and snow balls at the intruding forces while the
soldiers counterattacked them with rifle butts.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said more than 10 Serbs were injured in the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
A KFOR spokesman, British Warrant Officer Mark Cox, was quoted
as saying KFOR is prepared to look into the reported excessive use
of force in operations.
</P>
<P>
There is no report yet from KFOR on its latest search of
weapons or criminals.
</P>
<P>
Describing the U.S. and German soldiers' acts as "barbarous,"
Chairman of the Kosovo Interim Executive Committee Zoran
Andjelkovich told the official Tanjug news agency that they were
siding with ethnic Albanian terrorists engaged in ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
The acts were aimed at forcing the Serb residents out of their
home by pressuring them psychologically so as to let the
separatist ethnic Albanians take control of Kosovska Mitrovica,
Andjelkovich noted.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs to Build Investors' Confidence: WB President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting World Bank (WB)
President James Wolfensohn said Indonesia needs to build investors
' confidence in the country so that they would put money here to
help maintain economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"I think you can cautiously say it's an upturn. What is needed
is not economic activities, but the return of confidence on the
social, legal and investment level," Wolfensohn was quoted by
Jakarta Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He warned that confidence in the ongoing recovery process from
the
financial crisis that plunged millions below the poverty line and
left Indonesia's banking system in ruins would depend on many
factors and would probably be slow.
</P>
<P>
Indications of not-yet-returning confidence was the slow pace
of investment activities by small and medium enterprises in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"They (small and medium enterprises) have adequate funding, but
not invested. And investment is not being made because everyone
wants to see where the country is going socially and politically,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to government data, foreign investment approvals for
the whole year of 1999 fell 22 percent to 10.6 billion U.S.
dollars over the previous year as political instability deterred
investors. Foreign investment approvals fell further by 74 percent
in January this year to 95.8 million U.S. dollars over the same
month of last year.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, nevertheless, said that indications show that the
economy is on the move and investment should soon flow in once
uncertainties disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Apart from investment, he said, Indonesian economic recovery
also depends very much on the restructuring of bank and corporate
debts, which has been proceeding quite slowly.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, who arrived here Thursday on his fourth visit to
Indonesia and first in two years, met with various government and
private sector leaders, including President Abdurrahman Wahid and
his economics ministers.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank fully supports the aims of Wahid and
Indonesians to stamp out rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
After spending four days in Indonesia, the World Bank chief
will fly to East Timor on Monday to access the situation in the
former Indonesian province.

<HEADLINE> "Snakeheads" Caught In East China </HEADLINE>

<P>
FUZHOU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Police in east China's Fujian
Province recently captured three men suspected of organizing a
series of illegal border crossings over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Wu Wenfeng, Wu Wenpeng and their nephew Wu Jinhui are fishermen
in Putian County in Fujian. Since 1989, all three had been helping
local people cross the border illegally to emigrate overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to local police, in a failed attempt on April 25,
1999, Wu Wenpeng and Wu Jinhui tried to help 53 local people leave
the country by sea.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province has often been used by "snakeheads",
border crossings organizers who help local people illegally
emigrate to Japan, the United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Local police have intensified their efforts to stop these
activities in recent years.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,500 officials of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and government at various levels in
south China's Guangdong Province have received administrative or
disciplinary punishment for committing economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
They were involved in 4,199 cases, which would cost the state
coffers 456 million yuan. Of the total punished officials, 35 are
bureau chiefs and 307 are division heads, said Wang Huayuan, head
of the provincial Disciplinary Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
A major case had to do with smuggling at Zhanjiang Port, in
which a number of senior officials in Guangdong took bribes.
</P>
<P>
Wang pledged his commission will continue to investigate
violations this year, focusing on law enforcement and economic
management departments as well as the sectors of banking, real
estate and materials purchasing.

<HEADLINE> Poor Traffic Administration, Driving Skills Blamed for Highway Carnage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 83,529 people were
killed and 286,000 people injured in 412,860 traffic accidents in
China in 1999, the "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figures represent a 7-percent increase in deaths, a 28.4-
percent rise in injuries and a 19.3-percent surge in accidents
when compared to 1998 figures, the English-language newspaper said,
quoting a report of the Public Security Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents along expressways increased to 12,634,
resulting in the deaths of 1,687 people, about 19.5 percent and 13.
4 percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Inefficient expressway administration and safety equipment as
well as poor driving skills were blamed for such accidents.
</P>
<P>
Drivers were responsible for 351,881 traffic accidents, 85.2
percent of all such accidents.
</P>
<P>
Accidents were more frequent on highways and in rural areas. In
1999, 256,474 traffic accidents were reported on highways and in
rural areas, killing 51,889 people.
</P>
<P>
Many traffic accidents involved drivers with less than three
years of driving experience, though their proportion in the toll
dropped from the previous year. The decrease was attributed to
tougher examinations during drivers' training.
</P>
<P>
A total of 24,840 people were killed in 156,619 accidents
involving these new drivers.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more Chinese have purchased private cars, and
many more people, though without their own cars, have obtained
drivers' licenses.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of Public Security issued stricter driving license
examination standards in 1996 to ensure drivers' skills.

<HEADLINE> Bus Plays A Key Role in Festival Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Buses were the transportation
of choice for an average 30 million passengers daily during the
Spring Festival period, the "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Between January 21 and February 9, buses carried 689 million
riders to their destinations, an increase of 4 per cent over the
same period last year, said Wang Yingjia, vice-director of the
Road Transportation Department under the Ministry of
Communications.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that despite an increase in passengers, no major
disorders occurred at bus stations, with 750,000 buses nationwide
on the roads.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics indicate that in some regions such as
Guangzhou and Shenzhen, where transient people make up a large
proportion of local labor, special bus lines were operated.
</P>
<P>
Special bus service to Guangzhou increased to 14,910 this
Spring Festival, double the number from last year.
</P>
<P>
The first Spring Festival in the new millennium tempted most
people working away from their homes to visit their families at
home.
</P>
<P>
Ticket price hikes for railway transport and fears about safety
on ships and ferries following a series of major accidents also
helped attract low-income passengers to the road.
</P>
<P>
Wang also said that 158,000 road service staff nationwide had
been working to ensure the smooth operation of buses for about 200
million passengers between February 5 and 11.

<HEADLINE> Campaign to Stop Poaching Saves Wildlife: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A 15-day campaign against
crimes threatening wildlife resources launched last month in China
's southern provinces has ended with "great success", according to
a China Daily report today.
</P>
<P>
To curb poaching and illegal trade in wildlife, the State
Forestry Administration mobilized about 50,000 forestry policemen
in Guangdong, Yunnan and Fujian provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, where illegal activities affecting wildlife are
widespread.
</P>
<P>
By the time the campaign ended on January 29, the police had
investigated 8,370 illegal wildlife fairs and had confiscated more
than 40,000 wild animals, including 10,000 first and second-class
state-protected animals such as tigers, bears and boas.
</P>
<P>
The police also confiscated 1,652 animal skins and about 28
tons of wild animal products.
</P>
<P>
The police detained 3,000 people suspected of wildlife poaching
and trading during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Many people in the southern provinces eat wild animals for
nutritional reasons. As a result, restaurants with wild animals on
their menus were found in many cities and towns in those areas.

<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Denmark's Wilson Kipketer and
Ethiopia's Hailu Mekkonen bettered world indoors records in the
Birmingham indoor athletics meetings on Sunday in Birmingham,
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan-born Kipketer improved his own record of world indoor 1,
000 meters with a time of two minutes 14.96 seconds, beating the
mark of 2:15.25 he set in Stuttgart, Germany, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Mekkonen smashed the 27-year-old world indoor two-mile record,
clocking 8:09.66, nearly four seconds faster than the mark set by
Emile Puttemans of Belgium in 1973.
</P>
<P>
American Maurice Greene stormed home in 6.47 seconds in the 60
meters after three false starts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Play Bigger Role in Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in
Qingdao, a coastal resort in east China's Shandong Province, are
now playing a still bigger role in the city's exports.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that township enterprises generated some
230 million U.S. dollars in exports last year, up 37 percent from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Yu Chong, the city's vice-mayor, attributed the upward trend to
a more diversified market strategy and major destinations of
Qingdao's exports.
</P>
<P>
Last year township enterprises of Qingdao improved their
business transactions with the United States and European
countries. Moreover, high-tech products such as electrical
appliances are on the rise, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao achieved more than 5.27 billion U.S. dollars in exports
in 1999, an increase of 9.8 percent on a yearly basis.

<HEADLINE> Thomas, Uber Cup Asian Qualifier Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The eight-day Asian Zone
Qualifier of the Thomas and Uber Cup World Badminton Team
Championship was concluded here on Sunday with the Chinese men's
team and the Republic of Korea's women's team qualifying for the
Cup Finals due in Malaysia this May as zone number one.
</P>
<P>
Men's teams of the Republic of Korea and India and women's
teams of Japan and Indonesia grabbed the other four tickets to the
Malaysia finals. In a quite insignificant match this afternoon,
the men's teams of China and Korea, both assured of a seat in the
Malaysia finals after beating India and Thailand respectively on
Saturday, vied each other for the number one position in the
Thomas Cup qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Taking a quite pragmatic attitude and determined to conceal
their real strength in doubles, the Korean team decided to let
their doubles player Hwang Sun Ho also play the third singles,
thus changing the match sequence from the usual one-singles-one-
doubles pattern to the all-singles-first pattern. This gave the
Chinese a chance to take full advantage of their singles
superiority and, as a result, a quite comfortable win of 3-0. All
doubles pairs of both teams, however, were deprived of their
chance to play on the court of the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium.
</P>
<P>
In a remarkable success for the host, Indian men's team won a
hard victory against its chief rival Thailand by 3-1. The Indians,
scoring conspicuous progress in both their skills and match
experience in recent years, took two crucial points in the first
singles and second doubles matches, which the Thais also counted
on for a win.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian women's team took their sweet revenge this
afternoon as they beat China's Hong Kong 3-1 to seize the final
qualifying berth in the Uber Cup Asian qualifier. The Indonesians
lost 2-3 to Hong Kong in a group match on Thursday and had since
been forced to make desperate efforts to bring themselves into the
Uber Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
It was not the case, however, that the Hong Kong girls never
had a chance to score a second miracle and bring a bigger surprise
to the Uber Cup competition, especially after their second singles
player Koon Wai Chee, in a very impressive performance, beat her
powerful opponent Angelina Ellen 7-11, 11-4 and 11-8. Koon lost to
Ellen 6-11, 8-11 within 24 minutes in their group match encounter.
</P>
<P>
But Hong Kong's opportunity was lost at the hands of their top
two singles players, Ling Wan Ting and Wang Chen, who were the
team's heroes in its last clash with Indonesia by taking all the
three winning points in two singles and one doubles matches. Ling,
though taking the first game 11-9, lost 1-2 to Indonesia's
Djaelawijay Lidya, whom she beat 2-1 the last time. And Hong Kong
players lost their hope and morale when Wang Chen, believed to be
the only one in the team that could take one winning point for
sure, lost 0:2 to Marfuah Yuli in the third singles match.
</P>
<P>
In another unimportant match in the Uber Cup competition, the
Republic of Korea, as they did in a group match earlier this week,
beat Japan 3-2. Both teams, however, were already secured a place
in the Malaysia finals after beating Indonesia and China's Hong
Kong respectively on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Thomas, Uber Cup Asian Zone Qualifier started here on
February 13. Defending champions Indonesian men's team and Chinese
women's team, and both teams of the host country Malaysia enjoy
the privilege of directly entering the Cup Finals and didn't come.

<HEADLINE> Serena Williams Wins Champion of Hannover Tennis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Williams of the United States
has taken an important step forward to the women's tennis-throne
on Sunday afternoon in Hannover, the capitol of the German state
Lower Saxony.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon the final of Hannover WTA Tournament was played
between the 18-year-old american black girl Serena Williams and
Denisa Chladkova from the Czechish Republic. Power-Girl Serena
Williams won easily Chladkova with 6-1, 6-1 and got the champion
of Hannover WTA Tournament. So she received 87,000 U.S. dollars
premium and the runner-up Chladkova took 43,500 dollars premium.
</P>
<P>
After the 46-minutes match Serena said: "I concentrate my
energy only for tennis. My aim is to become number one." At
present Serena is No. 4. of the world women's tennis range list
and her victory in Hannover shorted the difference to her old
sister Venus Williams by 300 points. Venus Williams is now the No.
3rd on the world women's range list.

<HEADLINE> Tenth Defeat of Arminia Bielefeld in a Row  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The 21st round of the German
Bundesliga came to the end on Sunday evening and four matches of
the 19th round of the Second German Bundesliga were played on
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Today is another catastrophic day for Arminia Bielefeld Club
that it was defeated by VfL Wolfsburg with 2-0 and it is its tenth
defeat in a row for a long time. Bielefeld's 0-2 loss equaled the
record of the defeat in a row of Tasmania Berlin (1965/1966 season)
and FC Nuremberg (1983/1984 season) and is the longest consecutive
run of the Bundesliga defaet.
</P>
<P>
Bielefeld team came to Wolfsburg where the headquarters of the
German Volkswagen AG is located in and wanted to get one point
from the host. But Wolfsburg didn't give it any chance. Bielefeld
had too bad luck this season and missed an opportunity of eleven-
meters-penalty. In the 35th minute the Romanian Dorinel Munteanu
scored for Wolfsburg and ended the first half with 1-0.
</P>
<P>
In the second half the Bielefeld's keeper Miletic was
successful in intercepting an eleven-meters-penalty of Wolfsburg's
Greiner, but his heroics didn't inspire the fighting spirit of
Bielefeld. In the 68th minute Andrzej Juskowiak got another goal
for Wolfsburg and the 2-0 victory to Bielefeld propelled Wolfsburg
four places into seventh position behind 1860 Munich on the league
table.
</P>
<P>
Now there is only the theoretical possibility left for Arminia
Bielefeld with its poor 11 points to stay in the rank of the
Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
SSV Ulm 1846 played vs Hansa Rostock on Sunday evening and had
equal shares with 1-1. The Swede Peter Wibran scored for Rostock
in the 37th minute and the Dutch van de Haar equalized for SSV Ulm
in the 83rd minute.
</P>
<P>
1-1 draw is advantageous to the two teams because they have
separately 24 and 23 points and still stay in places 14 and 15 in
the league table.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon Alemania Aachen in which the Chinese Xie
Hui palyed fought against stronger opponent VfL Bochum. Xie Hui
played very good, but he didn't score for Aachen. In the first
half he missed a very good chance for scoring. Just at the end of
the whole match Peschel got a decided goal for Bochum and won with
1-0. The victory can make good chance for Bochum's upgrade to the
Bundesliga. Aachen placed eighth on the table. Waldhof Mannheim in
which Zhou Ning plays is in the seventh position and Offenbacher
Kickers in which Li Bing serves stays in place 17 of the second
league table and is in very danger of relegation down to the third
league.
</P>
<P>
Other results were: Alemania Aachen lost to VfL Bochum 0-1 (0-0)
; St.Pauli bt Stuttgarter Kickers 2-1 (1-1); Mainz tied Fortuna
Cologne 0-0; Karlsruhe tied Tennis Borussia Berlin 0-0.

<HEADLINE> Rare Ancient Plant Grows Well in SW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- China has made a major
breakthrough in breeding wild cycad, a 280-million-year-old rare
plant species, over vast area of land.
</P>
<P>
A cycad forest covering 1,360 hectares has been created in the
suburbs of the city of Panzhihua in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, and the forest comprises 237,766 cycads, believed to be
the largest number of its kind in the world, said Yang Siyuan, a
horticulturist in Panzhihua.
</P>
<P>
In the forest, 136,000 are fully grown cycads and the rest are
saplings. Normally, cycads seldom blossom, however, the cycads in
Panzhihua blossom once a year.
</P>
<P>
"The cycad forest provides ample materials for studying the
origin and evolution of living things and the climate and
geography of ancient times," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
China is endowed with 15 kinds of cycads dating back to the
Paleozoic era, before the age of the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
Since a virgin cycad forest was discovered on Baguanhe Mountain
in early 1970s, the local government sent specialists to the area
and offered as much as materials and funds needed to protect this
rare plant species.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, China set up its first cycad protective zone where the
cycad forest was discovered, and by now all fully grown cycads
have been counted. Notices banning cycad logging and selling can
be seen everywhere in and around the protective zone, and there
are special patrols to guard against logging and forest fires,
said Nie Ping, deputy director of the Panzhihua Forestry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at Panzhihua attempted to grow cycads in
neighboring counties with seeds taken from the cycad forest in
1974, and they also experimented with artificial pollination in
the 1980s and achieved full success when the first generation of
hybrid cycad fungus was cultivated.
</P>
<P>
"We have raised 3,125 cycads by planting saplings and direct
seeding over the past few years, and the survival rate has
exceeded 98 percent," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The measures taken to expand the cycad forest at Panzhihua have
attained world advanced levels, according to a group of senior
forestry experts.
</P>
<P>
China's first cycad gene bank was recently set up in Panzhihua
with genes from more than 30 cycad species growing both in China
and elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We now are endeavoring to collect more cycad species grown in
and out of China to enlarge our gene bank," Yang said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy in Fresh Bid to Revive Mideast Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross said here Monday he will do whatever he can to help
Israel and the Palestinians revive their stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to doing all we can to help (the two sides)
overcome their difficulties," Ross said after a meeting with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy arrived in the region Monday in a fresh bid to
revitalize the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which grounded to a
halt early this month.
</P>
<P>
Barak also voiced optimism over the possible resumption of peace
negotiations after the meeting, saying he believes Israel and the
Palestinians will find a way to overcome all the disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke off on February 3
after a summit meeting between Barak and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat failed to resolve disputes
on an overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who was in the region at that time, failed to narrow the
gaps between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was angered by Barak's refusal to include Arab villages
close to Jerusalem in the scheduled withdrawal from 6.1 percent of
the West Bank, which was to have taken place on January 20
according to the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the stalemate, the two sides missed the self-
imposed February 13 deadline for reaching a framework agreement on
final status issues such as the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements and Palestinian refugees. They accused each other for
the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Barak blamed the Palestinians for what he said was their
inflexible position, saying they had turned down an Israeli offer
in January to hold two series of 10-day intensive talks in order to
meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
He came up with a new timetable for the framework deal Sunday,
saying he intends to reach such a deal by May.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians refuted by saying they had laid out three
questions to the Israeli negotiating team in early February
regarding the 6.1 percent withdrawal, the third and final interim
redeployment and a final peace treaty, but Israel did not respond.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator for interim talks, Saeb Erekat,
repeated Monday that the main reason for the stalemate was that
Barak did not focus his efforts on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Barak is reportedly devoting much of his effort to reviving the
peace talks with Syria, which broke off last month over the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Barak hopes to reach an agreement with Syria that will help him
fulfill a key election promise to pull Israeli troops out of
southern Lebanon by July. Syria is the main power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have called on the United States to increase
its involvement in their peace negotiations with Israel to resolve
the latest disputes.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said Monday it is "imperative"
that Ross press Barak to adhere to what had already been agreed
upon.
</P>
<P>
Hours before his meeting with Ross, Barak told a group of
American Jewish leaders that Israel will work out new proposals in
the next few days to break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Maariv reported Monday that Barak will offer a "
package of gestures" to revive the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the package will include the inclusion of better
land in the 6.1-percent transfer, the opening of a new "safe
passage" between the Palestinian self-ruled West Bank and Gaza, and
the resolution of purchase tax disputes.
</P>
<P>
But chief Palestinian negotiator on the final-status talks
Yasser Abed Rabbo said he fears Barak's new offers will focus too
much on secondary issues in an attempt to give the false impression
that there is progress in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross is to meet Arafat on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan on Monday conveyed an oral message of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Jiang extended his cordial greeting and renewed
his invitation to Khatami to visit China on a suitable time.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese government attaches great importance to
expansion of relations with Iran and is ready to join hands with
Iran to further expand mutual cooperation in political, economic
and cultural fields in order to serve the two nations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the two countries will make further
efforts to promote their cooperation in international affairs and
push forward the establishment of new international political and
economic order.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Expressing pleasure over China's great economic achievements in
recent years, he said the Chinese developments will be a good
experience for other countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Terming Iran and China as two Asian countries with ancient
civilizations, Khatami said Iran's initiative on dialog among
civilizations is aimed at improving contacts and exchanges among
various cultures in the world.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Tang's visit to Iran will be a new
step for further promotion of Tehran-Beijing ties, calling on the
two countries to further expand their friendly relations and
cooperation and contribute to stability and economic developments
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also briefed Tang of the recent Iranian parliamentary
election, saying the election, which enjoyed strong support of the
Iranian nation, indicated that the social life in Iran is very
active.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the Chinese government also attaches great importance
to Iran's role in regional and international affairs and support
the initiative of dialog among civilizations advocated by President
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The idea of dialog among civilizations can help reduce regional
tensions and is in the line with the Chinese foreign policy and in
the interest of developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said China and Iran, as two
developing countries in Asia facing common issues and challenges,
can enhance their cooperation in maintaining peace and accelerating
developments.
</P>
<P>
Tang arrived here on Sunday for a four-day official visit, the
last leg of his four-nation tour, which has already brought him to
Mauritania, Tunisia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>

bilateral ties with Iranian Majlis (parliament) speaker Nateq
Nouri, Vice President for Executive Affairs Mohammad Hahsemi, Oil
Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh.
</P>
<P>
By the end of their second round of talks, Tang and his Iranian

<HEADLINE> Iran for Diplomatic Solution to Afghan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here Monday the restoration of stability and
tranquility in Afghanistan is possible only through contribution of
all political groups in the country and adoption of a diplomatic
solution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a senior delegation of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC), Kharrazi said Iran will continue
contributing to peace seeking efforts in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Information and Press General Office at the
Foreign Ministry, the OIC delegation has held consultations with
the organization's members that neighbor Afghanistan, as well as
with Saudi Arabia, on finding a peaceful solution to the Afghan
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and
International Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif, who is also head of the
OIC's Afghanistan committee, said here Monday the current head of
the OIC, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, has launched a new
initiative for restoring peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, he stated, President Khatami decided to
dispatch a delegation of the OIC committee on Afghanistan
(comprising Tunisian, Pakistani and Guinean envoys and a
representative of the OIC secretary general) to countries
neighboring Afghanistan and to Saudi Arabia to seek their views.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the people of Afghanistan who should find a way to
restore peace in their country through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The OIC's objective is to keep pace with United Nations efforts
for the formation of a broad-based government in Afghanistan,
comprising various groups and factions, said Zarif, adding the
government should realize that a military solution is not
acceptable and the crisis can only be settled through diplomatic
means.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Troops from
Colombia's Marine infantry have found eight bodies, with which the
number of dead rose to 18 in confrontations between rebel group
and paramilitary in the north Bolivar department.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said Monday the bodies were found in the
mountainous area of Carmen de Bolivar municipality.
</P>
<P>
In this area, men from rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) and paramilitary movement United Autodefenses of
Colombia (AUC) fought between last Tuesday and the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Regional Marine commander Lt. Col. Harold Mantillar reported
about the
finding of the bodies in an area of El Salado village, in Carmen
de Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
Mantilla said that these troops, which are pursuing
guerrillas and paramilitaries, confronted the paramilitaries and
in the fighting one of the marines was wounded lightly.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Bolivar and Sucre incursions, autodefense personnel
attacked Apartado and San Pedro, in Urabo, where they killed nine
peasants and wounded two more.
</P>
<P>
Colombian government said last week that it was prepared to
hand over control of an area of Bolivar to the National Liberation
Army (ELN), the country's second largest rebel group, to kick-
start peace talks.

WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
was ranked average among presidents of the United States,
according to a survey of 58 presidential historians released here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is 21st out of 41 men who have served in the Oval
Office, according to the survey, carried out by the public-
affairs cable channel C-SPAN and timed for release on President's
day.
</P>
<P>
He rates near the top for managing the economy and pursuing
equal justice, but dead last when measured for "moral authority,"
after Richard Nixon and Warren Harding, Two other presidents
marked by scandal.
</P>
<P>
Abraham Lincoln topped the list as the best president, followed
by Franklin D. Roosevelt, George Washington, Theodore Roosevelt
and Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
The worst president was James Buchanan, followed by Andrew
Johnson, Franklin Pierce, Warren G. Harding and William Henry
Harrison.
</P>
<P>
The scholars rated president on 10 qualities, including public
persuasion, crisis leadership, economic management, moral
authority, international relations and administrative skills.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's high scores are in pursuing equal justice (5th),
economic management (5th) and public persuasion (11th) while his
low scores were in congressional relations (36th) and moral
authority (41st).
</P>
<P>
Clinton has presided over the longest U.S. expansion in history,
but his scores were affected by his sex scandal with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.

"President Clinton came into office with a three-part strategy
for the economy: fiscal discipline, investing in people and
opening markets abroad to benefit American workers," White House
spokesman Joel Johnson said Monday.
</P>

"By any measure, this has proved resoundingly successful," he
said.  Johnson said time will tell about Clinton's moral

<HEADLINE> McCain Raises More Money Than Bush in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator John McCain
outraised Texas Governor George W. Bush in campaign funds in
January, taking in 2.5 million dollars to bring his total to 18.2
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bush raised 2 million dollars in January, bringing his record-
setting total to 70.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since his victory in New Hampshire primary on February 1,
McCain has raised 8 million dollars, including 3.5 million dollars
via the Internet, a senior campaign official said. He entered
February with 20.5 million dollars in the bank.
</P>
<P>
Overall, McCain spent 6.8 million dollars in January, bringing
his total spending to 21 million dollars, according to reports
filed Sunday with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
Texas Governor George W. Bush spent 12.8 million dollars,
bringing his total to 50.1 million dollars, more than any other
presidential candidate ever.
</P>
<P>
Continuing to spend at the rate of 3 million dollars a week,
Bush has since eaten into his 20 million dollars bank balance, and
campaign aides said last week that he would begin raising money
again to replenish his campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, former Senator Bill Bradley outspent
Vice President Al Gore last month, 5 million dollars to 3.8
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both the two Democratic candidates said they had slightly under
16 million dollars to spend, a combination of their cash on hand
and federal matching funds that they anticipate receiving.
</P>
<P>
That would leave them not far behind Bush's 20 million dollars,
although Gore also carries about 1.5 million dollars in debts.

via the Internet, a senior campaign official said. He entered
February with 20.5 million dollars in the bank.
</P>
<P>
Overall, McCain spent 6.8 million dollars in January, bringing
his total spending to 21 million dollars, according to reports
filed Sunday with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
Texas Governor George W. Bush spent 12.8 million dollars,
bringing his total to 50.1 million dollars, more than any other
presidential candidate ever.
</P>
<P>
Continuing to spend at the rate of 3 million dollars a week,
Bush has since eaten into his 20 million dollars bank balance, and
campaign aides said last week that he would begin raising money
again to replenish his campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, former Senator Bill Bradley outspent
Vice President Al Gore last month, 5 million dollars to 3.8
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both the two Democratic candidates said they had slightly under
16 million dollars to spend, a combination of their cash on hand
and federal matching funds that they anticipate receiving.
</P>
<P>
That would leave them not far behind Bush's 20 million dollars,
although Gore also carries about 1.5 million dollars in debts.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Urged to Promote Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has urged the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to promote
regional integration through trade and investment with a view to
achieving a fully integrated, internationally competitive and
unified economic area.
</P>
<P>
An integrated market on a regional scale would open up larger
opportunities for the industries to sell their products and
acquire production inputs at lesser costs for the benefit of all,
said Zambian Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister William
Harrington here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while addressing a workshop on the concept,
 challenges and opportunities of the COMESA Free Trade Area (FTA),
which is to be commenced in October this year.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA FTA would rather give member countries an
opportunity of integrating among themselves and later with the
rest of the world, he said, stressing that protectionism on the
FTA would only restrict trade, thereby making Zambia fall further
behind its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, COMESA Secretary General Erastus Mwencha praised
Zambia for the progress it has made in economic liberalization,
saying the country is among the front runners in the region.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Worm Cases Increase in Northern Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- There has been a resurgence of
about 70 percent of Guinea worm cases in Ghana's Northern Region
beginning last year, Ghana News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Guinea Worm Eradication Project Co-ordinator
Patrick Apoga as saying that the region recorded a total of 4,566
Guinea worm cases in 1999 as against 2,704 in the previous year,
adding that last year's figure was the highest in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Apoga, who is heading a 200-member team working to eradicate
the disease through the provision of potable water for the
affected villages, attributed the resurgence to lack of funds to
implement the project effectively.
</P>
<P>
"Measures taken by the project were temporary. There is also
lack of motivation for the volunteers," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm not to Hit Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Meteorological Department
of Zambia Monday told Zambians not to worry as the tropical storm
over the Mozambican channel, which is expected to hit its central
coast Tuesday, will not affect Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Jacob Nkomoki, senior forecast officer at the meteorological
department, told Zambia News Agency that the storm would not
affect Zambia very much because it has moved to the south, away
from a position which gives effects to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The effect would not be much on the Zambian side although it is
likely to cause some outbreaks of rains in most parts of the
country, he said.

CARACAS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Natural disaster through rains
that fell in Venezuela last December has caused direct and
indirect damages for an amount of 3.237 billion U.S. dollars, said
a report of the United Nations regional committee Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report made jointly by the U.N. Economic Commission for
Latin America (ECLA) and the U.N. Development Program (UNDP).
</P>

This report indicated that a multidiscipline mission of global
and systematic evaluation of economic, social and environmental
effects was carried out.

The ECLA or CEPAL (Spanish initials) convoked a team of 16
specialists that arrived in Venezuela a few days after the tragedy
to gather information and to know the damage's proportions.
</P>
<P>
The amount of damages comes to around 1.961 billion dollars,
and indirect ones for production losses or of "greater expense and
lower income" for 1.276 billion dollars. The total comes to 3.3
percent of Venezuela's Gross Domestic Product.
