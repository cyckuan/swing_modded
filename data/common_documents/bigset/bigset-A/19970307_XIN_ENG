program adopted by the bank since 1995, and cutting of
administrative spendings.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here today that his visit to Dhaka "can start a new phase" of
cooperation between the two countries in various areas for mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two sides could be increased in trade,
investment, cultural and other mutually beneficial areas including
tackling common problems like poverty, Ramos said in an interview
with reporters this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We have a common goal of empowerment of our peoples and also
(we are) for supporting measures for their confidence building,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also emphasized the need to boost trade between the two
Asian nations, adding that the existing bilateral trade is not
enough.
</P>
<P>
"We must overcome restrictions and let us not be confined by
limits," said Ramos, who also suggested activating the joint
economic and trade commissions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turning to problems faced by workers from the Philippines,
Bangladesh and other countries working in third countries, the

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Outlines Goals of Military Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The aim of Russia's military reform
is adequate defense, qualitatively new, slimmer forces armed with
modern equipment and weapons, said President Boris Yeltsin in a
state of nation address today.
</P>
<P>
In his 65-page annual message, distributed among parliament
deputies today, Yeltsin said, "The Russian armed forces are five
to 10 years, sometimes up to 15 years, behind the world's most
powerful armies in the general level of technical equipment."
</P>
<P>
The country would cut its armed forces both in structure and in
manpower, and try to keep them up to date, he said. He earlier
ordered a reduction of 200,000 men from the 1.7 million-strong
armed forces in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hence, military reform will be carried out to retain Russia's
capabilities for effective deterrence and for repulsion of
aggression against it and its allies, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will continue to attach priority to political,
diplomatic...economic means, collective actions...in preventing
wars and armed conflicts...," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also confirmed in the message plans for building
a fully professional army in line with building the
infrastructure necessary for their working and living.

<HEADLINE> First Foreign-Loaned Underground Heat Project Appraised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanggu Underground Heat
Development and Research Project in Tianjin Municipality, China's
first such project built with foreign loans, passed experts'
appraisal today.
</P>
<P>
The Iceland ambassador to China, Hjalmar Hannesson, was present
at the appraisal.
</P>
<P>
The Tanggu District under Tianjin has built the project with
2.78 million US dollars of loans from the Nordic Investment Bank
and the Nordic Development Fund of Iceland.
</P>
<P>
The computerized project, which has adopted advanced foreign
equipment and apparatus, was completed by the end of last year,
with three 2,000 m-deep wells, two pilot heating- and water-supply
facilities, and a digital model for the reserve of underground hot
water in the area.
</P>
<P>
A underground heat research center is now being constructed
with the district's own funds and with the technological
assistance from Iceland.
</P>
<P>
The system can supply heating to an area of 240,000 sq m, with
water at 65.5 centigrades and a water flow of 131 cubic m per hour.
</P>
<P>
According Ren Xiang, Director of the Underground Heat Committee
under the China Energy Research Society, China is one of the most
underground-heat-rich countries in the world, with over 3,000 hot
springs discovered and over 3,000 wells dug.
</P>
<P>
The underground heat already tapped is equivalent to five
million tons of standard coal, which has been widely used in
industrial, agricultural and medical sectors as well heating- and
water-supply and power generation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Complains of European Politicians' Stand on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has expressed great
disappointment with a suggestion by leading European politicians
that denies possibility of Turkey's full European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen summoned EU
countries' ambassadors in Ankara late Wednesday to formally lodge
its complaint over the stance of the European politicians.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the leaders of Christian Democrat parties, that
form the center-right European People's Party (EPP), held in
Brussels Tuesday reached a consensus that "Turkey is not a
candidate to become an EU member, short-term or long," reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
EPP president and also former Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried
Martens said that EU wanted to maintain a close cooperation with
Ankara but Turkey's bid for EU membership was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today quoted Oymen as questioning the
ambassadors at the half-hour meeting whether the EPP statement
reflected the official view of their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
"No one of them said that this was the official view of
their own government," he said, adding that some ambassadors
even denied such a consensus had been reached at the EPP
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller also downplayed the significance of the EPP statement by
saying that this was only a party suggestion instead of a
decision by the government.
</P>
<P>
What confused Turkey most is the fact that some key European
leaders including German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Marfa Aznar as well as Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi were among the politicians who were said to endorse the
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
These three leaders, however, have been advocating Turkey's EU
membership bid in public to date.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an associate member of the EU, has long been struggling
for a full membership, but witnesses no breakthrough due to some
controversial issues with EU.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
approved here today a package of draft legislation and
administrative measures to combat lawlessness and strengthen the
accountability process in the country.
</P>
<P>
The decisions were taken at the two-day first formal meeting of
the federal cabinet which concluded today.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decided to form Ehtasab (accountability) committees
at the district and sub-division levels, ban smoking at public
places and prohibit lavish expenditure on marriages, an official
press release said here today.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also approved a package of short-term measures for
improving law and order.
</P>
<P>
It also decided to refer a set of proposals for revamping the
police on a long-term basis to provincial governments for their
consideration, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of provincial governments will be placed
before a special meeting of the federal cabinet to be held in four
weeks, it said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who chaired the meeting, directed
that the decisions be implemented in letter and spirit.
</P>
<P>
He said no political influence should be accepted in any manner
whatsoever for the transfer, posting and promotion of government
officials.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by the four provincial chief
ministers.

<HEADLINE> US Jobless Claims Average Down to Eight-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of first-time claims
for jobless benefits in the U.S. dropped last week and pushed the
four-week average to the lowest level in nearly eight years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department reported today new applications for
unemployment insurance fell by 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted
310,000. It was the lowest since the week ended February 15 when
claims totaled 306,000, the smallest in seven months.
</P>
<P>
The weekly decline drove the average of new claims for the last
four weeks down by 3,500 to 310,000, the lowest since 309,750
during the period ended May 13, 1989.
</P>
<P>
It was fresh evidence of a robust economy and renewed concerns
the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise interest rates to check
inflation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. analysts prefer to track the less-volatile four-week
average because it smooths out the spikes in the weekly reports.
They consider a level of claims in the lower 300,000 range to be
consistent with a tightening labor market.
</P>
<P>
Economists are predicting the U.S. unemployment rate will slip
to 5.3 percent last month from 5.4 percent in January.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official: Netanyahu Misleads Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official today
criticized Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu for
misleading international public opinion and misinterpreting peace.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Local Government of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Saeb Erekat told the Cairo-based Voice of
Palestine radio that he believes Netanyahu will not abide by the
peace process nor honor his commitments.
</P>
<P>
"He speaks of peace in a different way from the Arabs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The peace Netanyahu envisions runs counter to all the previous
peace agreements, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs have proven their strategic commitment to the peace
process that rests on Israel's relinquishing of Arab lands it has
occupied since 1967, he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu always says he wants peace to continue, but at the
same time he wants to proceed with the construction of
settlements, the Judaization of Jerusalem, the confiscation of
lands and the expulsion of Arab residents from Jerusalem, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian criticism came a day after Netanyahu's visit to
Egypt and amid mounting tensions between Israel and the PNA over
the former's plan to build a new Jewish settlement in Har Homa in
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Erekat's remarks also came as Netanyahu has ordered the closure
of PNA offices in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Italian Industry Shows a Record Turnover Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian industry showed a record fall
in turnover last year, falling 0.4 percent compared to 1995, Istat
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Italian industry has almost always managed to
show a slight increase in sales even in the deepest economic
downturns.
</P>
<P>
Istat said the fall was due to a 1.6 percent slide in domestic
sales, which was not fully offset by a 2.3 percent rise in foreign
sales.
</P>
<P>
A slump in domestic demand meant orders were also sharply down
over the year by 4.8 percent. On the order front, there were big
rises for textiles and clothing, up 20.7 percent, and
furniture-making, up 12.6 percent. The biggest decline in orders
was for vehicle production which fell by a quarter.
</P>
<P>
Istat pointed out that the unprecedented year-long fall came
despite a 0.6 percent year-on-year pick-up in December, achieved
thanks to a 5.7 percent export sales surge which offset a 1.4
percent fall in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The highest increase in year-on-year sales in December was in
petrol, up 11.8 percent, textiles and clothing, up 3.6 percent,
electrical equipment production, up 3.1 percent and paper and
publishing, up 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The biggest falls in sales were in leather, hides and similar
products, down 10.8 percent, the metal industry, down 9.8 percent
and non-metal-bearing minerals processing, down 7.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> France, Saudi Arabia Ask Israel Not to Undermine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan Ben Abdel Aziz today asked
Israel not to undermine the status quo of Jerusalem, in reference
to a plan by the Israeli government to build a new settlement in
an Arab district in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued after their meeting at the Elysee
presidential palace, Chirac and Prince Sultan also said that
France and Saudi Arabia are ready to continue to help push forward
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries stress the need to contribute actively to
the march forward of the Middle East peace process, in order to
attain a global, just and lasting peace founded on the pertinent
resolutions of the United Nations, in conformity with the
principles of Madrid (conference), including that of the exchange
of land for peace," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said that it is necessary "not to
undermine the status quo of Jerusalem, which should not undergo
modification before the result of negotiations on its final status
comes out."
</P>
<P>
It stressed that France and Saudi Arabia support "the
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
The communique also reaffirmed the commitment by France and
Saudi Arabia to the territorial integrity and political
independence of Iraq, while calling for "the full application by
this country of the pertinent resolutions of the (UN) Security
Council, and full cooperation with the United Nations for the
rapid implementation of Resolution 986 aimed at relieving the
sufferings of the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Prince Sultan also expressed their will to reinforce
military cooperations between the two nations and to fight
terrorism "under whatever forms, wherever it comes from, and
whoever its sponsor is."

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Up 2.5 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
increased by 2.5 percent to a record high in January, the U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that factory orders for durable and
nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 323.2 billion
dollars in the month from 315.4 billion in last December.
</P>
<P>
The report said that orders for durable goods expected to last
more than three years jumped by 4 percent, stronger than the
initial estimate of 3.6 percent announced last week.
</P>
<P>
The gain in durable goods orders was led by a 16.6 percent
surge in demand for electronic and other electrical equipment, due
mostly to communication equipment and electronic components. But
other durable categories also registered increases.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nondurable goods such as chemicals and clothing rose
by 0.7 percent, the fourth increase in the last five months.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft gained
3.6 percent after falling in the previous two months. These orders
often are a barometer of future business plans and have been a
major source of economic strength during the current expansion.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders rose by 1 percent, the eighth
increase in the last nine months. A growing backlog suggests
businesses may have to increase production facilities and manpower
to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, were up 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports of U.S. economic growth has resulted in more
predictions that U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to
keep the economy from overheating.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Successes in Exploration of Mineral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has achieved great
sucesses in the exploration of mineral resources in recent
years .
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government holds that the country's mineral
potential is considerable and therefore it has paid much
attention to the exploration of mineral resources in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Ugandan government initiated a petroleum
exporation promotion project. In 1990, Uganda and Zaire signed an
agreement on the joint exploration of petroleum reserves beneath
lakes Albert and Edward. In 1991 the Ugandan government also
signed an oil exploration agreement with Fina Exploration Uganda,
a subsidiary of Belgium's Petrofina, on the exploration in an
area of 26,800 sq km in the two lakes.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Ugandan government started negotiations with three
companies on the exploration of oil resources in the Lake Albert
region. These firms are TDC Energy and Azania House of the
United States and Heritage Oil and Gas of Britain.
</P>
<P>
The proposed oilfield at Lake Albert on the Ugandan-Zairean
border can produce more than 60,000 barrels of crude per day,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
They believe that oil production in the region can ease
Uganda's oil import bill, its biggest expenditure, and make the
country self-sufficient in oil needs.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the Ugandans found one of the world's largest
deposits of phosphates in its eastern district of Tororo. Experts
say, the deposits at the Sukulu Hills in the district --
estimated at some 225 million metric tons -- can be exploited and
supplied to the 16 member states of the Preferential Trade Area
(PTA) for 200 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a big iron ore deposit was found in Kabale and Kisoro
districts, southwestern Uganda near Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The deposit, estimated to yield 300 million tons of iron ore,
is mixed with low levels of phosphorus sulphur and titannium.

KAMPALA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- In 1995, a large gold deposit was
found in the Karamoja region, northeastern Uganda. It was said to
be the second largest gold deposit in the world, only after that
of Australia.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary surveys, the deposit at Karamoja
would be mined for 50 years with an annual production of three
metric tons.
</P>
<P>
In March 1994, Uganda found a large deposit of kaolin in the
Mutuka Hills in the southwestern district of Bushenyi.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey report, the deposit contains over three
million tons, of which 2.3 million tons are minable. The deposits
are said to be of the best quality in eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Mutuku kaolin can be used in the manufacture of cosmetics,
absorbents, detergents, chemicals and bleaches, textiles, and
pesticides. The by-products can be used in the manufacture of
scouring powders.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the Ugandan government announced that
vast deposits of sand for glass manufacture were found at the
Bukakata and Lambu beaches of Lake Victoria, southwestern Uganda,
in 1994 after an exploration by the Geological and Mines
Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
According to a chemical analysis, the sand contains 98 percent
of silica, while the iron in the sand is 0.24 percent. The iron
content is too high for the manufacture of colorless glass, but
colorless glass can be produced after extracting the iron by a
magnetic seperater.
</P>
<P>
Besides the mineral resources found in recent years, Uganda
also has a large sum of proven and probable reserves of copper,
tin, tungsten, beryl, columbo-tantalite, bismuth, cobalt,
apatite, limestone, among others.
</P>
<P>
It was the bad goverance that hindered the country from
exploiting the mineral resources in the political turmoil period
of the 1970s and the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, when the current government came to power, peace
and stability have been prevailing across the country, creating
an ideal environment for the development of national economy
including the mining sector. enditem

<HEADLINE> New York City's Unemployment Rate Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- New York City's unemployment rate
has risen in January to 9.9 percent, up a full percentage point
from the corresponding period of last year, also the highest
monthly level in nearly three years, according to a report issued
on Wednesday by the Department of Labour.
</P>
<P>
The city had experienced a deep recession between late 1980's
and early 1990's. The high unemployment rate peaked at 11.9
percent in January 1993. That was caused largely by job losses in
New York.
</P>
<P>
The new January development does not in itself signal another
economic downturn, economists noted, adding that what makes it
more significant is the sudden acceleration, a full percentage
point above the rate in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new higher number is caused largely by thousands of people
entering the job market and failing to find jobs, economists said.
</P>
<P>
A latest city report listed New York as among the nation's
weakest urban economies in terms of unemployment, job growth and
the local rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment remains the highest of any large city, a high
ranking city official said. Although there are still many signs of
continuing improvement in the city' fortunes, the slow rate of job
growth and the uneven distribution of economic rewards remain
ominous portents for long-term health, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Increase Beef Market Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe should take advantage of
the expected increase in world livestock trade to increase beef
exports which currently earn the country more than 45 million US
Dollars annually, the European Union said today.
</P>
<P>
EU Representative Michael Laidler told a livestock symposium
in Harare that estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organisation
showed that trade in livestock products was set to rise over the
next few years, and this would present market opportunities for
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said it would ''certainly be shortsighted'' for Zimbabwean
livestock producers to look only to the EU, where it currently
exports about 9,100 tonnes of beef and other agricultural
produce, such as horticulture.
</P>
<P>
''If the predictions are correct, Food and Agricultural
Organisation trade experts estimate an increase of two percent
per annum in trade of livestock products which will be
accompanied by increases in product prices by eight to nine
percent. This would be an increase by approximately 40,000
tonnes per year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe at present produces between 50,000 tonnes and 70,000
tonnes of beef annually. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Timber Production Affected by Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Timber production in Zimbabwe will
this year be reduced by more than 50 percent due to heavy rains
that fell throughout the country recently.
</P>
<P>
Timber Producers Federation Chairman Bill Johnstone today said
the industry, which produced timber worth over 10.9 million US
Dollars last year, would suffer major loses as a result.
</P>
<P>
He said timber logs were taking long to dry resulting in
moulds, reducing the market value.
</P>
<P>
''The rains have badly reduced our production level resulting
in major loses, but we may be able to get on top of the situation
in the next three months,'' he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Improve Packaging Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean indigenous companies should
be fully responsive to trends in the international market in terms of
product development and packaging so as to meet the ever-increasing
international competition.
</P>
<P>
The consultant, Daniel Chiwandamira, who was conducting a Zimtrade
product development and packaging seminar in Harare, said today
that packaging standards of Zimbabwe were low, and this made local
products less competitive on the export market.
</P>
<P>
Zimtrade is Zimbabwe's trade promotiuon body tasked with helping
local companies identify export markets.
</P>
<P>
Chiwandamira said the packaging industry in Zimbabwe was still
backward and failing to respond to latest international market
trends.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a number of packaging companies were trying their
best to import modern equipment needed to change the quality of
packaging.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar, which ended today, was aimed at creating
awareness among business people of the product development process
and the need to have products that will compete effectively on the
export market. enditem

<P>
DAMASCUS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara held talks today with his French counterpart Herve de
Charette on the situation in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Their talks dealt with the prospects of Mideast peace in light
of the Israeli government's anti-peace policy, according to a
Syrian Foreign Ministry official spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian and French foreign ministers also discussed Madrid
peace process, and developing bilateral relations in different
aspects.
</P>
<P>
"The talks were very good and important," de Charette told
reporters following the talks. He arrived here Wednesday for a
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"Situation in the Middle East has been reviewed," he said,
adding that views have been exchanged on what could be done to
push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a report by Israeli Radio today that the French
minister was to deliver two messages to Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad from Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
President Ezer Weizman, de Charette said he was not a postman,
denying he was carrying any messages.
</P>
<P>
Describing bilateral relations as excellent, he said the
Syrian-French relations were reviewed during the talks. He
expressed his country's readiness to further develop political
and economic relations with Syria.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Attack Reported in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A bomb attack was launched against
patrolling British soldiers in Belfast, Northern Ireland this
afternoon but no serious injuries were reported, according to
British security sources.
</P>
<P>
The device exploded behind a garden wall in an Irish
nationalist stronghold in west Belfast early this afternoon when a
British security patrol was patrolling the place.
</P>
<P>
The BBC television quoted a police spokesman as saying: "some
form of explosive device was detonated" around one o'clock this
afternoon at Glenaleena Road in Ballymurphy.
</P>
<P>
"There was a joint police and army patrol in the area at the
time. There are no reports of any serious injuries," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Several arrests have been made in a follow-up police operation
as troops and police flooded into the area and sealed off part of
the Irish nationalist area.
</P>
<P>
No organization has so far claimed responsibility for the bomb
attack but British security experts say that it might be
masterminded by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) forces fighting to
end British rule in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Identifies Land for Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu (PF) Land
Acquisition Committee, set up in April last year, has identified
some 4.07 million hectares of land to resettle landless
peasants.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the eight-member committee Joseph Msika today said the
identified land included multiple owned land, un-utilised and
under-utilised land, or land with absentee landlords.
</P>
<P>
Msika, who is also Zanu (PF) National Chairman, said the
government was now looking at ways of putting the farms to use
although funds were a constraint.
</P>
<P>
''At the implementation stage, we will consult with the commercial
farmers organisation for their cooperation. We are asking multiple
land owners to voluntarily give up excess land failing which it would
be acquired forcibly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Since independence in 1980, the Zimbabwe government had resettled
some 70,000 families with financial assistance from Britain which
provided some 22.7 million US Dollars to fund the land acquisition.
</P>
<P>
The government estimates it needs over 182 million dollars to
resettle the over 92,000 families in need of land. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's three-party government
led by Sher Bahadur Deuba resigned late Thursday soon after losing
a vote of confidence in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra has accepted the resignation by Prime Minister
Deuba's cabinet but asked it to continue to carry out its duty
until the formation of an alternative government, according to a
press release issued by the royal palace here tonight.
</P>
<P>
A motion tabled by Deuba seeking a confidence vote for his
government was defeated earlier today in the 205-seat house by a
vote of 101 to 92. The motion required a majority of 103 votes to
pass in the house.
</P>
<P>
The Deuba government was reduced to a minority status last
December by an opposition-sponsored no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
It came to power in September 1995 after Deuba's Nepali
Congress party overthrew a minority government of the Communist
Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) by joining hands
with two small parties.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML, the main opposition and largest party in the
parliament, will likely form a new government to replace the
present one, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Is A Total Failure, Says Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Julius Nyerere, former President of
Tanzania, has described the Organization of African Unity (OAU) as a
total failure in its quest of forging unity among its member states.
</P>
<P>
However, the continental body deserves credit for the liberation of
Africa from colonialism, he said in Accra, Ghana, according to a
report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
"The founding fathers of the organization had set themselves two
major objectives: the total liberation of our continent from
colonialism and settler minority rule, and the unity of Africa,"
Nyerere said.
</P>
<P>
"But cynics could say that the charter of the OAU itself, with its
great emphasis on the sovereign independence of each member state,
combined with the Cairo Declaration which upheld the sanctity of
inherited borders, made it look more like the organization of African
disunity," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, 75, who retired from active politics in 1985 after ruling
Tanzania for 23 years, was addressing diplomats, ministers, government
officials and students at a public forum, held on Tuesday in Accra as
part of activities marking Ghana's 40th independence anniversary on
March 6.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere pointed out that although Africa had leaders who hated the
Balkanization of the continent, there were too many others who
preferred to keep the continent divided, just to safeguard their
personal interests.
</P>
<P>
"The two, Balkanization and colonialism, are twins and any struggle
against colunialism must go hand in hand with a struggle against the
Balkanization of Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Africans to reject the now popular tendency of dividing
the continent's people into Anglophones, Francophones and Lusophones,
on the basis of the language of their former colonial powers.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Urged to Pay Attention to Oral Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopians were today urged to
pay attention to oral health care and raise awareness of the existing
dental problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
The call came from Dr. Wondwessen Fantaye, Vice Presidnet of the
Ethiopian Dental Professionals Association, at a one-day third annual
conference of the association here.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wondwessen pointed out that oral health has not been
considered among the priority health problems in Ethiopia. Gum and
teeth diseases are however one of the 15 leading causes of out-
patient morbidity in Ethiopia, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
At present, he continued, there are only 46 dental surgeons in
the country both in public and the private sectors and the ratio
shows only one dentist is available for 1.2 million people.
</P>
<P>
The ratio shows that one dentist is available for 114,000 people
in Uganda, for 60,500 in Kenya and for only 49,000 in Nigeria, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wondwessen underlined that absence of school of dentistry,
very few research and lack of essential facilities and the graduate
number of trained dental professionals are a confirmation to the
fact the sector has not been given the necessary attention.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Ministry of Health and concerned authorities to
consider the problems and give due emphasis to the need of formu-
lating national oral health policies and plans based on primary
health care. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia today called for
cooperation among Horn of Africa countries in the transport
industry with a view to developing the sub-region and make strides in
reducing and eradicating poverty.
</P>
<P>
The call was made here by Ayenew Bitewelgn, Vice-Minister of
Transport and Communication at a symposim on ''comparative transport
costs analysis of the greater Horn of Africa''.
</P>
<P>
Ayenew said although road trnasport is of paramount importance
for Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia, the total
distance of roads in these countries is only 51,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In all the sub-regional countries of the greater Horn of African
region, he noted, both local and inter-state transportation
infrastructures are in poor condition and investment in the area is
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The transport infrastructures in most of the sub-region countries
have been damaged by civil war, he said, adding that basic
infrastructures in the Horn of Africa are not commensurate with its
wide area and population.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium, which will end Friday, is attended by
governmental officials, represnetatives of the private sectors and
various experts from the sub-region. enditem

<HEADLINE> Proximity Talks on Cyprus Issue to Start Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Proximity talks on the Cyprus
issue between the U.N. and the Cypriot government and the
Turkish Cypriots will begin Monday, Government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"The government is ready to discuss the substance of the
Cyprus problem during the U.N. effort for proximity talks aiming
to create common ground to allow direct negotiations between
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash to take place," the spokesman said at his daily press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot government enters these talks "with
good will and no prejudice," adding that the positions of both
sides will emerge during the talks.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides and Denktash had two informal talks
under the U.N. auspices in Nicosia in October 1994, but the
talks reached a deadlock due to the wide gap on the substantive
issues of the Cyprus problem between the two sides. The two men
have not met since then.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General's Resident Representative Gustave
Feissel will start the talks between the two sides, with separate
meetings with Clerides and Denktash next week, which will deal
with substantive issues, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"These talks will be more intensive and no timetable has been
set as it is difficult to foresee how long they will last," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said the time devoted to probing for common
ground has come to an end and now "we embark on the search for
common ground on the main aspects of the Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
He declined to reveal the issues to be discussed, but noted
the U.N. resolutions on Cyprus and the High Level Agreements
reached between the two sides in 1977 and 1979 providing for an
independent, bizonal federation would serve as a basis.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions, the spokesman did not rule out the
possibility of seeing "a sudden and speedy promotion of the
Cyprus problem" if there is political will.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the proximity talks will tackle the various aspects
of the Cyprus problem separately, Cassoulides replied that "the
U.N. hopes for a comprehensive approach in a spirit of
compromise."
</P>
<P>
"This phase of consultations is important in that it will
pave the way for direct negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said the U.N. Secretary-General's Special
Representative for Cyprus, Han Sung-Joo, will be visiting the
island during "crucial periods" of these talks.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to both President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Denktash last month, the U.N. Chief, Kofi Annan, expressed
his determination to move the Cypriot peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Government to Solve Scarcity of Water in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa today said that drilling of shallow and deep wells
in Dar es Salaam region will be a permanent exercise aimed at
solving the shortage of water in the city.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before inaugurating a well at Mbagala in Temeke
district in the city, the president said the government could no
longer depend on River Ruvu as the major source of water given
the present aridity.
</P>
<P>
"In support of the government's efforts to solve the scarcity
of water, you should also form water management committees to
ensure efficient use and ownership of such wells," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Minister for Water Pius Ng'wandu, told the president
that 26 deep wells have so far been dug. He said initially his
ministry had planned to drill 30 deep wells and 4,500 shallow
ones which could jointly produce 25 million gallons per day, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We have made impressive strides in drilling deep wells
whereby we have also managed to repair and clean 13 old wells,"
explained the minister, adding that the total 36 deep wells can
produce 3.2 million gallons.
</P>
<P>
Ng'wandu thanked the government for disbursing one billion
Tanzania Shillings (about 1.6 million U.S. Dollars) for the
on-going drilling exercise but also showered praise on Britain,
Denmark, the UN Development Program (UNDP) and the UN Children's
Fund (UNICEF) for supporting the program.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa, who toured Temeke, Ilala and Kinondoni
districts to see the drilling work, was also accompanied by heads
of diplomatic missions from Denmark and Britain, the UNICEF and
UNDP officials.
</P>
<P>
Last month, when the water level fell at River Ruvu following
a prolonged dry spell in the country, some parts in the city were
experiencing water scarcity.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Minister Resigns in Discord With PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's just-resigned Minister of
state for Foreign Affairs Khalid Madadha said today the reason
behind his resignation is his discord with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
His Wednesday resignation, the first in Abdul Karim Kabariti's
13-month old government, is followed by two other ministers.
</P>
<P>
"It was the autocratic and centralized method in which the prime
minister handles the foreign ministry which has forced me to
resign," Jordan's Petra news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Right after Madadha offered his resignation letter, Minister of
Education Abdullah Ensour and Minister of Information Marwan
Muasher followed suit citing "family reasons."
</P>
<P>
As Kabariti himself also holds the foreign affairs' portfolio,
at present a new minister of state does not have to be appointed
to replace Madadha, Petra quoted an informed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Madadha's post might be left vacant until the next cabinet
reshuffle, widely expected to take place late March.
</P>
<P>
Madadha is the second minister to have offered a
resignation. Minister of Post and Telecommunications Jamel Saraieh
submitted his resignation in December, criticizing Kabariti's
"haughty attitude and disrespect for his colleagues."
</P>
<P>
Saraieh later withdrew his resignation after intervention by
the Royal Court and Cabinet colleagues.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticizes UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi newspaper Al-Thawra said
today that Rolf Ekeus, chief of a U.N. committee on sanctioning,
is pursuing a "dubious policy" towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra said in an article that the recent tours to some Arab
Gulf states and Turkey by Rolf Ekeus show that he is pursuing a
"dubious policy" towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus is the chairman of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on dismantling mass destruction weapons in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Such visits by the U.N. official have certain objectives other
than those related to the UNSCOM mission, said Al-Thawra, organ of
the Arab Baa'th Socialist Party of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It added that those objectives only "serve the U.S. interests
in the region, and the policy it has been pursuing in its
relations with the Gulf states aiming to arouse fears of an
Iraqi threat."
</P>
<P>
During his trip to the above-mentioned countries, Ekeus made
statements suggesting that Iraq is "a source of threat" to them,
the paper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The paper continued to say that by such a policy, the
U.S. seeks to blackmail politically the Gulf states and put
pressures upon them so that they will hesitate to improve
relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra also cited Ekeus' latest visit to Ankara as an
additional evidence on his "dubious policy," accusing the UNSCOM
chief of having intentions to "instigate Ankara against Iraq."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Regional cooperation between
member countries of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA)
should be explored in a cautious and evolutionary manner, South
African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the IORA's first ministerial meeting in Port Louis,
Mauritius, Nzo said the prudence did not detract the common
enthusiasm from seeking the set goals of regional cooperation,
but "keeping our eyes on the ground" in implementation.
</P>
<P>
"We feel it appropriate not to be in undue haste to entrench
ourselves in a position of artificial or contrived benefit," said
Nzo, adding this prudent approach would best serve the
advancement of the IORA.
</P>
<P>
The IORA was established two years ago to seek closer trade,
economic and other cooperation to the benefit of all countries
reliant on the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the 14-member countries of the IORA
attended the meeting, which saw the signing of a charter that had
been negotiated for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The IORA comprises Australia, India, Indonesia, Kenya,
Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mozambique, Oman, Singapore,
South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Yemen.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ford Motor Company is
expected to return to the Kenyan market and has chosen Lonrho
Motors as its partner, the Ford's Regional Market Manager Bob
Hopkin has said.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, he stated that Ford had
recently signed a partnership contract with Lonrho Motors at
Ford's world headquarters in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Lonrho is expected to have the Ford
franchise fully operational in Kenya within four months under the
name of Kenya Motors.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Motors will provide showrooms, spare parts workshop and
branch facilities for a range of five passenger car models at the
initial stage.
</P>
<P>
The regional market manager noted that the Ford-Lonrho Motor
Alliance is expected to extend to Uganda and Tanzania where
Lonrho Motors East Africa has recently increased its investment
in motor business.
</P>
<P>
According to Hopkin, Ford, the second largest motor
manufacturer in the world, will use Kenya to launch its new
"global sourcing" policy and the product range including vehicles
from Europe, United States, Australia, Japan and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The release stressed that Ford's return to Kenya is
potentially "the single most powerful brand development in this
market for 20 years."
</P>
<P>
Ford was one of the first makes of car to come to Kenya and
dominated the market for nearly half a century through its Kenya
agents Hughes Ltd. before the company was sold and the franchise
was wound down.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Sues Japanese for Falsifying Tourist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon today sued five Japanese
citizens allegedly belonging to the radical Japanese "Red Army"
for falsifying passports and entry visas, the Lebanese National
News Agency (LNNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The state-run LNNA said Abdullah Bitar, a Beirut appellate
prosecutor, brought a suit against the five Japanese on charges of
"falsifying passports and Lebanese and foreign official stamps and
illegally entering and residing in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the five men could face up to seven years of
imprisonment, a judicial source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The defendants were identified as Kozo Okamoto 49, Kazuo
Tohira 44, Haruo Wako, 48, Mariko Yamamoto, 56 and Masao Adachi,
57. "The men Tokyo said are members of the Japanese Red Army
(JRA)," said the LNNA.
</P>
<P>
However, the Lebanese authorities have failed to confirm
whether the defendants are members of the JRA, which was allegedly
involved in a series of terrorist attacks which occurred in the
1970s and 1980s in the Middle East and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Okamoto had been sentenced to life imprisonment in Israel for
his role in the 1972 bombing and shooting attack in Tel Aviv's
Lodd airport in which 24 people were killed and around 80 others
wounded. He was released later in a Palestinian-Israeli prisoners'
swap in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The LNNA said the five Japanese were detained by the security
forces in a search-and-arrest campaign against Asians in Beirut
on February 15, which was aimed to capture a clandestine network
of falsifying tourist documents.
</P>
<P>
A Lebanese woman, Omaya Abboud, who had been under custody in
connection with the case, was also handed over to the
investigation judge, the state-owned LNNA said.
</P>
<P>
Three other Japanese were set free by the judicial authority,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Counselor in Beirut Hiroshi Odada met the suspected
JRA members in the Justice Ministry Wednesday for about 30
minutes and enquired about the conditions of the detainees.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Nigerian Women Sigh a Long Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Two days before their own days,
Nigerian women can now have a long relief: they can wear trousers
now without fear of being harassed by the police.
</P>
<P>
The good news was reported today by the official News Agency
of Nigeria, which reads, "Trousers-wearing females now move
freely in and out of the new federal secretariat, Abuja, without
policemen at the gates molesting them."
</P>
<P>
This may sounds strange, and indeed, a little appalling to
many people, but it's all true.
</P>
<P>
It all started about one month ago, when it was widely
reported that the women wearing trousers were denied entry to the
federal secretariat in Abuja, the capital.
</P>
<P>
Reports also said that some women were being harassed by the
security men at the gate, and that a 22-year-old young woman were
almost stripped to nakedness, beaten up and later detained for
wearing trousers.
</P>
<P>
When being questioned of the justice of their acts, the
security men reportedly said that they were acting on "orders
from above".
</P>
<P>
As heated debating was still going on, the same order seemed
to have reached Lagos, the commercial center of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, scores of trousers-wearing women were reportedly
stopped by security men at the entrance of the Apapa port.
</P>
<P>
One security officer was quoted as saying that most of the
women were stopped because they were prostitutes that intended to
steal on board ships and sell their bodies, which is embarrassing
to the country.
</P>
<P>
But a report said that the security men were turning back any
woman in trousers without asking her of her mission or pass.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the acting spokesman of the Defense
Headquarters in Lagos, Colonel Godwin Ugbo said at a press
conference that there is no Nigerian law banning women from
wearing trousers publicly, nor is there an official directive to
the effect.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the problem is with the affected security
operatives who acted without any official directive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman assured Nigerian women that they would no longer
be attacked or embarrassed for wearing trousers to public
offices.
</P>
<P>
The event itself has ended here. But what revealed by an
investigation by a local newspaper is worth meditating.
</P>
<P>
Most people asked expressed their shock at this regrettable
occurrence at this age of enlightenment, saying that it is a
violation of women's fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
But there are indeed some people who are against women in
trousers. One contractor said trousers is for men, and the Bible
says women should not put on men's clothing. He added that he
would never allow his wife to wear trousers. A police officer
shared his opinion.
</P>
<P>
Others said women can wear trousers but not too tight ones and
not in offices.

<P>
LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Police and security operatives in
Delta State in southern Nigeria have begun investigation into an
alleged human parts market in Warri, a major city in the state.
</P>
<P>
The official News Agency of Nigeria reported today that the
order to conduct thorough investigations into the matter came
from the Presidency, which was disturbed by the alleged existence
of such a market.
</P>
<P>
A national newspaper in January this year reported the sale of
human parts at the Igbudu Market in Warri and stated the price of
each part of the human body.
</P>
<P>
There have been continuous reports of murders for ritual
purpose on Nigeria media.
</P>

Both the office of the state security services and the police
in Warri have confirmed the order to investigate the matter, the

<HEADLINE> Women's Development in Nigeria Under Discussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- As the International Woman's Day
draws near, many woman's organizations in Nigeria are turning
their search light on serious problems affecting the proper
development of women in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium organized by the Woman's Consortium of Nigeria
here today, woman activists expressed their keen concern over the
fact that in many parts of the world, especially Africa and
Nigeria included, women have been bearing the brunt of violence
and poor education.
</P>
<P>
The most prominent problem is the traffic of women for
prostitution to European countries, especially Italy, said
participants.
</P>
<P>
The root cause of the situation, which has caused AIDS and
other sex transmitted diseases among Nigerian girls, was
described by participants as the down-turn of the economy,
unprecedented unemployment and lack of parental control over
girls.
</P>
<P>
Today, they argued, how to stop this situation should be the
focus of the nation, rather than the wearing of trousers by
women, a topic that has recently triggered heated discussion
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
They called the entire society to stand to fight the traffic
of women for prostitution.

<HEADLINE> France Stresses Readiness to Offer Peace Helps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 6 (Xinhua) -- France reiterated this evening its
readiness to offer helps for an achievement of peace in the
Middle East region, especially between Lebanon and Israel and
between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, who arrived in
Beirut this evening from Damascus, held a meeting with Lebanese
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz in the latter's office.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 45-minute meeting, the French foreign
minister said that the Middle East peace process is currently in a
"state of stalemate."
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the situation is "dangerous"
for all sides, especially for south Lebanon, which could witness a
security deterioration in the course.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for us to let the situation to stay like
that," the French official underlined.
</P>
<P>
De Charette arrived in the region Tuesday and visited Israel
and Syria before arriving in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He called for a resumption of the Lebanese-Israeli and
Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations, adding that he has told all
those he met during the current Middle East tour that the
resumption was an "urgent need and is what all sides want."
</P>
<P>
France is eagerly seeking a more effective role of France and
the European Union in the Middle East peace process, an attempt
welcomed by the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The French minister re-stated that his country is ready to
provide help to "overpass this stage and to bring closer view
points for an achievement of peace especially on the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks."
</P>
<P>
De Charette emphasized a necessity for Lebanon to prevail its
sovereignty to all its lands.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, the French official clarified that he is
"not optimistic" over the present situations in the region,
adding that he is "objectively analyzing the things."
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to disclose what proposals he brought to
Israeli and Syrian leaders in order to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of missions of a five-nation
committee monitoring a limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli
border, but noted that the committee is "not enough" to reach a
peace.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee, comprising representatives
of France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States, was set
up under a truce agreement Lebanon and Israel reached in April,
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister, on the other hand, thanked his
French counterpart for his peace efforts and praised a French role
in seeking a resumption of peace negotiations for reaching a just
and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
After talks in the Foreign Ministry, the French foreign
minister, accompanied by Lebanese officials, went to the
Presidential Palace for talks with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Businessman on Attracting Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A leading member in Zambia's
business sector here today stressed the country's investment
strategy should be focused on certain objectives and be of long
term.
</P>
<P>
"We must define what areas we would like to attract
investment. This can be done by way of subject, e.g., agriculture
or tourism, or by geographical, area/location..." said G.
Chabwera, chairman of the Zambia Association of Chambers of
Commerce and Industry, at a forum on enhancing the country's
investment climate for sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
Referring to investment incentives, Chabwera said, they should
not concern only with foreigners but "should apply to all
investors regardless of where they come from."
</P>
<P>
He added that "it must be remembered that the responsibility
of developing any country first and foremost lies with the
nationals of that country."
</P>
<P>
In Chabwera's opinion, the investment policy should focus on
depressed areas with a view to creating new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said, "in this regard, it will require local authorities in
depressed areas to be more imaginative to attract investment in
their areas."
</P>
<P>
Good infrastructure is also inalienable to attract investors,
Chabwera stressed, as "investors do not just consider a country's
political stability. They consider a number of other factors such
as a good infrastructure, well developed transportation networks,
literate and dedicate labor force, good telecommunications#,good
health facilities and a lot more."
</P>
<P>
The tow-day forum is under the auspices of the Zambia
Investment Center. Government officials, businessmen and
entrepreneurs as well as researchers on economics are invited to
deliver papers and discuss how to effectively attract more
investment in the country.

today declared a state of emergency to control and withstand the
natural disaster that has reportedly befallen the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, in a statement issued
in Jijiga, capital city of the region, the Executive Committee of
the Regional Council said despite efforts to alleviate problems
emanating from scarcity of water in the area, the magnitude of
the disaster was found to be beyond the resources of the region.
</P>
<P>
It said, people have started to evacuate their villages due to
the acute shortage of water with animals as well as humans dying
from disaster that surfaced in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
The number of aid recipients which was estimated to be 200,000
earlier has now increased by three-fold, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
It called on governmental and humanitarian organizations to
cooperate in providing tank-trucks, water pumps and generators
and medicinal drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, the Somali region in eastern
Ethiopia was suffering from shortage of rains since last
September. Over 54,000 tons of food aid is required to feed some
600,000 victims in the drought area.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Foreign Debts Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's total foreign debts stood at
some 31 billion U.S. dollars till the end of June, 1996, down by
nearly 6 percent over a year ago, according to a recent annual
report by the Central Bank of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Per capita of foreign debts also slipped from 563.7
U.S. dollars by the end of June, 1992 to 515.4 dollars at the end
of June, 1996, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report ascribed the drop in the foreign debt to a boosted
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which achieved an average annual
increase of 13.8 percent during 1992-96.
</P>
<P>
It said the government's successful settlement of 1.9 billion
dollars into investments in Egypt also contributed to the fall of
debts.
</P>
<P>
Egypt owes 25.5 billion dollars, or 81.2 percent of its total
debts, to a group of developed donor countries in the Paris Club,
which has absolved Egypt from altogether 10 billion dollars of
debts over the recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, it is yet to pay 0.7 billion dollars to other
countries and 3.8 billion to international and regional financial
institutions, as well as short-term loans amounting to 1.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rather than borrowing and living in red, the reform-minded
Egyptian government is increasingly interested in investment as a
way of financing and has offered various privileges and premiums
to attract both domestic and foreign capital.

<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's housing market is
continuing to recover at a moderate pace, with prices rising by
0.5 percent in February, according to the Halifax Building Society
today.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, said that
the latest figures confirmed that January's fall in prices was a
one-off adjustment for the larger-than-expected rises at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, house prices were 6.8 percent higher last month than
they were a year ago, compared with an annual increase of 7.1
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Prices for first-time buyers rose sharply in February, by 2.1
percent, offsetting a two percent fall in January. On an annual
basis, house prices for first-time buyers rose five percent last
month.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally-adjusted average house price now stands at
66,612 pounds (107,245 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Halifax said that the housing market was recovering at a
moderate pace and was within its end-of-year forecast of seven
percent.

<HEADLINE> Research of Cassava in Nigeria Yields Dividend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The research efforts of the
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) based in
Nigeria has resulted in the production of a nutritious bread and
other baked products, using cassava and its starch, soybean
flour, margarine and eggs.
</P>
<P>
A recent investigation carried out by IITA researchers has
shown that 85 percent of consumers found the cassava bread good
or very good, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The idea of substituting part of wheat with other starchy
crops is not new. For more than 40 years, several institutions,
including the Food and Agriculture Organization, have carried out
researches designed to find ways to diluting wheat flour with
other sources of flour or replacing wheat altogether.
</P>
<P>
According to a research paper jointly provided by IITA's Mpoko
Bokanga and Olumide Tewe, the research achievement of their
institute is especially important because wheat needed to make
bread cannot be grown in most consuming areas in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Zaire, Tanzania, Madagascar and Cote D'Ivoire are
among the 10 countries in Africa that produce over 90 percent of
the cassava in the continent.
</P>
<P>
However, these countries import about two million tons of
wheat annually as their local wheat production capacity
represents less than seven percent of their wheat imports, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency, the world production of
cassava in 1990 was estimated at about 158 million tons, with 46
percent of it emanating from Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a separate paper, Bokanga revealed the traditional
preparation of cassava in Nigeria is efficient in detoxifying the
leaves and producing virtually cyanide-free goods.
</P>
<P>
The researcher is trying to confirm a conclusion at an earlier
workshop that there has been no evidence to show that death could
be attributed to cassava consumption.
</P>
<P>
His words are also helpful for the promotion of
cassava-related food items, especially bread and other baked
products, observers here said.

CAIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria has exported 900,000 tonnes of cereals in
1996, earning the country 179 million U.S. dollars, a
government announcement said here today.
</P>
<P>
Syria has over the past few years developed a great deal in
producing foodstuffs, and turned from a food-importing country to
a country of not only self-sufficiency, but also a
cereal-exporting state, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
By virtue of its high quality cereals, Syria has managed to
find its way into many markets in Europe, Asia and Africa. Syrian
cereals have been highly welcomed in the markets of India, Turkey,
Cyprus, Italy, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Jordan, it
added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Resettlement Programs Benefitting Northwest Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- In 1985, when 24 peasants from
poor mountainous parts of Gansu Province moved to a wasteland in
the western part of the province as part of a resettlement program
financed by the central government, it did not seem possible that
an oasis would take shape there.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, in this formerly desolate spot 20 kilometres from
Gaotai county, they live in decorated brick houses and no longer
feel homesick. Their granaries are full, and pigs and sheep wander
around in a carefree manner.
</P>
<P>
The oasis, now named Xinmin village, has become the second
hometown for 1,154 villagers, who came from Dingxi, a county in
the east that is known for its abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
Mao Zhimin was one of the 24 pioneers. His family of six
produced more than five tons of grains last year, and his wife
explains, "In Dingxi, we lived at nature's whim and could only
afford a meager life even in the best of years."
</P>
<P>
When asked about their income, the neatly dressed woman smiled
but said nothing, as the tiled-roof of her house with its four
spacious rooms and the tractor nearby spoke for her.
</P>
<P>
The peasants attribute their comfortable life to 12 years of
hard work, led by Shi Wenguo, the village's party secretary. He
was the first to move his whole family to the wilderness and lived
in an underground dwelling before a new house was built.
</P>
<P>
The settlers opened up wasteland, cultivating it, and dug
irrigation ditches. They also planted trees and grass in the off
season.
</P>
<P>
When the villagers settled in 1985, they had a good harvest
with a grain output of more than 3,750 kilograms per hectare, five
times that of their hometown.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, these poor people enjoyed enough food and
clothing. This in turn encouraged other peasants. Now 83,500 live
in 12 such resettlement bases.
</P>
<P>
A lack of water was at the root of their poverty in the
east. In the west, villagers regard water as their source of life
and 80 percent of the families have dug wells. They have even
raised 286,000 yuan to build an 26.7 km irrigation canal, in a
move to increase water utilization.
</P>
<P>
The villagers even funded a primary school and a mosque for the
278 Moslems in the village last year. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's women organizations have
had some remarkable results in helping the country's women promote
material civilization, cultural and ideological progress, and in
self-improvement in many ways, according to Hu Jintao, a member of
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks today at a gathering in Beijing for
International Women's Day, where he extended cordial greetings to
the women of all nationalities in China and to women working in
all areas on behalf of the Party Central Committee and State
Council.
</P>
<P>
His remarks attested to the important role the country's women
have played in building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. Women's participation in the country's reforms
and opening up and in the modernization drive has produced a large
number of model women in all fields and professions, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu encouraged those model women to be modest and prudent and to
act as guides for the rest of the people to contribute to the
country's construction. He emphasized that now is an important
time for China's socialist modernization, and that the whole
party and the people should work to promote the reforms and
opening-up, which were initiated by Deng Xiaoping, based on Deng's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Hu called on women and their federations, guided by Deng's
theory, to unite and work hard under the leadership of the Party
Central Committee with Jiang at the core, and to build China into
a strong, democratic and civilized country.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 people attended the gathering including
Vice-premier Wu Bangguo, alternate member of the Party Central
Committee's Political Bureau, Wen Jiabao, and vice chairwoman of
the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Chen Muhua.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is also president of the All-China Women's
Federation, spoke on women's contributions to the achievements of
China's socialist culture and ideology and of material progress.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the All-China Women's Federation, Chen extended
greetings to women worldwide and expressed her heartfelt thanks to
those who have devoted themselves to women's cause and have
contributed to China's development.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Jobless Rate Stands at 9.7 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in Canada
stood at 9.7 percent in February, little changed from the previous
month, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
"There was little movement in labour market conditions in
February," the federal agency said, noting that while the month's
employment fell slightly, the labour force also declined.
</P>
<P>
In February, Canada got 19,000 more part-time jobs, and lost
38,000 full-time jobs. Part-time jobs have grown at a faster pace
than full-time work since last September.
</P>
<P>
The full-time job loss was concentrated primarily among adult
women (down 44,000). In the meantime, adult men gained 23,000
full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Canadian youths still have great
difficulties to find jobs. The youth employment rate fell to 50.5
percent, the lowest in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In February, employment in retail trade and agriculture fell by
27,000 and 19,000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The losses were somewhat offset by gains of 14,000 jobs in
transportation, storage, communications and utilities industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of men and women at a
Cambodian rally to mark International Women's Day today called
for women's social status to be improved and their exploitation
stopped.
</P>
<P>
Some ten thousand people attended the rally in the capital's
Olympic stadium, demanding implementation of the constitution's
articles stipulating the abolition of all forms of discrimination
against women and the banning of any trade in human beings,
exploitation by prostitution and obscenity.
</P>
<P>
An eight-point declaration adopted at the rally called on the
government to ensure that more Cambodian women participate in
decision-making and to take concrete actions to increase their
representation in major decision-making positions.
</P>
<P>
The declaration calls for the setting up of emergency
intervention services to address the legal and material needs of
women who need help.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian women make up more than 55 percent of the population
yet are represented by no more than 10 deputies in the 120-member
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Queen Norodom Monineath, who is now in Beijing, sent a message
to the rally, calling upon Cambodian women to play bigger role in
the society of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also called for equal access to education for
women and men, girls and boys.

<HEADLINE> US Jobless Rate Dips to 5.3 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. unemployment rate dropped
to 5.3 percent in February from 5.4 percent in January, the U.S.
Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decline wasn't a big change. But the unexpectedly strong,
seasonally adjusted 339,000 job increase recorded on employers'
payrolls, the largest in nine months, was a sign that the robust
economy of yearend 1996 was carrying into this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that job growth last month was led by a 109,000
gain in construction sector, the strongest in a year, following a
scant 15,000 rise in January.
</P>
<P>
Service businesses showed an increase of 230,000 jobs, the best
in four months.
</P>
<P>
Retail trade recorded a seasonally adjusted increase of 49,000
jobs in February after a slight 2,000 decline in January while
manufacturing jobs edged down by 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Last month's overall job growth of 339,000 followed a gain of
247,000 in January which was revised down from an earlier estimate
of 271,000.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the unemployment rate to 5.3 percent in February
returns it to the level of December and November.
</P>
<P>
Today's employment report was seen by analysts as another sign
that the economic expansion would result in tightening of U.S.
monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve in coming months.

<HEADLINE> No Change in U.S.-Russia Summit Agenda: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin will stick to their one-day agenda
for the Helsinki summit, an official of the United States Embassy
to Finland said today, responding to rumor that the meeting day
has been moved forward.
</P>
<P>
The official reiterated that two presidents will, as planned,
hold the summit in the Finnish capital Helsinki on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Local media had speculated that the schedule might have been
adjusted and that talks might begin on March 19.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents are expected to focus on European security,
disarmament and bilateral economic relations, with particular
emphasis placed on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s
proposed eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
NATO is planning to admit new members from central and eastern
Europe. But Russia strongly opposes the plan, saying it would
pose a serious threat to the country's security.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the U.S.-Russia summit, the two heads of state will
meet Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari on the evening of March
19, the day they are scheduled to arrive in Helsinki.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Equality For Men And Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China is continuing with its
efforts to implement its state policy of equality between men and
women, says an editorial of the People's Daily, which is to be
published tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
On International Women's Day, the newspaper extends its
greetings to the women of different ethnic groups who are working
for a strong, democratic, and civilized nation.
</P>
<P>
China places great importance to women's development and
progress, and takes equality of men and women as a basic state
policy in promoting social development, the article quotes
President Jiang Zemin as saying in his speech on September 4,
1995, at the Fourth World Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
This policy is a decision of strategic importance in new
circumstances and is a solemn commitment to the international
community by the Chinese government for guaranteeing women's
rights and interests, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party has regarded women as a major force
during every stage of its revolution and construction, and
stipulations on the equality of men and women formed part of the
Constitution shortly after new China was founded in 1949, the
paper notes.
</P>
<P>
Since that time, Chinese women have enjoyed the same rights as
men in politics, economic activities, culture, society, and the
family.
</P>
<P>
The editorial continues that China has worked to reinforce
legal protections for women and established a legal system with
the Constitution as its base and the Law of the People's Republic
of China on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests as a
major part.
</P>
<P>
The quality of women reflects the nation's quality and
civilization. From now to the year 2010 is an important period for
Chinese women's development, the editorial notes.
</P>
<P>
Government at all levels must take effective steps to guarantee
women's rights and interests in the areas of family planning, land
and environmental protection, it stresses.
</P>
<P>
The new conditions present opportunities for women's
development and progress - but also challenges. For women to fully
enjoy equal rights with men will still require more time and
difficult work. Chinese women should continue the spirit of
self-respect, self-confidence, self-reliance, and self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
They should also make full use of their role of "holding up
half the sky" and greet the Party's 15th National Congress with
remarkable achievements, the editorial concludes. enditem

<HEADLINE> EU's New Harmonized Annual Inflation at 2.2 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The annual inflation rate of the
European Union (EU) in January was 2.2 percent, up from
2.7 percent a year earlier, the European Commission (EC) said
today, using a new harmonized method of calculation.
</P>
<P>
The figures calculated under the new Harmonized Indices of
Consumer Prices (HICP) showed that among the 15 EU countries,
Finland registered the lowest inflation rate of 0.9 percent,
followed by Luxembourg and Sweden, both with 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Greece had the highest inflation rate of 6.6 percent, followed
by Portugal and Spain, both with 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new standardized figures showed that biggest rises over the
year were in Denmark (from 1.2 percent to 2.6 percent) and Belgium
(from 1.3 percent to 2.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
In five member states, January's inflation rate was lower than
a year before. There was a big fall in Italy -- from an estimated
5.7 percent to 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures under the new method of calculation showed some
countries with different inflation rates compared with those
previously published by national statistics agencies.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Sweden's harmonized inflation rate rose to 1.3
percent compared with the nationally published deflation of
0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The harmonized rise in Britain was 2.1 percent, lower than the
nationally reported 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the EU's Maastricht Treaty, a country's average
inflation rate observed over a year before joining Economic
Monetary Union (EMU) should "not exceed by more than 1.5
percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing
member states in terms of price stability".
</P>
<P>
The EU will use the harmonized indices early next year to judge
which countries will qualify for EMU.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that all 15 EU member states except Greece
meet or are close to meet the inflation standard required for them
to join the single currency in 1999.

<HEADLINE> More Earthquakes Hit Japanese Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- More earthquakes struck the Izu
Peninsula 120 kilomters southwest of Tokyo today, but caused no
damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
The quakes measured up to five on the Japanese intensity scale
of seven, and 4.7 on the Richter Scale in Ito city on the
peninsula, the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Since Monday, more than 6,000 quakes, most of them too weak to
be felt by residents, have been recorded in the area.
</P>
<P>
The epicentres were off the east coast of the Izu peninsula,
but there is no threat of tidal waves, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Ito, a popular coastal resort, has suffered a big fall in
tourism since the earthquake swarm started. Some 40,000 tourists
have so far cancelled hotel reservations.

<HEADLINE> EU Threatens WTO Action on U.S. Textile Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is threatening
to challenge U.S. trade rules classifying Italian scarves, German
furnishings or British cotton goods as "Made in China" or "Made in
India" even when they are prepared and designed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission (EC) has decided to launch "a formal
complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) if no solution is
offered by the U.S. in a reasonable period of time," an EC
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
America's "rules of origin" say that even if a piece of grey
cloth imported from China, India, Pakistan or elsewhere is cut,
bleached, shrunk, dyed, printed or labelled in Europe, it does not
benefit from being classified as of EU origin.
</P>
<P>
"These rules could harm top European designers and clothing
manufacturers either by resulting in quotas or by undermining
quality European labels as a selling point among American
customers," the Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU's action follows a complaint from Federtessile, an
Italian organization representing Italian textile and clothing
manufacturers, and is supported by exporters of flat textile
products from all over the EU.
</P>
<P>
According to Federtessile, Italian silk clothing producers fear
that 57 million Ecus (about 66 million U.S. dollars) of their
exports will be affected.
</P>
<P>
Under the new EU Trade Barriers Regulation, individual
companies as well as federations and EU governments can ask the
Commission to investigate barriers to their exports and to launch
international proceedings if no suitable solution is found.

"We resumed the custom of going on pilgrimage to Mecca in 1978,
and every year some five to six thousand people do so," Shen
added.
</P>
<P>
Master Ming Yang, 80-year-old vice-chairman of the Chinese
Buddhist Association, said that Buddhism is flourishing in China,
citing a recent grand ritual of Buddhism in east China's Shanghai
that attracted tens of thousands of domestic and overseas
believers.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jiyu, vice secretary-general of the Chinese Taoist
Association and the 65th-generation offspring of the founder of
Taoism, said that the essence of Taoism has been completely inherited
in China, and that a lot of people in and out of China have taken
interest in Taoist culture.
</P>
<P>
He noted that recently the world environmental protection fund
had invited Chinese Taoist priests to participate in global
environmental protection efforts, because it held that some ideas
of Taoism could help remove problems in the industrial society.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is urgent for us to train some priests that
speak foreign languages," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The five religious leaders, who are members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, China's top advisory body, said that a religious
believer in real sense should also care about national affairs,
and try to do good to the society.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that it is their duty to make known to the
government the opinions of religious believers.
</P>
<P>
"Both the Party and the government have attached much
importance to such opinions," said Zong Huaide.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Principal figures of China's five
leading religions said here today that they are contented with the
current situation for the development of their religions.
</P>
<P>
The five religions are Protestantism, Catholicism,
Islamism and Buddhism, which were introduced from foreign
countries, and Taoism, China's native religion.
</P>
<P>
"Within the confines of the Constitution and other laws, we enjoy
sufficient religious freedom and rights," said Han Wenzao,
Chairman of the China Christian Council.
</P>
<P>
China now has 10 million protestants, 12,000 churches, and a
joint venture publishing house that prints the Holy Bible in
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
"Some people allege that China has no Bibles and that we have
to smuggle the book from abroad. This is not true," said Han.
</P>
<P>
A major challenge for the Chinese Protestantism now is how to
help some of the believers to get rid of some heretic ideas, such
as preferring prayers to medicines for the cure of diseases.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are four million people in China that believe
in Catholicism, which came to the country more than 300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"From the countryside to towns and cities, all Chinese
Catholics can lead a normal, open and pleasant religious life,"
said Zong Huaide, Chairman of the Chinese Catholic Bishops
College.
</P>
<P>
Shen Xiaxi, advisor to the Chinese Islamic Association, of
which he served as chairman for 15 years, said that Islamism
has 19 million believers from 10 ethnic groups in China.

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore Oil

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua)-- The opposition and over-reaction of
the British side to the establishment of the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) is unreasonable and unnecessary, and it
will produce no impact on the smooth transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made by Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian said outside concern over the future of Hong Kong is
"understandable" while declaring that "no foreign country has the
right to interfere in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference organized by the press center of China's
legislature, the National People's Congress, Qian said it's
understandable that many countries are interested in the
development of Hong Kong as they have interests in the financial,
commercial and economic sectors of Hong Kong, an international
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
However, if some countries think that they have the right to
interfere in the affairs of Hong Kong, "they are going too far,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed confidence in the prosperity of Hong Kong after
its return to China when it becomes a special administrative
region of China.
</P>
<P>
"Many people who left Hong Kong have returned during the
transitional period," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the election of HKSAR deputies to the Ninth NPC, Qian noted
that anyone who recognizes the Chinese Constitution and meets
qualifications as stipulated in the election method can stand for
voting.
</P>
<P>
The basis for conducting talks across the Taiwan Straits is the
recognition that there is only one China in the world, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question by a reporter from Taiwan, Qian said
that China has always stood for direct cross-strait shipping, mail
services and trade.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, up to now, it has seemed that the Taiwan
authorities are reluctant to talk about 'one China,' do not dare
to do so, and are afraid to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, how can can direct negotiations
between the two sides proceed?" he said.

<P>
"I think the basis for such negotiations is the recognition
that there is only one China in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to another question, Qian said that as China's
foreign minister he will not visit Taiwan since Taiwan is part of
China.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Dalai Lama's planned visit to Taiwan later
this month, Qian urged the Taiwan authorities to adopt a prudent
and wise attitude toward Dalai's visit, which is aimed to split
China.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the Taiwan authorities will not do
anything detrimental to the reunification of the motherland and
national unity.
</P>
<P>
Everybody knows the Dalai Lama is a political figure in exile,
who has long been engaged in activities aiming at splitting the
motherland, and his visit will inevitably have political purposes.
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to any activities of any one in whatever form
that are aimed to split the motherland," Qian warned.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Qian said China will continue implementing the
foreign policy laid down under Deng Xiaoping's guidance during the
past decade and more.
</P>
<P>
China will make efforts to create a good multilateral
environment for the nation's modernization drive, safeguard world
peace, oppose hegemonism, promote cooperation in the international
community and seek common development, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on the Korean Peninsula, he said that
China always attaches importance to the maintenance of peace and
stability there, and that it has been making unremitting efforts
to this end.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to say whether or not a new peace mechanism on the
Korean Peninsula can be established in the near future, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's true that sometimes incidents happen on the Korean
Peninsula and when such sudden and individual accidents and
incidents occur, China hopes such incidents and problems could be
resolved in a way that will not affect peace and stability on the
Korean Peninsula," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nazarbayev Advises NATO to Be Cautious About Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- NATO must carefully consider the
effects of its proposed eastward expansion to avoid
misunderstanding and mistrust between the military alliance and
Russia, Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
NATO needs to redefine its role in a post-Cold War Europe now
that the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military bloc no longer exists and
the Cold War has ended, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev was speaking after a meeting with his Lithuanian
counterpart Algirdras Brazauskas and ahead of Monday's visit by
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana for talks on the alliance's
eastward expansion and admission of new members from eastern
European countries.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Russia should not be excluded from the process
of European integration. Each state has the right to find its own
methods of defending its independence and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said he and Solana would also discuss planned joint
military maneuvres between Kazakhstan and NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas, who arrived here Thursday evening, is scheduled to
conclude the visit today.

<P>
On the incident of Hwang Jang-yob, the Chinese foreign minister
also urged the parties concerned to keep cool-headed in order to
resolve the incident properly and promptly.
</P>
<P>
Essentially speaking, the Hwang Jang-yob incident is a matter
between the north and south of the Korean Peninsula, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, this incident took place in Beijing, therefore China
has jurisdiction over the settlement of the incident, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China is right now conducting investigations and we
will follow the international law and conventional international
practices to resolve this problem.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, China will take into account the need to
facilitate peace and stability on the Korean peninsular, he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment at a press conference on a book recently
published in the US which predicts that a conflict between the two
countries is inevitable, he said there is now no possibility for
China and the United States to enter into conflicts with each
other, unless China's territorial integrity and sovereignty are
infringed upon.
</P>
<P>
Qian said, "I don't think this is a correct conclusion as there
is no possibility for China and the US to enter into conflicts
with each other unless the US harbors a desire to infringe upon
China's sovereignty and its territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, that kind of theory is a continued replica of
the `China threat' theory," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"As far as our policy towards the relations with the US is
concerned, we implement the following principles, namely, to
increase trust, reduce trouble, develop cooperation, and avoid
confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, this was what President Jiang said during
a meeting with President Clinton shortly after the latter's
assumption of office several years ago," he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
"And the US side has already expressed their appreciation of
the policy," he said, "Not long ago, President Clinton also
emphasized that the US proceeds a policy of engagement with China
rather than a policy of containment."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome that," he added.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the policies of the Chinese and US governments are
concerned, we have a common ground and common interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I'm confident that we can expect that Sino-US relationship
will grow," Qian said, "I don't think that there is any
possibility that the two countries will enter into a conflict."

<P>
He said China's position on the question of human rights is to
conduct dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect, and
oppose confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, dialogue and confrontation are incompatible, and
it is impossible to have both. We prefer to have dialogue," he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, he said China attaches great
importance to the development of its relations with the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
China's relation with the European Union at present is quite
good, and in particular last year the Meeting of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was held in Bangkok, which for
the first time brought leaders of Asian and European countries
together, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the relations between Asia and Europe have been
growing smoothly and so have the relations between China and the
European Union, he said.
</P>
<P>
China always attaches importance to its relations with the
European Union, because this is in the interest of world peace,
economic development and will contribute to the emergence of a
more balanced world.
</P>
<P>
When asked about China's viewpoint towards the eastward
expansion of NATO, Qian said that as an military block, any
measure that it takes should accommodate to the interests of
Europe and the region's peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
On a question on relations between China and France, he said
the relations of the two countries are at the moment in very good
shape, particularly since the two countries reached an agreement
in January 1994 whereby the French side made a commitment that it
would not adopt measures to arm Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ever since then the relations between China and France have
been growing rapidly, he said, adding that French President
Jacques Chirac will pay a visit to China in May.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this visit will be of major significance to the
promotion of the relations between China and France," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the Sino-Australian relations, Qian said there
is a very good chance for the development of Sino-Australian
relations after some twists and turns last year. The Chinese
foreign minister said he hoped that the scheduled visit by Prime
Minister John Howard to China would be a great success.

On China's relations with Japan, Qian said he hopes that the
China visit by the Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda at the
end of this month will help improve relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We will have a good discussion and we hope that our
relationship can develop positively," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said this year marks the 25th anniversary of the
normalization of relations between China and Japan and this is an
occasion for joint commemorations and celebrations by China and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Regretfully, however, the Sino-Japanese relations have often
been subjected to various kinds of disturbances," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that we can minimize such disturbances so as to
develop our relationship on a sound track."
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question on the Nansha Islands, Qian said that it
is China's consistent position to shelve disputes for joint
development.
</P>
<P>
"We have already reached common understanding to varying
degrees with many countries concerned, so I do not think this will
evolve into a very big issue," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there has been significant development in
China's relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(Asean).
</P>
<P>
As a full dialogue parter of the Asean, China has, among
others, already established the China-Asean Joint Cooperation
Committee and held a number of joint activities.
</P>
<P>
And soon China and the Philippines will co-sponsor a
confidence-building meeting in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about the possible sponsoring by the
United States of a resolution on human rights against China at
this year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Qian
said this is no news. And China prefers dialogue to confrontation
on the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Since the beginning of the 1990s, the United States and EU
countries have for six consecutive years tabled anti-China
resolutions in Geneva, and every time they have suffered defeat,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"If they insist on doing the same thing this year, I can't see
any different outcome," he said.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The transition of Hong Kong will
be smooth and the territory's prosperity and way of life will be
preserved well into the next century, Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa said here today.
</P>
<P>
He was giving a concluding speech to a conference on financial
integration in Asia and the role of Hong Kong, which was attended
by hundreds of central bankers and financial executives from Asia
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
Tung referred to the tremendous commitment by the Chinese
leadership to the upholding of the concept of "one country, two
systems" and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
This has been "reaffirmed in both words and deeds" in the two
and a half months since he became chief executive of the future
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung pledged that he and his administration will stick to the
"one country, two systems" policy and the Basic Law and ensure
their proper application after July 1.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the participants of the conference for the optimism
they expressed over Hong Kong's future, saying this is very
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll showed that the confidence level of people in
Hong Kong and the international community which has investment in
Hong Kong has never been higher, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung also emphasized the significance of the territory's
cooperation with other economies in Asia in light of growing
economic and financial integration in the region.
</P>
<P>
"China's prosperity is Hong Kong's prosperity and Asia's
prosperity is Hong Kong's prosperity," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Tung hoped to visit Hong Kong's Asian neighbors to extend them
his hand of friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In the next century, people will see a Hong Kong which is
stable, equitable, compassionate and democratic with clarity of
direction and unity of purpose, he concluded.

HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Industrial Investment
(Holdings) Co. Ltd. (SIIC), the investment vehicle of China's
largest metropolis Shanghai, contracted a syndicated loan totaling
135 million U.S. dollars here today.
</P>
<P>
Jointly arranged by nine international banks, the five-year
loan facility will be pumped into promising industrial companies
in Shanghai, one of the fastest-growing areas in China.

The SIIC is the parent company of Shanghai Industrial Holdings
Limited (Shanghai Industrial), which went public on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange in May 1996 and injected the first batch of assets
into the listed company six months later. The subsidiary company
has become one of the quality chips chased up by punters on the
Hong Kong stock market.

MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
held talks with his Belarussian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko,
today on speeding up integration between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus had "the closest relations," which must be
strengthened to reach a level of integration "superior to that in
Europe or elsewhere in the world," Yeltsin said during the meeting
in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
He told Lukashenko that the two countries, both former Soviet
republics, "are not just friends but are on the way to
establishing a community."
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the community between the two sovereign
states was not simple, but that was in line with "the wishes of
our two peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, who arrived in Moscow Thursday for a working visit,
has repeatedly called for reunification with Russia since he was
elected president in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also signed a joint statement at the meeting
assessing all the aspects of the community, Dmitry Ryurikov,
Yeltsin's assistant on international affairs, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus signed a treaty on establishing a union in
April 1996, but progress toward integration has been slow.

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice premier Jiang Chunyun
today stressed that efforts on flood prevention should be stepped
up to guarantee the safety of life and property and a good
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark when joining Hunan province deputies to
the National People's Congress (NPC) in discussing Premier Li
Peng's government work report.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, urged
provincial and local authorities in Hunan, central China, to make
preparations to prevent floods this year.
</P>
<P>
Located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and with
China's second largest lake, the Dongting, in its lap, Hunan is
among the most vulnerable to serious floods.
</P>
<P>
He called for giving top priority to preventing big rivers,
lakes and reservoirs from overflowing in the flood season, with
more fund and other input invested in water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
Flood prevention facilities in urban areas should also be
improved, Jiang added.

<HEADLINE> Competition in China's Feed Market Getting Tougher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Liu Yongxing, the manager of
China's biggest individually-owned enterprise, the Hope Group,
announced here today that the company will slash the price of its
fodder by an average of 350 yuan a ton in east China as of
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The company now is one of the country's feed-processing giants
and sold 4.5 billion yuan worth of feed products last year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in east China will benefit greatly from the cut, Liu
said, noting that his company will maintain its sales of 25,000
ton per month in east China alone this year.
</P>
<P>
A local observer said that one main reason for the Hope Group's
move was an earlier announcement by another feed-processing giant,
the Dajiang Company, that it would cut its prices by 4 to 15
percent. Another factor was that China had good harvests last
year, which brought down both grain prices and plant costs in feed
production.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have been hoping that the price of feed, which has been
rising in the past several years, will come down to suit their
business.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the price war will fuel the fire of
competition among feed-processors. In the process, however, small
companies will lose out in the fierce competition, Liu pointed
out.

LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The mystery of how the world's
oldest flying reptile managed to glide through the air has been
solved after nearly a century of speculation.
</P>
<P>
The Coelurosauravus, which lived in western Europe and
Madagascar 260 million years ago, turns out to have glided with
wings that unfolded like a Japanese fan. Past researchers had been
so perplexed by its fossil remains that some believed that they
had become mixed up with those of another animal.
</P>

Paleontologists report in the journal Science that
Coelurosauravus evolved long, bony rods - separate from the
rest of its body - that it spread when it wanted to fly and
retracted afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"It had an elaborate skin flap with spokes," said Professor
Hans-Dieter Sues, a curator at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada,
one of the researchers. "This was an early attempt to build a
flying apparatus." The attempt was never repeated after
Coelurosauravus became extinct 250 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came last year when Prof Sues and his
colleagues in Germany obtained a complete skeleton that had been
discovered buried in copper shale in central Germany.

<HEADLINE> Human Cloning Could Be Possible Within Two Years: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Human cloning could happen in less
than two years, according to the scientist who caused worldwide
uproar last week when he revealed he had successfully cloned a
sheep called Dolly.
</P>
<P>
But Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh said on
Thursday that such work should be banned.
</P>
<P>
Wilmut told the Science and Technology Select Committee he
believed the technique could be applied to human beings, if
researchers were determined to do it, a press release from the
institute said.
</P>
<P>
"I've hesitated to make predictions, but I'm sure if you really
wanted to do it you could do it," he said. "But if you were
prepared to make that sort of effort, you would expect to make
significant progress in one or two years."
</P>
<P>
He said that everyone at the institute and PPL Therapeutics,
the company collaborating with the cloning research team, believed
that such work involving human embryos would be offensive and
should be prohibited.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Qian Guifang, a woman villager in
east China's Zhejiang Province, was trying to get rid of the pests
in her greenhouse but ended up killing her vegetables instead
because she had used the wrong pesticides.
</P>
<P>
That was several years ago. Now, after having taken courses
from a farming correspondence school and having graduated from it,
she has learned more about the use of pesticides and her income
from growing vegetables has more than doubled. Last year, she set
up a strawberry association with 49 other local women.
</P>
<P>
Qian is one of 23,000 rural women in the province who have
received training from the Provincial Farming Technique
Correspondence College, a kind of school that is becoming more
common in various parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Women account for 70 percent of the illiterate people in
Zhejiang. With the help of local science and technology
associations and women's federations, however, special training
classes have been set up for rural women to provide instruction in
agriculture, cooking, accounting, law, health care and fashion
design.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Provincial Farming Technique Correspondence College
alone has opened 232 women's classes, from which more than 10,000
rural women have graduated and been given the title of farming
technician.

</P>
<P>
Richard Stirland, director general of the Manila-based airlines

<HEADLINE> Cooperation Between Shanghai and Southwest China Strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and financial center, is making a special effort to
increase co-operation with Yunnan, an under-developed province in
southwest China that is inhabited by ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), Shanghai's
average annual GNP exceeded 240 billion yuan (29 billion US
dollars) three times the figure for 1990. Yunnan's, however,
remains under-developed because of a lack of technology and
administrative personnel, even though it is rich in natural
resources like nonferrous metals, and biological and
hydro-electric energy resources.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has set aside 500 million yuan to help the ethnic
minority groups escape poverty in the province. Twelve counties
and urban districts in the Shanghai area have built 1,500 projects
in Yunnan, involving a total investment of 200 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Under a bilateral cooperation agreement for the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000), Shanghai will help Yunnan improve pillar
industries like chemistry, tourism, light industry, and finance,
and Yunnan will provide Shanghai with nonferrous metals,
chemicals, timber, tobacco, and pharmaceuticals. Shanghai is also
scheduled to build five trade centers and 100 Shanghai-funded or
joint venture chain stores.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai also plans to train 4,000 specialists and 5,000
skilled workers for Yunnan by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Senior Army Officer Emphasizes Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A good job must be done in
safeguarding stability, Liu Huaqing, a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China, said today.
</P>
<P>
Joining a group discussion of the Shanxi delegation to the
Eighth National People's Congress, which has been in session since
last Saturday, Liu said this year is important in the development
history of China.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts should be made to reinforce unity among people of all
ethnic groups, unity between the army and the government, and
unity between the army and civilians, in order to push forward the
cause of socialist development with one heart and one mind," said
Liu, who is also a vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who once lived and worked in the Taihang Mountain area of
Shanxi, commended the province's effort to promote both material
and ethical-cultural progresses under the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, in accordance with the basic line of the Party,
and under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has over the past years enjoyed rapid economic
development, good agricultural harvests, industrial progress and a
reduction in the size of poverty-stricken areas, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, Shanxi has scored considerable achievements in
infrastructural development, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Shanxi was a revolutionary base that made huge
contributions in the war times. He called on local officials to
further arouse the initiative and creativity of the masses, so as
to speed up economic development.
</P>
<P>
Liu also had discussions with the deputies on Premier Li Peng's
government work report and on the draft national defense law.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Urges Closer Ties Between ASEAN, SADC </HEADLINE>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today stressed the importance of closer links
between the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which he said could
benefit all their members.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN, one of the world's top economic growth areas with a
population of 400 million, would give the members of the
predominantly "southern" association a voice that could not be
ignored by the world, he said in a public lecture here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SADC, with a population of 150 million, is also
setting out on a path toward a free trade area and this has made
it an ideal destination for investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Malaysia and South Africa would promote the prospects
of successful relations between their regions.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Malaysia share many common aspirations and as
both are building up links, he said, adding that they could
promote their broader endeavors to construct regional associations
and linkages.
</P>
<P>
Describing Malaysia as a model that advocates cooperative
regional relations in the wake of the colonial era, Mandela said
South Africa wants to learn more about Malaysia's economic
policies which have proven to be successful in overcoming the
legacy of colonialism and poverty.
</P>
<P>
During the question-and-answer session, Mandela said South
Africa could only overcome social apartheid with strong economic
growth to significantly improve the living standards of the
majority.

HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has produced a series
of 18 brochures on favorite tourist spots in each of its 18
administrative districts to help tourists explore the unique
characteristics of the oriental city.
</P>
<P>
The brochures provide a systematic guide to places of interest,

<P>
Director of Home Affairs Shelly Lau hoped that the series of
brochures, titled "Hong Kong Eighteen Districts Tourism Guide,"
can help further promote the booming tourism industry in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the traditional sightseeing spots such as the
Ocean Park, the Victoria Peak and the Repulse Bay, the new
brochures are likely to offer tourists more choices to gain a
deeper understanding of the city, which attracted about 11.7
million overseas tourists in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For children and students, the guide is good educational
materials as it gives them knowledge of the history and
development of the 18 administrative districts, the official

<HEADLINE> Unity, Prosperity to Be Treasured in Literary, Art Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The current good situation in
China's literary and art sector that is marked by unity and
prosperity should be cherished, said some members of China's top
advisory body.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing to do is to adhere to Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as
guidance for literary and artistic creation, they held, and to
advocate normal art criticism and refrain from meaningless debate
and arguments.
</P>
<P>
The members are here attending the Fifth Session of the
National Committee of the Eighth Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Literature and art have developed and thrived in China since
the late 1970s when Deng Xiaoping came back onto the country's
political scene, said Liu Yanping, a musician.
</P>
<P>
Literary and art circles were especially encouraged by Deng's
congratulatory message to the Fourth National Conference of the
Chinese Writers' Association, "which brought spring to the
country's literary and art circles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years, membership of national associations
for writers and artists has risen from 30,000 to 60,000, and there
are 2.4 million writers and artists if membership of local
associations are counted in.
</P>
<P>
Each year, hundreds of novels and tens of thousands of short
stories, poems and film plays are published.
</P>
<P>
At the Sixth National Congress of the Chinese Writers
Association held last year, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
that Chinese writers and artists are worthy of the trust of the
Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the airing of views on an equal basis, advocated
literary and art criticism on a scientific basis, and called on
writers and artists to adhere to the basic theory, line,
principles and policies of the Party.
</P>
<P>
Without stability and unity, literature and arts cannot
flourish, said actor Li Moran.
</P>
<P>
Most writers and artists attending the current CPPCC National
Committee session expressed their wish to create works that are
appreciated by people and will endure.

<HEADLINE> East China's Province Achieves Economic Soft Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's coastal Fujian
Province scored a GDP increase of 15 percent, while its retail
price increased by 4.5 percent in 1996, achieving a successful
soft landing.
</P>
<P>
The inflation pressure is apparently relaxing and has plummeted
to the same low level of 1992.
</P>
<P>
In line with the state's macro-economic control measures
started in late 1993, Fujian has taken measures to maintain its
stable economic development.
</P>
<P>
Its total agricultural output value reached 90 billion yuan in
1996, a record high increase of 11 percent. Peasants shared 2,380
yuan of per capita income, up 8 percent after allowing for price
rises, approaching a relatively comfortable standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Fujian invited four billion US dollars of overseas
investment, and its exports exceeded 10 billion US dollars for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade and joint ventures have become a major
contributor to the province's industrial growth and promoted its
formation of an export-oriented economic structure.  enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left Cairo before noon today for Paris on a brief one-day visit to
France.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak is scheduled to hold talks with French
President Jacques Chirac on the hurdles that confront the Middle
East peace process and ways of overcoming them.
</P>
<P>
At the summit meeting, the seventh of its kind since Chirac
assumed office in May 1995, the two leaders would also deal with
the prospects of promoting bilateral relations, burning issues in
Africa and matters of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents are meeting at a decisive juncture in the
history of the regional peace process as tension prevails due to
the Israeli government's approval late last month to build a new
Jewish settlement in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Syrian-Israeli negotiations, suspended in February
1996, have not yet been resumed so far.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak is due to proceed Saturday to Washington on
an official five-day visit to the United States. A summit meeting
is scheduled to take place Monday in the U.S. capital between
Presidents Mubarak and Bill Clinton, dealing with the Middle East
peace process, bilateral relations and regional security.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak held talks today before departing Cairo with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on the latest developments in
the Middle East peace process particularly on the Palestinian-
Israeli track.

<P>
CAIRO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Mideast countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and the United States have agreed to set up a
joint committee to promote trade between the two countries, the
local newspaper The Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The committee will follow up meetings and contacts made through
the Egyptian exports promotion mission based in Washington and New
York, said Investment Authority Chairman Ibrahim Fawzi upon his
return home from a visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt is stepping up efforts to promote sales of
agricultural produce to European countries.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are under way between Egypt and such European
countries as France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Holland on how to
boost Egypt's export, said Director of Egypt's Agriculture
Research Center Saad Nassar, quoted by the local newspaper Al
Gomhuria today.
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Deputy Premier and Minister for Trade Timothhy
Fischer is now in the Middle East region on a 10-day tour in a bid
to promote his country's exports of good and services.
</P>
<P>
His seven-nation trip would take him to Kuwait, Egypt, Lebanon,
Jordan, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates from
March 6 to 16. He also planned to meet with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Saudi Arabia will set up a new petrochemical
complex at a cost of around 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in a bid to
expand its chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
The engineering studies had already been completed and the
project would be launched in the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The plant was expected to come into operation early
2000 with an annual production capacity of 800,000 tonnes of

<HEADLINE> Deputies Call for Economies of Scale  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) - - When it comes to economies of
scale, China's automobile industry is heading toward the very
opposite.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the National People's Congress, which has been in
session since last Saturday, said that they are gravely worried by
the fact that China is quickly becoming a country with the largest
number of automotive plants in the world.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that at least 22 of the country's
provincial-level administrative areas have chosen carmaking as a
pillar industry. Nationwide, China now has more than 160
automotive plants, with each producing merely 8,000 vehicles
annually on average.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Geng Zhaojie, chairman of the No. 1 Automobile Group
Company, China's largest motor works, said: "China cannot build 22
Detroits."
</P>
<P>
"It's the right time for China to make up its mind and solve
the long-term, persistent problem of indiscriminately launching
repetitive projects," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has vowed to make a change in the growth
mode for the national economy, from one based on increasing
investment to one based on technological progresses.
</P>
<P>
Geng cited some statistics to highlight the necessity to pursue
economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
The largest three US manufacturers last year turned out 9.87
million vehicles, the largest seven in Japan 10.11 million units,
and the largest three in Germany 4.27 million units.
</P>
<P>
China produced 1.47 million motor vehicles last year, with
the top two's outputs standing at 200,000 and 180,000 vehicles
respectively.

<P>
"The way to survive in the automotive sector is to pursue
economies of scale," Geng said. "If it does not readjust the
economic structure of its automotive industry, China will lose its
foothold in the field in international competition."
</P>
<P>
Xu Penghang, deputy-director of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said that the Chinese economy is moving from
quantitative expansion to qualitative upgrading and is evolving into a
"buyers' market" from a "sellers' market."
</P>
<P>
Low-level repetitive construction in the process of quantitative
expansion over the past years has resulted in a relative surplus
of production capacities, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Of the tens of thousands of large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises, only 35 percent make full use of their production
capacities, while 45 percent have one-third of their capacities
lying idle, according to official data.
</P>
<P>
The deputies said that effort should be made to prevent a new
round of repetitive construction in the campaign to improve the
product mix and the industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
"You must not rush to launch a new project just because others
have made money in similar projects, or there will be new losses
of resources," one deputy said.
</P>
<P>
Hu Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China, said: "The crux lies in choosing a
pillar industry in accordance with real conditions so as to foster
comparative advantages among different regions."
</P>
<P>
In restructuring the economy, Shanxi, China's largest coal
producer, will focus on improving the structure of its energy
industry to turn its advantages in coal into economic advantages,
Hu said.

Yu Hanqing, chairman of the Standing Committee of Chongqing
Municipal People's Congress, said that Chongqing will consider the
drive to restructure the economy as a new development opportunity
to transform its old industries.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Chongqing has 49 of the existing 50 industries in
China, Yu said, adding that his city has selected machinery,
metallurgy and chemicals as its pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
"We will transform and develop the three industries massively
in the next ten to 15 years to raise their proportion in total
industrial output to 40 percent, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Though consensus has been reached on economic restructuring,
the deputies pointed out, there are difficulties of a fairly big
magnitude in practice.
</P>
<P>
Economist Dong Fureng said that the biggest problem is regional
and departmental protectionism and an immature capital market.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of liquidity of the capital market and administrative
intervention by different regions and departments have combined to
make it difficult to restructure existing capital and assets," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, to readjust the structure, we must beef up our
effort to reform," he said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Guancong, chairman of a Shanghai electronics company,
echoed Dong, saying: "The realistic way to improve the economic
structure is to achieve economies of scale through restructuring
enterprises' existing capital and assets and through technical
renovations."
</P>
<P>
The 33 subsidiaries of Huang's company used to produce 12
similar products before they were incorporated into a group, and
at the time 22 of them lost money.
</P>
<P>
After restructuring the enterprises into 13 factories, the
group as a whole has reversed the trend and has begun making
capital investment in neighboring Jiangsu Province and Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region in the north.
</P>
<P>
"As for the automotive sector, focusing our effort on forming
large enterprise groups will fundamentally change the now
irrational sectoral structure," said Ma Yue, general manager of
Dongfeng Automobile Group Company, China's second largest.

<HEADLINE> HK Hosts Meeting on Asian Financial Integration, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A one-day conference was held
here today on financial integration in Asia, the fastest growing
region in the world, and the role of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, co-organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), brought together top
policy makers, leading central bankers and financial executives
from Asia and beyond.
</P>
<P>
They reassessed the process of economic and financial
integration that has been taking place in Asia and examined the
role that Hong Kong can play in the region now and in the future.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech at the meeting, IMF Managing Director
Michel Camdessus claimed that Hong Kong is "a prime example of an
economy that has managed rapid structural transformation in an
increasingly integrated world economy in a most successful way."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's prudent monetary policy, built around the exchange
rate link to the U.S. dollar and supported by a tight and
rule-based fiscal policy, has created an environment of
macroeconomic stability and investor confidence, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Basic Law and the principle of "one
country, two systems" provide confidence that this policy
framework will continue.
</P>
<P>
"IMF and World Bank members will have the opportunity to see
the 'one country, two systems' approach in action in September
when they come to Hong Kong for the joint annual meetings," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
Governor Dai Xianglong from the People's Bank of China
reassured the participants that the status of Hong Kong as an
international financial center will be "preserved and further
enhanced" after it returns to China.
</P>
<P>
Under the Basic Law, the principles governing the monetary
relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland can be
summarized as two currencies, two monetary systems and two
monetary authorities under two different social and economic
systems within one sovereign country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers included Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the
future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, British Chancellor
of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, Hong Kong Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang and central bankers and financial officials from
South Korea, Singapore, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Australia.

DHAKA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina garlanded the portrait of her father Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman at the Bangabandhu Museum here this morning in
observance of the historic March 7 day.
</P>
<P>
On this day in 1971, Bangabandhu in his landmark speech called
for non-cooperation with the regime of the erstwhile Pakistan from
a mammoth public meeting in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was later pushed into the bloody liberation war on
the night of March 25, 18 days after the historic March 7 call of
Sheikh Mujibur.
</P>
<P>
The nation achieved an independent Bangladesh on December 16,
1971, after the nine-month war.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina along with her cabinet colleagues
and her Awami (people's) League Party leaders stood in a solemn
silence in front of the portrait of Bangabandhu for a minute.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government today also released a commemorative
postage stamp and a first day cover, marking the historic speech
of Bangabandhu.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday night, President Shahabuddin Ahmed and
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina gave separate messages on the eve of
the historic March 7 day.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Hasina also inaugurated a huge torch rally
observing the month of independence, which will be back here on
the independence day of March 26, after a round-the-country tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Yang Yang grabbed the first gold
medal of the China's Eighth National Games Friday when she won the
title of the short-track speedskating 500 meters after former
world champion Wang Chunlu fell to the rink.
</P>
<P>
Yang, winner of the 3,000m relay in the 1995 world
championships, skated to a winning time of 46.05 seconds, far
slower than her own national record of 45.18, which was 0.07
second faster to the world record set by Canada's Isabelle Charest
in Hague, Netherlands, on March 2, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to win the first gold of the National Games
for my province," said the 21-year-old Heilongjiang skater, who
also won the 1,500m and 3,000m relay in the 1996 Winter Asian
Games.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not satisfied with my winning time because I was not
in my top form. I was lucky for the victory today after Jilin's
Wang Chunlu and Yang Yang fell."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yanmei of the Army team, silver medalist at the 1994
Winter Olympic Games, was second at 46.08 second. She led the way
until Heilongjiang's Yang overtook her at the first turn of the
last lap.
</P>
<P>
"I was too tired to be forced to slow my pace in the last lap,"
said the 25-year-old Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chunlu, who won the 500m and 1,000m and shared the 3,000m
relay in the 1995 world championships, touched Zhang and tumbled
when she tried to surpass her opponent Zhang to the first position
at the second turn after the first lap contest.
</P>

XINING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A hundred well-to-do township
enterprises in northwest China's Qinghai province will lend a
helping hand to poor farmers this year.
</P>
<P>
The move, sponsored by the local bureau in charge of township
enterprises, is another large-scale aid project to ensure the

end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Involving more than 100,000 poor farmers in 45 towns and 55
villages, it is the largest aid-the-poor project launched by
township enterprises, according to the local government.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Conflict in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Four people were killed and
other five wounded when two gunmen fought over a fuel tanker at a
busy junction called Black Sea in southern Mogadishu early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The tanker has crossed the green line from north Mogadishu for
sale into the city's southern part when the shooting broke out,
said eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Along the green line which divides the two parts of the
capital, southern Mogadishu's militiamen and technical vehicles
are heavily patrolling against those trying to defy the taxation
collections imposed by faction leader Hussein Aidid's self-styled
government on all goods.
</P>
<P>
During the exchange of fire, the driver of the tanker was
killed.
</P>
<P>
The tanker, an Italy-made 110 Iveco carrying with 35 barrels
of petrol, was ablaze after being hit by a rocket-propelled
grenade.
</P>
<P>
As a result, flames from the burning petrol spread and reached
the largest fuel tank located in the Black Sea area, destroying a
fuel store containing 150 drums of diesel, oil and petrol.
</P>
<P>
People living near the area have fled from home.
</P>
<P>
Some houses and kiosks were looted after their owners had fled
for safety.
</P>
<P>
So far, one fire extinguisher from North Mogadishu's GASCO
company and three water tankers from South Mogadishu's Somali
Petroleum Importation Company (SOPICO) have arrived at the scene
to control the spread of the fire, trying to put it out.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that Black Sea, near the main Bakara
market which was gutted in 1995 with an estimated four million
U.S. Dollars damage, caught fire since last year.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Nur Ahmed Ali, the chairman of SOPICO, said the two
petroleum firms have all the time been ready to help stop any
fire that flares up in the fuel tank and the markets of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts often occurred during tax collection by officials of
Aidid's government in the areas under his control of southern
Mogadishu, ending up in casualties and damage.
</P>
<P>
There are widely-spread allegations that these gunmen misuse
the tax revenues they collect by pretending to be solely serving
Aidid's administration.

<P>
YANTAI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Yantai, a coastal city in east
China's Shandong Province, is upgrading its local telecom networks
in a bid to welcome the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) Fair scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the city earned a post and telecom
turnover of 800 million yuan in 1996, or a year-on-year rise of 14
percent. Last year, some 500 million yuan was poured into 48
projects ranging from the expansion of the local telephone network
to setting up more advanced networks for mobile communications and
data transmission.
</P>
<P>
With its current switching capacity of 560,000 lines, the city
plans to add 110,000 more lines into the network and gain an
additional 100,000 telephone users in its urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
A ground station for satellite communications and the
supporting projects for the north China optic fiber project are
due to go into operation in the next October.
</P>
<P>
The city already runs Shandong's biggest mobile telecom
network, capable of serving 40,000 mobile phone subscribers and
100,000 pager users. The target is to develop 30,000 mobile phone
users this year.
</P>
<P>
Also on the development agenda for the city this year is the
expansion of its nodes attached to ChinaDDN and ChinaPAC, the
country's two major data transmission networks. More telecom
services, including E-mail and ChinaNet, will be available this
year.
</P>
<P>
The city expects to register a business turnover of 900 million
yuan this year, a growth of 12.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> HK to Remain as International Financial Center: PBC Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The status of Hong Kong as an
international financial center will be preserved and further
enhanced after it returns to China, Dai Xianglong, governor of the
People's Bank of China (PBC), stated here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when addressing a conference sponsored by
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) on "Financial Integration in Asia and the Role
of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The confidence in the future of this territory is also held by
the international financial community, he noted.
</P>
<P>
First, "Hong Kong enjoys the full backing from the Chinese
mainland, whose prosperity and stability lend great support to
Hong Kong in maintaining its status as an international financial
center," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
The economy of the Chinese mainland is well positioned on the
path of relatively high and steady growth. In 1996, its gross
national product (GNP) grew by 9.7 percent and inflation was kept
at 6.1 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the next few years, the annual GNP growth rate is projected
at around 8 percent with inflation below 6 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
"As China moves ahead with its modernization drive, the
prosperity of Hong Kong will be even more secured," he stated.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the governor stressed, the Basic Law
provides a legal guarantee for the maintenance of Hong Kong as an
international financial center.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Law, the fundamental principles
governing the monetary relationship between Hong Kong and the
Chinese mainland can be summarized as two currencies, two
monetary systems and two monetary authorities under two different
social and economic systems within one sovereign country, Dai
noted.
</P>
<P>
In other words, Hong Kong will retain its independent currency
issue mechanism, and the Hong Kong dollar will continue to
circulate as the only legal tender in Hong Kong, he continued.
</P>
<P>
The PBC and the HKMA will perform their own functions of
monetary management in their respective currency areas independent
of each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he continued, as an international financial center
Hong Kong will continue to participate in the activities of
international and regional financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
In February 1996, the PBC and the HKMA signed a bilateral
repurchase agreement against the United States Treasury notes, and
in November 1996, the two authorities joined the Bank for
International Settlements at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The PBC also actively supports the efforts of the HKMA to join
the IMF New Arrangements to Borrow, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The PBC will certainly follow the policy of 'one
country, two systems' and the Basic law, handle and safeguard the
monetary relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland
in the most appropriate way, and spare no efforts to maintain the
role of Hong Kong as an international financial center."
</P>
<P>
In September when the joint annual meetings of the IMF and the
World Bank are held in Hong Kong, the concept of "one country, two
systems" will become a reality, and at that time," a more
prosperous and stable Hong Kong is on the horizon, and a more
dynamic and vigorous international financial center is on the
horizon," he concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A World Trade Organization (WTO)
official said here today that Asia Pacific's telecoms industry is
set to enjoy accelerated liberalization.
</P>
<P>
David Hartridge, director of the WTO Trade-In-Services Division
in Geneva, said that a major breakthrough has been made last month
at a WTO meeting in Geneva, at which 69 countries signed the
Global Telecommunications Pact.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Third Asia Pacific Telecommunications
Roundtable held today in Hong Kong, Hartridge said that the 69
countries which submitted 55 schedules of commitments to the WTO
are now bound by their commitments and cannot go back on them.
</P>
<P>
He said that governments are aware that demand for investment
in the telecoms sector far exceeds supply and that nothing curbs
investment more than changes in policy and regulations. He
indicated that investors' confidence will increase and the
industry will grow.
</P>
<P>
The WTO meeting significantly improved the Information
Technology Agreement (ITA) by cutting tariffs on all information
technology-related products by 2000, he told the international
gathering of 85 participants.
</P>
<P>
The four commitments which the 69 countries have undertaken are
to provide cross border service, to acquire overseas services, to
invest in export markets and to allow "natural" persons into their
countries, he said, confirming that the agreement is to be
finalized on November 30 this year and to be implemented by
January 1, 1998.

<P>
Occupying an area of 190,000 square kilometers, western Yunnan
boasts abundant biological and mineral resources and tourism
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 ethnic minorities live in the region. But its
harsh natural conditions and undeveloped infrastructure make it
one of the most poverty-stricken areas in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, the region was the logistics base for the
allied forces.
</P>
<P>
To tap the region's potential, the construction of a transport
system has been named a priority. Main targets set for the years
to come include linking the local roads with the Asian road
network, seeking a sea channel to Indian Ocean via the Irrawaddy
River in Myanmar, and opening air routes to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Local experts are now also compiling feasibility reports for
the construction of two international railways linking Kunming,
the provincial capital, with Singapore and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The region is also eyed by some government departments as the
site of a key state energy base, which will involve tapping the
hydroelectric resources abundant in upper reaches of the Jinsha
River, the Lancang River and the Nujiang River.
</P>
<P>
The three river valleys, along with Qinghai, Tibet and southern
Sichuan, have been designated as China's future non-ferrous
metals industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
The potential biological resources, such as rubber, tea, coffee
and spices, can be used to build up some agricultural bases.
</P>
<P>
To kick off the initial development, the province has invested
10 billion yuan on infrastructure construction in the past years.
Its local road system has been linked with the national road
network and extended further to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Four airports, half of the province's total, are in operation
and two new airports are under construction.
</P>
<P>
A hydropower plant with a generating capacity of one million
kilowatts has been erected on the Lancang River and the upper
reaches of the Mekong River in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Local economists considered that the implementation of the
overall development strategies will not only create a new dynamic
economic belt in Yunnan, but also boost the cooperation between
all of southwest China with Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> China Has 2,000 Female Officers from Minority Ethnic Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's armed forces have in their
ranks more than 2,000 female officers coming from 39 minority
ethnic groups, according to sources with the General Political
Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Most of the women are engaged in military management, teaching,
scientific research, medical care, engineering, cultural matters,
and news reporting and publishing.
</P>
<P>
Military statistics indicate that many of the female officers
are well-educated, and some have obtained masters or doctoral
degrees.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a large number of them have made outstanding
achievements in science, and have been awarded professional

<HEADLINE> Women Active in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A series of lectures by local
model women was held this week in the Chinese capital to mark the
International Women's Day, which falls on March 8.
</P>
<P>
Eleven model women, including a teacher, a scientist, a
policewoman, a doctor and ordinary workers, told their own stories
to 400 women representatives and leaders.
</P>
<P>
The lectures were sponsored by the Municipal Women's
Federation, which over the past year has assisted local women with
problems in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
To help laid-off female workers find new jobs, the federation
set up a women's employment agency last year, which offered
consulting services for 6,000 women, and helped 200 out of 600
women registered for assistance to find jobs from 390 employers
looking for workers.
</P>
<P>
The center has also held training classes for more than 2,000
displaced female workers.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1996, the Municipal Women's Federation helped 2,204
women in mountainous areas to eliminate poverty and resolved 2,400
out of 3,700 complaints related to women's rights.
</P>
<P>
Partly owing to the federation's effort, women are playing an
increasingly important role in the capital, partly as a result of
the women's federation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 45 percent of local government officials
are women -- the highest percentage among province-level areas in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The ratios of women in the Municipal People's Congress and
the Municipal Committee of the CPPCC (Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference) exceed 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 4,363 women were elected as deputies to
township-level people's congresses, accounting for 31.6 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing's suburban Miyun County, the ratio of female
deputies to township-level people's congresses reached a high of
57.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 14 women's organizations are also active in
Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Creative Students, Challenge to Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Where are the creative
professionals who will lead Asia's future economic growth? This is
a major concern of educators in Asia, the world's fastest economic
development region in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Asia's future development, to a large extent, depends on
today's students, but lack of creative students, as many teachers
complained, is one of the challenges to the education sector in
the region.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, some teachers described their students as "silent
lambs", because they are "too obedient". Even in the country's
universities, students often hang on every word of their
professors, agree what the professors say and repeat their
statements virtually verbatim months later in examinations.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the same phenomenon has not only caused a
considerable concern by educators, but also by senior government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Although the World Competitiveness Yearbook 1996 rated
Singapore's education system number one in ability to meet "the
needs of a competitive economy", the government was not content.
The Education Ministry conducted its own survey last year and
found that graduates from Singapore schools are competent but lack
creativity.
</P>
<P>
"They have good analytical abilities and can reason logically,
but they are not strong on creative and innovative thing and in
dealing with problems that are not well-defined," said Singapore
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong last September when summarizing the
findings by the Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the reason for the phenomenon, Goh said: "Our
students focus single-mindedly on getting good grades in
examinations."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's explanation was echoed by many educators,
who called for educational reforms, including reforms in
examinations.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to encourage creativity, some teachers proposed
introduction of open-ended examination questions to test students
ability to innovate, not just to regurgitate information, while
others standed for open-book examinations that student will not be
able to pass by memory alone.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, reforms in enrollment examinations will reportedly be
undertaken in high schools and universities this year. Japanese
students will have to submit papers and have admission interviews
in addition to passing written examinations.
</P>
<P>
However, whatever reforms to be undertaken in regular and
enrollment examinations, creative students can only be produced by
creative and qualified teachers, educators said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the shortage of qualified teachers is another grave
concern of Asian educators. In many Asian schools, a large number
of teachers have not obtained professional training and some
qualified teachers have transferred to other sectors due to lower
salaries.
</P>
<P>
During the last decade, many Philippine teachers have quitted
their jobs and become bank clerks, company secretaries, or public
relations officers to seek higher wages.
</P>
<P>
But teachers' welfare could only be improved gradually, as most
of Asian countries will have tight education budgets in coming
years. Therefore, more and more qualified teachers are expected to
changes their jobs at a time when they are badly needed across the
region, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, when Asian schools are in short of education funds,
thousands of Asian students are heading overseas and have pumped
millions of U.S. dollars into foreign schools.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, there were 664,000 Asian students studying
in 50 host countries in 1994, compared with 401,000 students in
1990.
</P>
<P>
To Asian nations, this outflow represents a strain on their
current accounts. Last year, foreign students pumped 2 billion
dollars into Australian schools alone. The amount is as big an
export earner for the country as wheat.
</P>
<P>
If the millions of dollars could have flowed into Asian
schools, some educators said, the budgetary situation would have
been better than it was now.
</P>
<P>
The training of creative students is a very complicated issue,
it could only be resolved by "creative solutions," they said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investors Favor Agriculture in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
has made great progress in using overseas investment to develop
high-yield, high-quality and high-efficiency agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics showed that the province signed 150
overseas-funded projects involving agriculture last year, using
163 million US dollars, 87 percent up from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The scope of cooperation has expanded from vegetable
growing to aquatic and poultry production, forestry and farm
produce processing.
</P>
<P>
A local government official has listed three characteristics in
the use of overseas investment in recent years:
</P>
<P>
-- The number of contracts and the amount of overseas funds
used in agriculture between 1994 and 1996 have exceeded the the
combined figures of the previous 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of overseas funds to Guangdong last year rose by 14
percent, while the amount of overseas funds flowing to the
agricultural sector increased by 87 percent, suggesting that
agriculture has found favor in the eyes of overseas investors in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
-- Mountainous areas have become a hot spot as investment
environments there have been greatly improved. Last year, seven
out of 10 top foreign fund recipients in Guangdong located in
mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
-- In addition to traditional investors from Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan, more overseas companies have settled in
Guangdong. Their investment covered a wide range of fields.
</P>
<P>
According to the local agricultural department, 20 percent of
Guangdong's investment in agriculture came from abroad and 30
percent of its agricultural output value was obtained through
Sino-foreign cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up 30 export-oriented agricultural
production bases, which turn out 50 million US dollar-worth of
farm produce each year.

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China will ban smoking from
passenger trains, ships, planes, buses, and waiting rooms at
railway stations, airports and ports as of May 1.
</P>
<P>
Public transportation that also prohibits cigarette smoking
includes subways, taxis, ferryboats and cable cars, according to a
regulation jointly issued by ministries of Public Health,
Communications, Railways and Construction, as well as Civil
Aviation Administration of China, and the National Committee of
Patriotic Hygiene Campaign.

<P>
"No-Smoking" signs should be fixed conspicuously, while tobacco
advertisements and facilities for smokers, such as ashtrays and
lighters, will not be put in those places, the regulation noted.
</P>
<P>
"Passengers have the right to stop people's smoking, or they
can ask authorities to do so," it said.
</P>
<P>
The regulation asked relevant authorities to appoint certain
inspectors at non-smoking areas and take measures to persuade
smokers to quit the habit.
</P>
<P>
So far, six provinces and municipalities, such as Beijing and
Shanghai, along with 40 other small and medium-sized cities, have
enacted laws and regulations to prohibit smoking at public places.
</P>
<P>
And in August, the Tenth World Conference on Tobacco or Health

<P>
Beijing, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
has sent a message to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, expressing
deep condolences on the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"I should like to reiterate my deepest condolences to the

FREETOWN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Twelve soldiers were shot dead
by members of the Civil Defense Unit called Kamajors in Matotoka
in northern Sierra Leone on Wednesday, local journalists said
today.
</P>

Two other soldiers were also killed in the north on Wednesday
when they were mistaken for rebels by Kamajors.
</P>
<P>
In the south, meanwhile, two civilians died and 11 Kamajors

year during the 1990-1995 period, remaining the highest among the
tropical regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the United Nations here
today, during the 1980-1990 period, about 3.9 million hectares of
forests were destroyed each year in the tropical countries of
Asia, or a rate of 1.2 percent, even higher than the first half of
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "the State of the World's Forests-1997",
was issued by the regional office for Asia and the Pacific of the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) before the FAO
Committee on Forestry to hold a meeting on March 10-13.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the deforestation in Asia to two direct
reasons - farming activities and excessive timber cutting.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that fuelwood harvesting, mining,
irrigation and hydroelectric projects and urban expansion are
responsible for the destruction of tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to destruction, forest degradation is also a
serious problem in the region," the 200-page biennial report said.
</P>
<P>
"Commercial harvesting has been more widespread and intensive
the tropical Asia and the Pacific than in any other tropical
region."
</P>
<P>
"High population densities have also led to widespread forest
degradation from fuelwood and fodder harvesting, cattle grazing,
shifting cultivation, and timber cutting for local construction."
</P>
<P>
"Fire continuously threatens many of the forests of the
region," the report said, noting more than 3 million hectares of
temperate forests burned in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that many countries in the
Asia-Pacific region are reducing their reliance on natural forests
to provide industrial roundwood and are shifting to other sources.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand, Sri Lanka and New Zealand have restricted most
timber harvesting in natural forests and now depend almost
exclusively on plantations, agroforestry, farm forests and, in the
case of Thailand, imports,' the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Reduced availability of timber in many major producer
countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Philippines
has caused pressure to shift to countries like Cambodia, Myanmar,
Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon islands which were previously
only lightly exploited," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region produced about one-third of the world's
roundwood in 1994, about 74 percent of which was used as fuelwood
or wood for charcoal, according to the report.

HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's subway operator, the
Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC), made 1.53 billion HK
dollars (197.4 million US dollars) in net profits last year, an
increase of 28.3 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Jack So Chak-kwong, chairman of the corporation, said that the
performance enabled his company to retain a profit of 789 million
HK dollars against the previous year's accumulated loss of 99
million HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the profit growth was helped by increased
passenger traffic and revenue, and falling interest charges.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers carried on the MTRC network grew by
0.4 percent to 817 million HK dollars last year, from 813 million
HK dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Fare revenue per passenger rose by 7.24 percent to 6.22 HK
dollars from 5.80 HK dollars the year before.

So said that the value of fixed assets rose to 32.99 billion HK
dollars from 30.1 billion HK dollars, while the amount invested in
the Airport Railway project rose to 21.74 billion from 11.78
billion HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that significant progress was made on the building of
the Airport Railway with 64 percent of construction work
completed by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
He said he remained confident that the railway would be opened
on time and within budget in the second quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
He said that MTRC is continuing to plan for the further
extensions to Hong Kong's subway network.
</P>
<P>
As one of the three rail systems operated by government-owned
public corporations, the MTRC operates a three-line metro system,
comprising 43 route-kilometers with 38 stations, served by a fleet
of 759 cars operating in eight-car trains.
</P>
<P>
The system was opened in stages between October 1979 and August
1989.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Computers Leads in Domestic Market For 1st Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- "Legend" Computer, a local
brandname assembled by the Beijing-based Legend Group, ranked
first in home market sales in 1996 by selling 200,000 units,
according to the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that a locally-made product took the
lead in the increasingly competitive Chinese computer market that
used to be occupied by international brands.
</P>
<P>
Following color TV-sets and refrigerators, computers have become
the third electronic product that has seen a dominant role in the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yuanqing, deputy general manager of the Legend Group, said
recently that the Chinese market used to be full of outdated
international products.
</P>
<P>
Last year, local computer manufacturers took the lead in upgrading
computer products in the domestic market through a price-war, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the General Administration of Customs, in 1996,
China imported merely 48,000 units of computers worth 490 million
US dollars, down 45.5 percent and 11.7 percent respectively from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tianxing, former director of the Computer Department of
the Ministry of Electronics Industry, estimated the
capacity of the Chinese computer market at about 10 million units,
but currently, the annual number of computers sold in the market
stands at two million units only.
</P>
<P>
The market has great potential, he said.

</P>
<P>
The joint venture bank, to be incorporated in Myanmar, would be
known as Myanmar Citizens Public Bank Ltd (MCPBL), the Malaysian
Public Bank said in a statement issued here to announce the MOU

multilateral financial, credit and aid institutions for investment
and development purposes as well as facilitating bilateral trade
between Myanmar and other countries, especially through Public

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is scheduled to introduce a new COMESA
Dollar to replace the Preferential Trade Area Unit of Account
(UAPTA).
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today quoted acting Secretary General of
COMESA Erastus Mwencha as saying here on Thursday that the new
currency was expected to start exchanging among member countries
by June this year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that commercial banks in member countries would be
allowed to directly deal with the Clearing House in COMESA
Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA Dollar will exchange at the same rate as UAPTA to
the U.S. Dollar, Mwencha told a news conference here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA official stated that inter-COMESA trade has
increased from 834 million U.S. Dollars to 1.7 billion and is
expected to rise to four billion Dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rise in trade between COMESA member
countries to the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers.

<P>
He said Comoros and Uganda have reduced tariffs by 80 percent
while Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Eritrea
have cut tariffs by 60 percent.
</P>

LHASA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- One out of every 15 women in Tibet
attended training courses sponsored by local women's federations
last year.
</P>
<P>
The organizations held 876 literacy courses and technological
training courses for agriculture and animal husbandry, which drew
nearly 86,000 women all over Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Some 63,000 trainees were taught rudimentary reading and
writing skills, while the rest learned farming techniques.
</P>

Financial support for the courses came from nine aid projects
involving some 30 million yuan, as well as economic entities under
the federations which earned 420,000 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the training classes, the funding has been used
to help female drop-outs.

<P>
"Teaching them techniques is, perhaps, the best way to help
women in underdeveloped Tibet to lead a better life," said an
official with the regional women's federation.
</P>
<P>
The group also encouraged local women to take part in group
activities, such as planting trees. Last year, women in Tibet

<HEADLINE> Grassland Flexes Economic Muscle Through Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Inner Mongolia, known as the
"kingdom of animal husbandry," has increased its economic muscle
by intensifying cross-region cooperation, sources here say.
</P>
<P>
Working in tandem with other parts of the country, north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which has the country's
largest area of grassland, carried out 830 projects in 1996,
attracting 2.22 billion yuan, or the total of the previous five
years' entire investment.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said that Inner Mongolia's cross-region
cooperation with other areas has entered a new phase, marked by
the considerable expansion of economic and technological exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said that businessmen have shown more willingness
to cooperate, as evidenced by the increase in contracts signed. Of
the 169 projects sealed between Inner Mongolia's Baotou and other
provinces and cities, 148 have been carried out.
</P>
<P>
Abundant natural resources have been the focus of investment by
businessmen from other parts of China. A company from the city of
Jingjiang, Jiangsu Province, has invested eight million yuan to
develop ferrosilicon in Wuhai, a rising industrial city in the
region's west part. Another company from Jiangsu has invested 27
million yuan in Wuhai for the production of lead.
</P>
<P>
Through cooperation with economically prosperous areas,
debt-ridden enterprises in the region have gained a strong growth
momentum. The Baotou Crystal Materials Factory had the largest
investment from the regional government, but has been suffering
from poor performance due to inadequate technology and poor
management.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest artificial quartz crystal production
center, Jiaojiang Crystal Factory, together with Hong Kong
businessmen, later saved the factory with a joint investment of
nearly 10 million yuan. The Baotou factory was resuscitated, and
its goods have edged onto the international market.
</P>
<P>
Large enterprises also have been a driving force behind the
development of a group of traditional industries in the region.
</P>
<P>
A subsidiary of China National Automotive Corporation has
joined hands with the Inner Mongolia First Machinery Factory and
Baotou Automotive Plant to produce automobiles. With the pouring
in of 60 million yuan of the corporation, the two Inner Mongolian
factories have made the best of their assets, valued at 600
million yuan, and sold out all the 200 vehicles they manufactured.
</P>
<P>
In the rush of increasing cooperation with
economically-developed areas, out-of-the-way areas in the region
have also opened up to the outside world. To create a sound
investment environment, the Bairin Right Banner has provided
preferential treatment to cooperation partners, and has attracted
32.6 million yuan of investment from elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Economy Develops Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The economy of north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, which has the country's largest area
of grassland, has developed steadily over the past year, with tax
revenues and individual incomes continuing to rise.
</P>
<P>
The region's income from taxes hit 9.3 billion yuan (about 112
million US dollars), 1.68 billion more than the previous year,
said Li Bin, a local statistics official.
</P>
<P>
An abundant agricultural harvest and rapid development of
township enterprises have led to remarkable increases in the
earnings of farmers and herdsmen. The net income of these groups
came to 1,602 yuan per person, an increase of 302 yuan. Urban
residents' income reached 3,107 yuan, up 515 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last year's grain output went up by 4.8 billion kg to reach 15
billion kg, or one-seventh of the country's total. The region also
raised 6.7 million domestic animals, an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia's gross domestic product totalled 98.3 billion
yuan in 1996, a 12.4 percent rise over the previous year,
adjusting for inflation. The increase rate is also 2.7 percentage
points higher than that of the country's average.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the region carried out reforms in state-owned
enterprises, a move which has apparently accelerated its
industrial growth rate. Last year, added value in industry totaled
31.3 billion yuan, up 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The region also made a step forward in its opening-up
drive. Last year, the imports and exports volume of the region
amounted to 1.25 billion US dollars, up 11.3 percent. Also during
the year, overseas-funded businesses signed 133 projects to use
overseas funds, with 168 million US dollars expected to come in,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, cross-region collaboration has made great
progress. The region signed 1,166 projects in 1996, bringing in
2.2 billion yuan from other parts of China.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Pretoria's City Council was
ablaze again this morning after a fire gutted more than half of
the council's administration complex, the Munitoria Building
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The new fire broke out on the fourth floor of the eight-story
north wing which was almost totally destroyed on Monday and was
quickly brought under control, fire officials said.

The latest fire had been confined to three offices, which
contained a lot of pairs of wooden furniture, police spokesman

</P>
<P>
About 30 firemen managed to extinguish the fire within two
hours.
</P>
<P>
The cause for the fire is under investigation and sabotage
possibility has been ruled out by the police.

<HEADLINE> Science, Technology Help Farmers Shake Off Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN March 7 (Xinhua) -- More and more farmers in Xihaigu
Region, one of China's poorest areas in the northwest Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, have made the most of science and technology to
rid themselves of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaoyi, a farmer in Tuanjiechun village, Xiji County, has
had an annual family income of more than 20,000 yuan (about 2,400
US dollars) in the three years since he built three greenhouses,
under the direction of the county's technicians.
</P>
<P>
Although Yu Deshui, a farmer in Dazhuangchun village in
Jingyuan County, started to breed oxen ten years ago, his efforts
repeatedly failed because he lacked knowledge in breeding and
management techniques.
</P>
<P>
After attending locally-sponsored training courses, his
economic return has increased.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, Ningxia has been encouraging local farmers to
learn agricultural techniques that involve science and
technology. Now, each county in the region has focused on
revitalizing its agriculture sector by means of science and
technology, and holds various training courses for the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Wang Junqi, head of the science and technology department of
the Guyuan Regional Government, said that the financial gains that
can come from application of science and technology has given
impetus to local farmers to learn more advanced farming
techniques.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, about 100,000 farmers received technical
training each year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Basically Equal With Men in Household Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 77.6 percent of Chinese
women believe that they are "completely equal" or "basically
equal" with their husbands in dealing with household matters,
according to a recent survey conducted by China Central Television
(CCTV).
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that nearly 64 percent of women
considered that they have "high" or "very high" status in family.
</P>
<P>
Only 3.2 percent of women think they have an inferior status in
the family, and family experts here believe China has achieved
great progress in achieving equality between men and women.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Xu has not lost status in her family since losing her job
last June. In the past, her husband always consulted her in
deciding important family matters. Though her income has been
greatly reduced, they continue the practice.
</P>
<P>
Xu, 36, has been married for 10 years. She had been employed in
the state-own Beijing Leather and Hardware Factory together with
her husband before she was displaced.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, they shared household work and happiness.
</P>
<P>
To earn some money, Xu has become a peddler and sells daily
goods. Though her husband felt some ambivalence, he did not
prevent her from doing the business, taking goods for her in his
spare time.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that the family belongs to both of them, so no matter
who earns more, the status between husband and wife should be
equal.
</P>
<P>
In China, many husbands and wives share the important decisions
about: the purchase of big-ticket items, choice of residence,
employment, finances, and their children's well-being.
</P>
<P>
According to China's Constitution, women enjoy equal rights
with men in political, economic, cultural and social areas, as
well as in the families.
</P>
<P>
Li Yanfen is a female farmer in Xianghe County, Hebei
Province. When one of her neighbor earned money selling local
products, she asked her husband to collect money to buy a small
truck.
</P>
<P>
Her mother-in-law and father-in-law firmly opposed her
suggestion while her husband hesitated to take the risk.
</P>
<P>
However, Li Yanfen did not give up and eventually persuaded her
husband to buy the truck. She said, "So long as my idea is
reasonable, I am sure that my family will accept it sooner or
later.
</P>
<P>
Li has received primary education, and worked as a household
maid in a big city. Her experience has given her confidence to
make decisions.
</P>
<P>
Nie Li, member of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, said China has been taking measures to list
equality between men and women as one of its basic national
principles, and to increase women's participation in managing
government and political affairs, education, employment and health
care.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the Law on the Protection of Women's Rights and
Interests in April, 1992, and an outline for Chinese women's
development in 1996 which includes the protection of women's equal
status in the families according to law.

<HEADLINE> PNA Calls for March on Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has ordered a mass march today on Har Homa
(Jabal Abu Ghneim) in Jerusalem, where the Israeli government
had decided to build a new Jewish neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
According a Palestinian Radio report, the march will start
at 10 a.m. this morning (0800GMT) from Beit Sahur near the
West Bank town of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of Palestine Radio called on Palestinians
everywhere to "march to the peak of the mountain (of Har
Homa)" to frustrate Israeli attempts to build settlement there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there also have been calls for Israeli Arabs to
gather at the Al-Aqsa Mosque (on the Temple Mount) at noon
today to pray in protest over Har Homa building plan.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said this morning that Jerusalem police will
be out in force today to prevent any disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Beginning at 6 a.m. this morning (0400GMT), some 2,500
additional policemen will be stationed at the two locations,
and the extra officers will be on duty through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The extra security will include helicopters, more roadblocks
and searches, and extra patrols.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, PNA had declared Friday as "the Defense of
Jerusalem Day," calling on Palestinian residents in the West
Bank to attend a prayer service at the Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
During the weekend, PNA president Yasser Arafat is also
expected to participate in a massive rally in the Gaza Strip
to protest against the building of Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian organizers told Israel Radio that the protests by
the Palestinian people will be "no-violent."
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Israeli police officer warned that if the
construction of Har Homa begins, the Palestinians will response
with rioting on a scale similar to that after the opening
of the Western Wall Tunnel last September.
</P>
<P>
During a violent confrontation between Palestinian police and
Israeli soldiers, triggered off by the opening of the tunnel
by Israel in Jerusalem's Old City, more than 70 people were
killed and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli security sources said that despite the
PNA's call for a protest, there has been coordination with
Palestinian Police, and a separation zone will prevent marchers
from storming Israeli positions at Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to face any disturbances in the streets
over the weekend," said Yair Yitzhaki, the new Jerusalem
police chief. "We are prepared for a whole range of
reactions, including the less desirable ones."
</P>
<P>
"Since the top political echelon has made the decision (on
Har Homa), they will receive the full backing of the
police," he added. "The Jerusalem police are prepared for all
eventualities."

<HEADLINE> high Interest Rates in India Not to Go Down: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Secretary Montek
Singh Ahluwalia said on Thursday that interest rates in the
country are not likely to go down in the near future, the Indian
Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ahluwalia said that among the Indian industry there is a
tendency to believe that a quick fix solution to bring down the
interest rate exists.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there are no quick ways of bringing down the
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"The only way that it can be done on a short term basis is by
increasing the money supply," he added, while addressing a meeting
of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India.
</P>
<P>
The finance secretary's remarks assumed significance because
high interest rates have been listed as one of the major reasons
leading to the sustained slowdown in economic growth in the
country over the last nine months of 1996 as the latest
statistical data available showed.
</P>
<P>
Economists said high interest rates have led to liquidity
crunch to the Indian industry.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank
of India (the central bank) announced a four-phased policy
designed to lower down the interest rates to boost the economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The measures have so far failed to result in the desired
reduction in interest rates.

He suggested that conditions of township medical centers in the
rural area be improved and subsidies to public health institutions
in underdeveloped regions increased, so as to stabilize the

</P>
<P>
On behalf of 25 other CPPCC National Committee members, Duan

for enhanced efforts to crack down upon illegal activities of
producing and selling fake and shoddy commodities.
</P>
<P>
"Strike on fake and shoddy commodities should be listed on the
agenda of Party committees and governments at all levels, and
various administrative and law-enforcing departments must enhance
their supervision on and management of various aspects," he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the speech delivered by Fang Jiade, vice-chairman of
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of 33 other

re-employment program for laid-off workers, and the establishment
of a mechanism of internal supervision and self-restraint for
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Black Pottery of Ancient Style Popular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A pair of two-meter high
black pottery vases are considered to be some of the most
distinctive articles in the refurbished Hebei Hall of the Great
Hall of the People in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The vases, designed with gilded carvings, were made of
ancient-style black pottery that was popular during the height of
Chinese pottery-making.
</P>
<P>
Black pottery, initiated in the Longshan culture some 4,000
years ago in east China's Shandong Province, is known for its thin
and fine-grained body which was made from yellow clay under high
temperature.
</P>
<P>
The traditional clay-making techniques are still practiced by
craftsmen in Shenzhou in the central part of north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhou craftsmen, who made the vases displayed in the
Hebei Hall at the Great Hall of the People, have developed more
than a hundred black pottery products which are exported to over
20 countries and regions including Britain, the United States,
France, Thailand, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhou is also famous for honey peaches, which along with the
black pottery were imperial favorites in ancient times.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Export 13,000 Tons of Sugar to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will this year
export 13,000 tons of sugar to Britain and on other European
Union markets.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of Tanzania Sugar Development Corporation
(SUDECO) George Mbati said Thursday that the country enjoys a
preferential sugar market in Europe because of its fine sugar
quality.
</P>
<P>
Under the Lome IV Convention signed between African, Caribbean
and Pacific (ACP) countries and the UK/EU protocol, Tanzania's
quota in sugar exports to Britain stands at 10,000 tons annually,
said Mbati.
</P>
<P>
However, thanks to its superior sugar quality and good
handling in shipment, a 3,000-ton quota for Special Preferential
Sugar (SPS) has been awarded to SUDECO, he said.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Jameison, the divisional director of raw sugar and
the European affairs at Tate and Lyle sugars in Britain, also
commended Tanzania for its qualitative sugar.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks when meeting with Tanzanian Minister for
Agriculture and Cooperatives Paul Kimiti during her recent visit
to the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, SUDECO exported 12,800 tons of sugar to Britain and
earned more foreign currency, while recording a superior purity
measure of 99.2 percent which is apparently above the set
standard of 96 percent base line.
</P>
<P>
"We earn extra cash in foreign currency for every extra purity
measure above the base line," noted Mbati.

BEIDAIHE (Hebei Province), March 7 (Xinhua) -- Five countries
issued a joint declaration to promote the protection and wise use
of wetlands in northeast Asia here today in Beidaihe, a coastal
summer resort in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Northeast Asian wetlands' high biological diversity plays a
critical role in the life cycle of many species and is important
to local people's quality of life, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the function and value of the wetland, the
declaration noted that the wetland ecosystem in the region faces
great threats, such as pollution and over-exploitation of natural
resources, so international and regional cooperation is necessary.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, issued by China, Japan, Republic of Korea,
Mongolia, and Russia at the ongoing International Workshop on
Wetlands and Water-Bird Conservation, commended the government of
China on hosting the workshop and on its efforts to protect
wetlands and water-birds.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Sets Example for Integrated World Economy: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is a prime example of
an economy that has managed rapid structural transformation in an
increasingly integrated world economy in a most successful way,
said Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
At a one-day seminar held here today with the title of
"Financial Integration in Asia and the Role of Hong Kong",
Camdessus said that Hong Kong's prudent monetary policy built
around the exchange rate link to the US dollar and supported by a
tight, rule based fiscal policy has created an environment of
macroeconomic stability and investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Joint Declaration of the Question of Hong Kong
and the Basic Law, which together enshrine the principle of "one
country, two systems" provide confidence that this policy
framework will continue.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the
People's Bank of China to operate as two mutually independent, but
cooperating, monetary authorities have been wisely and clearly
established.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong is one of the most open economies in the
world. China is also moving toward greater openness.
</P>
<P>
He said that one can easily see how promising these converging
trends in China and Hong Kong are.
</P>
<P>
He said the vast market provides excellent trade and investment
opportunities for Hong Kong, just as Hong Kong's own dynamism will
provide further impetus for China's growth and development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the continued economic development of the Chinese
mainland provides excellent trade and investment opportunities for
Hong Kong, just as Hong Kong's own dynamism will provide further
impetus for China's growth and development.
</P>
<P>
He said, "IMF and World Bank members will have the opportunity
to see the "one country, two systems" approach in action in
September, when they come to Hong Kong for the 1997 Annual
Meetings.

SHIJIAZHUANG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- North China's temperate Hebei
Province has become China's second largest fruit producer, with a
total dry and fresh fruit production output of 5.14 million tons
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the fruit tree planting area has reached
1.2 million hectares, with 580,000 hectares yielding.
</P>
<P>
Hebei, China's largest producer of fine pears, nuts, persimmons
and apricots, turns out thirty percent of the country's production
output.
</P>
<P>
The major market of these fruits is south China, which absorbs
75 percent of the total sales. The fruit exported to southeast
Asia, Japan, Hong Kong and Macao was about 60,000 tons a year,
earning 70 million US dollars of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, Hebei will see 1.3 million hectares of fruit tree

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Approves Further Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet today
approved the first stage of the three-phase further withdrawals in
the West Bank after a seven-hour stormy debate.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet endorsed by a vote of 10-7 the proposal put
forward by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu that Israel would
hand over to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) an
additional 9 percent of the West Bank, including 2 percent of
Area C which is under total Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the PNA only controls 3 percent of the West Bank
which is called Area A, and Israel retains sole control over 70
percent of the West Bank named as Area C. The rest areas, named
as Area B, are policed jointly by Israeli and Palestinian security
forces.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet said Israel would coordinate with the PNA in the
next few days to work out all details on carrying out the
pullback, including demarcating the lines.
</P>
<P>
The seven ministers who voted against were Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon, Communications Minister Limor Livnat,
Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy, Education Minister Zevulun
Hammer, Immigration Minister Yuli Edelstein, and Trade and
Industry Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israel Radio after the cabinet session, Netanyahu
said the government had made a "difficult decision" to create "a
good chance" to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The pullback was originally envisioned as not over 2
percent. Netanyahu justified widening the scope that the areas to
be handed over to the PNA had no security interest to Israel and
would not harm the final status of Israeli territory.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Netanyahu was trying to appease the
Palestinian anger over his recent decision to build 6500 housing
units in Har Homa in southeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the threats of rebellion against him by several
coalition members of the Knesset (Parliament). He insisted that
those people would realize that this was a better government than
any others and there was no alternative.
</P>
<P>
So far, five Knesset members have threatened to bolt the
coalition because of Netnayahu's policy to hand over Area C to
the PA. They decided to vote with the opposition in the next
non-confidence vote in the Knesset against the government. But
this is not considered immediately significant, as Netanyahu is
assured of the opposition Labor party's support regarding the
pullback.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet session ended at about 7 a.m. today. Foreign
Minister David Levy briefed U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on the decision.
</P>
<P>
At one point during the stormy debate, Netanyahu even
interrupted the session to consult U.S. Ambassador to Israel
Martin Indyk.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision was made just ahead of the deadline for the
first stage of the three-phase pullbacks. According to the Hebron
Agreement signed in January, Israel should begin the first
pullback today, with the last one due in the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior Palestinian official criticized Israel for
its manner in deciding the scope of troop withdrawals in the West
Bank. Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israel had violated the
peace accords by deciding unilaterally the pullback without
consulting the PNA.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Holds Talks with Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today held bilateral talks with visiting South
African President Nelson Mandela, focusing on the strengthening of
the economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Malaysian Prime Minister requested South
Africa to consider reducing the import tariff on palm oil to at
least the same level as that for soybean oil, Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said while briefing reporters on the
discussion.
</P>
<P>
He said Mahathir explained to Mandela that Malaysia wanted the
import tariff for palm oil to be the same as that for other
cooking oil imported by South Africa from other countries.
</P>
<P>
South Africa currently imposes an import tariff of 400 Rand
(about 88 U.S. dollars) per ton on palm oil while that for soybean
is 170 Rand (about 51.5 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia was not asking for "something more" and
would settle for the same tariffs.
</P>
<P>
He said Mandela could not give an immediate answer to
Malaysia's request but promised to look into it.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also assured Mandela that Malaysia would help the
South Africans, especially the blacks, by sharing with them its
experience and expertise in various fields like entrepreneurship,
human resource and skills training, the Malaysian foreign minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela wanted to see more Malaysian investments in the
republic which currently stood at 3 billion dollars and he told
Mahathir that his country needed more joint ventures between
Malaysian and South African companies, especially those owned by
the black community, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also wanted Malaysian investors to help in the
privatization of the shipping services as his government planned
to expand that sector.
</P>
<P>
The South African president assured that Malaysian investors
need not worry about security because the country was stable,
Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed on ASEAN-South Africa relations,
with both expressing the hope that the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the South African Development Community
(SADC), two regional blocs with a total population of 600 million,
would step up cooperation.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam while the SADC comprises 12
south African countries -- Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia,
Zimbabwe and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, being accompanied by an 115-member delegation
including ministers, senior officials and businessmen, arrived
here Thursday to begin a five-day visit to Malaysia, the final leg
of his 10-day tour of four Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also visited the Philippines, Brunei and Singapore
before coming here.
</P>
<P>
This is Mandela's first visit to Malaysia since he became South
Africa's head of state in 1994.

XINING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
has redoubled its efforts to protect the rights and interests of
female employees.
</P>
<P>
The province currently has 239,900 female employees in urban
areas, nearly 36 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
With the readjustment of China's economic structure, the number
of laid-off workers has been increasing. In Qinghai, redundant
women workers account for 40 percent of the total, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has encouraged all social sectors to
provide more employment opportunities for displaced female
workers, with 4,000 finding new jobs last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, governments at all levels have sponsored job
training courses for women, with a total of 61,000 redundant women
employees trained, and 36,000 finding jobs, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province has scored remarkable achievements in
providing special protection to women employees, speeding up
social security reforms related to women, and halting and

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan navy Wednesday
night arrested eight Indians employed by the Tamil rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to ferry supplies for them
from South India.
</P>
<P>
According to navy sources today, their trawler was attacked by
the navy but the eight Indians were rescued from the burning boat.
</P>
<P>
One of the Indians had a letter which revealed that they were
given 40,000 rupee (700 US dollars) by the rebels to transport
supplies.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Indians were caught transporting
supplies for the LTTE and Sri Lanka has already officially
informed India of this incident, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that Sri Lanka who had been aware of such intrusions
had repeatedly warned the Indian Central government and Tamil Nadu
government about them.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Sri Lankan delegation led by Secretary Ministry
of Defense Chandrananda de Silva had sought India's Tamil Nadu
support to end the involvement of Indian fishermen in ferrying
supplies to the LTTE rebels who have been fighting for a separate
state in the north-east of Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Moi Warns Foreigners Against Causing Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has said his government has never allowed and will never allow
foreigners who come into the country with the intention of
causing chaos.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking at a fund-raising rally in aid of
the Moi University and Chepkoilel Campus Primary School in
Eldoret, west Kenya on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He wondered why the international community kept on harping on
human rights abuses in Kenya yet they have never said anything
regarding thousands of people who have died as a result of civil
strife in war-torn countries in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that it was unfair for those who claim to be
championing human rights to apply double-standards, adding that
Kenya has been a peaceful country since independence and was
therefore unfairly blamed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a signed press release, John Koech, Minister of
State in the Office of the President, yesterday strongly denied
that it was exercising any bias in the distribution of relief
food in hunger-stricken areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that nobody in any of the 26
drought-stricken districts had been denied relief food.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily Nation today said that this was
apparently in reference to the remarks made by U.S. Ambassador to
Kenya Prudence Bushnell on Wednesday over the ongoing relief food
distribution.
</P>
<P>
Bushnell said she had received reports of discrimination in
the distribution of relief food and wanted to know what steps the
government is taking to ensure that politicians will not make
political capital out of the famine.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has condemned
Israel's decision to build Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia described the act as "highly provocative and
irresponsible" which it said could have negative repercussions on
the current Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's alternate permanent representative to the United
Nations Hasmy Agam said that "my delegation strongly condemns this
latest Israeli measure and calls on the Israeli government to
rescind its decision and to desist from taking any such unilateral
actions in the future."
</P>
<P>
His statement made in New York Thursday during a Security
Council meeting on the situation in the Occupied Territories was
released here today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia could not accept the policies of Israel in the
occupied East Jerusalem aimed at changing the city's legal status,
the Malaysian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia urged the Security Council to pronounce itself in
clear an unambiguous language on the issue and denounce the

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Cracks Down on Bogus Nike Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 pairs of bogus
Nike-brand sports shoes and hundreds of ersatz sports accessories
were confiscated in the recent campaign against fake and pirated
goods in Tianjin, a port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
The action shows that "the local government will make a
concerted effort to protect the legitimate interests of foreign
manufacturers," said a local official with the Tianjin
Administration of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Two Nike representatives accompanied the local officials in two
operations to identify the authenticity of the products. Sources
say that the company earlier lodged a complaint and the two sides
worked together to "co-plan the operations."
</P>
<P>
Officials in the raids searched the warehouse, confiscated the
fake goods on the spot, and found clues about the suppliers'
sources.
</P>
<P>
Sellers of the fake goods will be fined in accordance with
China's law against unfair competition. The confiscated goods will
be destroyed soon.
</P>
<P>
Meng Xiaolong, chief representative of Nike Corporation in
Beijing, considered the results "fruitful." Similar to Beijing and
Shanghai, Tianjin officials "took prompt action" after receiving
the complaint, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nike has already formed a wholly-funded venture in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Train Travelers Decrease in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Trains carried about 17,400 people
daily last month, a 0.6 percent drop compared with the same period
of last year, lastest statistics from the Ministry of Railways
show.
</P>
<P>
This is due to the fierce competition from highway and civil
aviation systems, authorities note.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the number of passengers delivered by train has been
steadily decreasing for the past few years. In 1996, trains
carried 942 million people, a drop of 12.3 percent from the year
before.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile highway and civil aviation departments are capturing
an increasing market share for their faster and more comfortable
service. Statistics show that the numbers of highway and air
travelers went up by 9.5 and 8.5 percent, respectively, last
year.

<HEADLINE> Famous Painter Donates Masterpieces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- He Haixia, one of the most
influential Chinese traditional painters, has donated 46 of his
works to the China National Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
The 89-year-old artist specializes in drawing mountains and
river scenes -- the traditional themes of Chinese paintings. Most
of the current group of donations are of scenic landscapes, while
some reflect scenes in west China, where he spent nearly 30
years working as a painter.
</P>
<P>
Currently the master artist at the "Chang'an Painting School"
combines traditional painting techniques with realism.
</P>
<P>
At a donation ceremony held here today, Pan Zhenzhou, vice
minister of Culture, said, "These donations will not only enrich
the country's store of art treasures, but also contribute to the
cause of China's protection drive for excellent forms of
traditional culture."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Traditional Paintings will work in tandem
with the China Art Gallery to collect and preserve He's works.
</P>
<P>
The painter said he will donate his additional paintings in the
future, and will do his utmost to push forward the traditional
Chinese arts.
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, He's paintings often were on display nationwide
and were even included in overseas exhibits with the works of his
mentor, Zhang Daqian, a world-renowned Chinese traditional painter.
</P>
<P>
China's leaders often sent He's works as state gifts to foreign
guests.

<HEADLINE> Central China's Women Profit from Breeding Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- About a million women in central
China's Hunan Province have made money through breeding domestic
animals.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of the women in the province's rural areas have
experience in animal husbandry. In the past few years, some two
million rural women have been lifted out of illiteracy, and about
five million have grasped a couple of practical techniques.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ying, a woman in east Hunan's Songshan Village, has bred
9,670 pigs over the recent years, with an output value of 7.66
million yuan (920,000 US dollars) and a net profit of 1.1 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The breeding industry provides a good economic return with
little risk, so it is attracting more and more women. In north
Hunan's Changde City, 830,000 families have been in the breeding
business, with women as the backbone. They rake in some four
billion yuan annually, contributing to a half of the city's total
agricultural output value, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Changsha County, in the province's northeast region, has
organized a large number of rural women to breed pigeons, with the
average yearly income per family reaching 5,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Israel Further Eases Closure on PNA area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army further eased
the closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip ruled by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), by allowing more Palestinian
workers to enter Israel.
</P>
<P>
Married Palestinians over the age of 24 who have security
clearances now will be eligible for work permits inside Israel,
Israel Radio today quoted the new regulations as saying.
</P>
<P>
Until today, work permits have been given only to those over
the age of 28.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli army increased to 400 the number of PNA
officials allowed to travel between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Two hundreds Palestinians also were given one-day permits to
transfer civil administration vehicles to Israel for maintenance,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Chief of
General Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak approved the measures, but
stipulated that all eligible workers needed to have security
passes.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of suicide bombing attacks by Palestinian
extremists last February and March, Israel has imposed a total
closure on the PNA controlled area of West Bank and Gaza Strip,
barring tens of thousands of Palestinians from returning to their
jobs inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the last few months, Israel has gradually eased the
one-year long closure which had caused further difficulties to
the troubled economic situation in the Palestinian autonomous
areas.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and South Africa
today signed two agreements including one on trade to enhance
bilateral cooperation,
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was witnessed by Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and visiting South African President Nelson
Mandela after their bilateral talks. Mandela arrived here
Thursday on a five-day visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Under the trade pact, the two countries would grant each other
the Most Favored Nation treatment in matters relating to customs
duties and foreign trade formalities besides the setting up of a
joint trade committee, Malaysian International Trade and Industry
Minister Rafidah Aziz said in a statement after the signing.
</P>
<P>
She said the trade pact would also facilitate each other's
participation in trade fairs and exhibitions which include
exemptions from custom duties and other charges for samples
intended for exhibitors and fairs.
</P>
<P>
"The main objective of the trade agreement is to expand and
deepen trade, economic and industrial cooperation on a long-term
basis," she said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is Malaysia's largest trading partner in Africa.
In 1996, total trade stood at 1.362 billion ringgit (about 544.8
million U.S. dollars), an increase of 14.3 percent over 1995.

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen urged the parties concerned to keep
cool-headed in order to resolve the Hwang Jang-yob incident properly

</P>
<P>
Essentially speaking, the Hwang Jang-yob incident is a matter

<P>
However, this incident took place in Beijing, therefore China

</P>
<P>
"China is right now conducting investigations and we will
follow the international law and conventional international
practice to resolve this problem," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, China will take into account the need to
facilitate peace and stability on the Korean peninsular, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the parties concerned will adopt a
cool-headed attitude, so as to resolve the problem appropriately
and as soon as possible," Qian noted.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not Intending to Become Rice Exporter: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto said
his country's efforts to increase its rice production did not in
the least mean it intended to become a rice exporter.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to farmers in Karang Agung Ulu district, South
Sumatra, Thursday, the president said all efforts to increase
productivity were aimed solely at maintaining self-sufficiency,
reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto noted that Indonesia was sometimes even importing rice
to maintain domestic rice price stability and to anticipate
emergencies caused by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be a rice exporter because if we do become one, we
may crush the markets of other rice exporting countries," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also stressed the importance of using peatland because
agricultural land in the country, especially in Java, was
continuing to shrink due to industrial and housing development.
</P>
<P>
Many rice fields had been converted into industrial estates,
among other things, for factories and roads as well as
resettlement areas, the president said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the biggest agricultural countries in the world and
with a population of 200 million, Indonesia achieved
self-sufficiency in rice in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Provisional findings have revealed that Indonesia's rice
production in 1996 is predicted to reach 50.3 million tons, up 1.6
percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government has targeted 52 million tons of rice output for
1997.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia imported between 1 million to 1.5 million tons of
rice in 1996, compared with 3 million tons in 1995.

<HEADLINE> House Committee Disagrees with Clinton on Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Congress' House International
Relations Committee voted today to overturn U.S. President Bill
Clinton's certification that Mexico is fully cooperating in the
battle against drugs.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee let the president avoid the
decertification on grounds of national interest.
</P>
<P>
The committee cast a bipartisan 27-5 vote for a resolution on
the matter. Under the law, Clinton has the right to waive any such
sanctions, even without the "let-out" provision in the House
committee's resolution.
</P>
<P>
House Majority Leader Dick Armey (Republican, Texas) has
scheduled a House vote on the measure for next week and similar
resolutions are pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"Not only are we changing Mexico's grade, we are also sending a
message to this administration that its international narcotics
control strategy is in shambles," said Benjamin Gilman
(Republican, New York) chairman of the Committee.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers have alleged that about 70 percent of the drugs
imported to the United States come through Mexico. They criticized
the Clinton administration for failing in its anti-drug strategy
when news came that a Mexican top anti-drug official was fired and
arrested for his link to drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
But White House National Security Council spokesman David
Johnson said: "We believe decertification would only undermine
Mexico's effort, making it more difficult for us to work together."
</P>
<P>
Representative Tom Lantos (Republican, California) called
decertification hypocritical. He said: "The only way to stop the
flow of drugs is to stop the demand for drugs here in the United
States."
</P>
<P>
If that happened, "Mexican drug lords will vanish because they
won't have anyone to sell drugs to," Lantos added.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Davidow, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, told the House committee that Mexico's anti-drug efforts
and cooperation with the United States had vastly improved over
the past year.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Slovakia Look to Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 6 (Xinhua) -- There are bright prospects for the
signing of a free trade agreement between Ukraine and Slovakia,
says Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko.
</P>
<P>
The only way to develop bilateral trade is to liberalize trade
between the two countries, Lazarenko told the Ukrainian Interfax
News Agency today, after talks with his Slovak counterpart,
Valdimir Meciar. They met in the border town of Uzhgorod, 755
kilometers southwest of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian leader said economic and trade cooperation
between the two sides could be further developed if a free trade
agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the signing of an agreement would herald the
further development of cooperation between Ukraine and other East
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar expressed hope that the
free-trade-and-tariff agreement, to be signed with Ukraine, would
provide a base for establishing a free trade zone. He hoped the
trade volume between the two countries could increase sevenfold in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia has started to build a highway linking itself with the
former soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Ukraine and Slovakia increased to 392.9 million
dollars in 1996, from 113.8 million dollars in 1993. Raw
materials accounted for about 67 percent of Ukrainian exports to
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Meciar said Slovakia was interested in helping Ukraine repair
pipe lines leading to his country. Ukraine could send to Slovak
40 billion cubic meters of gas every year after the repair project
was finished.

<HEADLINE> Compromise Pact Reached, Situation Remains Tense in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Albanian Democrats and
nine opposition parties today agreed to take measures to end the
one-month long unrest in the southern part of the country while
situation there remained tense.
</P>
<P>
A seven-point statement was signed by President Sali Berisha
and nine opposition leaders after more than five hours of talks,
supporting the restoration of constitutional order and
guaranteeing public order throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement promised to offer amnesty to anti-government
protesters who hand in weapons within two days, and promised that
Berisha would work on the appointment of a new prime minister to
replace Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi who stepped down last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the Council of Defense established last
weekend to order the suspension of military operations in the
unrest zones within 48 hours starting at 6 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
It also called for an all-party commission of experts to
investigate the demise of the pyramid investment schemes, in which
hundreds of thousands of Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The statement came just one day before President Berisha is to
receive delegations from the Organization on Security and
Cooperation in Europe and the European Union, which will push him
to end the bloody crisis by proposing an early election in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
More than 25 people have been killed in southern Albania in the
latest wave of violence and dozens of military officials have been
fired, including the defense minister and the chief of general
staff.
</P>
<P>
Protesters, armed with guns, tanks and torpedo boats they have
seized, have set up road blocks to prevent the military from
entering six southern towns they control, including Clore, Saranda
and Delvine, declaring that they would not give up unless Berisha
resigns.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Berisha showed his intention for a
non-military solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
It was after the parliament last Sunday declared a nationwide
state of emergency that the Albanian government ordered the
security forces to shoot armed protesters on sight and then
imposed dusk-to-dawn curfew following protesters stormed police,
seized weapons from state arsenals and went on a rampage of
looting and burning.
</P>
<P>
The United States and European states hailed the statement,
saying it was the first important concession from the government
for national political compromise.

<HEADLINE> Schools in Thailand Urged to Help Fight Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Teachers in Thailand have been
urged to cooperate with narcotics agents to wipe out the use of
drugs in high schools.
</P>
<P>
The Narcotics Control Board has called on secondary schools to
carry out a "drug demand reduction project" to keep students away
from narcotics, according to a report today.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, students will be divided into users and
non-users. The first group will be treated in hospitals, while the
second will be educated on the danger of narcotics, Prija
Champaratna, board deputy chief, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Student addicts will be allowed to resume schooling once they
are cured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Interior Minister Chalerm Yubamrung asked
school administrators to take drastic action against food sellers
and janitors who sold drug to students.
</P>
<P>
He also called on schools to send two teachers each to every
seminar on drug prevention and suppression organized by the Thai
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said schools which lack funds to support activities related
to drug prevention and suppression could seek help from his
ministry.
</P>
<P>
He added his ministry was pushing for legal amendments to allow
addicts to seek treatment after their arrest. Under the existing
law, addicts will be jailed and prosecuted in court after their
arrest.
</P>
<P>
He said this would encourage more parents and teachers to
inform authorities about their addicted children.

<HEADLINE> Austria Partly Meets European Monetary Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Austria has met part of the demands
for membership of the European Monetary Union (EMU) stipulated in
the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
A report on the Austrian economy for 1996/1997 issued by
Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) said the Austrian economy had entered a recovery phase with
its growth rates reaching 1.1 percent in 1996, and an estimated
1.4 and 2.3 percent in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficit would drop from 4.3 percent in 1996 to 3
percent in 1997. But, it would rise again in 1998 to 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The high rate of unemployment, which would reach 6.5 percent in
1997, would not drop before 1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
So, Austrian Prime Minister Viktor Klima and Financial Minister
Rudolf Edlinger stressed today that Austria would intensify its
efforts to reach most of the conditions for EMU by adjusting the
budget and improving employment.

<HEADLINE> Traces of Wild Cats Found in Suburban Guilin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Traces, believed to have been left
by tigers or leopards, have appeared recently in suburban Guilin
City in south China.
</P>
<P>
This is the first evidence of such animals in the area reported
in 30 years since the destruction of the forests.
</P>
<P>
A group of clear footprints were found on muddy ground recently
near Zhutou Mountain in the Guilin National Forest Park. Experts
of an investigation team believed they were left by two tigers or
leopards.
</P>
<P>
The large footprint was ten centimeters long and six cm wide,
and the small one was four cm long and 5.5 cm wide. From the
depth of the footprints, the experts inferred that the creatures
weighed about 60 kilograms and 20 kilograms respectively.
</P>
<P>
It is the first finding of wild cat traces near this renowned
tourist attraction in south China during the past 30 years, the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The last appearance of wild tigers and leopards in this area
was reported in the 1960s. Since then, they've disappeared due to
excessive lumbering and destruction of animal habitats.
</P>
<P>
However, the area reemerged as an ideal living place for wild
animals thanks to large-scale reforestation, particularly after
the forest park was established in 1992. About 80 percent of the
area has been covered by forests so far.
</P>
<P>
Wild tigers and leopards are both listed as endangered species
under China's top protection.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Launches Program to Boost Food Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is launching a "food for
the world" program to woo supermarket chains in major industrial
countries to buy processed Thai food products in a bid to boost
the country's food product exports.
</P>
<P>
The program will provide an introduction of Thai food products
to potential buyers, especially those in Japan, the United States
and the European Union, while helping Thai farmers to meet the
need.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is contacting supermarkets chains in those countries
for the purpose, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Thailand exports foods, such as frozen chicken,
frozen shrimp, canned food, fruits and other ready-made food to
Japan, the United States and Europe. Last year, its total food
exports to these regions were valued at 150 billion baht (6
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thailand has set a 10-percent growth target for its food
exports for this year. The Thai Industry Ministry called on local
food manufacturers to meet its sanitary standards, saying the
standards were one of the major barriers for Thai food exports.

<HEADLINE> Thai Steel Fastener Firms to Face EU Dumping Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai stainless steel fastener
manufacturers are to face anti-dumping investigation by the
European Union (EU), which claimed that the Thai products were
sold much less than those made in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU has filed an allegation against stainless steel
fasteners made by six Thai manufacturers on January 25, local
newspapers quoted a source from the Thai Commerce Ministry as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
The EU recently has called on Thai exporters as well as EU
importers and complainants to answer questionnaires, mainly
concerning the production cost and market prices of the products,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
Some local manufacturers said that they are puzzled about the
EU move, saying their products were sold to the United States at
even lower prices to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Some said that they would not answer the EU questionnaires
because they exported a small volume of fasteners to the EU. They
said they will no longer export fasteners to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The source also said that if the investigation found there was
dumping, a 20-40 percent anti-dumping duty would be imposed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Most of buildings in Bangkok lack
fire safety gear, such as automatic sprinkler systems, fire alarms
and fire hoses, a survey report available today said.
</P>
<P>
According to a random inspection of 287 buildings in Bangkok by
the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration on March 4-5,
three-quarters of the buildings inspected do not have automatic
sprinkler systems to contain internal fires.
</P>
<P>
The results of the inspection showed that about 45 percent of
these buildings do not have fire alarms and 56 percent do not have
internal fire hoses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the survey also indicated that 24 percent of the
buildings inspected are not easily accessible by fire engines.
</P>
<P>
Fire disasters increased over the past years in Thailand,
especially in Bangkok. Although the authorities in 1992
promulgated a law requiring multi-storey commercial and
residential buildings to be equipped with standard fire safety
equipment, some buildings owners did not follow.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepali Government Falls Unexpectedly Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's three-party coalition
government fell unexpectedly Thursday as it failed to secure a
confidence vote in the lower house of parliament mainly due to the
absence of two MPs of the main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
A confidence motion for the coalition government, led by Sher
Bahadur Deuba of the NC party, was defeated by 101 votes to 92 in
the 205-seat house Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 MPs including nine from the ruling side abstained
from voting on the motion, tabled by Prime Minister Deuba in the
house meeting earlier in the day, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The absence of NC MPs Deepak Shah and Chakra Shahi from
Thursday's house voting resulted in the unexpected fall of the
18-month-old government formed by the NC, the National Democratic
Party (RPP) and the Nepal Goodwill Party (NSP), they said.
</P>
<P>
The two MPs didn't show up at the house meeting for the whole
day despite all the fruitless efforts by police and ruling party
workers to search for them throughout the capital city.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspapers today, the defecting MPs were
lured by senior RPP leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand to be absent
from the house voting in a view to bringing down the government.
</P>
<P>
Chand, who is reportedly ambitious for the post of prime
minister, leads a RPP faction against the NC-RPP-NSP ruling
coalition and has been expecting to form a new coalition
government with main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
Worse for the Deuba government, NSP leader and Supplies
Minister Gajendra Narayan Singh announced his party's withdrawal
from the government at last minute just before the voting.
</P>
<P>
Almost all MPs of the main opposition CPN-UML, the largest
party in the house, voted against the prime minister's confidence
motion.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML President Man Mohan Adhikari earlier in his speech in
the house meeting urged MPs to vote down the government by
accusing it of being ineffective, directionless and being pulled
different ways by the three ruling partners.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deuba tendered his resignation to King Birendra
in the night and the king has called for the formation of an
alternative government with majority support in the lower house by
next Monday, the royal palace announced today.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected here that the CPN-UML, holding 90 seats
in the house, would form a new minority or another coalition
government with other parties to replace the ousted one.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to resume the
construction of the Thai-Myanmar friendship bridge soon after
Myanmar showed a green light to the project following a suspension
of nearly two years, a report here said today.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Thursday agreed to allow Thailand to resume the work on
the bridge, which links Mae Sot in Thailand's Tak province with
the Myawaddy checkpoint in Myanmar, after a Thai-Myanmar
subcommittee meeting on boundary disputes along the Moei river.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar ordered the project suspended on June 7, 1995 when 90
percent of which had been completed, accusing Thailand of illegal
encroachment by changing the Moei borderline, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was scheduled for completion by the end of 1995, but
the project was delayed due to conflicts over border demarcation
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Title Sweep A Mission Impossible For Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese table tennis players, who
clean-swept the world titles and Olympic gold medals in the recent
two years, can hardly repeat the feat in the coming World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yinsheng, president of the International Table Tennis
Federation (ITTF) who also heads the Chinese association in the
sport, warned that rising complacency might cost the Chinese gold
medals in the 44th World Championships which is to open late April
as European and South Korean players have formed a two-pronged
challenge to dethrone the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese men players now hold no edge over Europeans and South
Koreans," said Xu, also China's vice sport minister. "The worst
thing is that some players have become complacent and got a
feeling they can be invincible in the world and international
competitions."
</P>
<P>
Xu did not name the players who he alleges has become cocky.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoliang, Olympic singles and doubles winner and World Cup
holder, defending world champion Kong Linghui and doubles expert
Wang Tao now form the backbone of the Chinese men's team, and only
they have reason to belittle the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Xu said China aimed for three or four titles in the Manchester
Worlds.
</P>
<P>
"In England, the Chinese players won't have as many fans to
cheer for them as in the 43rd Championships held in Chinese city
Tianjin, they might not get used to the weather, time lag, living
conditions and competition facilities there," Xu said. "Therefore,
three or four gold medals are a reasonable goal."
</P>
<P>
The table tennis chief said the waterloo the Chinese suffered
in the Qatar Open late February laid bare a bitter fact this team
is not as strong as before.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, comprised of Liu, Kong and Wang, came home
empty-handed from the first leg of the world table tennis series
in Qatar. Sweden's 1992 Olympic champion Jan-Ove Waldner, at 31,
lifted the men's singles title after anchoring fellow countrymen
to the team top honor.
</P>
<P>
To most upset the Chinese table tennis authorities, the Chinese
team was beaten by its longtime rival South Korea for the second
time in less than two months.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans, paced by Kim Taek Soo, the world best

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua)-- China's consistent stand with

there and China has been making unremitting efforts to
this end, said China's foreign minister today.

<HEADLINE> East China Trying To Protect Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) --East China's Zhejiang province has
taken a series of measures to protect farmland and achieved
initial success.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita farmland in Zhejiang is some 0.33 ha, half the
nation's average and in recent years the total acreage decreased
by 20,000 ha each year.
</P>
<P>
To ensure grain production, the province has made great efforts
to curb the trend, and slogans on protecting farmland can be seen
everywhere. For the first time, the province seems to have struck
a balance between the use and expansion of farmland in recent
years, indicating some achievements in protecting farmland.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial statistics, last year farmland being
used for other purposes was 7,700 ha, but that newly developed
farmland surpassed that figure at 7,800 ha.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking officials are being asked to handle the job
themselves, and a series of rules and regulations have been worked
out and a large-scale study begun.
</P>
<P>
The province has been paying attention to "economizing on
farmland", and has opened up new farmland. Last year, it raised
590 million yuan just for reclaiming farmland. It has a plan to
add 33,000 ha of farmland and rework 330,000 ha of mid- and
low-yield farmland during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000).

XINING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
expects to see an increase in its GNP of 8.6 percent to 19.6
billion yuan for last year, according to the provincial statistics
bureau, in spite of the fact that it suffered from severe
snowstorms that affected its animal husbandry.

<HEADLINE> China, US will not enter a conflict: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- There is now no possibility for
China and the United States to enter into conflicts with each
other, unless China's territorial integrity and sovereignty are
infringed upon, Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said
here today.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment at a press conference on a book recently
published in the US which predicts a conflict between the two
countries is inevitable, Qian said, "I don't think this is a
correct conclusion as there is no possibility for China and the US
to enter into conflicts with each other unless the US harbors a
desire to infringe upon China's sovereignty and its territorial
integrity."
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, that kind of theory is rhetoric and the
continuation of the `China threat' theory," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"As far as our policy towards the relations with the US is
concerned, we implement the following principles, namely, to
increase trust, reduce trouble, develop cooperation, and avoid
confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, this was what President Jiang said during
a meeting with President Clinton shortly after the latter's
assumption of office several years ago," he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
"And the US side has already expressed their appreciation of the
policy," he said, "Not long ago, President Clinton also emphasized
that the US proceeds a policy of engagement with China rather than
a policy of containment."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome that," he added.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the policies of the Chinese and US governments are
concerned, we have a common ground and common interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I'm confident that we can expect that Sino-US relationship
will grow," Qian said, "I don't think that there is any
possibility that the two countries will enter a conflict."

<HEADLINE> Albania Says It Will Not Attack Rebel Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha has
assured Italy that he will not use military force to recover
control of the Southern Albanian cities held by armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said today Berisha had
assured him in their telephone conversation early today that "no
force would be used to regain the cities it (the Albanian
government) no longer controls."
</P>
<P>
Dini said there had been "numerous contacts" between the
Albanian government and the opposition and the "situation is
changing rapidly."
</P>
<P>
He said he did not rule out "some sort of accord relatively
quickly."
</P>
<P>
Dini spoke after talks with Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van
Mierlo, who will visit Albania on Friday for talks with Berisha
and the opposition on a European Union push for a solution to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Berisha, re-elected to a second five-year term on Monday, is
facing the worst crisis of his rule after insurgents in several
southern towns looted police and army weapons depots over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The insurgents hold sway in the southern port of Vlore, the
Adriatic coastal town of Sarande and several other points where
government troops have faced stiff resistance.
</P>
<P>
Italy, separated with Albania only by the Adriatic Sea, and
usually the destination for Albanians in any mass exodus, have
expressed alarm about the unrest rocking the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta said Italian naval
forces had entered Vlore to evacuate more Italians there after
helicopter from a frigate posted at the edge of Albanian waters
rescued 35 Italians on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mierlo, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, said
at his joint conference with Dini that he hoped his visit to
Tirana would "lead to developments in the next few days."
</P>
<P>
Dini and Mierlo also stressed that Europe was not contemplating
any kind of military intervention in Albania.
</P>
<P>
They said the only possible solution to the crisis was to form
a government of national reconciliation following a new round of
elections and refrain from exploiting the violence unleashed by
popular anger at the loss of savings in shady get-rich-quick
investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy and the EU were ready to supply humanitarian
aid to Albania. "But as for more substantial aid packages, we must
await a political solution."
</P>
<P>
The EU is the biggest source of economic aid to Albania.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Affairs Off-Limits for Foreign Countries: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, March 7 (Xinhua) - Vice Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen said here today that outside concerns over the future
of Hong Kong is "understandable" while asserting that "no foreign
country has the right to interfere in the affairs of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region."
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his views at a press conference organized by the
press center of China's legislature, the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign countries have interests in the financial,
commercial and economic sectors of Hong Kong, an international
metropolis, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So it's understandable that they are interested in the
development of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, if some countries think they have the right to
interfere in the affairs of Hong Kong, "they are going too far,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed confidence in the prosperity of Hong Kong after
its return to China when it becomes a special administrative
region of China's.
</P>
<P>
"Many people who left Hong Kong have returned during the
transitional period," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the election of HKSAR deputies to the Ninth NPC, Qian
noted that anyone who recognizes the Chinese Constitution and meets
qualifications as stipulated in the election method can stand
for election.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Not to Devalue Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's State Bank
Director-general Cao Si Kiem reaffirmed that the central bank will
not devalue the Vietnamese currency dong, but will allow it to
find its own level, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cao said the bank will not worry about fluctuations in the
foreign exchange market unless there are sharp increases. It would
not allow great disturbances in the domestic exchange market.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the current slightly higher value of the
U.S. dollar against dong to higher demand for the dollar, and
listed several reasons for it, with the trade deficit being the
most important.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam recorded a trade deficit of about 4 billion dollars in
1996 and 643 million dollars in the first two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The official said a stablized exchange rate, encouragement of
exports and strict control of imports are crucial to development
of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the bank would intervene promptly to curb any
major fluctuation.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on Cross-Strait Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen said here today that the principle of "One China" is
an important principle, and that the Taiwan side has set up
obstacles to cross-strait talks by abandoning this principle.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark today at a press conference organized
by the joint press center of the National People's Congress and
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that both sides across the Taiwan strait used to
agree on adhering to the "one China" principle, but the Taiwan
authorities have changed their attitude and refused to mention
"one China" and "reunification of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
"This is a real big question and a big problem," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in the meeting of the so-called "National
Development Congress" recently, the Taiwan authorities did not
mention the principle of "one China," nor did it mention
"reunification," and instead, called for the dilution, freezing or
abolishing of the term "Taiwan province," in an attempt to deny
the status of Taiwan as a province of China.
</P>
<P>
"It is rather puzzling," he said, explaining that because the
Taiwan side used to adhere to and endorse the "one China"
principle despite the fact that interpretations may differ. But
recently they have refused to mention this policy, and this has
caused significant difficulties on the road of cross-strait talks,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
As for a meeting between leaders of the two sides, Chinese
president Jiang Zemin has made his stand clear in his speech in
January, 1995, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang suggested that as the first step the two sides can, under
the principle of "one China," hold talks on ending hostility
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Now the Taiwan authorities have refused to mention the "one
China" principle and, by doing so, they have erected an obstacle
to such talks," Qian said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great importance to
the development of its relations with the European Union (EU),
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
China's relation with the European Union at present is quite
good, and in particular last year the Asia-Europe meeting was held
in Bangkok, which for the first time brought leaders of Asian and
European countries together, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the relations between Asia and Europe have been
growing smoothly and so have the relations between China and the
European Union, he said.
</P>
<P>
China always attaches importance to its relations with the
European Union, because this is in the interest of world peace,
economic development and will contribute to the emergence of a
more balanced world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the relations between China and France are at the
moment in very good shape, particularly since the two countries
reached an agreement in January 1994 whereby the French side made
a commitment that it would not adopt measures to arm Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ever since then the relations between China and France have
been growing rapidly, he said, adding that French President
Jacques Chirac will pay a visit to China in May.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this visit will be of major significance to the
promotion of the relations between China and France," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about China's viewpoint towards the eastward
expansion of NATO, Qian said that as an military block, any
measure that it takes should accommodate to the interests of
Europe and the region's peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> British Opposition to PLC Establishment Produces No Impact: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua)-- The opposition and excessive
reaction of the British side to the establishment of the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) is unreasonable and
unnecessary, and it will produce no impact on the smooth
transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made by Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen at a press conference here today presided
over by Zhou Jue, a spokesman for the Fifth Session of the Eight
National People's Congress (NPC), when asked by a Wen Hui Bao
reporter from Hong Kong about his view on the British opposition
to the PLC establishment and on the future of the post-Deng era.
</P>
<P>
Qian said, "The British side has expressed their opposition
to the establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council.
Their overreaction is unreasonable and unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
"The British side should have known that these things they do
not wish to see happen are entirely of their own making. If they
continue to voice their opposition to the operation of the PLC,
I don't think it will have any impact on the smooth transition
of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian stated that the PLC has already started operating
smoothly, saying that "the British side should have known the
consequence of this. Why did they do that in the first place?"
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that it is wise for them to see the situation
and to read the picture clearly. Now it is only 100 more days away
before Hong Kong's return to the motherland, it is advisable for
the British side to do more things which are in the interests of
the smooth transition, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
"This would serve the interests of Britain, the interests of
China and the interests of Hong Kong," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's behest of "One country, two systems" and "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "A high degree of autonomy"
will soon be materialized, Qian said.

WARSAW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz said here today that Russian stance on NATO's eastward
expansion is "very important."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a parliamentary meeting, Cimoszewicz, however, said
that the good relations between Poland and Russia would not be
affected by their difference on NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Led by the United States, NATO has been endeavoring to expand
eastward to include states of the former Warsaw Pact over recent
years. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are the top
contenders for NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been strongly opposed to NATO expansion, citing
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz described Russia's opposition to what he called the
"irreversible process" of NATO expansion as "regrettable." He
said that NATO expansion is of importance to Poland.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that Poland should not be optimistic
on NATO expansion too early, because there were many factors which
might make NATO delay its final decision on the process or even
decide to do something not fully conforming to Poland's wish.
</P>
<P>
A decision on NATO expansion will be made at a July NATO summit
in Madrid.

<P>
CARACAS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The "Interamerican Convention
Against Corruption", signed by 23 members of the Organization of
the American States (OAS) on March 29, 1996, came into force today.
</P>
<P>
The pact was initiated by Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera
at the 1994 OAS summit meeting in Miami, the United States.
</P>
<P>
It was adopted because OAS member states shared the view that
corruption undermined the legitimacy of public institutions,
society, moral order and justice as well as development.
</P>
<P>
The OAS said today that this was the first judicial instrument
to promote and strengthen the development of mechanisms that would
help prevent, detect, punish and eradicate corruption in the
region.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The basis for conducting bilateral
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is the
recognition that there is only one China in the world, said Qian
Qichen, China's vice-premier and foreign minister today.
</P>
<P>
In responsse to a question by a reporter from Taiwan, Qian said
that China has always stood for direct cross-strait shipping, mail
services and trade.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, up to now, it has seemed that the Taiwan
authorities are reluctant to talk about 'one China,' do not dare
to do so, and are afraid to do so." he said.
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances, how can direct negotiations between
the two sides proceed?" he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the basis for such negotiations is the recognition
that there is only one China in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to another question, Qian said that as China's
foreign minister he will not visit Taiwan since Taiwan is part of
China.

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen said in Beijing today that China prefers dialogue to
confrontation on the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about the possible sponsoring by the
United States of a resolution on human rights against China at
this year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Qian
said that this is no news.
</P>
<P>
"Since the beginning of the 1990s, the United States and EU
countries have for six consecutive years tabled anti-China
resolutions in Geneva, and every time they have suffered defeat,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"If they insist on doing the same thing this year, I can't see
any different outcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China's position on the question of human rights is to
conduct dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect, and
oppose confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, dialogue and confrontation are incompatible, and
it is impossible to have both. We prefer to have dialogue," he
concluded.

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great importance
to the development of its relations with the European Union (EU),
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here
today.
</P>
<P>
China's relation with the European Union at present is quite
good, and in particular last year the Meeting of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was held in Bangkok, which for
the first time brought leaders of Asian countries and European
countries together, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the relations between Asia and Europe have been
growing smoothly and so have the relations between China and the
European Union, he said.
</P>
<P>
China always attaches importance to its relations with the
European Union, because this is in the interest of world peace,
economic development and will contribute to the emergence of a
more balanced world.
</P>
<P>
When asked about China's viewpoint towards the eastward
expansion of NATO, Qian said that as an military block, any
measure that it takes should accommodate to the interests of
Europe and the region's peace and stability.

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen said today in Beijing that the Taiwan authorities
should adopt prudent and wise attitude toward Dalai's visit to

Every body knows who the Dalai Lama is, Qian said, pointing out
that he is a political figure in exile, who has long been engaged
in activities aiming at splitting the motherland, and his visit
will inevitably have political purposes.

"We are opposed to any activities of any one in whatever form
that are aimed to split the motherland," Qian warned.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' International Reserves Hit Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves (GIR), pushed by sustained influx of
foreign capital into the country, hit an all time high of 12.05
billion U.S. dollars as of Wednesday, local press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Singson, governor of the Philippine Central Bank, was
quoted as saying Thursday that the record level of the foreign
reserves can finance the country's 3.2 months of imports of goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
Singson attributed the healthy GIR build-up to strong
investment flows due to bullish sentiments about the Philippine
economy.
</P>
<P>
He was optimistic that the country will easily meet its target
GIR level of 14 billion dollars for 1997 which it pledged to the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
"Given the current level of investor confidence on the
Philippines, the targeted year-end GIR level of 14 billion dollars
by the central bank will certainly be achieved within a shorter
time frame," he said.

<P>
YANTAI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- An economic and technological
development zone of Yantai City, in east China's Shandong
Province, will increase efforts to improve its investment
environment and attract more overseas investment this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Yan Yuantian, director of the management committee
of the Yantai economic and technological development zone, they
expect to use 200 million U.S. dollars in overseas investment,
have 550 million U.S. dollars worth of imports and exports, and
have a 2.8 billion-yuan GDP in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Investors from 27 countries and regions have started businesses
in the zone, with contracts involving 1.46 billion U.S. dollars in
overseas investment. The Republic of Korea is the zone's biggest
overseas investment source.
</P>
<P>
The development zone approved 33 overseas-backed ventures last
year, involving a total investment of 850 million U.S. dollars,
and use of 660 million U.S. dollars of overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
As many new investors continue to come, 32 existing
overseas-funded enterprises in the zone have added an additional
200 million U.S. dollars to expand business, said Yan.

RIO DE JANEIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian 1994 World Cup
star Romario scored his 100th goal in the 116th games for Rio's
Flamengo on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The world's first-class forward just found his way back onto
the national team after a nearly three year absence due to series
of personal problems and lackluster performances.
</P>
<P>
Romario went back and forth between Brazil's Flamengo and Spain
where he played for Barcelona and Valencia.
</P>
<P>
The bad-tempered soccer star angered coach Mario Zagallo when
he turned him down for an exhibition game against the Slovak
Republic. The national head coach kept him off the national team
and out of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
However, Zagallo called him for an exhibition game against
Poland. His play in the match earned him good reviews and
probably a berth on the 1998 World Cup team.

ROME, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Minister Beniamino
Andreatta repeated today that NATO's enlargement should take place
on the basis of good relations with Russia which, eventually,
would be part of a European security structure.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta made the remark at a press conference while answering
questions about a statement Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
recently made in Moscow that the expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) could not happen without Russia's
consent.
</P>
<P>
"It is also in Moscow's interest to consolidate stability and
security in Europe," observed the defense minister, who had talks
with visiting Polish Defense Minister Stanislaw Dobrzanski prior
to the joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
Dobrzanski said Poland's membership in NATO "will contribute to
the stability of the whole European continent," instead of causing
new divisions and breaks as Moscow claimed.
</P>
<P>
He also described his talks with Andreatta as "transparent and
clear", saying he had no doubts that Italy would support Poland's
effort in joining the Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
Regarding bilateral cooperation, Andreatta said that
opportunities existed for greater cooperation between Italy and
Poland, and for closer ties between their armed forces, especially
in personnel training and the defense industries.

<HEADLINE> China to Control Building Large Department Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China will tighten control of the
construction of large and luxury department stores while
developing convenient retail outlets, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The country's retail sales grew an estimated 12.5 percent in
1996 and 26.6 percent in 1995. The profitable growth of retail
sales spurred the rise of large department stores.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 stores, each with a floor space of at least
10,000 square meters and an annual turnover exceeding 100 million
yuan, have sprung up across the country.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper suggested the managers of large stores to feel a
sense of crisis, noting that chain store will be competing with
the superstores in the future.
</P>
<P>
Some of the large department stores suffered profit downturns
last year.
</P>
<P>
Revenue growth rate of the large stores last year fell below
that for all retail sales of consumer goods, said an official with
the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are crowded into downtown business centers,
resulting in fierce competition, the newspaper noted, adding that
people prefer conveniently-located retail outlets near their homes.
</P>
<P>
The relatively low purchasing power of consumers also
contributed to lessening sales at large shopping centers, which
usually feature high-priced merchandise.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has become aware of the negative consequence of having
too many large stores and will not approve the construction of new
department stores with a floor space of more than 10,000 square
meters this year.

<HEADLINE> Journalists in Grozny to Move to Safety Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chechen Authorities today decided
to remove all journalists in Grozny to areas bordering on Chechnya
until the ongoing negotiations in Grozny between the delegates
from Russia and Chechnya concluded.
</P>
<P>
The decision was disclosed by Movladi Udugov, the First Acting
Deputy Prime Minister of Chechnya, to Itar-Tass, two days after
the kidnapping of four Russian journalists by unidentified gunmen
in Gronzy.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted Udugov as saying the decision was to protect
the journalists in Grozny, and to ensure the smooth continuity of
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappings had a negative impact on the negotiations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the main aim of the kidnappings was
to undermine the negotiations, in which the two sides are likely
to agree on a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of one journalist of Itar-Tass and three
journalists of Radio Russia, who were abducted by a group of
unidentified gunmen in Grozny Tuesday, is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Ignatenko Wednesday
condemned the kidnappings as an act of political provocation
against the new leadership of the Chechen Republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists after addressing the State Duma,
Ignatenko said the Russian government would establish direct
contact with the leadership of Chechnya in order to settle the
issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The local branch of the People's
Insurance Corporation of China Group in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recently began to cover local
state-financed water conservation projects on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for this type of insurance to be
provided in China, according to Wang Yanhui, a vice-general
manager of the regional PICC Properties branch.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to reduce losses of government-funded
reservoirs, power stations, and other projects caused by fires, or
natural disasters such as floods and mud-slides, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The PICC branch plans to insure 200 such projects in the next
three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Various types of disasters have caused huge losses for
state-run water conservation facilities. In 1996, they were as
much as 900 million yuan, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Local governments cannot rebuild these damaged facilities on
their own, so PICC's new form of service has been well received by
the regional government.

Australian dollars (157 billion US dollars) in debt to foreigners

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Three women entities in the
United Nations system have pooled efforts and resources to create
"WomenWatch," a joint space on the Internet on the advancement and
empowerment of women, which will be launched on International
Women's Day, 8 March.
</P>
<P>
The three women entities are the Division for the Advancement
of Women in the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable
Development, the U.N. Development Fund for Women and the
International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement
of Women.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the three entities said WomenWatch is a
gateway to U.N. information and data on women worldwide and an
evolving electronic forum on global women's issues in the
follow-up to the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women held in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The joint initiative responds to a growing demand for
information, which can be obtained today at unprecedented speed
through the use of computer communication technology. Women stand
to benefit from these new technologies and to be on the cutting
edge of their development.
</P>
<P>
One of the objectives of WomenWatch is to enable more women to
not only be mere users of computer networking, but also be
producers and full beneficiaries as recommended by the Beijing
Platform for Action, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Mostly Lower, Dow Changed Little </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks turned mostly
lower today as interest rates rose in the bond market on worries
about Friday's report on February employment and more signs for an
overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.15 points to 6,944.70.
The blue-chip barometer gained 93 points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Technology issues suffered the sharpest losses for the day.
</P>
<P>
Investors are mostly worried about Friday's report on payroll
and wage levels, a key force behind production costs and
inflation. They are also awaiting anxiously the February
employment. A year ago, a surprisingly strong report on February
employment led bo a 171-point plunge in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond rose from 6.82 percent late Wednesday to 6.88 percent, the
highest finish since late January.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 522.48 million shares,
down slightly from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 3.40 to 798.59, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 0.43 to 420.24.
</P>
<P>
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 13.66 to
1,315.43, and the American Stock Exchange composite index fell
0.57 to 600.31.
</P>
<P>
On the New York foreign exchange market, one U.S. dollar is
sold for 121.13 yen, slightly down from 121.21 yen on the previous
day. One U.S. dollar was changed for 1.7155 marks, a bit higher
than the 1.7121 level.

<HEADLINE> 3-Strikes Laws Affect Little in Crime Rates in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A study found that the
"three-strikes" laws in the United States mandating long sentences
for three-time violent offenders have little affect in bringing
down crime in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Police Institute, a group that studies the justice
system, said today that between 1994 and 1995, both violent and
overall crime rates dropped more in the 37 states without three
strikes laws than in the 13 that had such laws.
</P>
<P>
Violent crime fell 4.6 percent in states without the laws, but
in the states with the laws, violent crime dropped by 1.7 percent,
the group said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, for overall crime, the states without the laws saw a
decline of 1.2 percent, but the states with the mandatory
sentencing provisions gained only a 0.4 percent decrease.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Continues Meeting on Jewish Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today continued its formal meeting on an Israeli plan to build
Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem, with 26 more member states
calling upon Israel to rescind the plan.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union deeply deplores the decision of the Israeli
government to approve construction plans for Jabal Abu Ghneim/Har
Homa on the West Bank in the Jerusalem area," said J. Berteling,
deputy permanent representative of the Netherlands, on behalf of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"This poses a threat to these positive developments," he said,
referring to redeployment of Israeli troops from Hebron. "The EU
has repeatedly stated that settlements in the occupied territories
contravene international law and pose a major obstacle to peace."
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Ambassador Nugroho Wisnumurti said the settlement
actions are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"They are in clear violation of Security Council and General
Assembly resolutions, as well as incompatible with the Declaration
of Principles and subsequent agreements, both in letter and in
spirit, and indeed generally accepted principles of international
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the fear that the mutual trust and confidence,
which have assiduously been built over the past four years, are
placed in jeopardy by Israel and that the arbitrary acts may
provoke a new wave of Palestinian anger and frustrations with
unpredictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabian Ambassador Abdulrahman Al-Ahmed told the council
that Jerusalem is the crux of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the
most pivotal issue that occupies the attention of the Arab Muslim
world.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned to see how the Israeli authorities are
continuing to commit acts that intend to change the demographic
and structural character which aims to judaize holy Jerusalem, as
well as its legal, historical, religions and cultural reality," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is "the first Qubla and the third holiest place for
Muslims and the center of their attention," he said. "They will
not feel content until all their rights are returned to them."
</P>
<P>
He warned that the failure of Israel to completely stop any
settlements in Arab Jerusalem would engulf the region back into
a whirlpool of conflict, tension, and instability.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Industrial orders in Germany rose by
2.4 percent in January after falling by 1.9 percent in December,
the Economics Ministry reported today, attributing the increase to
rising export orders.
</P>
<P>
Germany's export orders in January surged 7.3 percent, while
domestic orders dropped by 0.8 percent, compared with a 1.4
percent decline in December.
</P>
<P>
Businesses in western Germany enjoyed a 2.5 percent increase in
orders, while a 0.4 percent decrease was registered by eastern
German firms.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that however, the price and
seasonally-adjusted figures for the two-month December-January
period showed that industrial orders were still down 1 percent
from the last two-month period.

<HEADLINE> German Machinery Industry Sees Stronger Growth, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The German machinery industry is
expecting a 3 percent growth in production in 1997, but it seems
inevitable that massive jobs would still be axed, the machinery
industry association said today.
</P>
<P>
After a disappointing 1.2 percent growth in 1996, German
machinery builders are expecting strong foreign demand thanks to
the rising dollar, said the German Machine-building and Plant
Manufacturing Association (VDMA) in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time since 1985, all the key markets are
growing, from North and South America to Asia, and all the
prospects are good," VDMA president Michael Rogowske said.
</P>
<P>
That bright prospect, however, will not help to save jobs. A
further 10,000 to 20,000 jobs were predicted to be slashed this
year, after last year's losses of 38,000 jobs due to massive
bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
The machinery industry in Germany employed about 943,000 people
at the end of last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
called for a bipartisan approach to education reform to raise the
education quality.
</P>
<P>
Addressing state lawmakers as the guest of Republican Gov. John
Engler in Lansing, Michigan, the president said, "We have to forge
a new partnership for a new time."
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted, "Our schools are still turning out millions of
young people who simply are not equipped for the new world of
work."
</P>
<P>
He urged states to establish one set of performance standards
and tests that measure students' ability to compete in the world.
</P>
<P>
"I want to create a climate in which no one can say no, and
which is voluntary but you are ashamed if you don't give your kids
their chance to do this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to critics who worry that the poorest and slowest of
students would be held back by standardized testing, Clinton said,
"Sometimes out of the goodness of our heart, we exercise our
compassion by expecting less of them, and we are selling their
future right down the drain every day."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe all
surged strongly and ended sharply higher today, with both London
and Paris hitting record closing highs, fueled by Wall Strent's
strength and a firm dollar.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London had breached the 4,400-point level and
scored record gains earlier in the day before succumbing to
profit-taking in late trading, with the FTSE 100 index ending 39.2
points higher at 4,399.3, a new record closing for the third
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
Investors drove the market higher after Wall Street's 100-point
surge Wednesday and after UK interest rates were left unchanged
today after Wednesday's monetary meeting between Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Governor of the Bank of England Eddie
George.
</P>
<P>
However, buyers soon became cautious ahead of the US jobs
report to be released Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares were also pushed higher by ongoing
strength in the dollar, strong bond prices and Wall Street's
overnight gains, with the DAX-30 index having climbed to a new
record trading high of 3,426.54 points before finishing the
session 52.61 points up at 3,417.60.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse, as the other two major European markets,
enjoyed solid gains in heavy volume, supported by a firm dollar
and a strong Wall Street, with the CAC-40 index closing the day's
trade at a new record high, 32.73 points up at 2,698.92.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon today confirmed
that the United States and South Korea had canceled the Team
Spirit military exercises on the occasion of talks between the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the United States
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
But spokesman Michael Doubleday said that Team Spirit was only
one of many exercises the United States undertakes with South
Korea. He stressed that not all of the exercises had been
canceled.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Seoul announced that the United States and South
Korea had canceled this year's Team Spirit military exercises to
ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has constantly denounced the joint war games as
preparation for an invasion into the country.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK's delegation Wednesday held talks with the United States
and South Korea in New York over U.S.-South Korean jointly
proposed peace settlement on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The United States said after a day-long meeting that the talks
were "positive, sincere and serious" on all sides.
</P>
<P>
"There were no breakthroughs, but we are hopeful North Korea
will join peace talks in the future," U.S. State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said Wednesday.

<P>
ATHENS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
and Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo held talks here today
to discuss the situation in Albania and ways of handling the
crisis in that country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after two hours of talks, Simitis
stressed the need for the democratization process to proceed in
Albania, and said that the use of violence would have negative
consequences.
</P>
<P>
"The strengthening of democracy in Albania will facilitate and
speed up procedures for the provision of aid by the European Union
to relieve the suffering Albanian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both men described the proposed mission of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to the country, headed by
Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, as "very useful." They
expressed support of the European Union to this initiative. They
also noted that in their separate telephone conversations with
Albanian President Sali Berisha, he referred to the prospect of
proclaiming early elections in his country.
</P>
<P>
Van Mierlo, whose country currently holds the rotating EU
presidency, expressed the view that the crisis could be controlled
and noted that Berisha attributed great significance to the
economic aid the EU could provide.
</P>
<P>
Van Mierlo will fly to Tirana Friday to meet Berisha and
leaders of political parties.

<HEADLINE> US Testing Missile Fails to Intercept Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon's test of an
anti-missile missile today again failed to intercept its target,
the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth failure in four tests of the Thaad
interceptor since December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said the cause of the latest failure has not
been determined.
</P>
<P>
Paul Kaminski, the top Pentagon official in charge of weapons
development, said last month that further failure of the Thaad
test would prompt the Pentagon to push back its goal of fielding
the system in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The missile project is a top priority for the Pentagon to
prevent the U.S. and its alllied troops from being attacked by
medium-range ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
Thaad is intended to provide a better defense than the Patriot,
the only current antimissile missile in use.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, said 2.46
billion U.S. dollars has been spent on the project since 1990.

be expected to increase its subsidies from 1 billion marks (580
million dollars) annually to 2.5 billion marks (1.45 billion
dollars). Chancellery Minister Friedrich Bohl said some 30,000 out
of the present 90,000 jobs would remain.
</P>
<P>
Germany's coal-mining industry is mainly based in and around
the Ruhr Valley in the west of Germany. Although coal production
cost in Germany runs higher than that in other countries, Bonn has
been subsidizing the heavily-unionized sector against any possible
unrest.
</P>
<P>
IG Bergbau leader Hans Berger immediately denounced the
government proposal as "not worthy of compromise," threatening to
launch a fresh round of demonstrations. The two sides will resume
negotiations next Tuesday at the latest.

<HEADLINE> Working Party on China's Accession to WTO Ends  3rd Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The third meeting of the Working
Party on China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
ended here today with all sides unanimously calling it positive,
constructive and productive.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement on a few key sections has important significance
for China's WTO accession," said Long Yongtu, China's chief
representative for trade negotiations, during the
one-and-half-hour plenary session this afternoon. "I would like to
draw your special attention to the agreement on the section of
right to trade."
</P>
<P>
Long stressed, "The successful conclusion of this agreement as
well as other important progress we made during this Working Party
meeting clearly demonstrate the resolute determination of the
Chinese government to continue the implementation of the policy of
reform and opening to the outside world initiated by Mr. Deng
Xiaoping. This policy is of decisive importance in accelerating
the process of China's accession to the WTO."
</P>
<P>
Long noted that there are still many pending issues in China's
negotiations with WTO members. However, he said, "We believe that
the negotiations shall continue to achieve progress so long as we
have the political will to resolve these issues without
interference of other irrelevant factors."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Working Party Pierre-Louis Girard called the
multilateral consultations this week "especially productive."
"Significant progress has been made on major issues.
Clarifications have also been made which, in my view, should lead
to further narrowing of positions and, ultimately, to achieving
overall consensus on the conditions of China's accession," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"China understands requirements of the WTO. I think that's very
good. We made general progress discussing a number of subsidy
issues," Lee Sands, a trade representative of the United States,
told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Trade Commissioner of the European Union (EU) Sir
Leon Brittan issued a statement today on China's accession to the
WTO. He said, "The time has come to turn the new mood of optimism
into concrete progress on the ground. The EU believes that if all
sides muster sufficient political will, the terms of China's
accession could be agreed by the end of the year. For this to
happen, China must make bold and meaningful commitments to market
reform in areas that are vital to the smooth functioning of the
WTO."
</P>
<P>
Trade sources in Geneva said that some WTO members still have
concerns about issues like agriculture, services and non-tariff
barriers.
</P>
<P>
Since its arrival in Geneva on February 23, the Chinese trade
delegation has had bilateral talks with the US, the EU, Canada,
Japan, Australia, Norway, Argentina, Chile, Cuba and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Long leaves for Beijing Friday. Other members of the delegation
will continue bilateral talks with other WTO members mainly in
Latin America next week.
</P>
<P>
The next fourth meeting of the Working Party on China's
accession will be held here in mid-May.

<HEADLINE> UK Women Enjoy Higher Employment Rate Than Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment among Britain's women
is much lower than for men, and UK women are unemployed for a
shorter time than men, showed official figures today.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said today that the
unemployment rate for women now stands at 3.5 percent, with
430,000 out of work, while for men it is 8.8 percent, or nearly
1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that 34 percent of all unemployed women have been
out of work and looking for a job for less than three months,
compared with 22 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 45 percent of all unemployed men have been out of
work and looking for a job for more than a year, compared with
only 28 percent of unemployed women.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons why female unemployment is lower than
that for men is that employers prefer hiring women, often at lower
pay rates than men, and many of the jobs on offer, often part-time
and temporary, are frequently favored by women.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are 1.3 million more British women
in work now compared with 10 years ago, with 700,000 of the
increase in part-time jobs.

<HEADLINE> US, Qatar Hold Military Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Qatar
have held a new round of talks on military cooperation between the
two countries, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
It was their third annual military consultative committee
meeting held in Washington on the two previous days, discussing
bilateral and regional issues, a Pentagon spokesman said. But he
declined to provide details on the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon only said in a statement that the meeting, which
followed its first in Qatar in April 1994 and second in Washington
in April 1995, "reflects the ongoing expansion of military
cooperation between the United States and the State of Qatar."
</P>
<P>
The other evidence to show the expansion of the cooperation was
the 30-plane Airpower Expeditionary Force currently operating in
Qatar, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Airpower Expeditionary Force was deployed to Qatar by the
U.S. Central Command in February in support of Operation Southern
Watch, which was for the purpose of increasing U.S. air force over
U.S. unilaterally-enlarged no-fly zone in southern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Criticizes European Politicians' Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller today flatly rejected a suggestion
by leading European politicians to deny the possibility of Turkey's
full European Union (EU) membership.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the EU ambassadors at a working lunch, Ciller
insisted that Turkey, by the very standards that the EU itself
has set, is more eligible for membership than any other contenders.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the leaders of Christian Democrat parties, that
form the center-right European People's Party (EPP), held in
Brussels Tuesday reached a consensus that "Turkey is not a
candidate to become an EU member, short-term or long," reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
EPP president and also former Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried
Martens said that EU wants to maintain a close cooperation with
Ankara but Turkey's bid for EU membership is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Ciller explained to the EU ambassadors that Turkey is proud to
have played the role it did as a staunch NATO ally in the "great
victory" which resulted in the end of the Cold War to the West's
advantage.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said: "As we watch the convening of a series of major
meetings to plan 'new Europe,' only Turkey is being kept outside
the room. While each of our former Warsaw Pact adversaries is
warmly welcomed, Turkey is being asked to step aside."
</P>
<P>
If the competition involving Turkey and former Warsaw Pact
applicants for the EU membership is fairly judged, then Ankara
"would score very high," said she.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said: "We ask to be judged by
exactly the same criteria as every other applicant."
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, she continued, there will be "a map of Europe with
inconsistencies and aberrations."
</P>
<P>
"For example, if all the current applicants for EU membership
and NATO membership were accepted except Turkey, there would only
be one nation in Europe that belongs to NATO but was denied
admission to the EU," she added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an associate member of the EU, has long been
struggling for a full membership, but witnesses no breakthrough
due to some controversial issues with the EU.

<HEADLINE> US Urged to Pay UN Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A record 98 nations have
already paid their United Nations assessments in full, but the
United States still owes the world body 1.3 billion U.S. dollars,
U.N. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The host country's failure to pay 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in
arrears -- 377 million U.S. dollars to the U.N. regular budget and
926 million U.S. dollars to the peacekeeping department --
continues to cripple finances of the United Nations as its debt
accounts for 61 percent of the U.N. deficit.
</P>
<P>
"You can sum up the United States' payment in two words," said
Joseph Connor, the U.N. undersecretary general for management and
budget, "Late and partial."
</P>
<P>
Connor, an American who used to head the Price Waterhouse
accounting firm, noted that even though more nations are paying
their assessments in full and nearly on time, the dent in the U.N.
deficit is surprising small.
</P>
<P>
As of December 31, 1996, the United Nations's 184 member states
owe 511 million U.S. dollars to the U.N. general budget and 1.6
billion to the peacekeeping department. The total shortfall is
2.27 billion U.S. dollars, down from 2.3 billion U.S. dollars a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The information and advocacy group U.N. Association for the
U.S.A. released a report earlier in the week, strongly urging the
United States to pay its debt to the world body and its affiliated
agencies.
</P>
<P>
The report was signed by former U.S. Assistant Secretaries of
State Charles Maynes and Richard Williamson, former U.S.
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and former U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that by failing to pay its U.N. debt, the
United States is losing influence in the world scene, and losing
face by failing to honor its treaty obligations.

<HEADLINE> UK Interest Rates Remain Unchanged at 6 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's base interest rates were
left unchanged at 6 percent after Wednesday's monthly monetary
meeting between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and
Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England, Britain's central bank, has been pressing
for base rates to be raised by 0.25 point for some months, arguing
that otherwise the government will miss its inflation target in
two years' time.
</P>
<P>
However, Clarke has been resisting the bank's call for higher
interest rates and has made it equally clear that he saw no need
for tighter credit and that the strong British pound was having a
big deflationary effect on the British economy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a survey of 20 economists found that no one
had expected base rates to be raised Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Today the bank dealt at unchanged rates in its normal daily
money market operations and there was little surprise among
dealers.
</P>
<P>
Britain last raised its base rates by a quarter point to 6
percent on October 30 last year.
