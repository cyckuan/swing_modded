<HEADLINE> British Prime Minister Plans Student Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
is planning a massive expansion of universities and colleges over
the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who put education at heart of New Labor's election
manifesto, wants at least 50 percent of all people under the age
of 30 to take part in higher education, according to a report from
The Guardian newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the new places would be on part-time courses, so
students could learn at the same time as working or looking after
a family.
</P>
<P>
A Department for Education spokesman confirmed there were plans
under way to look at how to achieve a large-scale expansion of
college and university places. The figure of 50 percent would
include part-time students and flexible courses, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Education Secretary David Blunkett has already set a target of
35 percent of 18- to 21-year-olds studying in higher education by
2002.
</P>
<P>
A more ambitious target would be likely to become part of the
government's promises for a second term in office, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Higher Education Funding Council for England
announced this year's university funding settlement, which
included an extra 95 million pounds (about 160 million U.S.
dollars) to help widen access to degree courses to students from
poorer families.
</P>
<P>
The new money would be spent over two years on improving the
training of managers and lecturers, modernizing equipment and
buildings, and widening participation in further education.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Coordinator Reviews DPRK Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy William Perry said Monday
the conclusion of his report on the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) will be made in full harmony with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at Seoul Kimpo International Airport, Perry, the U.
S. coordinator on DPRK policy, said in a arrival statement that
the South Korean government's viewpoint is an essential condition
for making U.S. DPRK policy.
</P>
<P>
Perry was appointed as the coordinator to review the Clinton
Administration's DPRK policy in accordance with the 1994 nuclear
agreement signed in Geneva amid increasing criticism by the
Republican-led House of Representatives of the agreement after
Pyongyang's successful launch of a satellite.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. defense secretary said he is still making an
overall review of the DPRK policy and that he has not yet made a
final report to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton wants to know South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung's view on the DPRK policy, said Perry, who is expected to
meet Kim Dae-jung, Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young and other
South Korean senior officials.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Perry pointed out that engagement is a
positive element of a policy basis Seoul and Washington should
make and Clinton voiced his support of it at his two meetings with
Kim last year.
</P>
<P>
However, in his recently published book titled "Preventive
Defense", Perry expressed his concern over President Kim Dae-jung'
s "sunshine policy" which seeks reconciliation, exchanges and
cooperation with the DPRK based on separating economics from
politics.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the book clearly shows the differences between
the United States and South Korea on the DPRK issue.

<HEADLINE> NATO General Complains of Bloc Split Over Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A top NATO official Monday accused
some political leaders in the 15-nation bloc of undermining the
Alliance's ability to take action against Yugoslavia over the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
NATO Military Committee chairman General Klaus Naumann,
addressing a London conference, said unnamed leaders of the bloc
were giving Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic "guarantees that
certain things won't happen."
</P>
<P>
NATO has threatened to strike at Serb forces in and around
Kosovo if Belgrade is deemed to be blocking a deal to end the
conflict in the ethnic Albanian region of Serbia, although some
member states are not altogether comfortable with the idea, a
Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
"I am unhappy that some of our Alliance leaders are giving
President Slobodan Milosevic guarantees that certain things won't
happen, so he can play chess with us," Naumann was quoted by
Reuters as telling a conference marking NATO's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Such guarantees made it harder for NATO to keep Milosevic
guessing as to what the Alliance might do, he said. "Everyone
should rest assured that anyone who dares to raise his weapons
against NATO will not have a good time in the long run. This
uncertainty has to remain and we will remain free to use all
instruments in our quiver so that anyone should know uncertainty
is a factor of risk calculation."
</P>
<P>
Naumann refused to say as to what measures NATO might be
prepared to take against Belgrade next, noting that "one should
never try to answer this question precisely in advance. Everyone
should know that this Alliance will use all the instruments it has
as soon as it is threatened."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Lets Kurdish's Party to Run in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's highest court Monday
rejected an appeal lodged by the Court of Appeals demanding the
closure of a Kurdish party and ban on its participation in the
upcoming April 18 elections.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Constitutional Court said the
People's Democracy Party, which is allegedly linked to the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), can run in the local and
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was reached following a four-hour-long meeting on
the appeal raised by Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas that aimed at
putting an end to the Kurdish party.
</P>
<P>
The HADEP has strong opportunities in the local elections in
the Kurdish-dominated southeast, where the PKK has been waging a
15-year-old war for independence despite the capture of its
leader, Abdullah Ocalan, by Turkish authorities.
</P>
<P>
Savas charged that the HADEP was operating as a branch of the
PKK and accused it of inciting separatism based on ethnic lines
and enlisting volunteers for the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Savas cited a nationwide hunger strike staged by the HADEP
members last November in support the PKK as evidence.
</P>
<P>
The HADEP may face closure if the Constitutional Court rules in
the future that it has close ties with the PKK, deemed a
separatist terrorist group by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Turkey's Constitutional Court has banned 14
political parties for various reasons, arousing European concerns
over its human rights record.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Port Workers' Strike Causes Huge Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The nine-day-long Israeli port
worker's strike has caused huge economic losses to the country,
and port authorities and manufacture associations have asked the
government to help end the strike.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the port authorities told the Israel Radio on
Monday that during the past nine days, 58 large cargo ships were
forced to leave Israel without unloading due to the work stoppage
and about 500 million U.S. dollars of material and supplies could
not reach Israel.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strike, many Israeli companies and factories are
facing shortage of supplies and some of them are on the verge of
close-down, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, port authorities and representatives from several
local companies and factories on Monday urged Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to help end this strike.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the Israeli National Trade Unions, the port
workers are striking for salary increase, but so far their
demands are not met.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Announces Delay in N.Irish Power Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
Monday a three-week delay until March 29 for forming a new
home-rule executive in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the delay, Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam
told a news conference Monday, "This gives the parties the time
and space to find a way forward."
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland secretary had originally set March 10 as
the deadline for transfer of power from London, but a dispute over
Irish Republican Army (IRA) disarmament has held up the creation
of a new power-sharing cabinet composed of Protestant and Roman
Catholic politicians.
</P>
<P>
The proposed handover is seen as an important part of last
year's "Good Friday" peace deal, intended to draw a line under 30
years of political and sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
As many Northern Ireland politicians would be visiting the
United States next week for St Partick's Day celebrations, "there
will be opportunities to build confidence and talk informally
together, ready for an intensive round of discussions when they
return to Belfast," Mowlam was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam made it clear that it was up to the parties to ensure
the success of the new executive, saying "power can only be
transferred and exercised with cross-community support."

KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said Monday that women's status in the east African country has
been greatly improved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks when addressing a public rally
marking the International Women's Day in the southwestern district
of Mbarara, Radio Uganda reported.

<P>
He said that the recently enacted land law has several

The government has launched a poverty alleviation action plan
which has focused on five sectors including improvement of road
network and establishment of sound food marketing structures, he

<P>
The president acknowledged that poverty still constitutes a big
threat to the country and urged leaders at all levels to make
poverty elimination a priority task.

<HEADLINE> No Secret Deal in Pak-India Talks: FM Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said here Monday that there was no secret deal with
India during Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to
Pakistan last month.
</P>
<P>
Making a policy statement at the Senate on Vajpayee's visit,
Aziz said that Pakistan would not compromise on its principled
stand on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
There was no secret understanding or deal during the talks
between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart
Vajpayee, the foreign minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Vajpayee himself underlined the need to resolve
the long-standing Kashmir dispute through bilateral process in his
three public announcements during his two-day stay in Lahore on
February 20-21.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Lahore Declaration signed by the prime
ministers of Pakistan and India, Aziz said the document
establishes the commitment of both sides to intensify their
efforts to resolve the outstanding issue of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"It is our conviction that the government policy of engaging
with India at the highest level has better served the Kashmir
cause," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the most significant outcome of the Pak-India
Summit has been the agreement between the two prime ministers to
intensify the efforts for the resolution of the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The Lahore Declaration, Aziz said, also underscores the
commitment of both sides to the principles and purposes of the
U.N. charter as well as reiterating their determination to
implement the Simla agreement in letter and spirit.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that peace, progress and prosperity in South Asia are
not possible without an environment of security and stability, for
which purpose it is imperative to resolve the Kashmir dispute, the
root cause of tensions in the region.

ASMARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- An Eritrean youth leader confirmed
in Asmara Monday that his country will host this year's
Confederation of East and Central Africa Football Associations
(CECAFA) Youth Championship.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the National Union of the Eritrean Youth and

</P>
<P>
He noted that Ethiopia refused to play with the Eritrean team

Earlier, reports said that the venue of the football games
might have to be shifted to either Kenya, Zanzibar or Uganda
because of the escalating war between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

<P>
The event is scheduled to take place in Eritrean capital Asmara
from April 10 to 24. Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Somalia and Sudan
were reported to have confirmed their participation.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no sign showing that an immediate cease-fire

<HEADLINE> US, EU Criticized at WTO Special Meeting Over Banana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Both the United States and the
European Union have been criticized for their handling of the
escalating banana dispute at a special meeting of the General
Council of the World Trade Organization (WTO), according to trade
officials here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called at the European Union's request last
Thursday when the United States ordered importers to post deposits
against selected EU goods in anticipation of the possible
imposition of 100 percent duties.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the 134 WTO members, including the
Latin American countries associated with the U.S. in the banana
dispute, said that the U.S. unilateral action was not consistent
with the rule of the multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
Many also complained that the "extraordinary meeting" of the
General Council at the EU's request in such short notice was a
"source of frustrations."
</P>
<P>
Usually members should have 10 days's notice to hold a special
meeting of the General Council, the WTO's governing body.
</P>
<P>
In their statements at the closed-door meeting, WTO members
said that they thought the banana dispute between the U.S. and the
EU should be resolved at a meeting of the organization's Dispute
Settlement Body rather than the decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
The world is "mesmerized" by the dispute even though EU-U.S.
trade amounts to only 5 percent of the global market, Canadian
Ambassador John Weekes was reported as saying. The WTO should be
focusing on the other 95 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
WTO members urged the two "most powerful members" to show
leadership in settling their trade dispute and not to take any
"additional unnecessary actions."
</P>
<P>
No decisions have been taken during the one-day meeting, the
trade officials told reporters.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Withdraws Charge Against Swiss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A South African court Monday
dropped a charge of unlawful possession of the country's state
secret document against a Swiss journalist.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the South African prosecution, the Cape Town
Magistrate's Court informed Swiss TV journalist Jean-Philippe
Ceppi that the charge has been withdrawn and he is free, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Ceppi was arrested last Friday in Cape Town for alleged illegal
 possession of a top secret military intelligence document, the
contents of which have so far remained a mystery. The police said
Ceppi's arrest followed a request by military intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss national and a colleague were in South Africa to
investigate the role of Swiss banks in the former apartheid
government.
</P>
<P>
Ceppi's lawyer said Monday after his release that the charge
was withdrawn because there had been no basis for it.
</P>
<P>
He said in terms of South African law, a prosecution concerning
military intelligence cannot go ahead without an order of the
Directorate of Public Prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
However, having heard all relevant representations, Western
Cape Director of Public Prosecutions, Frank Kahn, decided there
was no case.
</P>
<P>
The documents in question have been returned to Ceppi, a
further proof that they are public documents, Ceppi's lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
Ceppi has not decided on whether to launch a civil action for
alleged unlawful arrest, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
Swiss ambassador to South Africa Robert Mayor, who attended
Ceppi's hearing Monday, said he understood the reason for Ceppi's
arrest but did not want to get involved.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Partnership in Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Monday called on
countries to decentralize developmental activities by adopting
comprehensive frameworks through which they can link themselves to
local and global institutions.
</P>
<P>
Macro-economic management and policy division manager of the
World Bank Ishac Diwan told a capacity building workshop in Harare
that governments should be more open to work with the private
sector and the civil society.
</P>
<P>
He said that countries should be in the driving seat of their
own development programs.
</P>
<P>
He said it was imperative for governments, international
organizations and civic society to work in partnership for
development to take place.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for countries to have knowledge for long term
visions rather than having short term and myopic plans as is
usually the case with politicians," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, he said, had started a comprehensive
development framework pilot project with Ethiopia, Ghana, Bolivia
and Turkey which would later be extended to other countries if
successful.
</P>
<P>
The capacity building workshop is being attended by more than
50 representatives of economic research institutes and foundations
from sub- Saharan Africa, as well as Germany, Lebanon, Poland and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is being held under the theme: "Think tanks as policy
catalysts in Africa: A capacity building workshop". It will run
for three days.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Injured in U.S.-British Warplane Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi citizen was injured in
U.S. and British air raids against a number of civilian facilities
on Monday, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 9:50 a.m. local time (0650 GMT), 11
formations of F-14, F-15 and F-16 warplanes supported by early
warning AWACS from the Turkish airspace violated Iraqi airspace
over Neineva, Erbil and Dohuk provinces.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes shelled civilian targets and anti-aircraft
artillery positions, injuring one Iraqi citizen, he said. He did
not say whether the injured is a military personnel or a civilian.
</P>
<P>
"Our anti-aircraft defenses challenged the hostile warplanes
and forced them to flee, returning to their bases at 2 p.m. local
time (1100 GMT)," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that at 11:15 a.m. local time (0815 GMT), hostile
formations coming from Kuwaiti and Saudi bases violated Iraqi
airspace over Dhi-Qar, Wassit, Misan and al-Muthana provinces.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Iraqi air defense forces and U.S. and British
jets patrolling the no-fly zones have almost become a daily
occurrence since the mid-December U.S.-British bombardment of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed after the 1991 Gulf War by the
U.S.-led western allies with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds
in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's
suppression."

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges OIC to Deal Problems More Actively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
here on Monday called for a more active role by the Organization
of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in dealing with the problems of
the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the OIC Secretary General Azeddine Laraki,
Khatami called on the Islamic body to pay more attention to the
issues of Palestine, Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Having a general knowledge of problems in the world of Islam
helps with addressing the specific problems of each Muslim state,
he was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who is also current OIC chairman, called on Laraki to
try to bring Muslim states closer to each other.
</P>
<P>
He cited expansion of dialogue and understanding among the
member states as the main achievement of the organization since
Iran took over the chairmanship in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Through a dialogue among Muslim scholars and relying on
commonalities, Muslim states should become fully prepared to
enter the year 2001, designated as the year of dialogue among
civilizations," Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations last year approved Khatami's proposal to
name the year 2001 as the year of dialogue among civilizations.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Laraki termed dialogue among civilizations as a
very rich idea which is yet to be fully understood in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Laraki arrived here on Friday night for a four-day visit to
present a report on the organization's activities to the OIC
chairman, the implementation of OIC resolutions in
particular.

<HEADLINE> Pirate Radio Owner Charged with Incitement in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The owner of a pirate radio
station in Israel was charged in the Jerusalem District Court
Monday with incitement after calling for the murder of left-wing
Meretz party leader Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Bundak, calling Sarid anti-religious, threatened to
kill him in a broadcast last Friday. He was also charged with
running an illegal radio station, the pirate Voice of the East,
Israel TV reported.
</P>
<P>
Bundak defended himself by insisting that the death threat was
only "a joke" in the Jewish joy holiday of Purim, but Sarid said
it has crossed the "red line" in domestic debate.
</P>
<P>
Meretz is a left-wing secular party famous for its opposition
to what it calls the religious coercion by ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
The death threat came a week after the parliament passed a
legislation legalizing un-licensed pirate radio stations which had
been broadcasting for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
Hearing five petitions against the legislation, the Supreme
Court issued a compromise order Monday, halting the legalization
proceedings for two weeks to give the supporters of the
legislation more time to respond to the petitions.
</P>
<P>
Two of the five petitions were filed by the Meretz party,
including one from Sarid.
</P>
<P>
After the death of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was
killed by an ultra-nationalist in 1995, Israelis have urged the
government to take tough measures to curb incitement of violence
against politicians.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Increasingly Claims Girls, Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Girls and women are
becoming the principal victims of the rampant HIV/AIDS pandemic in
the developing world, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of observing International Women's
Day, UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said, "What was once a
predominantly male disease has become a heterosexual-spread
pandemic which is now consigning tens of millions of girls and
women to a cruel, slow death due to AIDS."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said the spread of HIV/AIDS among girls and women is
taking place amid an atmosphere of pervasive gender-based
discrimination, and some 73 million girls worldwide are denied the
right to education and the majority of the world's 1 billion
illiterates are female.
</P>
<P>
Deprived of the opportunity to receive an education and to
participate in their societies as equals to men, millions of girls
are relegated to subsistence and domestic chores instead of
attending school and building a future, the UNICEF head said.
</P>
<P>
The challenge posed by the spreading HIV/AIDS epidemic among
girls and women involves issues of basic human rights and urgently
requires adequate services to prevent the spread of HIV, Bellamy
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are faced with age-old cultural values which have
subordinated women and denied them the same rights as have been
accorded to men. the resulting widespread abuse and discrimination
are nowhere more clearly evident than in the chilling fact that
huge members of socially powerless women are being infected with
HIV by their husbands," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"Hand in hand with the battle to defeat HIV/AIDS, we need to
endure that girls and women are accorded full equality in all
areas of life," Bellamy added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for End to Violence Against Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday called for an end to violence against women in the
world at large, but he acknowledged that "much remains to be done"
to reach the goal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Inter-Agency Videoconference for a World Free
of Violence Against Women, Annan said, "Each of us must accept
responsibility for stamping out gender-based violence. We must
ensure that there are legal framework and institutions capable of
dealing with in."
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure that violence is recognized and condemned, and
that those who perpetrate it do not go unpunished," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, it is up to all of us -- in our homes, our
communities, our nations, our global community -- to create a
world that is safe for women and girls: in which all women have
full enjoyment of all human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks as the United Nations is celebrating the
last International Women's Day of the 20th century, which falls on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"During this century, human rights have been recognized in law
and guaranteed in international agreements. During this century,
humanity has learnt that the enjoyment of human rights is
essential to the well-being and development of the individual, the
community and the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And yet, too many women are still denied these basic human
rights," he said. "Too often, their liberty and dignity are
compromised. And too many of them are subjected to violence."
</P>
<P>
"Violence against women is perhaps the most shameful human
rights violation. And it is perhaps the most pervasive," he said.
"It knows no boundaries of geography, culture of wealth."
</P>
<P>
"As long as it continues, we cannot claim to be making real
progress towards equality, development and peace," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Fix A Common Written Language for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will have a standard
written language for all ethnic groups this year, the Minister of
Culture, Youth and Sports, Jose Mateus Muaria Katupha, said in
capital Maputo Monday.
</P>
<P>
Katupha revealed this while attending the opening ceremony for
the second National Ethnic Languages Standardization Seminar.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that it is not an easy job to require various
ethnic groups to use a common written language.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that there might be disputes over what will
be fixed as a standard written language. He appealed decision
makers to be less emotional when they work to settle this problem.
</P>
<P>
At present, Mozambique's official language is Portuguese, but
the southern African country has a diversity of ethnic languages,
most of which do not have their own written languages.
</P>
<P>
Katupha expressed beliefs that the five-day seminar,
co-sponsored by the ministry and the University of Eduardo
Mondlane, will produce a significant impact on Mozambique's new
ways of writing.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Radio Mozambique should play an important
role in popularizing ethnic tongues by broadcasting news and
programs in these languages.

<HEADLINE> Riyadh Calls for Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Monday urged
the international community to exercise more pressure on Israel
to pull out unconditionally from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi statement was made by King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
during a weekly cabinet session, according to the Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi cabinet discussed recent Israeli attacks on Lebanon
in retaliation for Muslim resistance group Hezbollah's ambush in
which four Israelis, including a brigadier general, was killed.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet condemned the Israeli attacks and called for an
immediate Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon it has been
occupying since late 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
On February 28, Israeli troops carried out retaliatory air and
ground attacks on south Lebanon, and its fighter bombers fired two
air-to-ground missiles at Wadi Zellaya, a valley at the edge of
the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied border zone in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the border strip in 1985 after two invasions,
withe the claimed aim of protecting its northern border from
Lebanese guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery also continuously bombed the Bekaa valley
with 150 rockets within one hour that day.

<HEADLINE> UK Ramblers Promised Right to Roam Over Private Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- British Environment Minister
Michael Meacher has promised ramblers a statutory right to roam
over 4 million acres of land in England and Wales, which has been
denied them up till now.
</P>
<P>
In a Commons statement he told members of parliament Monday,
"We are now convinced legislation is the only way to make sure
people will be free in perpetuity to explore open countryside."
</P>
<P>
He said the government recognized landowners' concerns and
walkers would not have the right to trample over crops and
gardens. Strict controls would also be introduced on dogs, the
environment minister said.
</P>
<P>
Legislation will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time
allows and will cover mountains, moor, heaths and downs and may be
extended to woodland.
</P>
<P>
"Securing greater access to open countryside will bring
tremendous benefits," Meacher was quoted by BBC as saying, and
"new opportunities for improving people's health, physical and
mental."
</P>
<P>
"And it will enable everyone to experience the wonders of
wildlife and beautiful landscapes," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party attacked the proposals, which they say
will satisfy neither ramblers nor landowners.
</P>
<P>
Shadow Environment Secretary Gillian Shephard demanded
compensation arrangements for landowners who may suffer loss of
value to their property after being compelled to open it up.
</P>
<P>
"It will be cumbersome, it will be bureaucratic, it will
further divide town and countryside, and it is a squandered
opportunity," she said.
</P>
<P>
The right to roam is a tribute to former Labor leader John
Smith and the government promised legislation guaranteeing a right
to roam over open countryside when it was in opposition. Since
taking office, it has held consultations on how to increase
access.
</P>
<P>
The Country Landowners' Association says it supports the idea
that people should have greater freedom to explore open
countryside, but opposes the change in the law.
</P>
<P>
But the association is anxious to preserve "the right of owners
to choose how best to satisfy public demands for improved
countryside access, while safeguarding their land management
interests, wildlife and the environment."

MOSCOW, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian scientists have patented a
drug that they believe can rid blood of the AIDS virus but keeps
blood cells intact, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Interfax, quoting an evening newspaper in Novosibirsk, Siberia,
said the drug, developed by a local research center, rids blood of
immunodefficiency viruses in three to four days after
intravenously injection into the patient.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Lelyak, holder of the patent, said that the new
technology may be the basis for the development of a cure for HIV
carriers or AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have successfully tested the anti-AIDS technique in
laboratory conditions and have detected no viruses in the blood
after injections of the drug, Interfax said.

HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The drafting of Zimbabwe's new
constitution could be completed by November this year, Minister
Without Portfolio Eddison Zvobgo said Monday in Bulawayo, the
country's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants at a media and constitution workshop,
Zvobgo, who is also ruling Zanu (PF) legal affairs secretary, said
he was confident the draft constitution could be written
thoroughly within a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
"We would like the constitution to be completed this year and
elections to take place under the new constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that we can do it and we can do it thoroughly.
There is nothing mystical about writing a constitution" he said.
</P>
<P>
Organizations such as the National Constitutional Assembly
already had their proposed draft constitutions in place.
</P>
<P>
Zvobgo said the good faith of the government lay in its
determination to have all stakeholders represented in the proposed
commission of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The government's proposal was that the commission to be
appointed by President Robert Mugabe would carry out intensive
research to determine the nature of constitution the people want,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The one-day workshop was organized by the Media Institute of
Southern Africa in conjunction with Friedrich-Erobert Stiftung, a

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Chief Calls for Zero Tolerance of Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Naif Sadik, executive
director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Monday
called for zero tolerance of violence against women, saying
perpetrators of violence against women worldwide must be held
accountable for their actions.
</P>
<P>
All too often, the perpetrators receive light sentences or are
excused with a reference to family honor, she said, encouraging
all governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil
society including the private sector to work for an end to all
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
Sadik made the remarks in delivering an address at the global
videoconference for "A World Free of Violence Against Women" on
the occasion of International Women's Day, which falls on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The very same biological function that ensures that societies
survive, thrive and reproduce is the very same one that makes
women the targets of violence," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It is time that everyone of us, individually and collectively,
takes a stand to eradicate violence against women in all its
manifestations," she said. "We must break the culture of silence
on violence against women. We must promote zero tolerance of
violence against women everywhere."
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute videoconference is held at the U.N. headquarters
Monday morning with the presence of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, who voiced in a speech his appeal for an end to violence
against women in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
"Women and girls are actually at greater risk of violence from
members of their households, than from strangers," Sadik said.
"Many forms of communally sanctioned violence against women, such
as female genital mutilation or honor killings, are associated
with the community's or the family's demand for sexual chastity
and virginity."
</P>
<P>
"Womens' and girls' reproductive and sexual health should not
depend on the perceptions and feelings of those wielding authority
over them, be they the State, the church, the community or the
family, but must be guaranteed as a basic human rights," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Violence against women knows no class, race, or age," she
said. "It exists across all socio-economic groups, and it is a
daily phenomenon in the lives of women throughout the world and
throughout their life circle."
</P>
<P>
"Even before they are born, girls suffer from the consequences
of a widely prevalent socio-cultural disposition that favors boys
over girls," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In some countries, a strong preference for boys leads to the
killing of girls children and selective abortion of female
foetuses," she said. "Where resources are scare, boys are often
more likely to receive enough food, education or adequate medical
care, which logically leads to poorer health in girls, and even to
higher mortality rates on their part."
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA is fighting violence against women in several ways:
by helping to establish women's health centers, supporting
violence counseling, and campaigning against female genital
mutilation where it persists.
</P>
<P>
Also, it has named Goodwill Ambassadors to call attention to
improve the status of women and point out the harmful effects of
violence on families, women and girls, as well as on society as a
whole.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Eliminating Violence against Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- As part of the UN campaign to
eliminate violence against women worldwide, a regional conference
on Good Practices toward Eliminating Violence against Women and
Girls in Africa opened here Monday on the occasion of
International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 participants from more than 20 African countries as
well as the United States and France are attending the conference
organized by the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM).
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the participants will discuss on
such topics as actualizing the right to protection, innovative
strategies to eliminate specific forms of violence against women,
good practices in dealing with gender-based violence in
situations of conflict and reconstruction, and African men's
initiative to eliminate violence against women and girls.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Attorney-General Amos Wako of
Kenya said, "our campaign to eliminate violence against women is
at the heart of the struggle for the survival of civilization."
</P>
<P>
Wako pointed out that in the process to eliminate violence
against women,
</P>
<P>
all levels of the society must be engaged in changing attitudes
and behavior particularly on the part of men.
</P>
<P>
He said Kenyan government is committed to eradicating violence
against women, and conference like this could help Kenya to put
in place appropriate legislation and strategies to combat
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the conference was coincided with a UN
inter-agency global video conference entitled "A World Free of
Violence Against Women", the first of its kind ever to be held in
the UN General Assembly Hall.
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute video conference linked five sites, Strasbourg in
France, Mexico City in Mexico, Nairobi in Kenya, New Delhi in
India and New York. It features women whose personal experiences
of violence have inspired policies and strategies to eliminate
gender violence.
</P>
<P>
The video conference discussed such issues as domestic
violence, trafficking in women and girls, harmful traditional
practices including dowry deaths and female genital mutilation,
and wartime violence against women including rape and sex
slavery.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Women Poor Despite Contribution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has said that women in the country are still the poorest of the
poor in spite of the major role they play in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement Monday when addressing the
nation on the occasion of International Women's Day in Mbarara
municipality, 270 km southwest of capital city Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Museveni attributed women's poor status to lack of access to
productive resources, unequal distribution of wealth and very
limited levels of awareness and information.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan women, who constitute 51 percent of the population,
produce 80 percent of the food, 60 percent of the cash crops and
contribute 70 percent of the agricultural labor force, but own
only seven percent of the land.
</P>
<P>
Museveni urged women to be facilitated to increase the volume
of their economic activities in all the sectors of the economy in
which they are engaged.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase women's sense of ownership, especially in
rural areas, they should have a say in the disposal of land and,
most importantly, own the matrimonial home jointly with their men,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Starts Reforms on Enrolment System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of new students entering
Zambia's two universities will almost be doubled this year
because the government has embarked on reforms to liberalize and
open entry into the universities.
</P>
<P>
Deputy permanent secretary of Education Ministry, Godwin
Chibesakunda, told Xinhua on Monday that the reforms will include
allowing more self- sponsored than the government-sponsored
students into the institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to expand and diversify student enrolment
and cut down on excess demand for bursaries from the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of introducing a loan scheme for students was
 receiving active consideration to establish cost implications,
adding that it was the ministry's objective to cut on direct
expenditure on student welfare through the reforms by at least 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the government will continue to be responsible for a
sizable part of funds for the two universities, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the reforms, the total of new students entering
Copperbelt University and the University of Zambia will increase
from last year's 1600 to 2700, he said.

<HEADLINE> Protein Holds Key of Cancers' Resistant to Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- British scientists said Monday they
were one step closer towards understanding why some cancers do not
respond to drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
The key to destroying drug-resistant tumors lies in a protein
molecule called Bak which prompts damaged cells self destruct,
Professor John Hickman and colleagues from the University of
Manchester have found.
</P>
<P>
The scientists believed their research will provide information
needed to find new ways to kill cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
Normally, a healthy cell will die when it reaches the end of
its life span or when it knows it's no longer needed. Cells that
are damaged will also "self destruct" as a safety mechanism so
their faults are not replicated in future generations.
</P>
<P>
However, cancer cells do not die in the usual way, and go on
reproducing themselves uncontrollably. Most conventional
treatments aim to force cancer cells to commit suicide by
inflicting further damage on them but some cancer cells can resist
this bombardment.
</P>
<P>
The Manchester team has found that the protein Bak receives
signals from the parts of the cell which assess and report damage
caused by drugs and it then makes the cell self destruct.
</P>
<P>
The researchers discovered that Bak is normally held in check
by another molecule. To become active, Bak must separate from this
"minder" and change shape.
</P>
<P>
Once it changes shape it can receive the signals that the cell
is damaged and commit it to die. The scientists believed this does
not happen in cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
"The next question we hope to answer is why Bak does not get
going in a cancer cell," Professor Hickman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"If we can find out why it doesn't, then in theory we could
find a way to jump-start it and force the cancer cell to die," he
added.

CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian monetary authorities on Sunday adopted urgent
measures to control the abrupt rise of the exchange rate of the
U.S. dollar against the Egyptian pound (LE) as a result of larger
supply than demand.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) agreed to pump 2 billion
dollars of the CBE reserve that hits 20 billion dollars to cope
with the situation, the Arabic daily Al-Hayat quoted Chief of the
Egyptian Chambers of Commerce Federation (CCF) Mahmoud Al-Arabi as
saying.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi dinar retreated against the U.S. dollar
shortly after the assassination of Mohammed Al-Sadr, a leading
Shiite leader in Najaf city late February.
</P>
<P>
The dinar exchange rate went down to 2,000 against a
U.S. dollar after the assassination, Al-Hayat reported. The
skyrocketing of the U.S. dollar exchange rate, which is
unprecedented in years, continued as unrest broke out.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon and Syria have agreed to build a cement plant
, which will cost 180 million U.S. dollars, with an annual output
capacity of one million tonnes, Lebanese industry ministry sources
said this week.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UNEP Launches Freshwater Communications Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) headquartered in Nairobi, capital of Kenya,
launched a freshwater communications campaign Monday with the
global release of a half-hour BBC television documentary.
</P>
<P>
The documentary, entitled "Everybody Lives Downstream", which
is to mark the World Water Day falling on March 22, focuses on
river basins on four continents and creates a symbolic river,
filmed in the Tibetan Plateau, the Colombian highlands, and on the
Nile and Rhine rivers.
</P>
<P>
"The film highlights the fact that when it comes to using
freshwater, human beings, whether they live in a village or a
mega-city, can not isolate themselves from their neighbors," said
Klaus Toepher, UNEP Executive Director, adding that there are
fundamental linkage and dependencies between water users and
users in a given drainage basin that affect everyone.
</P>
<P>
In the documentary, international experts and decision-makers
urge the public to back national and international efforts to
conserve the planet's limited water supplies.
</P>
<P>
The film, one of many information products pegged to a
communications campaign around World Water Day, will reach 135
million homes in 111 countries on BBC World Television, said the
UNEP official.

BONN, March 8 (xinhua) -- Bonn and Prague will sign a "final
treaty" to resolve historic problems between the two countries as
German Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and visiting Czech
Prime Minister Milos Zeman agreed after their Monday meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two also said ties between Germany and Czech should not be
disturbed by juridical or financial disputes.
</P>
<P>
The one-hour meeting focused on Czech's entry to the European
Union (EU), which has been fixed for next year.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder clearly refused demand of the expelled Sudetic
Germans, who required the German government to consider Czech's EU
membership after Prague returned their properties.
</P>
<P>
The requirement, as part of history, would not be borne by
Germany's foreign policy, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
After World War II, then Czechslovakian authorities expelled
ethnic Germans living in Sudetic region to Germany and confiscated
their properties.
</P>
<P>
Zeman and Schroeder said the German-Czech relationship should
aim at the future, but not the past, which cannot be changed.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Women's Status Need to Improve: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A cabinet minister in Angola
appealed on Monday to further improve the social status of women
in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Promotion for Family and Women, Candida Celeste
Da Silva,

made the appeal at a public rally in the capital Luanda to mark
the International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
She said the legal equality between men and women in the
country is still not fully demonstrated, although a lot of women
are holding key work posts. Compared with their male colleagues,
women still take few important positions in the government or
other institutions.
</P>
<P>
In Angolan families, she said, it is still customary to let
boy go to school while girls are left at home doing household
chores, because in the eyes of parents the best life for a girl is
staying at home as a housewife.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said women remain victims of domestic violence.
In the capital Luanda, a quarter of women are victims of violence
while in the rural areas the proportion is as high as 40 percent,
she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said eruption of civil war in Angola again has
frustrated the country's women emancipation drive, adding that the
population of refugees in the country has increased by two
million, 80 percent of them are women and children.
</P>
<P>
She said the government has worked out strategies of improving
women's political, economic and social status, like extending
loans to them for creating enterprises and developing agriculture
and animal husbandry to help them escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
Other strategies include holding courses to reduce women
illiteracy rate, and banning violence against women, she said.

NICOSIA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Armenia are preparing
an agreement on avoiding double taxation, visiting Armenian
Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after talks with his
Cypriot counterpart Ioannis Kasoulides, Oskanyan stressed the
"very close relations" and "common interests" between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Oskanyan described the Armenian community in Cyprus as "a
bridge for very strong and healthy relations" between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Around 2,500 people of Armenian origins live in Cyprus. They
opted to be part of the Greek Cypriot community when the island
gained independence from the British colonial rule in 1960.
</P>
<P>
According to Oskanyan, a "Cyprus Week" will be organized in
Armenia, while Armenian groups are planning to participate in
festivals in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides described the talks between them as
"productive," saying that they discussed bilateral relations,
political and economic issues and the Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
Oskanyan, who arrived in Cyprus on Sunday for a four-day

<HEADLINE> Arafat on Declaration of Palestinian Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said here Monday that it is the Palestinian leadership that should
make decision on whether to declare statehood in early May.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority is contacting Arab States
and international parties on the issue, Arafat told a delegation
of the representation council of Jewish organization and community
in France.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had insisted that he would declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 when the transitional period under Oslo
accords expires, with or without Israeli consent.
</P>
<P>
Israel strong opposed the idea. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu threatened to stop implementing the signed agreements
and annex parts of the West Bank if a Palestinian state is
unilaterally declared.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and European countries have been trying to persuade
Arafat to reach agreement with the Israelis before his next
move. So have some moderate Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here earlier in the day for consultations with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on a string of related issues.
"Peace is a strategic Arab choice and the Palestinians are keen on
realizing just and lasting peace," Arafat told the Jewish
delegation.
</P>
<P>
He had been scheduled to meet with Mubarak later Monday on
issues such as Palestinian statehood, situation on all tracks of
the peace process, future moves to reactivate peace-making. But
the talks were postponed until Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
However, his lieutenants, chief negotiator Saeb Eraket and
State Minister for International Cooperation Nabil Shaath held
talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Their detailed consultations on the related issues will be
referred to Mubarak and Arafat before they meet, according to
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Shaath told reporters that the Palestinians
are still thoroughly examining the European call for delaying the
statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
But he said May 4 is still the date fixed for the declaration,
and dismissed speculation that a postponement is imminent.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt is assisting the Palestinians with regard to
statehood declaration and is working with France to formulate a
unified Euro-Arab stand.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on
March 23 to explain the Palestinian viewpoints, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court Rejects Appeal from Oklahoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court Monday
left intact Timothy McVeigh's conviction and death sentence for
the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people and injured
hundreds more _ the worst such attack on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which McVeigh
argued his trial was tainted by jury misconduct and news reports
that he confessed to his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy and
weapons-related charges in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. A three-judge federal appeals
court panel upheld his 11 convictions and death sentence last
September.
</P>
<P>
The ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sends a
message that "the rules of law may be applied on a sliding scale
when the crime is unspeakable and public outrage is great,"
McVeigh's Supreme Court appeal contended.
</P>
<P>
At McVeigh's 1997 trial, prosecutors said he and co-defendant
Terry Nichols carried out the bombing in revenge for the April 19,
1993, deaths of about 80 people in the siege at the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco, Texas State.
</P>

Prosecutors said McVeigh, now 30, chose the Oklahoma City
building because he believed people responsible for the Waco siege
worked there and because the building was an easy target. Nichols
was convicted of conspiracy in a separate trial and sentenced to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
Justice Department lawyers said the bombing "caused
extraordinary harm" and that courts took "extraordinary steps" to
ensure McVeigh a fair trial, including disqualifying the original
judge and moving the trial to Denver.

<HEADLINE> UK Withdraws Soyabean-oil Breast Implants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Breast implants made from soyabean
oil is being withdrawn from the market because of health fears,
the British government announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Trilucent breast implants, which has a filling derived from
soyabean oil, have been available since 1995, and up to 8,000
women have received them in the UK.
</P>
<P>
However, Britain's Department of Health Monday warned that not
enough is known about the long-term safety and rate of breakdown
of the soyabean oil in the filling, or its possible effects on the
body.
</P>
<P>
National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and private clinics are
being advised not to use any more Trilucent implants and to return
stocks to the suppliers while further assessment is carried out.
</P>
<P>
The decision to withdraw the implants was taken as a
precautionary measure following discussions between the Department
of Health and Lipomatrix-Collagen Aesthetics, the U.S.-based
supplier.
</P>
<P>
Dr Jeremy Metters, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said that The
Medical Devices Agency (MDA), a section of the Department of
Health, has received reports of local complications in a small
number of women who have Trilucent implants.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no evidence of permanent injury or harm to
general health. However, on the precautionary principle we
consider that no more of these devices should be implanted," he
said in a statement.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been told
that Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) leaders have approved a peace
agreement for Kosovo and "authorized its signature," the State
Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But spokesman James Rubin remained sceptical, telling
reporters: "What we need to do is get maximum clarity from the
Kosovar Albanian side... I think I will conclude that the
agreement is signed when it's been signed."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. envoy Chris. Hill said that Kosovo Liberation
Army leaders had agreed to the terms of a peace deal negotiated at
talks in France last month.
</P>
<P>
"The KLA General Staff has asked Ambassador Hill to convey to
Secretary of State (Madeleine) Albright that it has approved the
Rambouillet accords and authorized their signing," Hill's
spokesman Phil Reeker said in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But some Western diplomats said KLA leaders still had serious
objections to the proposed peace accord that grants high self-rule
but short of independence as the KLA demanded.
</P>
<P>
"There are some problems," one diplomat said. "There is not a
'yes' and I have to say an early signing does not look likely.
Maybe, just maybe, on the 12th or 13th."

<HEADLINE> Burundi Warring Parties Seek to Build Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's warring parties
met again Monday at a seminar in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha in an effort to build trust necessary to a national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Arusha said that representatives from Burundi's 18
parties, religious leaders, civil societies and women groups
discussed ways to achieve an amicable political solution to the
endless bloody conflicts.
</P>
<P>
They were also given advice by the former Finnish Prime
Minister Harri Holkeri and the ex-Foreign Minister of Bosnia
Muhamed Sacirbey on trust build-up.
</P>
<P>
The two told the participants, including the international
peace facilitator, Julius Nyerere, a former Tanzanian president,
that no degree of peace process can succeed until some degree of
trust is restored.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody benefits more than the other side. Violence complicates
further the abnormal situation," Sacirbey said, citing the example
of his own country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the four committees appointed to make
recommendations to restore democracy in Burundi also resumed their
meeting Monday in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
They continued to explore the nature of Burundi conflict,
democracy and good governance, peace and security and
reconstruction and economic development at the two-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere has expressed his hope to reach a peace agreement at
least by June when the fifth round of Burundi peace talks is
scheduled to start.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that international community is ready to assist
Burundi in the reconstruction and to come to its feet again when
the rival factions reach a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
On January 23, the Great Lakes Region countries suspended the
economic sanctions, which were imposed on Burundi shortly after
Major Pierre Buyoya took power in a military coup in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
The suspension decision is to encourage the progress achieved
in the four rounds of talks.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The leading European stock markets
were slightly muted in trading Monday as a weak start on Wall
Street and an uneasy waiting for the UK's Budget on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of blue chips at the close was up 3.3
points at 6208.8. "Investors aren't willing to take significant
positions ahead of the Budget," said one dealer.
</P>
<P>
A weak start on Wall Street, which failed to extend the record
highs achieved last week, also hit London prices.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to remain subdued until after Chancellor
Gordon Brown has delivered his budget package on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts at HSBC Markets note that the healthy state of the
public finances mean that Brown could find room for a significant
fiscal easing, but "the political pressures for a giveway are
weak".
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax closed down 1.02 percent at
4791.43. Share prices fell back after Wall Street moved lower in
early trading.
</P>
<P>
"The German market is lacking in self-confidence," a trader
said. However, telecommunications news had a strong effect on
share prices in both telecom and utilities sectors.
</P>
<P>
Shares of Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Bank fell amid a row
over the bank's offer to buy Deutsche Telekom's cable television
business.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC 40 finished 13.59 lower at 4175.97. French
stocks prices finish little changed as Wall Street failed to offer
support, but shares did improve from earlier lows.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 had hit a 4148.69 low, in response to comments by
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn that the French economy
will expand by less than 2.7 percent in 1999, traders said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's major full-service
communications provider Hongkong Telecom and American software
giant Microsoft announced here today strategic cooperation to
develop high-speed broadband services that will allow Hong Kong to
fully experience the convergence of low-cost personal computer and
telecommunications technologies.
</P>
<P>
The joint effort, announced by Hongkong Telecom Chief Executive
Linus W. L. Cheung and visiting Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill
Gates at a press conference, is expected to usher in an era of
technology convergence for a new lifestyle in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Cheung said at the press conference that the two companies will
be developing "very exciting applications to stimulate the usage
of the PCs and their applications."
</P>
<P>
He said Hongkong Telecom can provide high-speed Internet which
is 30 to 300 times faster than normal Internet and ... "it is very
important we create applications like turning PCs into interactive
TVs."
</P>
<P>
"I hope this partnership of cooperation will not only set an
example for Hong Kong, breaking new markets, but for the world."
</P>
<P>
Gates said Hong Kong is in a "very privileged position" because
of the companies that add up the Internet to the PCs and the
investment that has been made to the existing network.
</P>
<P>
"There is a chance to really lead the way to show the
applications of how businesses will be done in the years ahead,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the joint project as a "milestone," Gates said, "We
see ourselves as really giving the businesses here in Hong Kong a
platform to be created with... and to address the entire market."
</P>
<P>
With the project, home PC users will be able to view exciting
movie titles and view these on their PCs or on their TVs -- just
by browsing through titles of the latest movies, while at the same
time having access to the wealth of information available on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Users will be able to communicate with their friends via live
video conferencing, participate in voice or on-line chat rooms,
send and receive e-mail, check the latest news, go shopping and
conduct secure e-commerce transactions.
</P>
<P>
Students will be able to interact and share in the learning
experience in new and unique ways.
</P>
<P>
Businesses will benefit from new and advanced solutions and
applications hosted and available through Hongkong Telecom's
broadband network, while also gaining access to an entirely new
class of video-enabled applications including video conferencing
and training-on-demand.
</P>
<P>
The innovative services will run on a tightly integrated
Microsoft platform which will accommodate a wide spectrum of
existing service components and capital assets.
</P>
<P>
The new applications scheduled to be implemented include video
on demand, music on demand, software on demand, up-to-the-minute
news and game zone.
</P>
<P>
The new application will be added up to the existing and the
world's first interactive TV and high-speed Internet service,
launched by the Hongkong Telecom a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Top legislator on Constitutional Amendments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese law maker Li Peng
today talked about the importance of amending the Chinese
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Amending the Constitution this time aims to enshrine in the
country's fundamental law Deng Xiaoping theory as the nation's
guiding principle, the basic principle of running the country
according to law, and non-publicly-owned economic elements as an
important part of the national economy," he said. "This is a
requirement made necessary by changed realities."
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, the nation's top lawmaking body, expressed the views at
a group discussion attended by Zhejiang deputies to the NPC, in
session here since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the constitutional amendments this time around have
an important and far-reaching significance for building socialism
with Chinese characteristics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that the enactment of a unified, comprehensive
contract law is conducive to standardizing market activities,
solving timely and correctly contract-related disputes, protecting
the legitimate rights and interests of parties involved, and
safeguarding economic order.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng expressed the hope that Zhejiang deputies would offer
views and suggestions on the draft contract law since the province
is noted for a well-developed market economy.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that running the country according to law and
building socialism on the basis of the rule of law is the Party's
basic principle in leading the people in managing state affairs.
Strengthening Party leadership is in agreement with bringing into
full play the role of the NPC, he said,
</P>
<P>
It is the role of the NPC and its Standing Committee to
enshrine in laws Party's policies and propositions that have
proven feasible, effective and reflective of people's will, he
said.

today that the Dalai Lama has always been engaged in activities of
splitting the motherland since he fled abroad in the late 1950s,
and that he has no sincerity at all for holding negotiations with
the central government.
</P>
<P>
"No sovereign state in the world would allow any groups or
individuals to break the law and attempt to split the country.
What Dalai did was just intended to cause ethnic separation and
ruin the unity of the motherland," said Raidi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Raidi is here attending the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Raidi said that for a long period of time, the Dalai Lama had
claimed he was willing to start negotiations at one time and said
at another time he wouldn't accept it. On some occasions he even
lied to the world that the central government refused to hold
negotiations with him.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, he has never really wanted to start negotiations with
the central government, and has instead become the tool of some
foreign anti-China forces," Raidi said, adding that "His attitude
changes in pace with theirs, and the fundamental reason lies in
his desire to separate Tibet from China."
</P>
<P>
He said that the central government has repeatedly made clear
its attitude toward negotiations with the Dalai Lama, which is
that the latter must first stop his splittist activities, give up
any attempt to seek "Tibet independence", and acknowledge that
Tibet is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory, Taiwan is
one of China's provinces and that the government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing
the whole China.
</P>
<P>
"On this basis, the central government has always kept the door
open for negotiations with the Dalai Lama, which can start at any
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Raidi went on to point to the fact that the Dalai Lama was
formerly the chief boss for the feudal serfdom in old Tibet, and
that he had oppressed the Tibetan people with cruelty and done
them no good throughout his reign.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that over the past four decades since the
Democratic Reform was carried out and the feudal serfdom abolished
in Tibet, the Tibetan people have become masters of their own
destiny and have achieved tremendous successes in promoting
economic and social development in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"Hadn't there been disturbances and sabotage from Dalai, Tibet
would have achieved more rapid economic growth and greater social
progress," Raidi said.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan legislator also criticized some western people for
making irresponsible comments on Tibet while having no idea at all
of the region's history and current situation.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, it is also necessary for the Tibet Autonomous
Region to make more exchanges with the outside world, so as to
help more people to understand the actual situation in Tibet," he
added.

<HEADLINE> HK Executive Council Set MPF Contribution Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Executive Council
has decided to set December 1, 2000, as the target date for
commencing the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA).
</P>
<P>
MPFA Chairman Mr. Charles Lee Yeh-kwong, said that to achieve
the target of launching MPF on December 1, 2000, one of the MPFA's
most important tasks was to conduct the licensing exercise in the
second half of this year. This would include the approval of
trustees and investment products and the registration of provident
fund schemes, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the timetable, the MPFA will receive formal
applications for licensing in August this year and complete
vetting of all licensing applications by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The timetable also allows an 11-month period for employers to
enroll their staff into MPF schemes before the commencement of
contributions in December, 2000.
</P>
<P>
He added that since the launching of MPF would affect many
parties including the industry, employers and employees, the MPFA
would monitor closely all aspects of the preparatory work,
particularly the development of the MPFA's information management
system, and keep the implementation timetable under constant
review.

<HEADLINE> Lao Minister Urges Efforts to Ease Impact of Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Lao Minister of Information and
Culture Sileua Bounkham has called for efforts to ease the impact
of inflation on Laos' economic growth, people's living conditions
and foreign investment, according to a report by Laos' news agency
KPL Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
KPL quoted Sileua Bounkham as saying that the causes of the
inflation in Laos stemmed from the economic and monetary crisis in
the region, from the failure in agricultural production caused by
natural disasters, and the imbalance between the lack of
production capability and high demands of social consumption,
among others.
</P>
<P>
Sileua Bounkham was speaking at the Ministry of Information and
Culture last Friday.
</P>
<P>
He urged all concerned parties to implement the resolution of
the seventh plenum of the Sixth Congress of the Lao People's
Revolutionary Party Central Committee, which calls for strongly
boosting agriculture, manufacturing and border trade. He also
stressed the measures to be taken to combat inflation, including
tapping income sources, punishing smugglers, curbing illegal
currency exchange, boosting tourism, more thrift among the general
public, improving the confidence in the local currency kip, and
support for the implementation of the socio-economic development
plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said on Tuesday that the military alliance is ready to
launch air strikes against Serbia if Yugoslavia does not accept an
autonomy plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
If Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic does not sign the
agreement, initiated by Western countries and including a NATO-
led peace implementation force, military options would be used,
Solana told a conference held in London to mark the 50th
anniversary of NATO.
</P>
<P>
All 16 NATO states agreed last October that military action
against Serbia would be legitimate and none of them have changed
their minds since, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed at the same time that no NATO nation supported
sending ground troops to fight their way into the southern Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
Solana said NATO needed to develop a more comprehensive
political and economic strategy for southeastern Europe rather
than just deal piecemeal with the conflicts in Kosovo or wherever
the next problem flared.
</P>
<P>
"What we hope is that the start of Kosovo peace implementation
should be the start of a wider initiative to pull all parts of the
Balkans toward Europe, politically as well as economically," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Without such a comprehensive approach, we will never get
beyond treating the symptoms," said the secretary general.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Researchers Uncover Genetic Link for Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadian researchers have found
that a "thrifty" gene, or genes, may account for the world's third
highest rate of diabetes in the Ojibway-Cree native reserve at
Sandy Lake in Northern Ontario province of Canada, the Globe and
Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the University of Western Ontario and the
University of Toronto have been scouring the DNA of the Sandy Lake
natives for four years to find the genetic link.
</P>
<P>
The project, which was an unusual collaboration between
researchers and a native community, is believed to be among the
first to pinpoint a gene linked to diabetes in aboriginal people
who generally battle a greater incidence of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Robert Hegele, the geneticist working on the project, assumed
that Ojibway-Cree had a "thrifty" gene, or genes, that served them
well when they lived as nomadic tribal people.
</P>
<P>
"The theory is that an individual who had these genes had a
super-economic metabolic process," Dr. Hegele said.
</P>
<P>
Their bodies may have been genetically programmed to store
every calorie they ate to survive the lean times between hunts, he
said. But with satellite television, heated cottages and fast
foods on the reservation, there are no lean times. In the Ojibway-
Cree native reserve, which was built in the early 1990s amid dense
woods, its diabetes rate is five times the national average,
affecting 25 percent of the 2,000 residents. The rate jumps to
more than 50 percent among those over the age of 50 and early
signs of the disease can be detected in children as young as 10.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, diabetes has been so severe it has resulted in
limb amputations, blindness or kidney failure.

agriculture at 4.1 percent, industry at 12.9 percent and service
sector at 14.1 percent. The service sector's GDP accounted for
more than half of the provincial total.
</P>
<P>
Economic development has led to rising income levels for
Guangzhou residents, with the per capita urban income level rising
by 13 percent on 1997 to 11,256 yuan. The per capita rural income
level grew 3.59 percent on 1997 to 5,629 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate on Rise in Singapore: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his speech to officiate a police workplan seminar, the
minister revealed that the crime rate went up by 5.2 percent last
year in Singapore and the crime rate rise has reversed a
nine-year consecutive fall in the overall crime rate.
</P>
<P>
Latest data published recently by the police shows that there
were 48,260 major criminal cases in 1998 in the city state
compared with 45,896 cases in the previous year. It also affirmed
that the police arrested 33,537 suspects last year, 3,248 more
over 1997 .
</P>
<P>
Wong said that the increase in the crime rate was due in part
to a sharp rise in immigration offenses.
</P>
<P>
The crime increase would have been lower at 4.4 percent if
immigration offenses are excluded, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Taking the increase in total population, Wong said, the
increase in the crime rate is just slightly over one percent,
rising from 1,064 per 100,000 population in 1998 compared with
1,054 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Citing police arrested some 23,000 illegal immigrants or
overstayers last year, Wong said the police have stepped up
efforts in all checkpoints including the sea around Singapore in a
bid to uncover any illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Underlining that reducing the crime rate in the current economic
situation has great significance for the island country, Wong said
the police is planning tougher enforcement to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon the police to push on with organizational
development and to be prepared for possible contingencies in the
year ahead to deal with problems such as the Y2K problem which may
require police assistance or intervention.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's crime rate dropped for nine successive years prior
to 1998.
</P>
<P>
For 1995 and 1996, the World Economic Forum's Global
Competitiveness Report considered Singapore's crime situation was
the best in the world.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, Advisors on Governing China According to Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators and government
advisors today described the endorsement of the principle of "
governing the country according to law" as "a milestone event" in
China's social advancement, which they believe will have a
profound impact on the country's modernization process in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
A draft amendment to China's Constitution submitted this
morning to the ongoing full session of the Chinese legislature,
the National People's Congress (NPC), for deliberation suggests
adding the following statement to the Constitution: The People's
Republic of China endorses the principle of "governing the country
according to law" and strives to build a socialist country based
on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"This revision will provide a legal guarantee for China's
current development strategy," said Wang Youhui, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xi, a professor with the Law School of central China's
Wuhan University, noted that China is one of the world's few
countries which have an extremely long history of a feudal society.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting the rule of law is the most powerful weapon for
combating the remainder of feudalistic ideas, including the idea
of the rule by man," said Wang, a member of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body also in session here
since last week.
</P>
<P>
China has greatly improved its legal system since it started
the reform and opening-up drive in 1978. Over the past two decades,
the NPC and its Standing Committee have enacted a total of 348
laws and relevant decisions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China made three comprehensive revisions to its
Constitution, while the existing Constitution adopted in 1982 also
underwent two partial amendments.

CANBERRA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar bubbled
higher Tuesday encouraged by gains in a leading commodity index,
an improved gold price and a stronger Japanese yen.

"It's gained a bit of ground in the past 24 hours," Colonial
State Bank treasury manager Nick Volanakis said.
</P>

index, as well as a stronger yen against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The CRB is an index of 17 U.S. futures markets and although not
weighted to Australia's exports, traders follow it as an indicator
for the commodity price-sensitive Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The CRB finished Monday night in New York up 1.11 at 187.64
points.
</P>
<P>
And gold for current delivery closed at 292.70 U.S. dollars per
ounce, up 3.20 U.S. dollars from Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading the Australian dollar was buying 76.29
Japanese yen, from 76.56 yen Previously.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said there was a chance the Australian dollar could
head toward the 63.50 U.S. cents area Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be sellers between 63.20 U.S. cents and 63.25
at the moment, but if it can get through there it might squeeze up
towards 63.50," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also at the close here the Australian dollar was buying 0.5787
euro from 0.5792.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, Advisors on Governing China According to Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another CPPCC National Committee member Wang Xiang pointed to
the fact that China is now building a socialist market economy,
the main features of which are a standardized market and an
orderly and fair competitive mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"All these features require the protection of a unified and
comprehensive legal system," said Wang, a private business manager.
</P>
<P>
According to NPC deputy Lu Zhiguang, the principle of "
governing the country according to law" will safeguard the
independent and equal legal status for all economic entities in
the market, protect property ownership and contract freedom, and
promote social justice and righteousness.
</P>
<P>
"It is all because of its early and successful promotion of the
rule of law that Guangdong, on the forefront of China's reform and
opening-up, has fully safeguarded its achievements in reform and
opening-up and maintained a sustainable economic development,"
said Lu, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong
Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Law experts here say that the principle of "governing the
country according to law" is a direct reflection of China's shift
from a central planned economy to a market-driven economy.
</P>
<P>
They also note that the endorsement of this principle is a
large project involving people of all walks of life and sectors
across the country and a lot of issues, which include legislation,
law enforcement, judicial justice and supervision, and promotion
of legal knowledge and people's law-abiding awareness.
</P>
<P>
"This principle is key to the smooth implementation of a series
of measures to be adopted soon by the government for the deepening
of reforms," an expert stressed.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Against Internationalizing Khmer Rouge Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen said Tuesday that he is against internationalizing the Khmer
Rouge issue which is Cambodia's "internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks during a nearly four-hour exclusive
interview with French TV-5 Tuesday at his Takhmau residence.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the Khmer Rouge issue is
Cambodia's internal affairs and no foreign country should
interfere in it. Otherwise, Cambodia will lose its sovereignty and
the issue can never be resolved, he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
"According to Article 33 of our constitution, Khmer citizens
cannot be deprived of the nationality, and transferred to a
foreign country to be tried," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is necessary to prevent some foreign
countries from using the Khmer Rouge issue as an excuse to
intervene in Cambodia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The capture of Ta Mok, the last Khmer Rouge leader still alive
who had not defected to the government, last weekend has
intensified the debate on setting up an international tribunal to
try the Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Cambodian Foreign
Minister Hor Nam Hong this week will discuss a recent report by
three U.N. legal experts on the best options for trying Khmer
Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen wants to try Ta Mok in a Cambodian court, instead of an
international tribunal, and he has already requested the Ministry
of Justice to discuss with courts to decide the procedure of
trial.
</P>
<P>
"Ta Mok is a Khmer criminal, the victims are Khmer and the
crimes he committed also occurred in Khmer soil so the tribunal
must be proceeded in Cambodia," Hun Sen told French TV in the
interview which was later broadcast by television Bayon.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Hun Sen showed a video of Ta Mok filmed
during his interrogation in the military prosecutor's prison in
Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's Military Court has started from Tuesday to
investigate the charges of Ta Mok who was arrested Saturday in
Cambodia-Thai border. Ta Mok was charged by the prosecutor under
the law outlawing the Khmer Rouge which was adopted by the
National Assembly in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 4 of the law, "members of the political
body and military forces of the Khmer Rouge group or any one who
committed acts of conducting secession, destroying the royal
government...shall be deemed as criminals against internal
security, and sentenced to a term of 20 to 30 years in prison or
to a life imprisonment."

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Washington to Continue "Sunshine Policy" Toward DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United States
Tuesday agreed to continue President Kim Dae-jung's "sunshine
policy" toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),
which seeks reconciliation, exchange and cooperation based on
separating economics from politics.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to "solve the DPRK's nuclear and missile
issue within the framework of Seoul's engagement policy," said
South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Hong Soon-young.
</P>
<P>
"There was no change in U.S. support for President Kim Dae-jung'
s engagement policy," said Hong, after meeting with William Perry,
U.S. coordinator on DPRK policy, who arrived here Monday for a two-
day visit.
</P>
<P>
The two nations also reached an agreement on counter measures
if Pyongyang failed to respond favorably to the "sunshine policy".
</P>
<P>
Hong said the United States needs to be cautious in working out
counter measures if Seoul's engagement policy towards Pyongyang
fails.
</P>
<P>
"Neither over-reaction nor under-reaction (to DPRK) is
appropriate," Hong said.
</P>
<P>
Hong's remarks reflected mounting concerns that the United
States is different from South Korea in how to deal with Pyongyang
if the country refuses to accept the "sunshine policy."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is now pressed by the U.S. Congress
to take a harder stance against the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
South Korea urged the United States to pursue the current
engagement policy with patience and consistence.
</P>
<P>
Surgical strikes (against the DPRK) should not even be
considered, and any war on the Korean Peninsula is a life-or-death
matter for tens of thousands of Koreans as well as 37,000 U.S.
troops stationed here, said Hong.
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate goal is peaceful co-existence (between South and
North)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perry, former U.S. defense secretary, updated his draft report
on U.S. policy on the DPRK to South Korean officials and is
scheduled to submit his final report to President Clinton by the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Hong and other Korean leaders, the former U.
S. defense secretary met President Kim.
</P>
<P>
President Kim and Perry agreed that Seoul and Washington will
continue conferring with each other until Perry finishes his
review of the DPRK policy, said Presidential spokesman Park Jie-
won.
</P>
<P>
Perry left here for Japan Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Fight Corruption to Ensure Project Quality: CPPCC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), who are here attending the second session of
the CPPCC, expressed their strong discontent over enormous
economic losses caused by shoddy engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
They urged to step up legal action and eliminate corruption to
ensure the quality and safety of the engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, over the past few years, such
accidents have led to a combined economic loss of around 100
billion yuan and 20 percent of the engineering projects built in
the period failed to reach the quality standards.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bai Dahua, a vice-chairman of the Central
Committee of the China Democratic National Construction
Association, said that poor management has caused a series of
accidents in engineering projects recently, which shows that
people pay little attention to quality, do not abide by law, and
the construction market is not ripe, which has provided a "
greenhouse" for corruption.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, of the over 100,000 bribery
cases handled by procuratorates in recent years, 63 percent are
related to the construction business.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure projects of poor quality may turn into disasters,
he said, urging people from all walks of life to be vigilant
against the problem of poor quality engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
He proposed to raise the awareness of the public about the rule
of law and the sense of quality, rectify the construction market,
crack down on unlawful activities in the field, and mobilize
people from all circles to take part in supervision in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of non-party-affiliation CPPCC members,
Professor Liu Xila, from the Beijing-based Qinghua University,
said that the issue of quality and security for engineering
projects require the joint efforts by people from engineering
management, educational and law circles.
</P>
<P>
The government departments in charge of engineering management
should take the first responsibility to deal with the issue, he
said, adding that at present, the most important is to regularize
the construction market, adopt the policy of open biddings and
contract, and accept the supervision of the news media.

OTTAWA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Glen Clark, the premier of Canada's
British Columbia Province, has decided to continue in office, the
National Post newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to carry on in the position I was privileged to
be elected to three years ago," said the premier after a four-hour
meeting of the provincial cabinet Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clark said he has been thinking about resigning since the Royal
Canadian Mounted Policy (RCMP) searched his home last week. But
the premier said: "I am not under investigation. I have done
nothing wrong."
</P>
<P>
The RCMP executed a search warrant on Clark's home in east
Vancouver last Tuesday. Police confirmed the search was connected
to an investigation into a gambling club allegedly operated by the
premier's friend and neighbor, Dimitrios Pilarinos.
</P>
<P>
Despite the search, police said the premier is not suspected of
any wrongdoing, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Clark said the RCMP search of his home had been "very
frightening." The only thing police had taken from his home after
a 45-minute search were copies of his house plans, he added.

In 1957, the central government decided not to make the reforms
in Tibet during the Second Five-Year Plan period (1958-1962) and
to allow the local government in Tibet make its own decision about
reforms in accordance with local conditions.
</P>
<P>
But, a few upper class reactionaries at heart were against the
reforms and tried to guard the theocratic feudal system and the
interests of the three categories of feudal lords by raising an
armed rebellion for Tibetan independence. After this rebellion was
quelled, the central government decided to comply with the wishes
of the Tibetan people and implement the democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan upper class reactionaries had tried to turn the
conflict between the new and old systems into a war between ethnic
groups, but the Tibetan people, who had spent eight years waiting
and watching, took the side of the Communist Party of China and
the People's Liberation Army without any hesitation.
</P>
<P>
The democratic reforms helped surfs become the masters of their
own destiny and there are no manorial lords or surfs today and
people are no longer sold, traded, given, or mortgaged as property,
nor are they separated into several categories or classes, and
there is no more gouging out of eyes, cutting off of feet or hands
or tongues.

The democratic reforms were a glorious chapter in the history
of global human rights in the 20th century.

In 1965, the Tibet Autonomous Region was established and the

autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 40 years, especially since China's reforms and
opening-up began in 1978, The Tibetan people have developed
agricultural and industrial production, got away from poverty, and
built up fortunes with the support of the central government and
people in the rest of China, and enormous changes have taken place
in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan economy has grown faster than the rest of the
country on average since 1994 and the standard of living and
health of the Tibetan people have improved considerably.
</P>
<P>
The fulfillment of the goals of the democratic reforms and the
achievements made in the 40 years of socialist construction in
Tibet have shown that the democratic reforms and socialist system
and the abolition of the serf system were the correct decisions of
the Tibetan people and the only way to develop Tibet and make it
prosper. Any attempt to return Tibet to serfdom will be in vain.
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that Tibet has been an inalienable part of China
under effective central government rule since it was merged with
Chinese territory in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), but Dalai Lama,
in his 40 years of exile, has stuck to his reactionary position
and involved himself in activities that are intended to divide the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- "People's Daily" will carry an
editorial in its overseas edition Wednesday on the 40th
anniversary of democratic reforms in Tibet that reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
This year is the 40th anniversary of the democratic reform and
abolition of the feudal serfdom under the despotic theocratic rule
in Tibet. Forty years ago, on March 10, the upper class
reactionary clique representing the three categories of feudal
lords in Tibet launched an armed rebellion to maintain serfdom,
backed by imperialists and anti-Chinese forces in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
They tore up the "17-Article Agreement", declared Tibetan
independence, persecuted patriots, and began an all-round attack
on People's Liberation Army (PLA) forces stationed in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
But, with strong support from local people, the PLA soon put
down the rebellion and Dalai Lama and members of his group fled
abroad in panic.
</P>
<P>
In July that year, a massive movement of democratic reforms
swept over the plateau area, and the extremely backward and
reactionary system of serfdom under the despotic religious and
political rule was abolished. A million serfs suffering under
slavery who had been trampled on for generations stood up and
became master of their own fate, and a new historical period began.

<P>
The three categories of feudal lords before Tibet's democratic
reform were administrative officials, the nobility, and high-
ranking lamas, who made up less than five percent of the
population but owned all the farmland, pastures, forests,
mountains, rivers, and most livestock.
</P>
<P>
Serfs and slaves made up more than 95 percent of the population
and had no land or personal freedom. Their owners had them at
their disposal because they were private property. They could
trade or sell them or present them as gifts.
</P>
<P>
The "13-Article Code" and "16-Article Code", which were in
effect for several hundred years in old Tibet, divided people into
three classes and nine ranks and people at the bottom of this
class system were worth a "straw rope". With the help of the law,
the serf-owners applied extremely cruel penalties like gouging out
eyes, cutting off feet, tongue, or hands, throwing people off
cliffs or into water, or executing them to maintain their rule.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan society before the democratic reform was darker and
more cruel than Europe's system of serfdom in the Middle Ages and
can be said to have been one of the world's most serious
violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951 brought hope to the
Tibetan people in their struggle for equal rights and economic
status. Tibetans craved reforms of the old system and many open-
minded people came to see that Tibet could never prosper without
reform.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the Tibetans' aspiration for reforms and
the history and actual situation of Tibet, the central people's
government took a very prudent attitude toward social reforms in
Tibet, and the "17-Article Agreement" on the peaceful liberation
of Tibet signed in May 1951 between the central government and the
local government in Tibet clearly states that reforms would be
carried out by the local government and not be forcefully
implemented by the central government.

<P>
Bernhard Jagoda, president of the labor office, attributed the

<HEADLINE> People's Daily on Tibet (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The central government has been magnanimous toward Dalai Lama
and his followers and has made all kinds of efforts to persuade
them to give up their ideas on "Tibetan independence" and stop
trying to divide the country.
</P>
<P>
But Dalai Lama has judged the situation incorrectly and has
increased efforts to push for "Tibetan independence" as a tool in
the hands of Western forces and has even tried to stir up riots
and terrorist activities in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He has done nothing good for the Tibetan people in his 40 years
of fugitive life while the central government has continued to
follow a clear-cut policy in contacts and negotiations with him,
asking him to abandon calls for "Tibetan independence", put an end
to attempts to divide the country, and openly admit that Tibet is
an inalienable part of China, that Taiwan is a Chinese province,
and that the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate
government representing the whole of China.
</P>
<P>
China objects to any interference by foreign forces in its
contacts and negotiations with Dalai Lama because this is an
internal affair.
</P>
<P>
After 40 years of reforms and changes, a poor and backward
Tibet has become a new Tibet of economic development, social
progress, unity between ethnic groups, political stability, and a
secure border.
</P>
<P>
Advancing on the road of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics as a member of China's big socialist family of
various ethnic groups, Tibet can look forward to an even better
future.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Member Calls for Early Solution for Taiwan Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A top advisor to the Chinese
government called for an early solution to the Taiwan question
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Lizhi, a member of the country's top advisory body, the
national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, and a member of the standing committee of the Taiwan
Democratic Self-Government League Central Committee, made the call
at a speech meeting of the ongoing session of the CPPCC national
committee.
</P>
<P>
"With Hong Kong having returned to the embrace of the
motherland and Macao also coming back, the problem of Taiwan is
becoming increasing prominent," Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin has put forward an eight-point proposal
on developing relations across the Taiwan Strait and promoting a
peaceful reunification of the motherland. And his suggestion to
end hostility and start negotiations under the principle of "One
China" in a report at the 15th Party Congress also created
favorable conditions for solving the problem of Taiwan peacefully
and promoting relations across the Taiwan Strait, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful reunification of the motherland still faces many
obstacle, he said. "The principal leader of the Taiwan authorities
has deviated from the principle of 'one China', and got involved
in activities aimed at creating 'two Chinas'. He has also
connived at the development of pro-'Taiwan independence' forces
and obstructed reunification of the two sides across the Taiwan
Strait," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is part of China, he said. The attempt to change this
fact through a referendum in Taiwan does not accord with the
interests of the Taiwan people, he said, adding "this is playing
with fire."
</P>
<P>
"A peaceful reunification is where the fundamental interests of
the Chinese people lie," Zheng said, citing numerous favorable
factors and conditions for the final solution of the Taiwan
question such as the same origin of the people, complementary and
mutually-beneficial economies on both sides, and expanding
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the principle of "on country,two systems"
is based on a respect for realities in Taiwan, which will be able
to maintain its capitalist system and way of life after the
reunification, just as Hong Kong has done after its return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Zheng stressed that the Chinese people will not permit anti-
China forces to contain China by thwarting the reunification of
China. "Both sides across the Taiwan Strait should conduct talks
and negotiations and fight against interference by foreign forces,
so as to achieve the reunification of the motherland as early as
possible and enjoy together the dignity and honor of a great
nation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Formulation, Revisions of China's Constitution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Constitution is the
fundamental law of the state, it has the supreme legal
authenticity, and is the basis for formulating all other laws. No
law or regulation should contravene the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, the first Constitution of the
People's Republic of China was adopted by the First National
People's Congress in 1954, and the Constitution was twice
completely revised in 1975 and 1978.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the Constitution was completely revised on the basis
of the 1954 version, and in 1988 and 1993, the Constitution was
twice partially revised.
</P>
<P>
The current Constitution stipulates the political and economic
systems of the country, the rights and obligations of the citizens,
the setup and the scope of responsibilities of the state organs,
and the fundamental tasks for the state in future.
</P>
<P>
Besides the preamble, the Constitution consists of 138 articles
in four chapters.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the revision of the Constitution, Article 64 of the
Constitution stipulates: "Amendments to the Constitution are to be
proposed by the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress or by more than one-fifth of the deputies to the National
People's Congress and adopted by a majority vote of more than two-
thirds of all the deputies to the Congress."
</P>
<P>
The Constitution is the legalization of the democratic system
in China and the general regulations for the organization and
activities of the state and is the country's own base and core for
its legalization. Therefore, the stipulation on the method for the
revision of the Constitution must take the stability of the
Constitution into consideration.
</P>
<P>
In China, the revision of the Constitution may be conducted in
the form of adopting amendments to the Constitution, such as the
amendments made in 1988 and 1993, as well as the form of rewriting,
such as the Constitutions adopted in 1975, 1978 and 1982 which
were completely rewritten on the basis of the former ones.
</P>
<P>
The 1954 Constitution was drafted on the basis of "The Common
Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference".
The draft sought wide-ranging deliberations among the Chinese
people and on September 20, 1954, it was adopted at the First
Session of the First National People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> Further Development in China-Ukraine Trade Relations Noted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese State Councilor Wu
Yi said here Tuesday that there's much to be done to promote
economic cooperation between China and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark during her meeting with Sergei Tigipko,
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed their concern over the decline in trade
volume between the two countries in recent years. Wu said that the
two governments should play a stronger role in promoting bilateral
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation should be diversified and focused on the
processing and manufacturing industries, she added.
</P>
<P>
Tigipko said the Ukrainian government will encourage more
Chinese investment by helping the existing cooperation projects
run more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China is one of the largest trade partners
of Ukraine and the promotion of bilateral economic cooperation has
a broad prospect and bright future.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, China agreed to donate 5 million yuan (about
604 thousand U.S. dollars) to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Wu arrived in Kiev on Monday afternoon for a four-day visit.
She has already visited Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Belarus.

<TEXT>
<P>
This Constitution established the fundamental political system
for New China and stipulated, for the first time, "All power in
the People's Republic of China belongs to the people."
</P>
<P>
The 1975 Constitution was formulated during the "Cultural
Revolution" and it had lots of pitfalls in its guiding ideology
and concrete regulations.
</P>
<P>
This Constitution adopted in March 1978 had greater changes
compared with the 1975 Constitution and restored the systems of
open trial, defending and procuratorates. Since it was promulgated
before the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), the 1978 version of the
Constitution still had many shortcomings, such as the erroneous
wording "Persisting in continuous revolution under the
dictatorship of the proletariat."
</P>
<P>
The 1982 Constitution was revised based on nationwide
discussions. It inherited and developed the basic principles of
the 1954 Constitution, summed up the experience of the socialist
development in China and absorbed international experience. This
Constitution is a fundamental law with Chinese characteristics
that meets the needs of China's socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
It stipulates that China takes the four cardinal principles --
socialist road, people's democratic dictatorship, leadership of
the Communist Party and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought --
as guidelines and it stresses that the basic task for the nation
is to concentrate its effort on socialist modernization drive. In
developing socialist democracy, it stipulates that all citizens
are equal before the law, no organization nor person has the
privilege of overstepping the bounds of the law. It also
stipulates that the state leaders must serve no more than two
consecutive terms (10 years), and this actually abolishes the de
facto life term of leading officials.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Seventh NPC in 1988 approved
amendments to Article 11 of Constitution: "The state permits
private economy to exist and grow within the limits prescribed by
law" and non-public economy is "a complement to the socialist
public economy."
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Eighth NPC made nine amendments to the
Constitution and added into the Constitution the theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhering to the
reform, opening up and the multi-party cooperation under the
leadership of the CPC and the political consultation system.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Files Libel Suit Against Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
filed Tuesday afternoon a 100 million peso (2.5 million U.S.
dollars) libel suit against the Manila Times for its story
published last month linking him to an alleged rigging of a 17
billion peso government contract.
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit-complaint filed before the Office of the
Prosecutor in Mandaluyong City, Manila, Estrada said that the
story, which contained "libelous comments and conclusions," is an
open attack and serious affront on his "reputation, honor and
dignity" as a person as well as his "honesty and integrity as a
public official."
</P>
<P>
Estrada also sought exemplary damages of at least 1 million
peso from the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters following the filing of the
libel complaint, Estrada said that should the case prosper, he
would donate the amount to an orphanage or to his administration's
scholarship program to send 100 Muslim youths abroad each year to
pursue higher academic studies.
</P>
<P>
Named as respondents in the case were Robina Gokongwei-Pe, of
Metromedia Times Corp., mother firm of The Manila Times; Liberato
Gomez Jr., Lisa Gokongwei, Marcia Gokongwei, Rhodora Dakanay and
Pedro Juanitas.
</P>
<P>
Gokongwei-Pe is the president and director of Metromedia Times
Corp., while Gomez, Lisa and Marcia Gokongwei are directors of the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
Dakanay is a director and treasurer of the corporation, while
Juanitas is a director and corporate secretary of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
The complaint also listed as respondents Manila Times publisher
Ermin Garcia Jr., Editor-in-Chief Ma. Lourdes Mangahas, Managing
Editor Chit Estella, News Editor Glenda Gloria and Chief of
Business Reporters Joel Gaborni.
</P>
<P>
The president presented as evidence a clipping from the
February 16, 1999 issue of the paper, whose banner story read,
"Palace in P17 billion contract rigging, President was unwitting
ninong (sponsor)."
</P>
<P>
"A reading of the headline and my picture immediately conveys
the thinking that I am a party and/or that I have participated in
the contract rigging referred to in the subject headline, and I
gave my go-signal to such rigging, which is far from the truth,"
he said in his complaint.
</P>
<P>
With the filing of the libel case, Estrada became the second
president since former president Corazon C. Aquino to file a libel
suit against a newspaper during the presidential incumbency.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Mrs. Aquino filed a libel case against the late
journalist Luis Beltran for writing in his column that she hid
under the bed at the height of a coup attempt in December 1989.
The case was dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Spring Snow Relieves Qinghai Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The first major snowfall on
northwest China's Qinghai Plateau since last winter has at least
to some extent relieved an extended drought.
</P>
<P>
The dry spell since last autumn has prevented Qinghai farmers
from planting crops on over 400,000 hectares of arable land. The
drought has also affected natural grassland areas covering over 16
million hectares.
</P>
<P>
The snow accumulation will not completely relieve the drought,
but will nonetheless bring life and vigor to drought-stricken
areas.
</P>
<P>
The local meteorological department reported today's snow
accumulations ranged from 0.5 mm to 2.4 mm, with more
precipitation predicted over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds reaching as high as force 10 roared through
pastureland located at 4,000 meters above sea level in southern
part of the province on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The continuing strong winds have destroyed a number of
ramshackle houses in the area. Experts predict that southern and
western Qinghai Province, as well as areas around the Qinghai Lake,
will continue to experience windy weather over the next few days.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine army troops Tuesday
launched a massive combat operation against New People's Army
(NPA) rebels who raided an army detachment, abducted a soldier and
carted away 12 pieces of high-powered firearms last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Santos Gabison, commander of the army's 4th Infantry
Division based in Cagayan de Oro, said the raid was well planned
in which the NPA rebels posed as residents of Lianga, Surigao del
Sur and invited soldiers manning the Army detachment to attend a
wedding feast.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the soldiers and civilian militiamen left their
post, 60 fully armed NPA rebels raided the detachment and captured
detachment commander Alvio Lozada.
</P>
<P>
The rebels also took away 12 pieces of high-powered firearms
which included seven M-14s, two Garands, two Carbine and one M-16.
</P>
<P>
Lozada is the fourth officer kidnapped by the rebels since
February 17. Still being held by the rebels are Brig. Gen. Victor
Obillo, Capt. Eduardo Montealto and Police Chief Inspector
Roberto.
</P>
<P>
The government has demanded for the release of the captives
pending resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
NPA rebels suffered a series of major setbacks during the past
13 years that reduced their combatants from a high of 25,600 to an
estimated 6,000 at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been trying to rebuild their forces since last
year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman on Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told today's
press conference that the visit is another major event in Sino-U.S.
relations in the wake of the successful exchange of visits between
the heads of state of the two countries, and it will further
promote mutual understanding and expand cooperation for mutual
benefit in broad areas.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the
establishment of Sino-U.S. diplomatic relations, and the
successful exchange of visits between the two heads of state have
pushed Sino-U.S. relations to a new stage. The bilateral relations
have maintained a good momentum in general, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that remarks detrimental to Sino-U.S. relations
are "groundless, irresponsible" ,and were made "with ulterior
motives."
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S. , both influential countries in the world,
share extensive common interests, Zhu said, pointing to the fact
that both sides have been expanding cooperation in various areas,
and have conducted fruitful consultations on the issues concerning
regional and international security.
</P>
<P>
Facts prove that developing Sino-U.S. friendly relations
conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries, and
serves peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and in the
world at large, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu reaffirmed that the Taiwan question has always been the
most important and most sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"As long as our two sides strictly adhere to the principles of
the three China-U.S. joint communiques and the China-U.S. Joint
Statement, especially such important principles as mutual respect
for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-interference
in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit,
relations between China and the United States will enjoy a smooth
growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to join hands with the U.S. to remove
interference and bring a healthy and steady Sino-U.S. relations
into the 21st century, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Australian Robbers Get Away With Millions of Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- An armored security van carrying
at least 2.5 million Australian dollars (1.5 million U.S. dollars)
was spirited away early Tuesday by four armed bandits in eastern
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The only witness to the daring heist was driver Matthew Kelly,
who was found handcuffed but unharmed in the back of the van in
the south of Brisbane, capital city of Queensland state, the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Kelly, 30, told police that four people dressed in black and
wearing white gloves hijacked the Brinks Australia vehicle as it
made its final pickup from the Sunnybank Hills Shopping Plaza on
the city's southside at 2:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
At least two of the robbers were armed with rifles when they
apparently overpowered him as he waited inside the vehicle with
the motor running while two other security guards went inside to
collect the day's taking.
</P>
<P>
The van was found seven hours later abandoned behind the
Calamvale Recreation Center with Kelly locked inside, handcuffed
to a door handle but otherwise unharmed.
</P>
<P>
Despite his ordeal, police took Kelly back to the scene Tuesday
afternoon and spent several hours interviewing him in the hope of
uncovering a clue that would help them crack the case.
</P>
<P>
Detective Inspector Peter Scanlon said Kelly, who have worked
for Brinks security for just two and a half months, had been
questioned extensively by detectives but could not give a detailed
description of his assailants.
</P>
<P>
"Even though police were at the scene within minutes we have
little to go on at this stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
There were no signs of forced entry to the armored van and
police were presuming Kelly was overpowered and forced to open up.
</P>
<P>
Police have set up checks at air, bus and train departure
stations in case the robbers dump their getaway car and try to
leave the city by public transport.
</P>
<P>
Forty policemen were immediately assigned to the investigation,
but Scanlon said there were no early leads.

<HEADLINE> NATO Official: Paris Meeting on Kosovo Could be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) - The Kosovo peace meeting, due to
resume next Monday in Paris, could be delayed for a few days to
allow more time for progress, a senior NATO official said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified, said
international mediators wanted the Paris meeting to be a signing
ceremony for an agreement drafted at talks in Rambouillet last
month, with a few days of detailed discussion on implementation,
according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
Once Kosovo ethnic Albanians agree to sign, the mediators will
concentrate on winning Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
acceptance of the full package, including a NATO-led
implementation force which he has so far rejected. If they succeed
in making progress, the Paris conference could be postponed for a
few days to allow time to complete the negotiations, the NATO
official said.
</P>
<P>
"I think it won't be Monday," he was quoted as saying, and
added that the meeting could last "perhaps up to seven days."
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, NATO Secretary-general Javier Solana repeated
the threat to use force if necessary when addressing a conference
here.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Urges India to Reduce Trade Imbalance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh asked India on Tuesday to
allow duty-free access of Bangladeshi products to Indian market to
narrow the huge trade imbalance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The key solution for reducing the huge trade imbalance is to
allow Bangladeshi goods duty-free access to India on a
non-reciprocal basis,
</P>
<P>
The comment was made by Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail
Ahmed at a meeting here with his Indian counterpart, Ramakrishna
Hedge, who arrived here Tuesday on a three-day visit to
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's imports from India stood at 755 million dollars
during the 1997-98 fiscal year, while its exports to the latter
was 50 million dollars only.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed requested Hedge to take appropriate steps to reduce the
trade gap, which he said would help improve his country's trade
capacities and increase intra-SAARC (South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation) trade. The intra-regional trade now is only
about 3 percent of the total of all SAARC member countries.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Bangladesh's liberalization in the early 90s, the
country's import from India have increased substantially and India
could do a lot for increasing Bangladesh's exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want speedy implementation of the decisions so far taken to
expand regional trade," said Ahmed, complaining that the tariff,
concession and removal of non-tariff barriers granted to
Bangladesh by India in the last two years have largely remained
unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that India import ready-made garments from
Bangladesh and Indian entrepreneurs set up joint-ventures in
Bangladesh with the products to be marketed in India on a buy-back
system.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the call for expanding import from Bangladesh,
the Indian minister said that India needs lots of goods to import
from Bangladesh. On the issue of expansion of regional and
sub-regional trade, he said, "We should made a joint campaign to
expand our bilateral and mutual trade."
</P>
<P>
He proposed to use Chittagong port in southeast Bangladesh for
goods destined for the north-eastern region of India.
</P>
<P>
In reply to Hedge's proposal of importing products of natural
gas from Bangladesh, Ahmed said the country's priority is to meet
the local demand of gas. "Definitely we will go for export if we
have surplus," he added.
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon meeting Tuesday, hosted by the Federation of
Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Hedge said it was now
the turn of Bangladesh to have a free trade agreement with India,
following Nepal and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
"My idea is that the SAARC countries must come closer and
closer," and relations be strengthened to such an extent that all
members could adopt a common currency, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a week-long Indian trade fair began in the city on
Tuesday to promote exports to Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace
and Development Council (SPDC) and Prime Minister Senior General
Than Shwe returned here Tuesday afternoon after ending a two-day
goodwill visit to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in northern Thailand's Chiang Rai on Monday,
Than Shwe held talks with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. The
two sides agreed to enhance the two countries' cooperation in
narcotics suppression, including cracking down on drug trade and
illicit trafficking in the infamous Golden Triangle area bordering
Myanmar, Thailand and Laos.
</P>
<P>
The talks also covered issues on settlement of border dispute,
and the two sides agreed to tackle the marine and fishing dispute
between them through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe, accompanied by Chuan, also visited a Thai crop
substitution plantation project in Chiang Rai where large areas of
opium have been successfully replaced by cash crops such as
vegetables and fruits.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe also called on Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej in
Bangkok during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe's 40-strong entourage included SPDC First Secretary
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, Foreign Minister U Win Aung and
four other ministers.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chuanchuan, an 18-year-old panda
housed at the Shanghai Zoo, was shipped to the Chongqing Zoo for
the ninth time today to spend the March-April mating season with
Xinxing (New Star).
</P>
<P>
Chuanchuan and Xinxing have conceived seven cubs since the zoos
initiated cooperation in 1990. Three surviving cubs are growing
healthily.
</P>
<P>
Xinxing has recovered rapidly since giving birth to her last
cub in July last year, and currently eats 20-30 kg of bamboo
leaves daily, along with portions of rice flour, eggs, milk and
mincemeat.
</P>
<P>
Chuanchuan and Xinxing will be housed in separate cages until
experts confirm the beginning of the estrus period.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that pandas are highly selective when it
comes to accepting mates, and note Chuanchuan and Xinxing have
rarely remained together throughout the entire mating season.

<HEADLINE> China Responds Positively To Export Market Challenges (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China's increasing commercial
skills in adapting to turbulent market changes in the face of the
still rippling Asian financial crisis have been highlighted at the
East China Fair which opened here on March 5th.
</P>
<P>
Transactions and turnover in sales and contracts have totaled
330 million US dollars in the first four days of the annual fair,
slightly higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
"The result is much better than expected and indicates that
China is becoming increasingly used to adapting to international
market changes in foreign trade," said Zhou Hongli, deputy
director of the general office of the fair's organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Chinese exports, which are often labor and resource intensive,
have been put at a competitive disadvantage on the world markets
by the growth of overseas products with a high added value and
high level of technical content, according to industry experts.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has posed the greatest challenges to
China's foreign trade as massive currency devaluation in Thailand,
Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and
some other countries in Asia reduced the demand for Chinese
products while raising the export competitiveness of the crisis-
hit countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
To turn around this negative situation, China has intensified
its efforts to improve product quality, diversify export markets
and optimize its export mix, among other measures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's decision not to devalue its currency, the
yuan, has effectively helped to avoid domestic economic
instability and prevented a new round of currency devaluation in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
All these measures combined to enable China to realize a 0.5
percent increase in exports last year, which, though significantly
lower than the 20.9 percent in 1997, was in sharp contrast to
substantial export declines in other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year China has unveiled measures to reform its
foreign trade system, such as reducing the number of goods with
export permits from 115 to 59, empowering 61 private enterprises
to engage in foreign trade for the first time and allowing greater
flexibility in the administration of the export and import rights
of over 6,000 large industrial enterprises.

<HEADLINE> China Responds Positively To Export Market Challenges (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In east Jiangsu Province, China's third largest export region,
efforts have been stepped up to tap the markets in Latin America
and Africa. Last year, Jiangsu's exports to Latin America and
Africa went up by more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is important for us to retain market share," Dai Yongyin,
Deputy Director of Jiangsu Provincial Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Committee, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Ningbo Youngor Group Co. Ltd., one of the best established
garment manufacturers in east Zhejiang Province, and also a major
exporter, has adopted a "brandname strategy" to increase exports.
At the fair, it exhibited a range of products in different styles
for customers in Europe, the United States, Australia, Africa, and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"We enjoy a brandname privilege and our market potential is
great so long as we can respond to market changes in a timely
manner," said Fang Jianming, one of the company's traders who was
holding an order from a German importer in his hand.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the possibility of an even harder export
situation this year, China will continue to expand its experiments
in Sino-foreign trade joint ventures, strive to export directly to
overseas chainstores, encourage enterprises to set up plants
overseas, and increase financial support for the export of
machinery and electronics, according to Xu Bingjin, Assistant
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Import and Export Bank of China, a major vehicle for
financing exports, has upped its line of export credit to 35
billion yuan this year from 1998's 25.6 billion yuan, which can
only benefit exporters in the short term.
</P>
<P>
In the interest of long-term goals, China will also establish
export-oriented scientific and technological industrial parks and
use new and high technology to renovate traditional industries in
an effort to increase the technical content and competitiveness of
Chinese products, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we can offset much of the adverse impact
of the turbulent world market and ensure a better development of
China's foreign trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many trade officials and exporters participating in the fair
say they have seen signs of a possible improvement in China's
export situation this year after the sudden plunge in growth from
1997's 20.9 percent to only 0.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji last week called for "all
possible means" to increase exports to help boost economic growth,
which reached 7.8 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Takes Part in Discussion of NPC Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, state vice-president
and a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the Communist Party (CPC) of China Central Committee, called for
fostering a scientific point of view on development, opening wider
to the outside world and maintaining a high spirit.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the call at a group discussion on the government work
report attended by NPC deputies from Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Hu emphasized that, in the process of building a socialist
market economy, resources should be allocated and production and
goods circulation organized in accordance with supply and demand
on the market.
</P>
<P>
Since the supply and demand situation in China has undergone
great changes, he said, particular attention should be paid to the
unity of scale and structure, quantity and quality, and speed and
economic results.
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization provides China with a rare opportunity
for development but at the same time brings enormous risks, too,
he said. "We should safeguard our economic security, but this does
not mean that we should become hesitant about opening the country
wider to the outside world."
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that it is completely correct and necessary for the
country to focus on expanding domestic demand, but efforts to
develop foreign trade and introduce overseas funds should not be
slackened.
</P>
<P>
China must firmly implement the opening policy and take an
active part in international economic cooperation and competition,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that keeping a high spirit is crucial for dealing
with contradictions and problems and called on cadres at all
levels to trust and rely on people in finding solutions for
problems and overcoming difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Debt Becomes Threat to S.Korea's Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's debt is expected to
rise this year, posing a threat to the nation's efforts for an
early economic recovery, said the Korea Center for Free Enterprise
(CFE) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The center's report said many unpredictable factors in the
financial and industrial restructuring may push the government's
debt beyond 60 percent of the gross national product (GNP) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The remark is quite different from a government-issued forecast
which claims that its debt volume, including external debt
guarantees for domestic firms, will rise to 200 trillion won (some
180 billion U.S. dollars), or 45 percent of GNP, by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Bad loans at local banks may turn out to be far greater than
expected, and the government's attempt to quickly implement
industrial restructuring will further add to its fiscal burdens,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Should the massive fiscal support for financial and industrial
restructuring be simultaneously accompanied by a similar drive to
expand budgets for unemployment and pump-priming projects, the
government debt will easily exceed the 60-percent level of this
year's GNP, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also warned that heavy tax burdens stemming from
heavy debts could disrupt many economic activities.
</P>
<P>
"People will increasingly lose their taste for savings and
investments, and pay more attention to evading taxes. Moreover,
the government's ability to provide public services will be
affected," it said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government's debt began surging in the wake of
the foreign exchange crisis in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The debt stood at 12.1 percent of GNP as of the end of 1997,
which was considered exceptionally low compared with those of
Japan, the United States and other industrialized countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
here today stated his vision to Asian business executives on how
his corporation can help Asian companies become efficient
enterprises for tomorrow through its Digital Nervous System (DNS).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to 160 administrative and information executives of
major Asian enterprises, who gathered here for the Asian
Enterprise Summit, Gates explained how his DNS can help them solve
business difficulties such as reducing cost, enhancing
communications and responding to market competition and
globalization of business.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day summit, leaders from 30 different industries
in Asia can have a chance to share the management experience of
big enterprises and to talk about how technology can improve their
business profits.

Delivering a keynote speech, Gates said that with the Digital
Nervous System, enterprises can make full use of the current
investment of its information infrastructure to improve their
efficiency and then become successful enterprises and establish
closer ties with their customers.
</P>
<P>
The basic elements of the high efficient DNS includes the
network function, secure E-mail, powerful data bank and other
application software.

<HEADLINE> Former French PM Acquitted in Blood Contamination Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Former French Prime Minister Laurent
Fabius and former Minister of Social Affairs Georgina Dufoix, who
stood a two-month trial for the 1985 contamination of government
blood stocks by AIDS, were acquitted on Tuesday by the Court of
Justice of the Republic.
</P>
<P>
Former Secretary of State of Health Edmond Herve was condemned
but would not serve jail sentence because he had not benefited
from the right of presumption of innocence during the judicial
investigation, said the court.
</P>
<P>
The three former ministers were accused of "involuntary
homicide and involuntary attack of physical integrity of persons"
by seven people who obtained AIDS through transfusion of the
contaminated blood.
</P>
<P>
The court said that taking into account of the lack of enough
knowledge about AIDS, the charges against Fabius and Dufoix did
not stand.
</P>
<P>
But the court said that Herve, 56, had failed to ordered the
verification of the blood products prior to August 1, 1985, the
date by which an AIDS checking system had been introduced.
</P>
<P>
He was also blamed for not informing the patients who had blood
transfusion at that time after the contamination was discovered.

<HEADLINE> Angola Worried Over Possible Price Drop of Diamond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
expressed worries over the possible price drop of diamond on the
international market following decreasing needs, which might
affect the country's mineral industry, the main sources of
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Sumbula, Deputy Minister of Geology and Mines, has said
that the prices of diamond would sooner or later decline after the
reduced demand in the international market, following the
financial crisis in Asia and Latin America, the Angola Daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The price drop of diamond may pose as yet another disaster for
the country after the the oil price decline in the world market,
Sumbula said, adding that the government is getting about 600
million U.S. dollars from diamond a year, with some of the mines
controlled by the rebel National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The Geology and Mines Ministry declared at the beginning of the
year that the government controled mines turned out about two
million karat of diamond in 1998, worth about 450 million dollars,
while the informal sector produced about 100,000 karat, worth
about 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Angola is also an important oil producer, next only to Nigeria
in Africa, with a daily production of about 780,000 barrels. The
sharp drop in oil price in the world market has greatly reduced
the country's foreign currency income, ushering in financial
crisis and price hike in the southern African country.

<HEADLINE> Most Middle School Students Suffer Shortsightedness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Shortsightedness arising from
excessive study and lack of care for eyes are plaguing 70 percent
of middle school students in China, according to a report in today'
s "Beijing Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
The level of shortsightedness is serious at senior middle
schools, where students often shoulder heavier loads of study and
pay less attention to care for their eyes. A survey found about 70
percent of the students suffering shortsightedness in their last
academic year.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that about 22 percent of primary school
students from grade four to six were nearsighted, compared with 10
percent among younger pupils.
</P>

However, after three years' studying at junior high school,
more than half of the students had to wear glasses due to myopia,

HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
today expressed interest in participating in the planned Cyberport
project in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Gates, answering questions at a press conference here to
announce a cooperative project with Hongkong Telecom, said his
company will "participate in the Cyberport, making sure we put in
engineers and architects there so that all the companies have the
media access," he said.
</P>
<P>
Between now and the time when the Cyberport gets done,
Microsoft will "encourage local software activity," he added.

Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang announced the 13
billion HK dollar (1.7 billion U.S. dollar) Cyberport project in

</P>
<P>
Gates, who arrived here Monday for a three-day visit before
going to South China's Shenzhen, met with officials of the Hong

a number of initiatives they are taking."
</P>
<P>
"It's a signal that there is a great opportunity for
entrepreneurial businesses, the software businesses going to be a
very fast-growing business with a variety of different companies
coming into it. And I think it's important that Hong Kong
participates in that," Gates said.

</P>
<P>
Admitting that the only real high-tech centers in the world
today are no more than a few cities in the United States, Gates
said he is "fairly optimistic" that there is enough demand that
places like Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong can be successful in
being great software centers.
</P>

"...It's great to be taking the right steps to a position Hong
Kong is a leader there. It starts with education, and the second
thing is the high-speed communications network," he added.

Hongkong Telecom Chief Executive Linus W. L. Cheung, also
attending the press conference, said Hong Kong is very well
positioned to be a hub not only for communications but for data

LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A massive shake-up of the army, navy

officers being retired compulsorily, media reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the present reorganization process which began last week,
dozens of the officers of the army, navy and air force have handed
out their letters of disengagement from service.
</P>
<P>
A reliable source at the military headquarters in Lagos told
the Post Express that those affected in the army started receiving
their letters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The source disclosed that the disengagement exercise cuts
across all ranks and affects mainly those that have had
disciplinary cases.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 senior military officers from the rank of
lieutenant-colonel and above have been retired compulsorily, The
Punch newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the list, the paper said, were 125 army officers including
two major generals and four brigadiers general, 91 senior navy
officers including one vice admiral and 84 air force officers
including one air vice marshal.

The three services also gave some of the senior officers who
have served for 35 years the option of formally resigning from
service, the paper quoted sources as saying.

A senior army officer said the exercise was being carried out
simultaneously in the three services in the west African country.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Trade with U.S. Still Abysmal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Africa remained a faint blip
on the United States' trade radar last year, despite its
much-touted desire to help integrate Africa into the global
economy, Business Day paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 47 African states south of the Sahara bought 6.77 billion
U.S. dollars worth of goods from the United States, accounting for
a fraction under one percent of U.S. merchandise exports
worldwide, the U.S. commerce department statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicated an increase on 1997 of less than 0.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The region's exports to the United States, at 13.1 billion
dollars, represented only 1.4 percent of U.S. imports worldwide in
1998.
</P>
<P>
This was down from 1.9 percent a year earlier, mainly
reflecting the sharp drop in the oil price.
</P>
<P>
The United States said it has sourced a strategically
significant 26 percent of its oil imports, worth 7.6 billion U.S.
dollars, from Africa, principally Nigeria, Angola and Gabon, with
smaller quantities supplied by the two Congos and Equatorial
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
But for oil imports, the United States would have run a 1.3
billion dollars trade surplus with the region.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community (SADC), a 14-nation
bloc, received 65 percent of U.S. exports to Africa, valued at 4.4
billion dollars.
</P>

</P>
<P>
This was announced by One S. Sung, Senior Vice President of

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Sink on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed weaker on
Singapore Stock Market Tuesday as poor banking results kept market
sentiment negative and the selling of bank stocks pulled the key
Straits Times Index down.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) lost 11.32 points to
close at 1,440.52 in thin trading.
</P>
<P>
The total volume was comparatively low at 138.35 million shares
worth 270.49 million Singapore dollars (156.17 million U.S.
dollars). Tuesday's session saw 87 counters ending higher, 133
lower and 207 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Wing T was the most active stock with 10.33 million shares
done. Also among the most heavily traded, JC MPH W00 closed on a
volume of 10.04 million shares and DBS Land finished on a volume
of 9.15 million stocks.
</P>
<P>
CityDev headed the top movers with a rise of 15 cents to 7.5
Singapore dollars. It was followed by Datacraft that picked up 11
cents to close at 2.29 U.S. dollars. SemMarLog was up 10 cents to
close at 3.4 Singapore dollars.

OCBC F and SPH 100 each sank 40 cents and ended at 11.6 and 20.5
Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said investors were discouraged by the poor results of
the Development Bank of Singapore whose bad loan provisions were
more than doubled to just under 1 billion Singapore dollars and
whose net profit halved to 222.7 million Singapore dollars in
1998.
</P>
<P>
A local broker was quoted as saying, "Banks have come off quite
a lot because of their poor results and the market may head for
more weakness."
</P>
<P>
However, brokers noted that the weakness was offset by the
buying in property counters.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Conduct Extensive Software Test in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft will conduct an
extensive test on the Chinese version of its new business software
suite, Office 2000, starting from next Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest information from company sources, the
world's software giant will officially launch Office 2000 in the
third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
This software test will be the largest so far in China's
computer industry. A total of 21,000 copies of the test version of
the new software will be sent to professional computer engineers
through software retailers around the country.
</P>
<P>
The previous major software test in China was on Microsoft's
Windows 98 (Chinese version) last year. It involved 6,000 users.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's Vice President in charge of desktop applications,
Jon DeVaan said Office 2000 is based on its predecessor, Office 97,
but has more integrated Internet-related information building,
release mechanisms and sharing programs.
</P>
<P>
This is in conformity with the development of computer
technologies that center on networking and the Web, said DeVaan.
</P>
<P>
According to Luo Chuan, group marketing manager of Microsoft (
China) Co., Ltd., his company will also hold preview fairs for
Office 2000 in seven major cities including Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
"The gap between the launching of the Chinese and English
versions of Office 2000 will be 2-3 months shorter than that of
Office 97, " Luo said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese version of Office 97 came on the market in May 1997,
whereas the English version was available in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Office 2000 will provide users with increased and improved
capacity for the Chinese language and for the first time there
will be a Chinese language grammar and spelling check.
</P>
<P>
The handwriting input of the Chinese language would involve no
other hardware than a mouse.

NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
announced the formation of the National Unity and Reconciliation
Commission, sources from the Office of the President told the
Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The current Minister of Public Service, Jean Nepomuscene
Nayinzira, from the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), was
appointed last Friday chairman. Other members include Rose
Mukankomeje, vice-chairman, and former Minister of Gender, Aloysia
Inyumba, who was appointed Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
Seven other people were also appointed.
</P>
<P>
Francois Gasana Ndoba, a human rights activist living in
Belgium was proposed as a candidate for the chairmanship of the
Human Rights Commission by the commission, to be elected president
of the Human Rights commission by parliament.
</P>
<P>
Both commissions were proposed by the Arusha peace accord of
August 4, 1993 between the then rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front
(RPF) and the Kigali regime, which unfortunately could not be
implemented because of the genocide of Tutsis which rocked the
country in April-July 1994.
</P>
<P>
After the genocide was stopped by RPF, the latter agreed with
other political forces which were not involved in the killings to
form a government of national unity, and maintained the plan to
set up both commissions.

<P>
The refugees claimed that they were fleeing fierce fighting
between government troops and rebels in the two war-torn
countries.
</P>
<P>
No single case of cholera was recorded among the new arrivals
and their transportation went on smoothly in defiance of heavy
rains, the sources added.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Since December 19, the day when the "Desert Fox" operation
ended, the U.S. Air Force made 3,224 sorties in the two no-fly
zones in Iraq where they fired 274 missiles and killed from 20 to
several dozen civilians. The bombings, which were aimed at
weakening the Iraqi regime, have so far proved inefficient in
destabilizing Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
-- Under the American pressure, the Kosovo Liberation Army has
announced its readiness to sign the plan on substantial autonomy
in Kosovo, but on condition that "the free expression of the will
of the Kosovo people is guaranteed at the end of a three-year
interim period." Meanwhile, the distrust of the Yugoslav
authorities toward NATO has gone deeper after the international
arbitrary authorities in Bosnia declared Brcko, which was
controlled by the Serbs, a "neutral" city.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- Jean-Arcady Meyer, a specialist of artificial intelligence
and director of the animal lab of the Paris VI University, said
that through observing animals, robots can use highly
sophisticated tools of men, but the human model is too complicated
for them to imitate.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami is due to begin on
Tuesday a three-day visit to Italy, the first of its kind by an
Iranian head of state to a country of the European Union since the
1979 Islamic Revolution. The visit, which is aimed at opening up
the Iranian diplomacy and restoring the international image of the
Islamic republic, precedes another one by Khatami to France on
April 12.

<HEADLINE> Changed Life of Former Tibetan Serf Owner (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Soinam Dorje, a former Tibetan serf
owner, has said that he did not complain when his vast farmland
and real estate were distributed among serfs 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"My life is more comfortable now than at that time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soinam, 71, is a vice-chairman of the Prefectural Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Shannan
Prefecture of China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He lives in a two-storey villa, which is two kilometers away
from his office, and goes to work in a Toyota sedan car provided
by the government. "I did not even know what a car looked like in
the old days," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Before Tibet's Democratic Reform in 1959, Soinam was a senior
official in the Shannan government and owned five manors, 45
hectares of farmland, 75 serfs, a three-storey house and vast
stretches of forest and grassland, with an annual income of 67,900
kg of grain as well as large amounts of meat and butter. This was
an income standing at middle level among the serf-owner class of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Reform was a turning point in Tibet's history
and a great achievement in changing the structures of Tibet's serf
and serf-owner class and its economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the property of serf-owners, two ways were adopted
during the two-year Democratic Reform, namely, to confiscate the
land and other means of production owned by those who opposed the
reform and participated in the armed rebellion aimed at separating
Tibet from China, but redeemed the property of those who were not
involved in the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The land, livestock and means of production so confiscated and
redeemed were distributed to the serfs, he said.

<P>
As Soinam supported the reform and re-distributed his land and
houses to serfs and slaves, the newly-established people's
government let him serve as vice-chairman of the Shannan
Prefectural Committee of the CPPCC and he was satisfied with it.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Officials of various levels pay great attention to
members of the CPPCC and would ask us for advice before making an
important decision and give us feedback."
</P>
<P>
Soinam makes regular tours around Shannan to learn about people'
s living conditions, actions which are spoken highly of by local
people.
</P>
<P>
He has only one son, who is 50 years old and serves as general
manager of a local factory. His grandson and grand-daughter are
studying in middle schools in Tianjin Municipality and Changchun
city, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, whose living
expenses and tuition fees are covered by the state.
</P>
<P>
Soinam gets a monthly salary of 2,027 yuan. Together with the
over 2,000 yuan monthly pay of his son and daughter-in-law, the
four-member family live a good life.
</P>
<P>
Soinam told reporters in his Tibet-styled house built of
granite and cement that he has finished writing his family's
history and will have the book published. He expressed the hope
that it will be translated into Chinese and other languages so
that more people will be able to learn about the past and present
of Tibet in an authentic and realistic way.

<HEADLINE> Giant Pandas Given As Gift To Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Two giant pandas have been
presented to Hong Kong from the Chinese central government as gift
in a bid to publicize the problems facing this endangered species.
</P>
<P>
The pair, An'an and Jiajia, are scheduled to leave for the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Thursday from
southwest China's Chengdu City.
</P>
<P>
For their first month in the HKSAR they will be in quarantine
before being housed in a specially built, state of the art
enclosure in Hong Kong's Ocean Theme park.
</P>
<P>
The female, Jiajia, is aged about 21, and is known in China as
a "heroin mother" after giving birth to six cubs in five
consecutive years from 1992 to 1996. She has been living with the
male An'an, aged about 14, in the Wolong Giant Panda Research
Center in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese veterinary experts the pair are in good
health.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the HKSAR, the Central Government decided to
send the two giant pandas to Hong Kong as local people have been
expressing the wish that they might have their own pandas in
captivity and the authorities believe it will also increase public
awareness in the region for the need to protect nature and
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are considered to be one of world's most
endangered species and only about 1,000 are known to exist, most
of them in Sichuan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary Leaves UAE for Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen left the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for Qatar on Tuesday
morning, a source from the U.S. Embassy here told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Cohen left from Dubai for Qatar Tuesday morning, the source
said, adding that Qatar and Kuwait will be the last two legs of
his Mideast tour aimed at explaining U.S. policy on Iraq and
rallying support.
</P>
<P>
He had visited Oman, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain before coming to
the UAE.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan and
Cohen discussed the latest developments in the region,
particularly the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told reporters later that Washington was not seeking the
break-up of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we have said time and time again that Iraq's
integrity must be maintained. Our goal is one day to help bring
about a change in regime so that the people of Iraq can in fact
rejoin the international community as a full-fledged member,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But during their talks, the two leaders did not mention the
U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq in mid-December, a UAE
official said.
</P>
<P>
"The position of the UAE has not changed. It is opposed to the
military strikes on Iraq and it favors a diplomatic solution
through the U.N. Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the UAE is also "against any change of Iraqi
regime that is imposed from outside" and it supports Iraq's unity
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has vowed to help the Iraqi opposition parties topple
the current regime led by President Saddam Hussein since it
launched four-night air strikes in December with a declared aim of
punishing Baghdad for not to cooperate with the U.N. weapons
inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Prolonged Drought Causes Forest Fires in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The prolonged drought in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province caused four forest fires in three
counties between March 1 and 8, affecting 50 ha. of land.
</P>
<P>
The fires in Huaxian, Fuping and Zhouzhi counties were doused
by local people and soldiers, according to Dou Minsheng, an
official in charge of the provincial forest fire-control
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
But strong winds and dry weather made efforts to control the
fires very difficult, Dou said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial fire-control department has been on high alert
in case major fires break out.
</P>
<P>
According to meteorologists, rainfall in Shaanxi since last
October was 40 percent to 60 percent less than the normal.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the provincial forest fire-control department
said a total of 76 fires have occurred since last November. There
were 54 forest fires in February alone, which affected 890 ha. of
forestry land. However, the fires caused no heavy economic losses,
deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Gaoshi, the director of the provincial forestry
department, said that measures have been adopted to prevent major
forest fires from starting, including strict regulations
concerning the lighting of fires in such areas.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, which boasts many wild animals and rare plants, is
also home to giant pandas, golden monkeys and other endangered
animals.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province banned lumber activities and closed
many enterprises in order to protect the environment for wild
animals. Forest fires pose a serious threat to these precious
wild animals.

<HEADLINE> TB Cases Rise Sharply in Israel in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis (TB) cases in
Israel rose by 47 percent in 1998 from 1997, but experts said it
is too early to draw final conclusions, the Haaretz daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It cited the latest data released by the Health Ministry as
saying that the TB cases increased from 422 in 1997 to 619 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Shem-Tov, head of the national unit in the Health
Ministry for TB and AIDS said the data is being analyzed and will
be discussed at a conference, which is scheduled for March 24 to
mark the World Tuberculosis Day.
</P>
<P>
Tunde Madaras, who takes charge of supervising TB for the
European branch of the World Health Organization (WHO), said that
one of the main reasons for the rise is the immigration from the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Last year, tuberculosis reached near-epidemic proportions in
the countries of the former Soviet Union, Madaras said.
</P>
<P>
TB is a bacterial disease caused by the Tuberculosis
mycobacterium and transmitted through the air. The bacteria can
lie dormant within an individual for several years, becoming
active when the immune system is weakened.
</P>
<P>
Signs of active pulmonary TB include fever, coughing, bloody
mucus and chest pains. Individuals can carry the disease and
infect others without experiencing any symptoms themselves.
</P>
<P>
The WHO recommends combating the disease by monitoring the
treatment to every person with TB. Shem-Tov instituted this method
in Israel in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the very serious problem of non-compliance, each
patient is assigned to one of the nine TB care centers around the
country, where health care workers watch them to make sure that
the medication dispensed is swallowed, Haaretz said.

<HEADLINE> "Independence of Tibet": Outcome of Foreign Aggression (18) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So we can draw the following conclusions by reviewing the
history of imperialist aggression of Tibet and the evolution of
activities aimed at "Independence of Tibet".
</P>
<P>
First, Tibet has always been under the sovereign rule of China,
since it came under the rule of the central government of the Yuan
Dynasty in the 13th Century. However, there had been no mention of
"Tibetan Independence" or the problem of "Tibetan Independence "
until the beginning of the 20th century. The "Independence of
Tibet" became a problem in the early period of the current century,
when The British government attempted to separate Tibet from the
motherland and to turn Tibet into one of its dependencies, by
encouraging the pro-British activists among the upper classes of
Tibetan society to split from China in the name of "Independence
of Tibet". Historical facts have showed that the "Independence of
Tibet" is an outcome of the aggression of imperialists and their
attempt to split China. Following that, the international anti-
China forces continued to play the card of "Independence of Tibet"
in both the Cold War period and the late 1980s, attempting to
split Tibet from Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
Second, the international anti-China forces have deployed a
large number of human resources, materials and funds to aid the
activities of "Independence of Tibet" over the past century, ever
since the British government plotted to separate Tibet from China
at the Simrall Conference held in 1913. But all their attempts
have ended in failure, due to strong opposition from and struggles
by all nationalities of Chinese people, including all the Tibetan
people and Buddhists. All the nationalities of Chinese people have
helped and supported each other over a long period of history to
protect the motherland and fight against foreign invaders. They
have thus cultivated a deep and long lasting brotherhood and an
unbroken cohesion that will never separate them from each other.
This is one of the most important reasons why all the attempts by
both imperialists and a small number of separatists among the
upper echelons of Tibetan society in spitting Tibet from China
were unfruitful.
</P>
<P>
Third, at present, China has witnessed a rapid economic growth
rate over the past few years, with people's living standards
consistently improving, and comprehensive national power and
national defense strength greatly being upgraded. All Chinese
people, under the guidance of the Deng Xiaoping theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, are continuing to
implement the policies of reform and opening-up. Tibet has also
made remarkable achievements in economic progress, and witnessed
social stability since the quelling of rebellion in 1959,
particularly over the past two decades of reform and opening-up.
The Tibetan people are living and working in peace and contentment,
as their living standards continue to improve. They now are eager
for peace and development, and those separatists will find less
and less support among the Tibetan people. So any attempts or
plots to split Tibet from China in the disguise of "Independence
of Tibet" staged either by the international anti-China forces or
Dalai Lama group are doomed to failure.

<HEADLINE> Return to Motherland Brings New Opportunities for Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A Macao member of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, said here today
that the return of Macao to its motherland at the end of this year
has brought new opportunities for the region's economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
"With continuous supply of production and living materials from
the interior areas and the backing of a huge domestic market,
Macao can further promote its economic and trade relations with
the interior areas and create broad room for local economic
development," said Vitor Ng, president of the Macao Association
for Exports and Imports, at a speech meeting of the ongoing Second
Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ng noted that according to a work plan of the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the
National People's Congress, China's legislature, a Selection
Committee will be established in Macao in early April for the
election of the first Chief Executive of the SAR in mid or late
May.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Preparatory Committee will choose members
of the Selection Committee in an open, fair, democratic and honest
manner," said Ng. "We also have confidence that the first Chief
Executive elected by the Selection Committee will be a highly-
competent leader with personal integrity."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that at present, a major concern for all
people in Macao is to prompt the Portuguese side to step up
efforts for the early resolution of problems relating to a smooth
transfer of power, so as to ensure Macao's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
"Though new progress has been achieved on several major issues,
such as localization of Macao's civil servants and of local laws
and the official status of the Chinese language, greater efforts
are needed to ensure the smooth transition of Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Macao people sincerely hope that the Portuguese side will
continue to cooperate with the Chinese side in a candid and
friendly manner, and promote satisfactory resolution of all issues
relating to the transfer of power and a smooth transition with a
pragmatic and responsible attitude, he added.
</P>
<P>
He finally called on all Macao residents to actively
participate in and give full support to the preparatory work for
the establishment of the SAR government, and make every effort for
a smooth implementation of the "one country, two systems"
principle in Macao and for the maintenance of Macao's economic
prosperity and social stability.

<P>
HANOI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Cabinet members and government
agency
heads in Vietnam have been asked to strictly adhere to the

<HEADLINE> Draft Amendments to Constitution Submitted to NPC Deliberation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) today submitted draft amendments
to the Constitution to the current Second Session of the Ninth NPC
for examination.
</P>
<P>
The draft proposes to add "Deng Xiaoping Theory" and "governing
the country according to law and building a socialist country
governed according to law" into the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the draft proposes to change the status and
function of the non-public sector such as self-employed and
private businesses in China's economy from being "a complement to
the socialist public economy" to "an important component of the
socialist market economy".
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, a vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, made
explanations to the draft amendments at today's meeting, which was
attended by 2,781 NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
He said that the present Constitution adopted in 1982 is a good
one and has played an important role in the country's political,
economic and social life, and it was revised twice in 1988 and
1993 with the constant development of China's reforms, opening up.
</P>
<P>
The principle for amendments is that "we will only make
amendments that are deemed necessary and relevant conditions are
ripe," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the report of the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and a wide-ranging collection of
the opinions and suggestions among people from all walks of life,
the CPC Central Committee put forward a proposal on revising part
of the Constitution to the NPC Standing Committee on January 22
this year, according to sources of the NPC.

<HEADLINE> Draft Method for Electing Macao Deputies Submitted for NPC Deliberation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR), to be founded after China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao at the end of this year, will have 12
deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's
legislature.
</P>
<P>
This is the stipulation of a draft method for electing Macao
SAR deputies to the Ninth NPC, which was submitted to the ongoing
Second Session of the Ninth NPC for deliberation this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth NPC now already has five Macao deputies, who were
elected to the top legislature by the Provincial People's Congress
of Guangdong. The draft method says that the five will
automatically become Macao SAR deputies after the founding of the
SAR.
</P>
<P>
The other seven deputies should be elected by an election
conference established in the Macao SAR, says the draft.
</P>
<P>
While explaining the draft to the NPC session, He Chunlin,
secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee and an executive
member of the session Presidium, said that according to a method
for electing NPC deputies in various provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities in the interior areas, one NPC deputy should be
elected from about every 220,000 urban residents and from about
every 880,000 rural residents.
</P>
<P>
According to 1997 statistics Macao only had a population of 450,
000 people. However, to enable Macao deputies to form an
independent delegation to the NPC, the draft stipulates that the
number of Macao SAR NPC deputies should be 12, He explained. (

<HEADLINE> Draft Method for Electing Macao Deputies Submitted for NPC Deliberation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The draft also stipulates that the election conference in the
Macao SAR should comprise Chinese citizens from the Selection
Committee for the first Macao SAR government, NPC deputies in the
Macao region who have not entered the Selection Committee, members
of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) who are residents of the Macao SAR
but are not concurrently members of the Selection Committee, and
members of the Macao SAR Legislative Council who are Chinese
citizens.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Selection Committee for the first
Macao SAR government has a broad representation, with members from
all circles of life and all social sectors in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is appropriate to form the election conference
mainly with Chinese citizens from the Selection Committee," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The election procedure stipulated by the draft method is: the
first meeting of the election conference will be called by the NPC
Standing Committee, and the meeting will select nine conference
members to form a presidium, which will preside over the election
conference.

presidium and be reported to the Subcommittee for Examining
Deputies' Qualifications under the NPC Standing Committee.

<HEADLINE> Draft Amendments to Constitution Submitted to NPC Deliberation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee discussed the proposal by the CPC
Central Committee and tabled the draft amendments to the
Constitution to the NPC session for examination according to law,
the sources said..
</P>
<P>
The draft includes six amendments to the Constitution,
according to the vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The first is to add "Deng Xiaoping Theory" into the
Constitution and is, accordingly, to change "in line with the
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics" to "
along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics",
and "China is currently in the primary stage of socialism" will be
revised into "will be over a long period of time in the primary
stage of socialism". The content of "develop a socialist market
economy" will be added into the Constitution, according to Tian.
</P>
<P>
Tian said the amendment shows the guiding role of Deng Xiaoping
Theory in China's socialist modernization drive and reflects the
consensus and the will of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping Theory is the succession and development of Mao
Zedong Thought, a guiding theory for the Chinese people to realize
the socialist modernization through reforms and opening up, and a
new stage of the development of Marxism in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tian stressed that China must hold high the great banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory and use Deng's theory to guide the work in
all fields in the process of reforms, opening up and the
modernization drive, and this is an unshakable conclusion drawn by
the Chinese people of all nationalities from the history and
reality.
</P>
<P>
He said: "To enshrine Deng Xiaoping Theory in the Constitution
is of great immediate and far-reaching historic significance to
the victorious advance of building the cause of socialism with
Chinese characteristics."

<P>
Explaining the addition of governing the country according to
law into the Constitution, Tian said that to govern the country
according to the law is a basic principle for the ruling CPC in
running the country and an important guarantee for the country's
long tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
"Enshrining 'governing the country according to law and
building a socialist country governed according to law' is of
great significance to adhering the basic principle of governing
the country according to law, to constantly improving the
socialist legal system, to developing socialist democratic
politics, and promoting the economic restructuring and
construction," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
The draft suggests to add into the Constitution: "In the
primary stage of socialism, the state upholds the basic economic
system in which the public ownership is dominant and diverse forms
of ownership develop side by side, and upholds the distribution
system with distribution according to work remaining dominant and
a variety of modes of distribution coexisting."
</P>
<P>
Tian explained that the clear definition on the basic economic
and distribution systems in the primary stage of socialism in the
Constitution is conducive to uphold and improve the above-
mentioned systems and further emancipate and develop productive
forces in the reforms, opening up and socialist modernization
drive.
</P>
<P>
According to the guidelines of the 15th CPC National Congress,
the draft adds the stipulation: "The rural collective economic
organizations follow the two-tier operations system that combines
unified and separate operations on the basis of the household
contract operations," and accordingly, abolishes the wording "the
responsibility system mainly based on household contract that
links remuneration to output" in the existing Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Tian said that the two-tier operation system that combines
unified and separate operations is a operation system that
combines the unified collective operations with household contract
operations within the rural collective economic organizations, and
the household contract operations constitute the basis of the two-
tier operation system, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Tian added that enshrining the two-tier operation system into
the Constitution is conducive to ensuring the system to stay long
and unchanged and to be constantly improved and to ensuring the
healthy development of the collective economy in rural areas. (

<P>
Regarding the status and role of the non-public economy, the
draft proposes to add into the Constitution: "Non-public sector
comprising self-employed and private businesses within the domain
stipulated by law is an important component of the country's
socialist market economy," and, accordingly, abolish the wording
that the self-employed and private businesses are "a complement to
the socialist public economy" in the current Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the draft suggests to change other wording of the
same article to "The state protects the legitimate rights and
interests of the self-employed and private businesses, and
exercises guidance, supervision and management over them."
</P>
<P>
Thus, Tian said, the status and role of the non-public economy
in China's socialist market economy are further clearly defined
and this is conducive to its healthy development, Tian explained.
</P>
<P>
The draft suggests to revise the wording of "counter-
revolutionary activities" in Article 28 into "crimes jeopardizing
the state security".
</P>
<P>
Tian said that in 1997's revision of the Criminal Law, "counter-
revolutionary crimes" was revised to "crimes of jeopardizing state
security", and therefore, it is completely necessary to revise the
wording of "counter-revolutionary activities" in the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Non-Performing Loans Expected to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda said Tuesday that non-performing loans (NPL) of
the country's corporate sector would fall from the current 45.9
percent to 30 percent of total lending by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the declining trend of the NPLs was due to the
government's corporate debt restructuring program which had
started to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
"The reform will even be speeded up after 11 key economic
reform bills are passed by the parliament without changes in their
major objectives," Tarrin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
If NPLs decreased, t would boost demand for loans, and
commercial banks, on the other hand, would be more willing to
extend loans to local firms, which would help spur the domestic
economy and strengthen the financial sector, Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
He said loans totaling 716.6 billion baht (19.4 billion U.S.
dollars) were in the process of restructuring talks, up from 690.5
billion baht (18.6 billion dollars) at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Swizerland,
which acts as the central bank of other countries, also reported
that outstanding loans of Asian countries from international banks
had declined.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi said Tuesday that the government was
considering revising the Banking Restructuring Program, another
crucial economic reform program in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"We have to take a serious look to see how measures included in
the program can be improved," he said, adding, "The measures are
sufficient in general, but there may be some problems to do with
the implementation."
</P>
<P>
He did not give other details.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Member Urges Increased Contact Between Hong Kong and Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hu Fa-kuang, chairman of the Ryoden Electric Engineering
Holdings Ltd. who also chairs the Liberal Democratic Federation of
Hong Kong, said at a CPPCC National Committee full-member meeting
this afternoon that increasing cooperation between Hong Kong and
the interior areas is crucial to Hong Kong's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"But extended cooperation should be based on more frequent
contacts between officials of interior areas and their Hong Kong
counterparts, especially at higher levels so as to enhance mutual
understanding," Hu said, adding that more mainland officials
should visit Hong Kong to enhance their understanding of the place
and explore cooperative opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the central government allow Hong Kong business
people to invest in such sectors as telecommunications, power
generation, agriculture, retail sale and service trade. Meanwhile,
the interior areas can make use of Hong Kong's expertise in
marketing and sales promotion to help their export business.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's efforts to develop hi-tech industries need lots of
talented people. Hu suggested an exchange system be put in place
to swap university students or graduate students between Hong Kong
and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province and the Hong Kong SAR government should
establish a liaison for coordinating efforts and achieving highest
possible economic returns in joint venture projects in land
utilization, environmental protection, waste water discharge and
transport network, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed concern over the housing reform in interior areas,
pointing out that difficulties the reform has encountered and
sluggish sales of commercial housing in the mainland result
largely from inadequate laws and regulations governing the
property market, in addition to weak residents' buying power.
</P>
<P>
He said mainland officials in charge of housing reform and real
estate developers should learn from Hong Kong's experience to
improve relevant policies in the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Women Demand Service in Army, Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese women have called on the
government to give them opportunities to play a role in army and
cabinet, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I entrust you with a message to President Emile
Lahoud: Lebanese women are asking to be included among the
conscripts for military service," said Judge Alice Aam at a
ceremony marking the International Women's Day, during which
Health Minister Karam Karam was present on behalf of the president.
</P>
<P>
Men will ultimately gain from such a move because it will
"minimize the duration of their military service," she added.
</P>
<P>
She called for an across-board abolition of discrimination
against women in laws relating to Lebanon's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Hayan Haidar, head of the local Family Planning Organization,
said he was disappointed at the lack of female representation in
the cabinet, contrary to expectations when Lahoud came to power
last November.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that women can make up for their lack of
representation in government by increasing their presence in other
bodies, such as the Social Economic Council which is soon to be
formed.
</P>
<P>
In Lebanese previous cabinets, there was no single woman
minister. In the 128-seat Parliament, there are currently only
three female deputies.

<HEADLINE> Western Envoy Reiterates Decision to Sack Serb President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- High ranking representative of
the Peace Implementation Council (of Bosnia) Carlos Westendorp
said on Monday evening that he could not accept Serb Parliament's
rejection to his decision to sack Nikola Poplasen as president of
the Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Westendorp, a Spanish diplomat, reaffirmed that Poplasen
should no longer officiate as president of the Serb Republic, the
Yugoslav Tanjug news agency quoted Serb radio and TV as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to Serb representatives to accept the decision
of Roberts Owen, head of the arbitration tribunal and American
arbitrator, on setting up a neutral district in the Bosnian town
of Brcko and put it under international supervision.
</P>
<P>
The parliament passed a resolution on Sunday to reject the
decisions of Carlos Westendorp and Roberts Owen, both announced on
March 5, saying they violated related articles in the Dayton Peace
Accord.
</P>
<P>
Under the rule of the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace agreement that
ended the 1992-95 war, Brcko, a city with 90,000 population, is a
Serb entity. But the Muslim-Croat federation claimed its control
over the city which serves as a key port on the Sava river.

<HEADLINE> "Independence of Tibet": Outcome of Foreign Aggression (9) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From then on, the 13th Dalai Lama gradually learned the truth
and began to strengthen contacts with the central government.
</P>
<P>
In 1933, the 13th Dalai Lama passed away and the central
government sent Huang Musong to Tibet to confer titles of nobility,
hold memorial ceremonies for the 13th Dalai Lama and help
establish the Tibet office of the central government in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
After that, Wu Zhongxin, head of the Mongolia-Tibet Commission
went all the way to Tibet for presiding over the celebrations for
the appointment of the 14th Dalai Lama. The move further promoted
relations between the central government and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Raiqen, living Buddha and regent, was elected as a
member of the central executive commission of the Kuomintang's
central committee.
</P>
<P>
All these triggered hatred from Britain and the pro-British
forces who managed to take over power from Raiqen by plots and
then they persecuted Raiqen to death later.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, fearing that the Chinese government would take
measures to reinforce sovereign administration over Tibet after
the second World War, the British authorities in April 1943 tried
to implement the policy of "giving up the recognition of China's
suzerainty over Tibet" and creating the independence of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
This was similar to 1912 when the British and Indian
governments termed Tibet as a protectorate of Britain in the name
of "abolishing China's suzerainty" according to the Memorandum
Respecting the Situation in the Countries Bordering on the North-
Eastern Frontier of India.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urged to Help Region Out of Economic Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan, with its regional and
global economic presence and strong profile, has a measure of
responsibility in assisting the region out of its current economic
 turmoil, a Malaysian official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said the
public-private sector partnership approach that Japan has taken to
reach out to the regional economies can have a positive impact on
the region's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 21st annual meeting of Malaysia-Japan Economic
Associations here, Rafidah said Japanese investors should make
their own objective evaluation of Malaysia through a first-hand
feel of what the country is all about.
</P>
<P>
She said Japanese investors' confidence in Malaysia needs not
be determined by subjective analysis done by others on the
country's situation.
</P>
<P>
"The experiences of Japanese companies already operating in
Malaysia can serve as valuable reference," she said, adding that
the Japanese experience in Malaysia has undoubtedly been a good
one with its track record showing success.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a total of 128 projects with Japanese equity in the
manufacturing sector were approved with capital investments of 1.9
billion ringgit (500 million U.S. dollars), of which 600 million
ringgit (157.89 million dollars) was pumped into 31 new projects
and 1.3 billion ringgit (342.11 million dollars) into expansion
and diversification.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investments in these projects accounted for 14.5
percent of total foreign investments in the manufacturing sector
in 1998 which stood at 13.1 billion ringgit (3.45 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Rafidah, 20 Japanese companies are currently
establishing their international procurement centers in Malaysia,
36 have set up representative offices, six have regional offices
and five have their operational headquarters here.

<HEADLINE> "Independence of Tibet": Outcome of Foreign Aggression (10) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The British Foreign Office, in a report called "Issues of Tibet
and China's Suzerainty", believed that maintaining its recognition
of China's suzerainty over Tibet might "hinder our freedom of
directly signing agreements with Tibet".
</P>
<P>
The British authorities, after consultation between their
Foreign Office and the Indian Office, did not dare to allow even
the "independence" of Tibet in name, fearing that the act would
give rise to the central government sending troops to Tibet. In
this case, the Tibetans could not resist while the British
authorities could not directly support the "independence of Tibet".
</P>
<P>
Despite the facts, British foreign secretary Anthony Eden
insisted in letter on calling Tibet a complete autononous region
in fact and opposing China's "attempt to retake control of Tibet".
The British authorities tried to persuade the Chinese government
to hold a conference similar to the Simla Conference and agree to
their "legal" division of Tibet through agreements. The Chinese
government did not consider at all the absurd requests and the
British authorities' attempts failed.
</P>
<P>
After that, Britain and the pro-British forces of Tibet's upper
class launched various splittist activities but failed to achieve
their premeditated targets.
</P>
<P>
In a word, in the past 100 years, the British authorities have
tried in various ways to invade Tibet, especially fostered pro-
British forces of the upper class in Tibet, in an effort to split
Tibet.

<HEADLINE> "Independence of Tibet": Outcome of Foreign Aggression (11) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
II. "Independence of Tibet" is a pawn on the chessboard of the
imperialist cold war policy.
</P>
<P>
Since the ending of the Second World War, great changes have
taken place in the political structure of the world, with the U.S.
rising to be the strongest capitalist country. During the period
between the end of the war and the middle of the 1970s, the U.S.
government, in its pursuit of a "cold war" policy, inherited the
mantle of the British Empire and spared no efforts in supporting
the Tibetan separatists in their activities aimed at the
independence of Tibet, in attempting to subvert, dismember and
weaken the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
As early as the end of 1942 when the Chinese people were
fighting a bloody war against the Japanese aggressors, U.S
intelligence departments had considered Tibet as a strategic
measure. Capt. Ilia Tolstoy and Lieut. Brooke Dolan were sent to
Tibet carrying gifts from President Roosevelt to the Dalai Lama,
ostensibly to investigate the possibility of building a highway to
transfer materials for the war against Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
Tolstoy also incited the local Tibetan authorities to think
about participating in the post-war peace conference, claiming
that the U.S. government fully sympathized with the small and weak
countries that hope to maintain their independence. The Chinese
Foreign Ministry lodged a protest with the U.S.State Department
following the two men's promise that the U.S. government would
support Tibet's independence from China.
</P>
<P>
Soon afterwards, the intelligence departments presented three
radio transmitters to the local Tibetan government to rope in the
latter in the scheme, and from that point the U.S. government
began to encourage Tibet to seek independence in the hope of
turning it into an anti-Communist base in the future.
</P>
<P>
After the Second World War, the Soviet and East European
socialist block were in direct confrontation with the U.S.-led
capitalist block. Against this political backdrop, China's civil
war was drawing to an end and the Communist Party of China (CPC)
was on the verge of liberating the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the U.S. State Department began to
discuss policies that the U.S. government could adopt in regards
to Tibet. Some argued that Tibet is of great significance
ideologically and strategically and if the CPC won the civil war,
the U.S. should not continue to regard Tibet as China's territory.
They proposed to send U.S. officials to Lhasa immediately to
establish secret relations in advance.

<P>
The State Department concluded that in light of the friendly
relations between the U.S. and the Chiang Kai-shek administration,
the U.S. would not publicize its attitude for changing China's
sovereignty over Tibet at that particular time, but it added that
in case China fell into Communist hands, it would be more
beneficial to the U.S. to recognize Tibet's independence than to
regard it as part of China ruled by the CPC. One way of supporting
Tibet's independence was to formally raise the issue at the U.N.
General Assembly, it suggested.
</P>
<P>
In 1949, the landslide victory of the people's revolution led by
the CPC threw Tibet's high-level separatists into chaos. On the
one hand, they expelled officials of the Kuomintang government
from Tibet and prepared for war; and on the other, they sought
help from the U.S. and U.K. by sending telegraphs and a delegation,
which was stopped in India.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government also eagerly looked forward to giving a
helping hand to Tibet. When Lowell Thomas, a U.S. reporter and
writer, and his son got to Tibet, they appealed to the U.S.to
provide anti-Communist support and to send a delegation to Lhasa,
which had a great propaganda effect.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government's plan to send a delegation to Tibet and
provide material aid was dropped for fear of being blocked by the
Indian government.
</P>
<P>
In June 1950, when the Korean War broke out, the U.S. was
determined to turn Tibet into a link of its chain for an oriental
strategic encirclement under the banner of worldwide anti-
Communist activists.
</P>
<P>
On June 13, the U.S. State Department sent a statement to
Britain's ambassador to the U.S., saying that it would probably
take action to encourage and support Tibet's ambitions to cast off
China's rule.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) advanced rapidly
toward Tibet and liberated Qamdo, which forced the local Tibetan
authorities to send a delegation to Beijing headed by Ngapoi
Ngawang Jime to negotiate peace.
</P>
<P>
On May 23, 1951, the historical 17-article agreement for the
peaceful liberation of Tibet was signed, which completely foiled
the scheme by U.S. and Tibetan separatists to obstruct the PLA's
plans for liberating Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Somalia Accuses Ethiopian Forces of Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A massive looting operation of
private properties by Ethiopian forces has been reported in the
Somali border town of Balanballe controlled by the Somali National
Front (SNF) faction of Marehan clan.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the central region of Galgudud indicated that
hundreds of heavily armed infantry Ethiopians crossed into
Balanballe Sunday night. They were supported by about a dozen of
armed personnel carriers and had entered into the town a little
after midnight. The Ethiopian soldiers did not fire a single shot
during their alleged "invasion", but had immediately started
searching houses, chemists and food stores.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian soldiers have taken away two VHF radios, quite a
few guns, car-batteries and all of the medicine in the only
chemist shop of the town.
</P>
<P>
One of the elders of the town who preferred to be anonymous
contacted reporters in Mogadishu through the VHF radio, said the
officials of the invading Ethiopian troops admitted they were
merely after what they called the fundamentalists group of
Al-Itihad Al-Islam whom they fought in Gedo region, southern
Somalia, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians said they had some traces of Al-Itihad men in the
town which is the sole motive of their crossing-over, a usual
pretext of the Ethiopian invasions into Somalia which lacks a
central government since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The elder said the Ethiopian forces, many of whom had retreated
back to their barracks across the border Monday evening, did not
kill anyone, but took a man with them while two other men are
still missing. The man they took is called Mohamed Fayoko Ali
Dharar who was very well known in the town for his seriousness,
but not very much of a religious figure.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources said some well known businessmen and
religious scholars have already fled the town before dawn Tuesday
morning, before the Ethiopians would again start killing or
arresting any man growing beards. Growing beards by men is
recommended by Islam according to the narration from Prophet
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Jama Howleh, the SNFspokesman here in Mogadishu, also confirmed
the invasion and condemned the act which he characterized as
provocative. He said the Ethiopians still remain in full
deployment of their forces along the border with Somalia, while
controlling the two towns of Bulo Hawo and Dolow-Somalia of Gedo
region, an act which is contrary to the international regulations
regarding the territorial integrity of a nation and its
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> AIDS to Cut Kenya's GDP by 14.5 PC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- AIDS is expected to reduce Kenya's
gross domestic product (GDP) by 14.5 percent by the year 2005,
according to a latest analysis released by the Ministry of
Planning and National Development of Kenya available hereTuesday.
</P>
<P>
The analysis, compiled by the Long Rang Planning Division of
the ministry, said the cost of treatment for AIDS patients in 2000
will equal the entire 1993/1994 recurrent budget of the Ministry
of Health.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the ministry showed that one in seven workers
in Kenya is HIV-positive and this figure would increase to a four
to one ratio, the Eastern African Standard newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"One in every three deaths in Kenya's sugar sector is currently
caused by AIDS. As a result sugar firms are losing highly
skilled workers," Director of Planning Kang'ethe Gitu in the
ministry said last week.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the ministry predicted that as AIDS related diseases
and deaths take their toll, small scale farming will decline
sharply due to lack of laborers.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, some 1.5
million Kenyans are HIV-positive. One out of nine persons is
infected with the killer virus among the age group between 15 to
49.

<HEADLINE> "Independence of Tibet": Outcome of Foreign Aggression (13) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, some Western countries
headed by the United States of America continued to provide
powerful support and aid to the Tibetan separatists. A political
instructor told Tibetan trainees at a camp in Colorado that China
was very powerful and was imposing threats on the free world;
however China was not yet rich but if one day it became rich, the
threat would grow bigger. He said the strategy was to cut it apart
when it's still impoverished. First the aim was to cut away Tibet,
then Xinjiang, then Inner Mongolia and lastly, Manchuria, leaving
a plot of land for the Han Chinese. Only thus was it possible to
make China weak and unable to threaten the free world, he said. He
told the Tibetan trainees that they must shoulder the important
task of splitting Tibet from China and that was the reason that
they were there to receive training."
</P>
<P>
Since 1951, The U.S. has supported the "Independence of Tibet"
activities of the Tibetan separatists in the following areas:
</P>
<P>
1. The CIA continued to have contacts and negotiations with the
Tibetan separatist force on ways and forms of support. The Dalai
Lama's brothers Gyalo Toinzhub and Tubdain Thubten maintained
particularly close contacts with CIA. The U.S. has on many
occasions encouraged the Dalai Lama to overthrow the 17-article
agreement signed between the local Tibetan government and the
Central People's Government on peaceful liberation of Tibet,
directed him to submit petitions for American aid to "confront the
Chinese Communist Government, to facilitate the American
government's "legal" and open support of the Tibetan separatists.
In addition, they also planned and arranged the Dalai Lama's
flight from China.
</P>
<P>
2. Since 1956, the CIA trained many Tibetan separatists in its
training camps in Saipan, Colorado and some other places. The camp
in Colorado alone trained 170 spies. They were sent back to the
Tibetan habitats in Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunan provinces and Tibet to
engage in rebellion and other destructive activities.
</P>
<P>
The Eisenhower Administration first gave approval in September
1958 to supply arms, ammunition, grain and other supplies to the
Tibetan separatists. Since the end of 1958, the CIA air-dropped a
great amount of equipment including guns, heavy machine guns and
mortars at the Tibetan separatists' camps.

<TEXT>
<P>
3. The CIA made a meticulous plan and provided guns for the
massive armed rebellion by the Tibetan aristocrats on March 10,
1959. Spies trained by CIA accompanied the Dalai Lama in his
flight to India. On May 20, 1959, the confidential "303 Commission
" of the US government approved the first batch of aid to the
Dalai Lama, who had just arrived in India.
</P>
<P>
4. Following the rebellion failed in March 1959, the U.S. led
some other countries at a United Nations congress in submitting a
draft on the so-called "Tibet Issue", attacking China's crushing
of the rebellion. They managed to list the "Tibet Issue" on the UN'
s agenda three times in 1960, 1961 and 1965 and had their anti-
China drafts approved in 1961 and 1965.
</P>
<P>
5. After the rebellion failed in March 1959, the CIA gathered 2,
100 rebels and stationed them at a place in Nepal adjacent to
Tibet. The number of rebels at that base later increased to 15,000.
They survived on funding covered by the US government which
included the supply of arms and equipment. They frequently sneaked
into Tibet and engaged in destructive activities for as along as
eight years.
</P>
<P>
6. According to the latest decoded American confidential
documents, for most of the 1960s, the CIA provided the Dalai Group
1.7 million U.S. dollars every year to help it carry out anti-
China activities. The funding includes 180,000 US dollars in
annual personal subsidies for the Dalai Lama. After 1968, the CIA
reduced the funding to 1.2 million US dollars and closed the
training camp in Colorado.

<HEADLINE> EU Provides $90M for Projects in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will spend
approximately 75 million euros (about 90 million U.S. dollars)
this year in implementing various projects in Zambia, Times of
Zambia newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The projects are part of a vast on-going eighth European
Development Fund (EDF) five-year program which has a potential

The United States terminated its financial, arms and other
material aid to the separatists aiming at the independence of
Tibet after Nixon's visit to China in 1972 and the establishment
of the China-U.S. diplomatic relations in 1976.
</P>
<P>
As China's international status rose and the U.S. tried to
readjust its relations with China in an effort to achieve world
hegemony against the Soviet Union, support from major western
countries to the Tibetan separatists was contained to a large
extent from mid 1970s through early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
III. "Independence of Tibet" is a card in the hands of anti-
China international forces to separate China
</P>
<P>
After the ending of the Cold War period, the involvement of the
international forces in the independence of Tibet movement entered
into the third stage.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid 1980s, a group of younger generation of
separatists of the "Tibetan Youth Conference" have taken major
positions in the "government in exile." the western educated
separtatists have made attempts to seek foreign support,
internationalize the Tibetan issue and stir up riots in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai group held a high-level meeting in April 1987, and
drew up lesson from its previous unsuccessul "independence of
Tibet" activities. They also set up plans to organize
demonstrations and riots in Lhasa and other places.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai group has also sent its members in the name of
various organizations to lobby foreign government leaders,
parlament members and officials of non-government insitutions for
the independence of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
These people have distorted history, denied the sovereignty of
the China's central government over Tibet, and claimed that Tibet
was an independent country. They have also attacked the Chinese
central government over its policies of Tibet under the disguise
of the human rights.
</P>
<P>
The international anti-China forces regarded the independence
of Tibet activities as an excellent card in their accusation of
China and have renewed their opposition against China using "
independence of Tibet" as a breakthrough.

<HEADLINE> Govt of National Unity in Zimbabwe Ruled Out: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean ruling party's secretary
for legal affairs Eddison Zvobgo has ruled out the possibility of
the formation of a government of national unity as demanded by
opposition political parties, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zvobgo told journalists attending a media and the constitution
workshop Monday in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city,
that opposition parties under the National Convention for Change
(NCC) were advocating for transitional government which would be
responsible for drafting a people's oriented constitution.
</P>
<P>
"These opposition parties are trying to get in government
through the backdoor without winning elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion to form a national unity government is rejected
outright and there is no negotiation on that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zvobgo, who is also Minister Without Portfolio, said a national
unity government was only possible when people had gone to war and
there was no outright winner.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the opposition parties had never participated
in elections, yet they wanted to use the drafting of a new
constitution as a method of getting into power.
</P>
<P>
"No one from any opposition party will get into government
without winning elections," said Zvobgo.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the international anti-China forces have been
using the support of the Dalai group's "independence of Tibet" and
"high degree of self-autonomy" as a pretext to stage the following
activities against China:
</P>
<P>
1. After several large-scale riots in Lhasa, instigated by the
Dalai Lama group, and the "Beijing Incident", the West conferred
the Nobel Peace Prize on the Dalai Lama in 1989, aiming to reward
and encourage him for his decades-long efforts to split China as
well as to raise his political status. With the title of a Nobel
Peace Prize laureate", the Dalai Lama was able to carry out his
activities and deceive the international community more easily.
</P>
<P>
2. Some western countries invited the Dalai Lama for visits one
after another. And some high-ranking government officials received
him and other heads of his "government-in-exile" formally and
informally. Since 1989, the Dalai Lama has visited, by invitation,
more than 50 countries and regions in Europe, the Americas, Asia
and Australia, some of which he has been to many times, and or
once a year. Heads of state, prime ministers and other important
government officials from scores of nations have met or held talks
with the Dalai Lama, some of whom even went so far as to make
statements, declarations or appeals either to pep up the Dalai
Lama or put pressure on the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
3. Anti-China forces across the world have been seeking the
support of parliaments to prop up the Dalai group. Western
countries, however, have established diplomatic relations with
China, so their governments would not deny China's sovereignty
over Tibet and yet overtly support Tibet's independence. They
choose to take low profiles while letting their parliaments take
the lead.
</P>
<P>
With the Dalai group staging worldwide propaganda, the U.S.
House of Representatives was the first to adopt a bill in June
1987 on the "Tibet issue" to support the Dalai group. Later in
September, the House invited the Dalai Lama to visit the United
States, where he made speeches and put forward the so-called "five-
point peaceful proposals". And soon after, some anti-China
Congressmen raised the "amendment to human rights issues in Tibet".
In 1991, the House passed a motion recognizing that the Dalai Lama
and his "government-in-exile" were the "genuine representative" of
the Tibetan people and claiming that Tibet was an "occupied
country". In September 1993, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee also made a proposal calling for the setting up of an
office of the United States Information Agency in Tibet, in an
attempt to establish relations of a diplomatic nature with the
Dalai "government-in-exile". In recent years, parliaments of
various countries have drawn up dozens of bills or resolutions on
the so-called "Tibet issue".

<P>
4. The United Nations has been used as an arena for the anti-
China activities focused on the "Tibet issue". In August 1989, the
West raised a motion to review the "human rights issues in Tibet"
at the U.N. group session on preventing discrimination and
protecting minority ethnic groups. And at the 46th session of the
U.N. Human Rights Commission in 1990, Western countries cooked up
some draft resolutions including "human rights in Tibet", in a
move to have them listed on the session's agenda. In 1991, some
Western countries again raised the "Tibet issue" and had the anti-
China resolution on the Tibet situation passed at the group
session, "appealing" to the Chinese government to fully respect
the "basic human rights and freedom of the Tibetan people". In
1992, the countries once again put forward a proposal on the "
Chinese Tibet situation" at the session of the U.N. Human Rights
Commission. On similar occasions in the following years, some
countries repeatedly raised the motion on so-called "human rights
in Tibet", but they failed to have them passed due to opposition
from most member states.
</P>
<P>
5. Anti-China forces in the world have been making use of the
semi-official, non-governmental organizations to summon support in
the name of "mass organizations". They have written letters to the
sessions of the U.N. Human Rights Commission", organized
receptions, public lectures, demonstrations, and sits-in, given
out leaflets and lobbied government officials or pushed them to
show concern about and support to the "Tibet issue". They also
made speeches at many international organizations, distorting and
attacking China's policies on Tibet. In addition, they financed to
the tune of millions of U.S. dollars a number of movies including
"Kundun" and "Seven Years in Tibet" to enhance the Dalai Lama and
the Nazis and vilify China. They showed the anti-China films in
Europe and America to deceive the world. They even sponsored some
"benefit performances in support of Tibet" and "Tibet freedom
concerts" by inviting a number of stars to perform in such cities
as Paris, to extensively whip up public opinion.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Party Forms Political Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's biggest opposition
Labor Party signed an agreement with the Meimad party in Tel Aviv
Monday night to join forces in contesting the May 17 elections,
local media reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the Labor has fulfilled its task of forming a
political alliance with Gesher led by former foreign minister
David Levy and the moderate religious movement Meimad before the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, which had already been approved by Labor
Central Committee last week, Meimad will be given one cabinet post
and three slots in the top 40 of the Knesset (parliament) under
an umbrella list called One Israel led by Labor leader Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
After signing the agreement, Barak praised his new Meimad
partners for giving his One Israel the Jewish, religious and
democratic support it needs to survive.
</P>
<P>
By merging with Meimad, Labor and Gesher have built a
broad-based, populist and democratic community that will properly
serve the occasion, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Gesher approved the union with Labor and Meimad on Sunday
and signed the unity agreement with Labor the same day.
</P>
<P>
Levy got the No. 3 slot on the alliance's list for the next
Knesset just behind Barak and former prime minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Third Way party, one of the coalition partners
of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, unanimously
approved Monday night Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani to
continue to serve as party leader.
</P>
<P>
The decision was seen as a foregone conclusion as Kahalani was
the only candidate for the post and the party is expected to
choose its Knesset list next week.
</P>
<P>
Talks among Israel's right-wing parties aimed at forging a
united nationalist bloc to contest in the May elections were also
under way.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Herut, Tekuma and Moledet parties met Monday
night in Tel Aviv again to try to close a deal.
</P>
<P>
Their joint platform, mostly focused on objecting to the peace
process with Palestinians, is nearly finished.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Taiwan's TMD Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao reiterated here today that China firmly opposed the
attempt to include Taiwan in the Theater Missile Defense (TMD)
system developed by the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question at a press conference, Zhu said that the
so-called claim that China deployed missiles along the southeast
coast aimed at Taiwan is the excuse some sides used when they
sought to proliferate or introduce TMD into Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The effort to incorporate Taiwan into TMD demonstrated the
ulterior motive of some people to obstruct the great cause of
China's reunification, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some people inside the Taiwan authorities are also speeding up
their efforts to squeeze into the TMD system, Zhu said, adding
that such activities are aimed at seeking protection from foreign
forces, stalling the reunification and splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"All these attempts are what we firmly oppose," he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Expressways To Exceed 10,000 KM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China will lift its total mileage
of expressways to more than 10,000 kilometers before the end of
next year, according to a senior transportation official who is
here attending the ongoing annual session of the National People's
Congress, China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Communications Li Juchang said construction
of expressways linking Beijing and Shanghai, Beijing and Shenyang
in the northeast and several others in eastern and southwestern
China is in full swing. Sections of the expressways are expected
to be completed and opened to traffic by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
During the 1999-2000 period, he said, China will build an
additional 3,750 km of expressways.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 285 major highways are under construction, with a
combined length of more than 27,000 kilometers, of which 12,600 km
are expressways, Li said, adding that total cost for these highway
and expressway projects will amount to more than 500 billion yuan
(about 62.5 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The proactive financial policy that has been implemented since
early last year to stimulate domestic demand has served as a shot
to the arm for road construction. Last year alone, investment in
the sector reached 218.8 billion yuan, a sharp rise over the
budgeted figure of 120 billion yuan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hefty funding last year added about 37,000 kilometers to the
country's total highway mileage and helped eased transportation
bottlenecks, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Myanmar to Crack Down on Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Thailand have agreed
to jointly crack down on narcotics trafficking and production
wherever the location, Thai government spokesman Akapol
Sorasuchart said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Akapol said Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and his visiting
Myanmar counterpart, Gen. Than Shwe, announced a long-term joint
drug suppression plan during talks in Chiang Rai, northern
Thailand, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the two neighboring countries would set up a
joint committee, which would comprise senior officials from
anti-narcotic agencies of both sides to hold regular talks aimed
at exchanging views and laying out concrete programs on joint drug
suppression.
</P>
<P>
Chuan also raised a proposal that Bangkok and Rangoon cooperate
in the short term as well to end narcotic production along the
border, especially amphetamine factories, Akapol disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Than Shwe as saying Myanmar would imitate Thailand's
projects initiated by King Bhumibol Adulyadej to replace opium
cultivation with cash crops.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand, as requested by the Myanmar leader, agreed to
help Myanmar by sending narcotic experts to Rangoon soon to
transfer knowledge on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Turning to disputes over border and territorial waters, Akapol
said the two sides agreed to discuss a joint patrol in the Andaman
Sea at the upcoming meeting of the Regional Border Committee of
the two countries and to hold talks more regularly to exchange
information and lay out plans aimed at effectively solving the
problems.
</P>
<P>
The disputes led to recent clashes between the naval forces of
the two countries resulting in deaths on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Akapol said Chuan also accepted Gen. Than Shwe's invitation to
visit Rangoon, but no date had been set. The Myanmar leader was
granted an audience by King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Than Shwe will return home Tuesday, ending a two-day
official visit to Thailand.

<HEADLINE> "Independence of Tibet": Outcome of Foreign Aggression (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To compete with the Tsarist Russia, Britain started to achieve
its goal of invading Tibet with armed forces in the 1880s. Using
the excuse of trading negotiations by Macaulay, a financial
secretary of Bengal province of the Indian government, Britain
launched the first large-scale war invading Tibet in 1888.
</P>
<P>
The corrupt Qing Dynasty government was compelled to sign two
treaties which resulted in national betrayal and humiliation which
enabled Britain to seize enormous benefits politically,
economically and in territorial terms.
</P>
<P>
Ambitious George N. Curzon, appointed to be the Indian governor
in the early 20th century, immediately carried out principles of
striving for supremacy in central Asia against Tsarist Russia, and
turning China's Tibet into a "buffer state" through the use of
force, and in reality a dependency of Britain.
</P>
<P>
Curzon, in a bid to change Tibet's political status in China's
territory and remove China's sovereignty over Tibet, distorted "
sovereignty" into "suzerainty." He further depreciated "suzerainty
" into a political fabrication and affectation.
</P>
<P>
Curzon even proposed that Britain directly make contact with
Tibet without reporting to the Chinese government in an attempt to
split Tibet from China.
</P>
<P>
Britain launched its second large-scale war of aggression in
Tibet in 1903-1904 after its plots were severely resisted and
forced the Tibetan local government to sign an illegal treaty
known as the "Lhasa Convention."
</P>
<P>
The British army's slaughter of Tibetans resulted in brave
resistance among the Tibetan army and people as well as bringing
stern condemnation from various provinces. The Tsarist Russia also
lodged a protest for the purpose of safeguarding its own
imperialist interests.
</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration preparations for a war against
Germany and trade with China, Britain again changed its plans for
invading Tibet by roping in elements from the upper echelons of
Tibetan society.

<HEADLINE> "Independence of Tibet": Outcome of Foreign Aggression (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expert in Tibetan
studies has published a signed article to criticize overseas anti-
China forces and the Dalai Lama clique which advocate the "
independence of Tibet" in an attempt to split China.
</P>
<P>
The author, Feng Shiwen, points out that the so-called "Tibetan
independence" is in fact an outcome of foreign aggressions and has
been utilized by imperialists to split China over the past two
centuries.
</P>
<P>
It took three periods for imperialists and the international
anti-China forces to split China by advocating "Tibetan
independence", the author says. The article continues:
</P>
<P>
I. "Independence of Tibet" is an outcome of imperialistic
countries' attempt to turn Tibet into their dependency.
</P>
<P>
The issue of "Tibetan independence" was initially created by
Britain which had plotted to turn Tibet into one of its
dependencies since the late 18th century.
</P>
<P>
In order to separate Tibet from China, Britain had tried out
different ways, such as occupying the territory after establishing
trade relations, instigating the pro-Britain upper class elements
of Tibet, and launching wars of aggression.
</P>
<P>
The East India Company of Britain committed the first
aggression against China's Tibet in the late 18th century after it
annexed the territories of Bangladesh. Similar to its actions in
India, the company planned to establish trade relations with
locals at first, then stir up disputes and occupy the territory
with armed forces.
</P>
<P>
In 1774 and 1783, the company respectively sent its employees G.
Bogle and S. Turner to Xigaze with the aim of winning over the
Sixth Panchen Lama and other senior officials in an attempt to sow
dissension between Tibet and the central government of the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
However, the Panchen Lama refused to be an ally of Britain. The
Qing government also prohibited British businessmen from going to
Lhasa and interior areas via Tibet, and later promulgated the
Authorized Regulations for the Better Government of Tibet in order
to tighten control over foreign affairs there.
</P>
<P>
Then, Britain launched a series of wars against Tibet's
neighbors Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan in the half a century period
between 1814-1864, and forced them to be its dependencies, and
also the base for invading Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tsarist Russia intensified its activities of
aggression against Tibet by sending spies and so-called "
geographical exploration teams" into the area.

<HEADLINE> "Independence of Tibet": Outcome of Foreign Aggression (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In late 1905 and early 1906, the British Indian government, its
executive official to Sikkim J.C. White, and business agent to
Gyaze Captain O'Connor plotted to lure the Ninth Panchen Lama to
India for a meeting with a British prince. The attempt was aimed
at controlling Tibet through the Panchen instead of Dalai.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor saw this plot as a means of consolidating his
friendship with the Panchen Lama, and even to subsidize and
protect him if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Captain clearly pointed out that this action was to
counteract possible measures to be taken by Chinese government in
order to re-establish its authority in Tibet. That is to say, the
action was for resisting and rejecting China's sovereignty over
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
To make use of the extremely high prestige that the Panchen
Lama enjoyed among the Tibetans, O'Connor said that the Panchen's
activities in Tibet would arouse great excitement and adoration,
just like Christ appearing among Europeans.
</P>
<P>
He wrote to White that Britain had in its grasp the most
valuable card. It should make use of the opportunity to impress
the Panchen with Britain's generosity and power. Britain would
then win the Panchen's friendship and trust at a very small cost
so as to complete the "cause" of action that would otherwise cost
millions of pounds, involve battles, the signing of treaties and
stationing of armed troops in the region.
</P>
<P>
There is no other evidence that can so clearly explain that the
"cause" of the British government was to invade and split Tibet,
and why the British government would like to rope in the Panchen
Lama to achieve their aims.
</P>
<P>
A plan mapped out by the British-Indian government saw the
first step as opening a business agency and station an armed
escort in Xigaze in an attempt to prevent the Lhasa government or
the Chinese government, which had a grudge against the Panchen, to
take any measures. The business agency would be generally regarded
by the people as a security guard for the Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
It was very obvious that Britain tried first of all to bring
rear Tibet into its sphere of influence so as to reject China's
sovereignty there.
</P>
<P>
However, owing to a warning that the Chinese government made to
the British government, the Panchen Lama made his Indian trip and
refused to kneel in front of the British prince and thus refused
to yield to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Also due to the rapid development of Britain's preparation for
a war against Germany, the British government finally had to give
up its plot of splitting China's Tibet by drawing the Panchen Lama
onto its side.

<HEADLINE> Manila Mulls Over Legal Action Against Australian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada said
Tuesday that his government is considering legal action against an
Australian investigator for taking the government on a wild goose
chase after the alleged ill-gotten wealth of the late President
Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here, Estrada said he has instructed Magdangal
Elma, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government
(PCGG), to study what actions to take against Reiner Jacobi.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Jacobi claimed to have documents showing
that Irene Marcos Araneta, the youngest daughter of the late
president, maintained a 13.2 billion U.S. dollar account in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Jacobi also accused the PCGG of allegedly obstructing efforts
to recover the amount.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada said a discussion Monday night with Elma showed
that Jacobi's claim had no factual basis.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence, it's all a bum steer. It merely muddled
up efforts to recover the Marcos wealth because it raised false
hopes among the people," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview Tuesday morning, Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora said the government is eyeing the prosecution of
Jacobi, especially if he continues with his "fantastic" claims.
</P>
<P>
Jacobi should be charged for his attempts to take the
government for a ride, Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also said Jacobi was the one who led the government on
an earlier wild goose chase when he claimed there was a 3,000-ton
gold hoard belonging to the Marcoses near the Kloten Airport in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Government teams and representatives from the Swiss government
rushed to the site but found nothing, he said.

<HEADLINE> "Independence of Tibet": Outcome of Foreign Aggression (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Revolution of 1911 founded the Republic of China. Britain
took advantage of chaos in China's domestic political situation
during this period when the country had no time to attend to the
matters in Tibet, and made a set of new policies in order to
control Tibet and split it from China.
</P>
<P>
The new policies mainly included firstly changing the political
status of Tibet, namely, to separate Tibet from China and,
secondly annexing a large territory in the southeastern region of
Tibet bordering India.
</P>
<P>
The Memorandum Respecting the Situation in the Countries
bordering on India's North-Eastern Frontier of the India Office of
the British government altered China's sovereignty over Tibet into
a suzerainty.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum specified clearly that Tibet retained in name
its autonomy under China's suzerainty, but in fact was dependent
on the government of India absolutely. And an organization
repelling both China and Russia must be instituted.
</P>
<P>
That attempt to totally reject the jurisdiction of China's
sovereignty over Tibet, put Tibet under the complete control of
Britain and changed Tibet into a dependency of Britain.
</P>
<P>
The document further explained that the status of Tibet should
be equivalent to that of Nepal and Bhutan. The two countries were
turned into dependencies of Britain after several large-scale
wars of aggression Britain had waged against them and the signing
of unequal treaties it subsequently signed with them at that time.

<HEADLINE> "Independence of Tibet": Outcome of Foreign Aggression (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The document expounded British strategy without any reservation
that Tibet still needed the fabrication of so-called China's
suzerainty then. But it should be under the control of Britain
completely, and then changed into Britain's protectorate by this
means. In effect it was only a change of name.
</P>
<P>
It is quite clear that within Britain's policies, Tibet is in
fact Britain's protectorate even though it remains under China's
suzerainty in name, or it has implemented so-called autonomy, or
proposed for independence.
</P>
<P>
The document also set forth a series of measures to realize
this goal, such as to instigate pro-Britain elements including
Dasang Zhamdui to return to Tibet and establish a pro-British
government.
</P>
<P>
The measures included holding talks with Russia to revise the
agreement on Tibet signed in 1907, in order to remove the hurdle
of Britain's control over Tibet and split it from China.
</P>
<P>
Since Britain had recognized Tibet as a part of China in its
former treaties signed with the Chinese government, Britain made
desperate efforts to abrogate the former treaties and conclude new
ones asking China to abandon the sovereignty over Tibet.

<P>
After the failure of the Simla Conference,the Britain continued
its diplomatic and material support for the pro-British upper-
class forces in Tibet. It carried out various kinds of tricks in
an attempt to realize its ambition.
</P>
<P>
First, the British government offered large amounts of weapons
and ammunition to the Tibetan local government and urged the
Tibetan army to invade parts of Sichuan and Qinghai, in a bid to
realize by force the dream of a "Greater Tibet", which it failed
to achieve at the Simla conference table.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Bell, a British official, visited Tibet again in 1920
to incite Tibet against the central Government and cut the
importance of the central government's order of sending generals
Li Zhonglian and Zhu Xiu to Tibet to restore its political links
with the central government. Taking advantage of the 13th Dalai
Lama's implementation of new policies, Bell persuaded him to
expand the Tibetan army and widely collect funds for the army, in
a bid to make preparations for another eastward invasion and the
establishment of a "Greater Tibet".
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Bell assisted a senior Tibetan army officer to
establish a secret organization which planned a coup against the
13th Dalai Lama to deprive the Dalai lama's secular and cabinet
ministers of power in 1924, in an effort to speed up Britain's
complete control of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
However, the plot was unveiled before its operation and the
British ploy suffered a heavy setback.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Mayor May Return from U.S. in November: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Mayor of Uganda's capital city
Kampala, Nasser Sebaggala, who was sentenced to 15 months'
imprisonment for financial fraud in the United States on February
24, will complete his term and return home to perform his mayoral
duties in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Paul Kelly, lawyer of the embattled mayor, made these remarks
when interviewed by the New Vision paper Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said Sebaggala will benefit from the "good time" policy
under which his jail term will be reduced by five months.
</P>
<P>
A 15-month sentence in the U.S. means serving about 12 months.
 Sebaggala will also get credit for the time he has already served
in prison, which means he will be freed in less than nine months,
the lawyer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the mayor is entitled to the deduction of three
months from the jail term because he has and will always behave
well while in jail.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala's political assistant Matthias Nsubuga also said the
mayor will return to take on his duties as the Mayor of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
In Kampala, there has been a loud outcry for Sebaggala's
stepping down and authorities here said they are studying the
mayor's case and will come up with a solution very soon.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala was sentenced in February and ordered to pay a
10,000-U.S. dollars fine and to refund 44,000 dollars he
fraudulently withdrew from Bank Boston.
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered him to pay immediately 800 dollars'
assessment fee. Sebaggala's sentence runs from December 4 when he
was convicted.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Airways Rated Among Best Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Qatar Airways has been rated
among the top three of its kind in view of the economic class
service offered by a selection of international airlines, the Gulf
News daily of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a survey conducted recently by British Business Traveler
magazine, Qatar Airways' daily Doha-London flight, an Airbus
A300-60R, got high marks in five categories of service, including
check-in, boarding, seat comfort, the flight and arrival.
</P>
<P>
Qatar Airways "spared no effort" in offering good service and
its service was "efficient and friendly, despite the frequent
demands made by passengers," the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The highly personalized service provided by the Qatar Airways
cabin crew received a special mention: " ... the friendly,
courteous cabin crew were at pains to help everyone as much as
they could."
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Officer of Qatar Airways Akbar Al Baker said
after receiving the result of the survey that "as this survey
placed us against some of the biggest airlines in the world, we
are delighted with the outcome."
</P>
<P>
"The fact that it focuses on the economy class service
highlights our commitment to providing all of our passengers with
an equally high level of service across all sectors," he added.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Emerges as Economic Growth Point of Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The private sector has emerged as
a new growth point of the economy of Yunnan Province, southwest
China, with the total output value in 1998 reaching 11.65 billion
yuan (1.4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 1998 output value for the individual and private economies
in Yunnan accounted for 45 percent of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The province has introduced a number of policies and
regulations designed to encourage and protect development of the
individual and private economies.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at all levels have formed special groups to
help solve problems to promote the growth of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the province had over 774,600 private
businesses and companies at the end of 1998, up 16.2 percent on
the previous year. The private sector employed 1.54 million people
and had amassed registered capital of some 18.6 billion yuan at
the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The private sector also gave strong support to the reform of
state enterprises in 1998, by providing jobs for 404,000 people,
including a large number of laid-off workers from state
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Study: California Has Highest Aggressive Driving Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A study released Monday by the
U.S. Surface Transportation Policy Project found that California
had the highest number of aggressive driving deaths in 1996, the
most recent available.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Riverside/San Bernardino, California-region
had an average of 13.4 deaths per 100,000 people, while Boston had
only 2.1 aggressive driving deaths per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Surface Transportation Policy Project, a group backed by
200 environmental groups, believes that a community like Boston, a
city with a reputation for bad drivers, has a lower rate because
it offers commuters options like the subway, commuter trains and
an extensive sidewalk network.
</P>
<P>
The Riverside/San Bernardino area, by contrast, is near Los
Angeles, a region with few mass transit options, overcrowded
freeways and a tradition of driving vast distances, the project
says.
</P>
<P>
"The endless strip malls and high-speed roads we are building
seem to be a breeding ground for aggressive driving," said Roy
Kientiz, executive director for the group that advocates mass
transit alternatives to traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
The Surface Transportation Policy Project's report was based on
its analysis of 1996. Like the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, the group defined aggressive driving as speeding
over 80 mph, tailgating, failing to yield and improper passing,
among other factors. It eliminated accidents in which drugs or
alcohol were a factor.
</P>
<P>
The aggressive driving report was criticized by The Road
Information Program, which noted a recent survey said aggressive
driving is triggered by congestion and slow-moving traffic --
evidence of the need to build more roads.
</P>
<P>
Since 1970, the group said, highway travel has increased by 130
percent while new road mileage has increased by only 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Production Doubles in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's coffee yield has more than
doubled from 22,278 tons in the 1997-1998 period to 47,061 tons
in the 1998-1999 period which started last October, the figures
released by the Coffee Board of Kenya (CBK) said.
</P>
<P>
The board said Monday that the five commercial coffee mills in
Kenya have already received bookings of 4,338 tons of coffee still
in the fields.
</P>
<P>
The statistics given by the CBK shows that the mills are
holding 21,365 tons of unmilled coffee and another 21,358 tons of
milled coffee that is ready for auction.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the coffee will be milled by the Kenya Planters
Cooperative Union (KPCU), the Kenya's leading coffee miller.
According to the statistics, KPCU expects to mill 37,013 tons of
coffee, up from 19,496 tons in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The CBK said that the KPCU has received bookings for 3,166-ton
coffee in the fields and has 18,788 tons of unmilled coffee and
15,059 tons of clean coffee in its store.
</P>
<P>
However, Director Abraham Mwangi of the KPCU Board said that
coffee farming was still viable, provided farmers got the
necessary financial support.
</P>
<P>
Mwangi, who also heads a coffee research foundation, said that
his foundation has adequate coffee seedlings for farmers willing
to plant.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Over 4,000 refugees have entered
Zambia in the past few days following renewed military activities
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Dominik Batsch, spokesman of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Lusaka, said Monday
preliminary indications are that the refugees sought protection
from rebel advances southwest of DRC's Moba district on Lake
Tanganyika toward the direction of Pweto which resulted in
indiscriminate attacks against military and civilian targets.

UNHCR representative Oluseyi Bajulaiye said a joint mission

Tuesday's Zambian newspaper, the Post, quoted Bajulaiye as

food and other relief items to the affected refugee population."

relocate the Congolese refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Batsch explained that the emergency response mechanism
contained in the contingency plan had been fully activated.
</P>
<P>
He said some 200 refugees were initially reported to have
entered Zambia last Thursday but the number grew rapidly to 2,000
new arrivals on Friday and topped 4,000 by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that another 500 refugees are reportedly close to
the border and may cross into Zambia any time.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Teenager Arrested for Alleged Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A 17-year-old Jordanian was
arrested for shooting at his pregnant sister to cleanse his honor
Sunday night, the semiofficial Jordan Times reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The young man, who turned himself in to police, claimed he
wanted to kill his sister to cleanse his honor because his elder
sister was found pregnant out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
The gunshot has inflicted wounds to the chest, neck and upper
limbs of the 19-year-old young woman.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest case of the so-called "honor killing" in the
desert kingdom, where some women are either killed or critically
injured each year for alleged fornication or immoral behavior with
men other than their husbands.
</P>
<P>
The "executors" are often their husbands or brothers, who
seldom face heavy sentences if they could provide evidence or
argument for such killing. And the Jordanian society also tends to
sympathize with men convicted of the action.
</P>
<P>
However, human rights campaigners in the kingdom have clamored
for amendments to the laws for tougher punishment on honor
killers, but the calls largely fell on deaf ears.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Starts Registration of Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has begun an exercise to
register foreigners to assist the security agencies to identity
foreigners when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
Kodjo Honari Okae, deputy director of Ghana Immigration Service
(GIS) in charge of operations, said the service would, after "a
reasonable period", begin to inspect identity cards (ID) which
are expected to give the foreigners confidence that they are
registered in the country, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of tourists, landlords and hoteliers are
expected to demand ID cards before accepting foreigners into their
premises.
</P>
<P>
Okae said such an action on the part of landlords and hoteliers
would compel foreigners to register.
</P>
<P>
Under the exercise, which started Monday, all aliens would buy
a registration form for 10,000 cedis (about four U.S. dollars) and
pay an additional registration fee of 20,000 cedis (8.5 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Every foreigner would be required to submit four passport-size
pictures in person to the GIS which would issue them with a
registration card after processing their particulars.
</P>
<P>
He advised foreigners without passports to register since a
passport is not a condition for registration.
</P>
<P>
Okae said the exercise is not the same as issuing them with
resident permits, explaining that one needs a reason for permanent
stay such as schooling or working to obtain a resident permit.
</P>
<P>
"The registration covers even those on long visits and project
tours."
</P>
<P>
The official said the exercise would be a continuous one,
adding there will be regular checks by GIS personnel to ensure
that all aliens have registered.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Abolish Fingerprinting of All Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government on Tuesday
endorsed a bill to revise the Alien Registration Law to abolish
fingerprinting for all foreign residents in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The revision, approved at a cabinet meeting, proposes to
require non-permanent foreign residents aged 16 and older living
more than one year in Japan to give a signature instead of a
fingerprint, and submit information on family members, when
registering at local municipal offices.
</P>
<P>
With the passage of the bill, Japan's fingerprinting system,
which has been criticized since it was introduced in 1952 as
treating foreigners like criminals, will be abolished.
</P>
<P>
Japan abolished compulsory fingerprinting for foreigners with
permanent resident status in a revision of the law in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese cabinet also approved a bill to revise the
Immigration Control and Refugees Recognition law to make illegally
staying in Japan a punishable offense separate from illegal entry.
</P>
<P>
Under the current law, offenders found to have illegally stayed
in Japan three years or more after illegally entering the country
can only be deported and not prosecuted for the crime of illegal
entry.
</P>
<P>
With the revision, illegally staying in Japan will become a "
continuing offense" and offenders could be sentenced to up to
three years in prison, or fined up to 300,000 yen (about 2,460 U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Starts Ground-Breaking Visit to Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
left here on Tuesday morning for his ground-breaking visit to
Europe since he took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's plane took off for Rome at 0800 local times (0430 GMT)
and he was seen off by Iranian First Vice President Hassan Habibi
and his office chief Mohammad Golpaygani.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, accompanied by Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi,
Minister of Mines and Metal Eshaq Jahangiri and some other senior
officials, will discuss with Italian leaders to strengthen
political, economic and cultural relations between the two
countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president will also meet Pope John Paul II at
Vatican City during his visit to Italy and then fly to France on
April 12.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi on Monday expressed hope that
Khatami's visit to Rome would help the westerners better
appreciate the factual realities in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the visit is in response to the good feelings of
Italian officials towards Iran and to their keenness on broadening
relations with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran has always been keen to have close
relations with all nations in the world, including those in Europe,
on the basis of mutual respect and commitment to tension-easing.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and European countries warmed up after
Khatami initiated a foreign policy of detente and tension-easing
and opened a new chapter for Iran's foreign relations with the
world, particularly with the Gulf states and the European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Khatami's policy, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
paid a visit to Iran in July, leading Italy as the pioneer in
Europe to improve relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Political observers believe that Khatami's visit to Italy and
the sequent visit to France will help him break the western
countries' policy to isolate Iran led by the U.S. since the
Islamic revolution in 1979.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Third seed Monica Seles of the
United States was eliminated by Slovakia's Henrieta Nagyova in the
third round of the 1.25 million-dollar WTA Tour Evert Cup in
Indian Wells on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nagyova, ranked 27th in the world, needed just one hour and
five minutes to beat Seles 6-2, 6-4 and reach the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"My mind definitely wasn't there from the start until the end,"
Seles said. "She didn't give me a chance really to get into it."
</P>
<P>
Seles was making her first appearance in the tournament since
1992, when she won the singles title.
</P>
<P>
Eighth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat upset by fellow Frenchwoman
Sandrine Testud 7-6 (7/3), 6-2 in one hour and 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth day of play in the Evert Cup, and the first
day of play in the men's Champions Cup, the first of the ATP
Tour's prestigious Super Nine events of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Big serving Briton Greg Rusedski dispatched Czech Petr Korda 6-
3, 6-4 in the first round, blasting 11 aces.

<HEADLINE> Hornets Name Silas New Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Paul Silas took over as the
Charlotte Hornets' new coach Monday, pledging to try to revive a
franchise beset by poor play, weak leadership and injuries.
</P>
<P>
"Where this thing is going, who the heck knows? Hopefully
miracles do happen," Silas said after running a nearly two-hour
practice at the team's training complex.
</P>
<P>
Cowens, who led Charlotte to back-to-back 50 victory seasons in
his first two years in Charlotte, stepped down because of mounting
frustration with owner George Shinn's refusal to give him a raise.
</P>
<P>
Cowen's inability to work out a deal with Shinn was just one of
several problems associated with a club that is off to a 4-11
start and has seen a significant drop in attendance.
</P>
<P>
Shinn is the target of a lawsuit accusing him of unwanted
sexual advances, and some fans are calling on him to sell the team
if he confines to refuse to pay the money needed to retain top
talent.
</P>
<P>
Injuries have sidelined the team's best two players, and one of
them, leading scorer Glen Rice, is the subject of ongoing trade
talks with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Silas coached the Clippers when they were located in San Diego
from 1980-83, compiling a 78-168 mark. He has been an NBA
assistant for most the past 12 years, including the last two
seasons in Charlotte.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Recovery of H.K. External Trade: Long Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua Correspondent Tao Wenge) -- The
maintenance and enhancement of the advantages of flexible
management, quick response to market changes, efficient production
and timely shipment of products of Hong Kong's external trade
firms may help them achieve better performance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the recovery of Hong Kong's external trade still has
an arduous long way to go following the sharp decrease in 1998 due
to the falling demand from its major markets caused by the
economic downturn as a result of the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The volume of Hong Kong's total exports decreased by 4.3
percent in 1998 compared with that of 1997. The volume of re-
exports decreased by 3.7 percent, and the volume of domestic
exports by 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
As an open economy with elaborate trade and investment links
with the rest of Asia, Hong Kong was hit hard by the regional
financial turmoil which engulfed the region and swept beyond it.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's exports to the United States and Europe grew, but
this growth was unable to compensate for the market shrinkage in
Hong Kong's exports to East Asia including Japan, South Korea,
Taiwan and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The growing volume of products made in China's mainland being
shipped out directly from mainland ports instead of Hong Kong as
before also trimmed Hong Kong's exports performance.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 the volume of freight handled by Hong Kong ports
increased by only 1 or 2 percent while in the meantime the volume
of freight handled by ports of Shenzhen in the mainland increased
by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward, the situation of Hong Kong's external trade in
1999 could still be difficult due to the gloomy external
environment.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang forecast the total exports of
goods to decline by 3.7 percent in real terms this year,
comprising declines of 5 percent for domestic exports and 3.5
percent for re-exports.
</P>
<P>
As for the export of services, Tsang forecast a 3 percent
growth in real terms this year, anticipating a further recovery in
tourism as well as in some other service areas.
</P>
<P>
The United States may not be able to sustain last year's robust
consumer demand created partly by its strong stock market
performance.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has recently suffered from financial instability which
may yet spill over to other economies.
</P>
<P>
A good part of Europe is still under the shadow of Russia's
earlier financial fall-out.
</P>
<P>
The demand from the European Union member states could not be
expected to increase for the trade policy of the European Union
may focus on stability as the European single currency, the euro,
was newly launched.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, although financial conditions appear to have
stabilized, domestic demand remains weak because consumers'
confidence has not restored.
</P>
<P>
The pace of economic re-vitalization in Japan will be the key
to regional recovery, but that re-vitalization remains elusive.
</P>
<P>
Finally, more products made in the mainland would be shipped
out directly from ports of the mainland rather than through Hong
Kong ports.
</P>
<P>
Is there anything the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region can do to improve the external trade
performance?
</P>
<P>
The answer is that what the government can do is very limited
in a market-oriented system as in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, the government can really do something. It can first
stabilize the stock and property markets, which can help restore
consumers' confidence and lower the cost to a more competitive
level.
</P>
<P>
In a market economy as Hong Kong, the government would never
give subsidiaries to certain enterprises to stimulate exports.
</P>
<P>
However, the government can further enhance its promotion of
external trade through the Trade Development Council by expanding
the scale of markets and promoting new products.
</P>
<P>
The government can promote the production efficiency of local
firms, especially the small and medium-sized enterprises by
offering technology support such as the use of computer networks
and business information.
</P>
<P>
Competition for export business from within the region is
expected to be very keen. As domestic demand is weak in almost all
the economies in the region, the development of the external trade
is very important for those economies.
</P>
<P>
Will Hong Kong fail to compete with its regional rivals? The
answer would be "no".
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is still competitive though its production cost is
relatively higher than other economies in the region due to the
devaluation of currencies in many economies of the region.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar can not help the external
trade because most of the raw materials were bought from outside
Hong Kong and manufacturing is not in Hong Kong, mostly in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation of Renminbi may help to reduce the cost but it's
impossible because the adjustment of Renminbi may lead to a new
round of wave of the Asian financial turmoil. The series of
reactions could impose greater threat to Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's advantages include the product quality, flexibility
of management, quick response to the changes of markets,
production efficiency, timely shipment of products.
</P>
<P>
The overseas market pay more attention to the quality of the
products than prices at present because in these markets the
retail prices may be several times the prices of the imported
goods. Price may not constitute a big proportion in the overall
structure of cost of these markets.
</P>
<P>
Today it's unlikely to receive small number of orders for large
amount of goods but large number of orders for small amount of
goods.
</P>
<P>
In this circumstances, the management flexibility, production
efficiency, timely shipment would be more important than prices.
</P>
<P>
With regards to price, the Hong Kong-funded firms in the
mainland can find more cheap labor and raw materials if they move
further to the inland areas of the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Ghana, Germany Sign Grant Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Ghana is to receive from Germany a
total of 15 million Deutsche marks non-repayable grants under
three agreements signed in Accra.
</P>
<P>
Kwame Peprah, Minister of Finance, signed Monday for Ghana
while Winfried Polte, senior vice-president of the German
Department of Development Loan Cooperation (KFW), signed on behalf
of his country, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ghana has so far received assistance totalling 1.1 billion
Deutsche marks, the equivalent of 600 million dollars, from
Germany within the framework of a financial cooperation program.
</P>
<P>
The first grant of 10 million marks is meant for water supplies
to poor areas in the Volta and Eastern Regions while the second
grant of three million marks is for basic education under which
Teacher Training Colleges at Bimbila, Pusiga and Tamale in the
Northern Region would be rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
The third grant for two million marks is for the "Study and
Expert Fund Four" which is meant to cater for costs in the
preparation of various programs for cooperation matters.
</P>
<P>
Peprah thanked the German government for its financial
assistance which had helped improve the economic status of
Ghanaians.
</P>
<P>
Ghana has a high profile for assisting investors, he said,
urging German companies to take advantage of the enabling
environment to do business in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Ekwow Spio-Garbrah, Minister of Education, said government is
making efforts to ensure that a fee-free compulsory education by
the year 2005 succeeds.
</P>
<P>
He said success can only be real when infrastructure and
supplies are in place to provide a congenial atmosphere to train
quality teachers who will produce well educated children to
contribute toward economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Motor Vehicles Cause Half of Air Pollution in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Motor vehicles are responsible for
nearly 50 percent of the air pollution in the Bangladeshi capital
city of Dhaka, endangering public health, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Some 16,000 polluting vehicles have been identified by the
Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), Amanullah Chowdhury,
director of the BRTA, told a project-launching workshop organized
by the Dhaka Urban Transport Project on Monday, The Bangladesh
Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 160,000 motorized vehicles are plying in the Dhaka
metropolitan area at present, with about one-third of them having
no fitness certificates and constantly emitting black smoke and
fumes polluting the air, according to the BRTA.
</P>
<P>
The air pollution has been causing serious health hazards to
the residents in the city with a population of over 9 million.
Traffic policemen and pedestrians are often seen wearing gauze
masks to cover their nose and mouth in the street to protect
themselves from inhaling hazardous air.
</P>
<P>
The level of suspended particulates in the city's air has
reached 2,600 micrograms per cubic meter, much higher than the
acceptable level, and the range of sulfur dioxide is about 100
micrograms per cubic meter against the acceptable level of 80
micrograms, according to a recent survey conducted by the
Environment Department on the air quality in the city.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the pollution level of the city, deputy director of
the department, Md. Reazuddin, said the department along with the
BRTA and police would set up 20 more check posts in some crucial
points of the city to control the smoke-emitting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The government has already banned the import of two-stroke
engines, widely used in motor cycles and baby-taxis (three-wheeled
motorized vehicles), and are implementing a World Bank-financed
project which is expected to be completed by 2003, to improve the
city's environment through developing its transport system.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Ready for Talks With Ethiopia, Ruling Front Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea is ready to negotiate with
Ethiopia over their border dispute without any condition,
secretary of Eritrea's ruling People's Front for Democracy and
Justice, Alamin Mi Said, said here Monday, but adding the future
for peace is not bright.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to negotiate with Ethiopia if they want to sit
down at the table and bring a solution to the problem," especially
to the dispute over Badme, Alamin told Xinhua at a rally marking
the International Women's Day (March 8).
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian forces broke through Eritrean lines at Badme in a
huge infantry offensive backed by artillery and fighter planes at
the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors went to war last May over their unmarked 1,
000-kilometer border, leaving more than 1,000 people killed. The
latest round of fighting erupted on February 6.
</P>
<P>
"We want peace, not war," Alamin stressed, adding that war is
good neither for the Ethiopians nor the Eritreans.
</P>
<P>
But he turned to be pessimistic over a peaceful solution,
blaming the Ethiopian side for bringing good-will efforts to a
deadlock."
</P>
<P>
He said the problem has gone beyond border conflicts, saying, "
The Ethiopians want to recapture Eritrea. This is our feeling."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Eritrean Foreign Ministry issued a statement
accusing Ethiopia of rejecting the recent calls by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the U.N. Security Council
for an immediate end to hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Ethiopia said Asmara's abrupt acceptance of an
OAU-proposed framework peace agreement is skeptical.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea accepted the framework agreement on February 27 when
the Ethiopians claimed "total victory" in Badme, a disputed area
of some 390 square kilometers southwest of Asmara.
</P>
<P>
The official Ethiopian News Agency quoted Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi as saying on Monday that Eritrean president's letter to the
U.N. expressing acceptance of the OAU package lacks clarity and is
open for interpretation.
</P>
<P>
Meles urged Eritrea "to immediately and unconditionally
withdraw its troops from all occupied Ethiopian territories
without any pre-conditions."
</P>
<P>
He said that Eritrean forces are still making efforts to
reinforce their trenches along the Ethiopian territories they
occupied by force in May last year and dispatching additional
troops to these areas.

<HEADLINE> Dustin Hoffman Wins Lawsuit Against Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Dustin Hoffman, twice Oscar-
winner for best actor, has won a lawsuit against Los Angeles
Magazine, owned by Disney unit ABC Inc.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian on Monday ordered the
magazine to pay 3 million U.S. dollars to Hoffman because the
popular lifestyle magazine had printed a computer-generated image
of him in a dress and high heels without permission.
</P>
<P>
The magazine was also ordered to pay 270,000 dollars in Hoffman'
s legal fees.
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, who also won life-achievement award last month, sued
Los Angeles Magazine over a 1997 photo layout called "Grand
Illusions," which also used other stars to promote the latest
spring fashions.
</P>
<P>
All the celebrities were "dressed" through computer trickery in
clothes they never wore. Hoffman was pictured in a butter-colored
silk evening gown by designer Richard Tyler and heels by Ralph
Lauren.
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said during the trial that the layout, which included
prices for the dress and shoes, made him an unwilling clothes
model.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Los Angeles Magazine argued that the layout was
protected under freedom of press provisions in the U.S.
Constitution and that the magazine's use of Hoffman's image was
fair and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
An ABC spokesman said earlier that the company would appeal the
damage decision.

<HEADLINE> Du Pont Plans To Reach Chinese Investment Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.'s Du Pont is paving the
way for investment projects in China to reach its objective of
investing a billion U.S. dollars in China by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
The projects include a new plant on Hainan Island in co-
operation with Germany's BASF with a total investment of one
billion U.S. dollars to produce four types of nylon intermediates.
</P>
<P>
This will bring Du Pont's total investment in China to more
than a billion dollars, according to Anthony Loo, president of Du
Pont China Holding Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
This year is Du Pont's 15th year of investment in China. It has
4 representative offices, 9 joint ventures, and 4 solely-owned
facilities in China, with total investment exceeding 420 million U.
S. dollars, employing 1,800 people. It has transferred 10 types of
technology to China in that time.
</P>
<P>
Its investment covers chemicals, agriculture, electronics,
textiles, and automobiles and it plans to expand into
biotechnology in the future. It will also stick to its commitment
to the Asia-Pacific region, especially China, Loo says.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Du Pont's business in China grew 10 percent in spite
of the sluggish economy and its trade on the mainland, Hong Kong,
and Taiwan amounted to a billion U.S. dollars, accounting for a
third of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Its global business grew 3 percent last year, with sales of
chemicals and special chemical products reaching 25 billion U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> State Sector Investment Not Satisfactory in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Disbursement of investment funds
in Thailand should be speeded up as the country's state
enterprises sector investment in the first quarter of the current
fiscal year has been 37 percent behind the target, a report by the
National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) available
Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
State enterprises sector invested 41.55 billion baht (1.12
billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of the current fiscal
year, which started last October, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Increasing the expenditure of state enterprises is one of the
measures being emphasized by the government to boost domestic
consumption and bring the country out of its worst economic
recession in decades.
</P>
<P>
Due to the delay in the disbursement of investment funds by
state enterprises in the first quarter, the NESDB report said it
is important to speed up the process in order to meet the
disbursement target, and stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed two major factors as the reasons for slow
disbursement of budget funds: the liquidity problem of state
enterprises, and an adjustment of their investment plans.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Try 2 Big Smuggling, Corruption Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City's new Chief Judge
of the People's Court Dong Thi Anh will begin her tenure by
presiding over what should prove Vietnam's two biggest smuggling
and corruption cases, the Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They involve a host of charges being laid against the Tan
Truong Sanh company and another private company EPCO-Minh Phung.
</P>
<P>
"Preparations are almost completed and the Tan Truong Sanh case
will be heard between the 22nd and 25th of this month, and the
EPCO-Minh Phung case should go to court in early May," Anh said.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-four alleged offenders face court regarding the
operations of Tan Truong Sanh.
</P>
<P>
Those indicted include Tran Dam, director of the trading
company, his wife and three of their children, 32 former customs
officers and 17 officials and employees of nine state-owned
import-export companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the indictment, Tran Dam and his accomplices illegally
imported 903 containers of goods through nine state-owned
import-export companies between 1994 and August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of the 903 containers, 544 contained 77 cars, a number of
electronic products and refrigerators and electrical goods valued
at more than 900 billion Vietnamese dong (64.3 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tran Dam is also accused of corrupting customs officers with
bribes in the form of Vietnamese dong and U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Minh Phung Company and the Export Production
Company, EPCO, up to 77 individuals will be prosecuted, most for
fraud involving state assets.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and 1997, the two companies bribed several banking
officials to obtain loans worth thousands of billions of
Vietnamese dong and more than 20 million U.S. dollars which they
cannot repay.

<HEADLINE> Italy Sees Iranian President as Moderate Reformer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami,
who starts a visit to Italy Tuesday, should be seen as a "hope for
moderation and reform" in a country dominated for many years by
Islamic fundamentalism, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said that Khatami's visit to Italy is "an event of the
utmost importance" and Khatami himself should be welcomed as an "
an important novelty" in Iran's politics.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian opposition in exile has been organizing
demonstrations against the visit, claiming that Iran's poor human
rights record has remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini later joined D'Alema's
appeal to all Italy's political parties for their support of
Khatami's reform.
</P>
<P>
"They should applaud the president against the most
conservative forces in an extremely closed Islamic state which
Khatami himself has described as religious fascism," said Dini.
</P>
<P>
"I think Khatami deserves encouragement from all the political
forces in our country," Dini added.

<HEADLINE> Ho Chi Minh City Targets 4 Billion Dollars in Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest
economic hub, is determined to post a 6-7 percent increase in
exports this year despite the economic slowdown, official media
here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It has targeted a turnover of 4,020 million U.S. dollars of
which foreign-invested businesses will account for 830 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Major exports are industrial goods at 71.9 percent, (of which
garments make up 70 percent), agricultural products 20.6 percent,
forestry and sea products 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of this year, export turnover
registered an increase of 12.4 percent over the same period last
year at 668 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increase mainly resulted from a 52.3 percent growth by
foreign-invested companies.
</P>
<P>
To reach this year's target, the city will focus on the
development of food and marine product processing industries,
consumer goods production and the export-oriented sector as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City will assist and encourage all economic sectors
to join export operations. The number of exporters has risen from
900 to 1,200 over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
The city last year posted a drop of 1.9 percent in export value
from the previous year after successive years of growth.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the slump to the regional financial
crisis, drop in international prices, unfavorable weather
conditions and slow development of the processing industry.

<HEADLINE> German FM Urges Kosovo's Warring Sides to Accept Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joscher
Fischer on Monday urged both the Serbs and ethnic Albanians to
sign the Rambouillet peace accord, Yugoslavia's official Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after holding talks in Pristina
with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, the German foreign
minister, who is the European Union's rotating president, said, "
it is very important that we need peace here in Kosovo; we need an
end to fighting; we need an end to killing."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Fischer held talks in Belgrade with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, who stood against the stationing of
NATO peacekeeping troops on Yugoslav territory as part of a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said it would be very hard to persuade the Serbs to
accept the accord totally, but he believed that the ethnic
Albanians would take the plan.
</P>
<P>
Fischer warned that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) would be
making a "historical mistake" if they do not accept the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Envoy Christopher Hill, after meeting with KLA
commanders at "a secret place" in Kosovo on Monday, disclosed that
the KLA is opposed to several clauses in the peace deal, including
the KLA's weapon surrender to NATO peacekeepers.

"The three existing contracts laws have made significant
contributions to safeguarding the legal rights and interests of
the parties involved in the contract, maintaining social and
economic order, promoting economic growth, technological
advancement and expansion of foreign economic and trade affairs,
and guaranteeing smooth progress of the cause of socialist
construction," Gu said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that as China continues reforms and
opens wider to the outside world, the regulating scopes and some
rules of the three laws are no longer compatible with new economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
The draft contracts law tabled today has an enlarged regulating
scope comparing with that of the three previous contracts laws, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a decision by the NPC Standing Committee, He
Chunlin, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee,
explained on the draft method for electing Ninth NPC deputies in
the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
The draft stipulates that the Macao SAR, which will be founded
after China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20 of this year, can have 12 deputies to the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the NPC Standing Committee to report its work over
the past year, Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing
Committee, said that the NPC and its Standing Committee have made
painstaking efforts to strengthen legislation, improve the quality
of laws, enhance supervision on government work and law
enforcement, and promote exchanges and cooperation with foreign
parliaments and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming year, the NPC Standing Committee will continue
to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, regard
developing socialist democracy and legal system as its fundamental
task, and earnestly fulfill and exercise various functions and
powers bestowed by the Constitution, so as to promote the process
of governing the country according to law and building a socialist
country based on a rule of law," he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Convenes Third Plenary Meeting (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On January 22 this year, the CPC Central Committee formally
delivered its proposal on constitutional amendment to the NPC
Standing Committee. The latter discussed the proposal at its
seventh meeting and, in accordance with the stipulation of Article
64 of the Constitution, put forth a draft amendment, which has
been submitted to the ongoing NPC full session for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment suggests six major changes to the current
Chinese Constitution. To be written into the Constitution are: "
Deng Xiaoping Theory" as the country's guiding principle; the
principle of "governing the country according to law and building
a socialist country based on the rule of law;" "the State in a
primary stage of socialism shall adhere to the fundamental
economic system of taking public ownership as the mainstay and
promoting common development for economic sectors of multiple
ownerships, and to a distribution system where distribution
according to work is the main form and a co-existence of multiple
ways of distribution is allowed;" "rural collective economic
organizations shall adopt a double-deck operation system based on
household contract operation and on a combination of unified and
separate operations;" private economic entities existing and
developing "within the limits of law" should be regarded as "
important components of a socialist market economy;" and the term
of "counter-revolutionary activities" in the current Constitution
be abandoned and the concept of "criminal activities endangering
state security" be adopted.
</P>
<P>
Gu Angran, chairman of the Commission of Legislative Affairs
under the NPC Standing Committee, made expositions on the draft
contracts law according to a decision by the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that guidelines for drafting the contracts law are to
draft a unified and relatively comprehensive contracts law by
proceeding from China's real conditions and absorbing useful
international experience under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping
Theory so as to guarantee a healthy development of the socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts must be made to maintain coherence and
consistency of the law, which has been formulated on the basis of
three existing laws, namely Economic Contracts Law, Law on
Economic Contracts involving Foreign Interests and Law on
Technological Contracts, said Gu.

<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Second Session of
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, held
its third plenary meeting in the Great Hall of the People in
downtown Beijing this morning.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,781 NPC deputies attended the meeting, which was
presided over by Wang Guangying, an executive chairman of both the
session and its Presidium.
</P>
<P>
The legislators heard explanations on a draft amendment to
China's Constitution, a draft contracts law and a draft method for
electing Ninth NPC deputies in the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR). They also heard a report on the work of the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a decision by the NPC Standing Committee,
Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, first
explained on the draft Constitutional Amendment.
</P>
<P>
"The Constitution of the People's Republic of China adopted in
1982 is a good Constitution, which has played a vital role in the
country's political, economic and social life," said Tian.
</P>
<P>
He noted that two amendments were made to some parts of the
Constitution in 1988 and 1993 as a result of the constant
development of China's reform, opening-up and socialist
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
After the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) convened in 1997, which made comprehensive
arrangements for advancing the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics into the next century, the CPC Central
Committee suggested that an appropriate revision be made to some
parts of the Constitution in accordance with the report of the 15
th National Party Congress, said Tian.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee also suggested the principle for the
amendment, which is that changes shall be made only on issues
which require necessary revision and have been well considered,
and that no change shall be made on issues for which a revision is
not absolutely necessary, he added.

<HEADLINE> IMF Clears Way for New Loans for Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said on Monday that it had agreed with Brazil on a new
economic program that would release 4.9 billion U.S. dollars for
Brazil after an executive board vote expected within weeks.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would recommend
to the IMF's executive board the approval of the revised program
for 1999-2001 proposed by the Brazilian government, which sees a
sharp drop in growth this year as well as falling inflation and
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"The key elements of the new program are a strengthened fiscal
adjustment and, in the light of the floating of the exchange rate,
the adoption of a new nominal anchor for monetary policy," the IMF
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The IMF put together an international rescue deal amounting to
41.5 billion dollars for Brazil's struggling economy last November
and disbursed an initial payment of 5.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It had scheduled to pay a further 4.5 billion dollars by the
end of February, but a devaluation of the real, the Brazilian
currency, in January meant the two sides had to renegotiate
conditions behind the loan.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the IMF executive board is expected to
review Brazil's new program, which sets out what Brazil will do in
return for the IMF's money, at the end of March or the beginning
of April. This is when the money is likely to be handed over to
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the IMF's decision, the World Bank said it planned to
disburse a loan of 1.01 billion dollars to Brazil to boost its
social assistance program.
</P>
<P>
In a statement welcoming the agreement between the IMF and
Brazil, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said that "firm and
sustained implementation" of the program by Brazil can preserve
financial stability and foster growth and investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is prepared to join the IMF and other
countries to make available substantial additional financing from
the international support program arranged last year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF gave a gloomier outlook for the Brazilian economy
compared to the forecasts the agency made in the December issue of
its World Economic Outlook, when it forecast a decline in gross
domestic product of 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Although real GDP is now expected to decline by 3.5 to 4
percent in 1999, it is expected that the program will lay the
basis for a sustained recovery in 2000 and beyond, as confidence
recovers, and external financing constraints are eased," the IMF
statement said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Standing Committee Improves Supervisory Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) improved its supervisory
work and increased the effectiveness of supervision last year,
Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the committee said here today.
</P>
<P>
In delivering a work report to the ongoing NPC session, Jiang
said the NPC Standing Committee examined and inspected law
enforcement by organizing six inspection groups, hearing and
examining five work reports submitted by the State Councial and
departments under it, hearing and examining work reports by the
Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate, and
setting up a special institution for strengthened supervision over
budget implementation.
</P>
<P>
"The committee embodied its support for government work in its
supervisory work," the vice-chairman said. "It has supported and
urged the State Council and its departments, the Supreme People's
Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate to improve their work in
accordance with Law."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the committee has strengthened supervision over the
implementation of the central budget in particular. It has decided
to set up a budget work subcommittee to improve supervision over
budget implementation and combat rampant irregularities in the
appropriation of fiscal fund.
</P>
<P>
In playing its supervisory role, the committee has focused on
major problems in economic and social development and problems
that attract the loudest complaints from people to ensure full
implementation of major decisions by the central authorities,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Special committees of the NPC also assisted the NPC Standing
Committee in exercising supervision, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman pointed out that the NPC Standing Committee
will continue to tighten and improve supervision intended to
enable administrative, judicial and procuratorial bodies to do a
better job. Lax law enforcement remains a serious problem in China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the committee will continue to hear from state
administrative, judicial and procuratorial bodies reports on
important issues in reform and development and problems of common
concern, and increase supervision through investigations and
hearings over major cases reported by people.
</P>
<P>
Also, the committee is drafting a Law of Supervision and some
special supervision-related decisions, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Ninth National People's Congress, the country's top law-making
body, has made substantial progress in legislation since it was
inaugurated last March.
</P>
<P>
According to a report delivered today at the ongoing NPC annual

the committee's legislative work, the NPC and its Standing
Committee examined 28 draft laws and law-related decisions last
year, out of which 11 laws and 11 law-related decisions were

The most important results of its legislative work include:
draft amendments to the Constitution and a draft Contract Law to
be submitted to the current NPC session for examination, and laws
that have been enacted including the Securities Law and the
Organic Law on Villagers' Committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the following five measures taken by the legislature
to improve its legislative work:
</P>
<P>
--to make annual, five-year and long-term plans for legislation.
The NPC Standing Committee of this term has set as its goal the
establishment of a basic socialist legal framework with Chinese
characteristics by the end of this century. It also worked out a
plan for legislation in the next five years and is considering
working on an outline for legislative work from now till the year
2010;
</P>
<P>
-- to enact and amend laws under the guidance of the
Constitution and in the fundamental interests of the people and
the overall interests of the nation;
</P>
<P>
-- to take into consideration China's basic national conditions
and absorb the experience of foreign countries when enacting laws
to ensure that they incorporate the results of the reform while
leaving room for further improvement;
</P>
<P>
--to adhere to the mass line and solicit public opinion on a
broad basis. The draft law on land management and the draft of a
revised organic law on villagers' committee, for example, were
published on newspapers prior to their enactment to get comments
and suggestions from the general public;
</P>
<P>
--to improve legislation quality by spending more time on the
deliberation of bills. Drafts of laws have to undergo three rounds
of deliberations at the NPC Standing Committee before they are
adopted, as against the old practice of two rounds of
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
Talking about legislative work in years to come, Jiang said the
NPC Standing Committee of this term is expected to enact or amend
89 laws, 29 of which will be examined this year, including law on
tender invitation, law on solely-funded enterprises, trust law,
law on labor contract, law on administrative appeal and
legislation law.
</P>
<P>
"We have a tough task ahead as reforms have entered a crucial
stage," he said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Exams Draft Contracts Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A unified, comprehensive contracts
law was tabled at the Second Session of the Ninth National People'
s Congress (NPC) for examination here today.
</P>
<P>
Gu Angran, chairman of the Commission of Legislative Affairs
under the NPC Standing Committee, made explanations on the draft
contracts law to the NPC session today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the guidelines of drafting the contracts law are:
To draft a unified and relatively comprehensive contracts law by
preceding from China's actual conditions and absorbing useful
international experience under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping
Theory so as to guarantee healthy development of socialist market
economy;
</P>
<P>
To pay attention to maintaining coherence and consistence of
law and to supplement and perfect the contracts law by summarizing
practice experience on the basis of the existing Economic
Contracts Law, Law on Economic Contracts involving Foreign
Interests and Law on Technological Contracts;
</P>
<P>
To place importance on easiness for administration by absorbing
as many rules as possible from administrative regulations and
judicial interpretation on contracts that proved to be effective
in the past decade and making the most detailed stipulations
possible on rules that have to be added.
</P>
<P>
China has put into force three contracts laws in the past two
decades, including the Economic Contracts Law, the Law on Economic
Contracts Involving Foreign Interests and the Law on Technological
Contracts.
</P>
<P>
"These three contracts laws have made significant contributions
to safeguarding rights and interests of contract parties,
maintaining social and economic order, promoting economic growth,
technological advances and expansion of foreign economic and trade
affairs and guaranteeing smooth progress of the cause of socialist
construction," Gu said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that as China continues reforms and
opens wider to the outside world, the regulating scopes and some
rules of the three contracts laws are no longer compatible with
new economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The draft contracts law tabled today has an enlarged regulating
scope comparing with that of the three previous contracts laws.
</P>
<P>
The basic principles that the draft contracts law stipulates
for contracts are "equality, willingness; fairness, honesty and
credibility, and law-abiding."
</P>
<P>
Gu said that the principle of willingness reflects basic
characteristics of civil activities. It is a unique principle that
marks the difference between a civil law and administrative and
criminal laws. It is also the objective requirement in developing
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the parties involved have the right to conclude
contracts according to their own will. However, he pointed out
that they must exert the right in line with the law. The content
and process of concluding the contracts must also be in line with
the law and administrative regulations.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Exams Draft Contracts Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Referring to conclusion and fulfillment of contracts, he
pointed out that the rights and duties of the parties involved
should be defined by conclusion of contracts. He said that taking
every thing possible into consideration before concluding
contracts will be conducive to safeguarding the legal rights and
interests of the parties involved, reduce disputes in executing
contracts and facilitate prompt solutions to disputes in case they
crop up.
</P>
<P>
He noted that fulfillment of contracts is linked with interests
of the parties involved and significant for commodity circulation
and economic development.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the draft contracts law emphasizes the
principle of complete fulfillment of contracts. That is to say
that the parties involved have to perform their specific duties
according to agreement in contracts and either of them must not
change or stop performing the duties unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the parties involved to fulfill contracts,
maintain trade order in market, compensate losses that incur on
other parties by violating contracts and safeguard the legitimate
rights and interests of the parties involved, the draft contracts
law goes further to perfect rules on liabilities of violation of
contracts, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This an important rule to ensure that the parties involved
will perform their duties in accordance with contracts," Gu
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The sub-provisions of the draft contracts law retain the forms
of contracts that the existing three contracts laws stipulate,
including contracts of supply and sales, electricity supply and
usage, fund lending, leasing, project undertaking, project
engineering, transport, storage and preservation and technology.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in light of new development in economic and
trade and practice of legal trials, the draft contracts law
stipulates additional forms of contracts, including contracts of
leasing for fund raising, donation, trust, brokerage and mediation.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that the existing Economic Contracts Law, Law on
Economic Contracts Involving Foreign Interests and Law on
Technological Contracts will be ceased immediately after the new
contracts law is adopted.
</P>
<P>
Rules of previous administrative regulations, local laws and
regulations and other regulations on contracts will also be sorted
out. The rules that do not go with rules of the contracts law will
be modified, and some of them will be abolished.

<HEADLINE> 15,000 Sri Lankan Villagers Freed From Tamil Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Around 15,000 Sri Lankan civilians
living in 25 villages in northern Wanni area have been liberated
from the clutches of the Tamil rebels, the official Daily News
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government troops captured about 535 square kilometers of
land under the operation "Rana Gosa" (the Sound of the War)
launched last Thursday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It is the first government offensive since a limited operation
in early December, in which troops captured a triangular area of
land.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the troops had met with almost no resistance
from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), although they
were ready to meet any contingency.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Anurudha Ratwatte and heads of the
security forces visited the liberated areas and mingled with the
villagers who reportedly complained that the rebels had treated
them very badly and even robbed their food rations, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Measures have been adopted to ensure adequate food supplies and
security for the civilians in the newly liberated areas, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a Defense Ministry press release said that troops
involved in the operation continue to dominate the newly captured
areas where rehabilitation work has been immediately started.
</P>
<P>
LTTE rebels have been waging a war against the government since
1983 for a separate state of its own in the north and east of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Remains Opposed to NATO-Led Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said Monday a peace deal expected to be signed during
the second-stage talks in France should not let "foreign troops
police any peace accord on Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
When meeting with visiting German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, who serves as the rotating chairman of the European Union,
Milosevic said that the peace deal should not impose others' views
on Yugoslavia, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia stood firm for a political solution to the
Kosovo issue on the basis of respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Serbia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He added the key of a political settlement of the Kosovo issue
is to respect and uphold the equality of all ethnic groups in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A peace conference is scheduled for March 15 after the
Rambouillet talks ended with both sides expressing reservations
over an interim autonomy plan for the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said the issue of the international community's
presence in Kosovo has been resolved in an agreement reached last
October between Yugoslavia and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in European (OSCE) on sending OSCE civilian observers
to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The international community has no reason to continue to put
pressure on Yugoslavia as it has been unswervingly carrying out
all international obligations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic also said he hoped that the European nations would
support the ongoing anti-terrorism struggle in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Asks International Community to Stop Aid for Kosovo Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia on Monday urged the
international community to cut off all channels of financial and
military support for ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for the
province's independence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said that
cutting off the rebels' supply lines would greatly help the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had briefed Fischer on the Serbian government
delegation's preparations to continue peace talks in France this
month.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, noted
that the peace agreement to be signed at the next stage must be
based on respect for Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and substantial autonomy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He called on the parties concerned to use the talks to be held
in France on March 15 to make substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian delegation, under pressure from the Western
countries, reached an outline peace agreement with the ethnic
Albanian delegation after 17 days of talks in Rambouillet near
Paris last month.
</P>
<P>
Both NATO and EU have said that the results of the first stage
of talks are not renegotiable and what the parties should discuss
is how to implement that agreement.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says NATO Force Indispensable to Kosovo Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Monday that a NATO force was indispensable to a Kosovo
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference that started here Monday to mark the
15-nation military alliance's 50th anniversary, Blair said a
peacekeeping force from NATO was vital to the peace agreement,
which the Contact Group on former Yugoslavia is urging the rivalry
parties in the Serbian province of Kosovo to sign as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Political agreement is not enough: the Balkans are littered
with agreements that are signed but not implemented," he told the
conference.
</P>
<P>
"To make an agreement work, to bring stability to Kosovo, an
international force is an indispensable element. Only NATO is
equipped to lead it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Western community wants to convene a peace conference in
France on March 15 to put the finishing touches to an interim
autonomy deal.
</P>
<P>
Last month, initial talks for peace in Kosovo ended after 17
days in France with no conclusive result.
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept prevarication in the negotiations. No side
can be allowed to obstruct the process," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Blair argued for stronger defense links between
the European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
"We Europeans should not expect the United States to play a
part in every disorder in our own backyard. The European Union
should be able to take on some security tasks on our own," Blair
argued.
</P>
<P>
His message was echoed by German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping, who set a target of two years to integrate Europe's
defense capabilities into the EU.
</P>
<P>
"It also includes integrating the Western European Union into
the EU soon. Concrete ideas on how this could be done should be
developed in the near future so that they can be implemented soon,
which means within a time frame of about two years," Scharping
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants its NATO allies to take a greater share
of the defense burden but is wary of French-inspired plans to give
European members independent decision-making powers.
</P>
<P>
NATO has repeatedly threatened to strike at Serb forces in and
around Kosovo if Belgrade is deemed to be blocking a deal to end
the conflict in the ethnic Albanian region.
</P>
<P>
But a settlement in Kosovo seemed as far away as ever on Monday
when the Albanians raised serious objections to the peace plan
designed by the Contact Group, which they appear unwilling to sign
up at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. senator Bob Dole, who was sent to Yugoslavia last
week as a representative of President Bill Clinton to mediate
peace in Kosovo, said in London last Saturday that Kosovo
Albanians "will" sign the peace agreement on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price on New Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The average OPEC oil basket price
rose to 10.44 U.S. dollars per barrel last week from 10.17 dollars
in the previous week, as showed by statistics released here Monday
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The average OPEC oil price in February stood at 10.02 dollars
per barrel, down 0.72 dollars compared with 10.74 dollars in
January, and also lower than the average price of 12.28 dollars
last year and 18.68 dollars in 1997 as well as the OPEC reference
price of 21 dollars.
</P>
<P>
As the oil reserves of the United States and other major oil
consuming nations have declined recently and the OPEC members and
some non-OPEC countries are reported to seek ways to prevent oil
prices from diving, oil prices on the international market have
gained slightly.
</P>
<P>
The cold weather in the United States and Europe have also
contributed to fuel price hikes.
</P>
<P>
However, market analysts are uncertain whether oil prices will
maintain the rising trend.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Mindanao Peace Process Under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Mindanao peace process may
suffer another setback if fierce fighting erupts between the New
People's Army and the government troops who are preparing to
rescue by force four army and police officers abducted by the
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that more government troops are being
deployed in Mindanao, the southern Philippines, for military
operations if the New People's Army (NPA), the military wing of
the National Democratic Front (NDF), refuses to release the four
officers.
</P>
<P>
The four are Brig. Gen. Victor Obillo, Army Capt. Eduardo
Montealto, Police Chief Inspector Roberto Bernal and Army Sgt.
Alipio Lozada. They have been abducted in the past month by the
NPA, which is demanding a prison swap with the government.
</P>
<P>
Following the abduction, President Joseph Estrada indefinitely
suspended formal peace talks with the NDF, making a lasting peace
in Mindanao more distant.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said that the
rebel group should immediately release the military and police
officers without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The government's position is clear and simple: no ifs, no
buts, free the hostages before peace negotiations are resumed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that if any fighting breaks out between the
two sides, it will take time for the two sides to heal the wound.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Mindanao peace process
has been almost derailed by conflicts between the government and
the country's rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
In January, when Estrada was told that the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) wants independence, he ordered the
military to shoot back. Government troops engaged MILF rebels in a
series of bloody skirmishes that broke a 1997 cease-fire, and
turned the rebel group's home base, Maguindanao, into a no-man's
land.
</P>
<P>
In the two-week-old fighting, 60 people were killed, scores
wounded and 90,000 residents were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
In response, the 12,000-strong MILF, which has been fighting
for an independent Islamic state in Mindanao since 1978,
threatened to launch a holy war against the government.
</P>
<P>
To save the peace process, President Estrada had planned a
meeting with MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat during his trip to
Mindanao early this month.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada canceled the meeting in the last minute
because of disputes over security arrangements. Critics said that
Estrada missed an opportunity to heal the wound by canceling the
scheduled meeting.
</P>
<P>
At present, the government is trying to woo the rebels back to
the negotiation table, but there are many obstacles lying on the
way to a lasting peace in the Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, both the government and the rebels would not easily
make any compromise over their major objectives in the future
talks.
</P>
<P>
While the MILF is demanding the establishment of a Muslim state
in Mindanao, the government insists that the territorial integrity
is non- negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, it will take years for the government to resolve the
poverty issue in Mindanao, the root cause of insurgency in the
south.
</P>
<P>
For the past three decades, the economic development in
Mindanao has lagged behind the rest of the country, although it
produces 25 percent of the nation's rice and 70 percent of its
corn, partly because of a war, and partly because of the
government's ignorance.
</P>
<P>
Even after the government and the Moro National Liberation
Front signed a peace accord to end a 30-year-old war in Mindanao
in September 1996, the government did not allocate enough funds to
the region.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the government promised to start a series of projects
in the region, including a 266 million U.S. dollar sugar mill and
refinery, a 69 million dollar irrigation program, and a 1,400-km
railway that would circle the entire island of Mindanao. But it
would take many years to complete these projects.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the MILF and the NDF have formed an alliance against
the government in addition to other sabotage activities by Abu
Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, some observers accused the government of failing to
adopt a flexible attitude toward rebels.
</P>
<P>
If the government fails to adopt new strategies to keep the
peace process on track, the situation in Mindanao may continue to
deteriorate in the months ahead, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Rating Downgrade Groundless: BoCom Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Communications BoCom)
regretted Standard &AMP; Poor's demotion of credit rating, regarding
it as a biased decision, today's China Daily quoted a senior
official with Bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official claimed that the credit rating agency's conclusion
was groundless, saying the Ministry of Finance has been consistent
in injecting capital to support the bank's development.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank, also
spared no efforts to support CoBom since it was reconstructed into
a share-holding commercial bank in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Standard &AMP; Poor's downgraded BoCom's long-term credit rating to
BB plus on March 1.
</P>
<P>
Standard and Poor's decision does not accord with BoCom's
actual performance, the senior official said.
</P>
<P>
As of 1998, despite the adverse impact of the Asian financial
crisis, the bank still achieved an assets volume of 183.9 billion
yuan (58.8 billion US dollars), an increase of 7.6 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that BoCom's assets quality has been strictly
controlled in line with the PBOC's stipulations, and its capital
adequacy ratio is maintained higher than 8 percent, which is
required by the Bank for International Settlements.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting BoCom's achievements in all lines of its operations,
the bank was honored as China's best performing bank for 1998 by
Euromoney, a magazine recognized worldwide, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"But to our great regret, Standard and Poor's reached a
lopsided conclusion while overlooking all these hard facts," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
An absence of a thorough understanding of China's economic
development and financial reforms was the main cause behind the
credit rating demotion, said the official.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members on Preventing Financial Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China's top advisors raised
suggestions on preventing possible financial risks amid
increasingly faster economic globalization and trade
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), who are here attending
the committee's annual session, expressed views and raised
suggestions on the subject at group discussions in the last couple
of days on Premier Zhu Rongji's government work report.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that in 1998, China maintained the stability of
its currency Renminbi and the local stock markets despite the
negative impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xiao Zhuoji of Beijing University said that, to
ensure financial security, the first thing to do is to develop the
financial sector. He attributed China's stable financial industry
to its consistent growth over the years and the supervisory and
control experience the government has gained in the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Economist Dong Fureng expressed concern about bad loans
extended to enterprises. He expressed appreciation for the
government's recent moves to deal with some banks and non-bank
institutions, such as investment and trust companies, that have
been engaged in irregular activities.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Shiying from Hunan Economic and Financial
College proposed strengthening supervision over financial
institutions and their activities, especially overseas-funded
banking institutions and financial activities that involve
operations overseas. China should make further efforts to build a
monitoring network on financial safety, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the relationship between preventing financial
risks and assisting economic development, Liu Hongru, a vice
chairman of the China Financial Society, said that banks should
not be reluctant to grant loans for fear of no repayment but that
they should also guard against lending that is too risky.
</P>
<P>
A strong support from banks is necessary for the realization of
this year's growth target, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ren Wenyan, chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and
Commerce, proposed that local banks grant more loans to small and
medium-sized enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM Vows to Push for Signing Kosovo Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli
Majko on Monday pledged efforts to push for the signing of the
Rambouillet peace deal by the warring sides in neighboring
Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with senior officials of the Foreign
Ministry, Majko said the Rambouillet peace package, brokered by
the six-nation Contact Group in France last month, is an essential
link in the chain of events seeking to settle the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said Albania, through close cooperation with the
international community as well as with Kosovo's ethnic Albanians,
has changed its role as being part of the Kosovo problem to being
an active force to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of the second phase of the peace talks,
due to start on March 15, he said Albania would participate more
actively than it did in the first phase.

<HEADLINE> Italy Reiterates Demand for Punishment Over Cable Car Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema on Monday reiterated Italy's demand that those responsible
for the Mt. Cermis cable car tragedy last year be punished.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly press briefing, D'Alema said legal procedures in
the United States have not yet been completed and that even U.S.
President Bill Clinton had recognized that the United States was
responsible for the incident.
</P>
<P>
He said defense officials from both countries are re-examining
security measures to protect the civilian population near NATO
bases in Italy.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military court acquitted marine pilot Richard Ashby of
responsibility in the death of 20 tourists killed on February 3,
1998, when his low-flying plane snipped their cable car wires.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling, based on the fact that Ashby and crew were
given incorrect maps and had instrument problems, sparked
indignation in the home countries of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Three of the victims were Italian, seven German, five Belgian,
two from Poland, two from Austria and one from Holland.
</P>
<P>
In Washington on Saturday, D'Alema urged Clinton to see that
justice was done.
</P>
<P>
Clinton apologized for the incident and said the U.S. would
offer adequate compensation.
</P>
<P>
Italian political parties have unanimously called for a review
of rules governing NATO bases in Italy and the jurisdiction of
trials in such cases.
</P>
<P>
The Italian and U.S. defense ministries have agreed to work out
new rules to prevent a recurrence of the Mt. Cermis tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Central Bank Cuts Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Urging the banking system to follow
its lead, The Central Bank of Philippines (BSP) reduced its key
interest rates and other term rates Monday.
</P>
<P>
The BSP's overnight lending and borrowing rates were reduced by
25 basis points to 14.25 percent and 12.25 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The rate cuts followed last week's announcement of the
inflation rate in February as having fallen to single-digit levels
-- down to 9.9 percent from 11.5 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
"We approved the rate cuts during the Monetary Board's meeting
last Wednesday," BSP Governor Gabriel Singson said Monday. "There
was a condition that the February inflation should be lower than
11.6 percent recorded in January before a reduction of BSP's
interest rates could be done."
</P>
<P>
The central bank's move and the announcement of a lower
inflation rate last month triggered an across-the-board reduction
in Treasury Bill yields in Monday's weekly auction, with the
benchmark 91-day rate falling to 12.318 percent from last week's
12.489 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 182-day rate fell to 12.637 percent from 12.742 percent,
while the 364-day rate dropped to 12.839 percent from 12.962
percent.
</P>
<P>
With the bellwether Treasury Bill rate at 12.318 percent,
commercial banks' lending rates should fall within a range of
13.818 percent to 18.818 percent, from last week's range of 13.939
percent to 18.989 percent.
</P>
<P>
A "gentlemen's agreement" still exists among commercial banks
that would set their lending rates at 1.5 - 6.5 percentage points
above the 91-day Treasury Bill rate.
</P>
<P>
A lower BSP borrowing rate should discourage banks from lending
to the central bank, while a lower BSP lending rate should
encourage them to seek more loans from the central bank which they
in turn could use to lend to borrowing clients, thus encouraging
business.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Send Best Shuttlers to SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will send its top
badminton players for the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in
Bandar Seri Begawan in August, the National Sports Council (KONI)
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mochamad Hindarto, KONI chief for athletes development, said
the participation of the country's best shuttlers in the games was
part of their preparation for international events next year,
including Thomas and Uber Cup championships and Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto discussed the plan with Mangombar Ferdinand Siregar of
the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI).
</P>
<P>
Siregar refused to name the players who would be enlisted in
the SEA Games team.
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about first string or second string of
players here, but we decided to send the best team to SEA Games
and we feel the Thomas and Uber Cup teams fit out requirement," he
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Badminton is among 21 sports to be contested at the biennial
Games, which will be held in Brunei for the first time. Indonesia,
the overall winner in the last Games held in Jakarta two years ago,
plans to compete in 20 sports.
</P>
<P>
The 20th SEA Games will be held from August 7 to August 12.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said KONI had ordered 20 sports federations to start
training programs for the Games by early April at the latest.
</P>
<P>
So far, training programs for athletes in track and field,
cycling, swimming and sepak takraw had already started.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said athletes should aim to beat or equal the records
of their compatriots set in the last SEA Games during training.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls on Women to Join in Building Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Minister of Social Welfare,
Relief and Resettlement Brigadier-General Pyi Sone has called on
women in the country to participate in the nation-building and
all-round development projects.
</P>
<P>
Pyi Sone, who is also chairman of the Myanmar National
Committee for Women's Affairs (NCWA), made the call at a ceremony
here Monday marking the International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
He recalled sending a Myanmar delegation to the International
Women's Conference held in Beijing in September 1995, saying that
the country has been implementing the action plans laid down at
the conference.
</P>
<P>
For the successful implementation of the plan, the Myanmar NCWA
was formed on July 3, 1996, comprising of officials of the
government, social welfare associations and women's organizations.
</P>
<P>
The day, on which the NCWA was set up, has been later observed
as Myanmar Women's Day every year, while the country started
marking the International Women's Day in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar NCWA carries out activities such as reduction of
the number of illiterate women, poverty, women's health
improvement, domestic science, prevention of violence against
women, rehabilitation and all-round development of women.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar held its first women's conference last December and
later hosted the regional consultation on violence against women
and the role of health sector in cooperation with the World Health
Organization in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Of Myanmar's total population of 46.4 million in the 1997-98
fiscal year, 23.6 million or 50.34 percent are women, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
A census conducted in 1994 showed that 46 percent of Myanmar
women above the age of 10 were in the labor force in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national literacy rate of women has gone up to
71.3 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has now stationed 8,000 troops in Macedonia,
in preparation for an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
a senior NATO military official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The number is expected to reach 10,000 this week, NATO
spokesman Major Jen Jonsen said at the NATO press center in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Most of the soldiers came from France, Britain, Germany, Italy
and the Netherlands, and others were from the United States,
Canada, Belgium, Greece and Turkey, Jonsen said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the Macedonian Information Agency, NATO'
s logistics equipment, including tanks, other vehicles and
generators, is entering Macedonia through the border with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Yugoslav province of Serbia and Kosovar
ethnic Albanians held talks on the Kosovo issue at Rambouillet
near Paris in February, which, in principle, reached some
agreement. The two sides will continue their talks on March 15 in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
NATO had planned to send some 28,000 soldiers to Kosovo after
the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians reached an agreement. However,
the Yugoslav authorities have so far refused to allow foreign
troops to enter Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji's government
work report delivered at the ongoing session of the Ninth National
People's Congress has drawn favorable responses throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
Many interviewed by Xinhua agree that the report is pragmatic,
seeks truth from facts and is encouraging, and that the national
economic growth rate for this year set in the report is feasible.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yiren, a vice mayor of Shanghai, said that what this
largest industrial city in China has achieved in recent years
proves that the central government's policy to turn around money-
losing state-owned enterprises before the end of the century is
correct.
</P>

According to the official, Shanghai has reduced the averaged
debt rate of industrial enterprises to 54 percent and the
workforce of local state enterprises to 850,000 people, while a
social security system, medical insurance and pension insurance
for retirees have been established and developed in the city.
</P>
<P>
Cao Banggong, a senior engineer from Beijing, said he is deeply
touched by what the premier said about the government's financial
policy: "Implementing a proactive financial policy does not mean
that we can spend money freely; rather, we should treasure and be
economical about people's sweat money."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baofeng, a woman laid off from a Beijing-based state
factory, said that the government work report gives priority to
raising funds for providing a basic living standard guarantee for
workers laid off from state enterprises and to their re-employment.
"This is exactly we are thinking about," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We should also change our views on employment, changing the
attitude of being not willing to do dirty and hard work," she said.
</P>
<P>
The government work report is also assuring for Huang Shihe, a
local farmer in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province. "The premier
has promised to continue the Party's basic rural policy and I'm
completely reassured," said the farmer who bought a mobile phone
after hearing Zhu's report on television.
</P>
<P>
Huang said he will sell his vegetables produced in greenhouses
to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government work report has also won appreciation from
university teachers and scientists as well as people living in
areas inhabited mainly by ethnic minorities..

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Sanction Violators of Currency Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
impose sanctions against those who bring more than 5 million
rupiah (600 U.S. dollars) in or out of the country, Bank Indonesia
Governor Sjahril Sabirin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This step is important if we are to avoid the appearance of
fake rupiah printed overseas, as well as to reduce the risk of
rupiah speculation abroad," Sabirin said on the sidelines of a
hearing with the House of Representatives over the draft bank
regulation.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will be in the form of fines as well as
imprisonment, Sabirin was quoted by the Indonesian Observer
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government issued the limitation through a joint decree of
the minister of finance and Bank Indonesia governor following the
monetary crisis that has rampaged through the country's economy.
Previously, the limit was set at 50,000 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been badly hit by the regional currency turmoil
with the rupiah losing more than 70 percent of its value against
the U.S. dollar at the height of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speculators have been blamed for exacerbating the depreciation
of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"The two previous regulations did not explicitly mention any
sanctions. Therefore all kinds of violation could go unpunished,"
Sabirin said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will go into effect as soon as the central bank
draft is passed into law.
</P>
<P>
"This limitation is different from foreign exchange control.
There are many kinds of foreign exchange traffic -- not only in
the form of money -- and this traffic is not yet subject to
limitation," Sabirin added.
</P>
<P>
The crisis-hit country is still committed to a free foreign
exchange regime although it also applies a monitoring system.

<HEADLINE> Sea Paasageway for Southwest China Inland Region Built (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China has spent billions of U.S.
dollars on building a passageway to the sea for its southwestern
inland regions, where economic growth was long held back by
transportation difficulties, officials from these regions said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The basically completed passageway links the entire
southwestern regions, including the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan
and Guizhou and the Chongqing Municipality and the coastal Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region which has a number of deep-water ports
along the coastline of the South China Sea, said the officials,
who are here attending the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Going through this passageway, cargo transportation from
southwest China to the Southeast Asia and other parts of the world
can spare distance by several hundred and even thousands of
kilometers compared with going via ports in Shanghai or south
China's Guangdong province, they added.
</P>
<P>
"The building of this passageway has cost the central and local
governments dearly," said NPC deputy Li Jiating, who is also
provincial governor of Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the passage consists of a railway costing nearly
20 billion yuan (about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars) between Nanning
and Kunming, capitals of Guangxi and Yunnan respectively, an
express highway which is the longest in central and western China,
and 15 berths for 10,000-ton-class vessels at three major ports in
Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the southwestern provinces and Guangxi
region have invested another several billion yuan to have 49
separate trans-provincial highways connected with each other to
expand the coverage of the new sea passageway.

<HEADLINE> Sea Passageway for Southwest China Inland Region Built (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economists here noted that in recent years, Chinese leaders
have been increasingly concerned about the country's central and
western regions which over the past two decades have lagged far
behind the eastern coastal areas in economic development.
</P>
<P>
The southwest regions, where dozens of ethnic minorities live,
have abundant reserves of coal, iron, tin, aluminum and other
natural resources. Due to geographical and historical reasons,
however, they have remained one of the country's underdeveloped
areas.
</P>
<P>
While participating in a panel discussion of the Guangxi
delegation to the current NPC session last week, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin urged all southwest China provinces to make full use
of their own advantages, give full play to the role of the newly-
built sea passageway and open wider to the outside world to
promote their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"In response to the central government's call, all southwest
China provinces have stepped up efforts to develop industries with
their own characteristics, such as grain processing, coal mining
and tourism," said the governor of Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputy Wang Shuqing, deputy director of the Liuzhou
Railway Administration in Guangxi, said that prompted by the
emergence of the sea passageway, the Baise Prefecture, which used
to be the poorest area in the autonomous region, has established
itself as the country's largest base for mango and winter
vegetables growing and for the aluminum industry.
</P>
<P>
"Now almost everyone in that area has been provided with
adequate food and clothing," he added.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Clashes Erupt in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed
Monday in fresh religious clashes in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's
Maluku province, according to the Indonesian Observer Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I have checked with the governor and two people were killed,"
Major General Suaidy Marabessy said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted witnesses as saying that the two people were
Christians beaten by a mob in Pohon Mangga near Ambon city.
</P>
<P>
Another said fresh clashes between Muslims and Christians had
broken out in Pasu area Monday, injuring at least 10 people.
</P>
<P>
There were unconfirmed reports of sporadic unrest in several
other areas on the island.
</P>
<P>
The clashes were initially set off by the explosion of homemade
bombs made from fertilizer, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,300 kilometers east of Jakarta, Ambon has been
rocked by religious unrest that has killed more than 200 people
this year and forced thousands to flee the territory.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said more than 400 others were injured since
religious clashes erupted in the province in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
In Ambon, about 60 percent of the population is Christian. The
rest are mostly Muslims, many of them immigrants from other
islands.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the military sent in a team of officers --
all of them originally from the spice islands -- to help restore
peace.
</P>
<P>
Even with an extra 3,000 troops sent in last week, the military
has appeared powerless to stop the clashes which first erupted
last January.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Ambon city, much of it in ruins, remained high
Monday and witnesses said Muslims and Christians had set up check
points along roads in their areas, the Indonesian Observer added.

<HEADLINE> New Move in Anti-Euro Campaign in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Conservative
Party Monday opened a new phase of its battle to prevent Britain
from joining Europe's single currency on Monday by setting up a
commission to examine the benefits of keeping sterling.
</P>
<P>
Conservative leader William Hague told a news conference the
commission, under former trade secretary Sir John Nott, would look
at how Britain could prosper if it chose to retain the pound.
</P>
<P>
Hague has ruled out Conservative support for Britain adopting
the euro in the current parliament or the next, which could mean
as late as 2007, according to local median reports.
</P>
<P>
A vast majority of Conservative members supported this policy
in a ballot last year, but party heavyweights such as former
deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine and ex-finance minister
Kenneth Clarke have publicly supported the euro.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has promised a referendum on whether
Britain adopts the euro, Hague claimed that by publishing a
National Changeover Plan last month, Prime Minister Tony Blair was
trying to push Britons into going along with the idea.
</P>
<P>
"He wants to change the cash registers, change the computer
software, change the banking systems so that in the end he can
turn round to the British people and say that they have no choice
but to change their currency," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nott said the commission wanted "to establish the facts to
convince businessmen, in particular, that we can continue to
prosper with an independent currency".
</P>
<P>
It would consider trade flows, how sterling could stand alone
beside the euro and the dollar, and the experiences of other
stand-alone currencies, the Canadian dollar within the North
American Free Trade Association, and the Swiss franc.
</P>
<P>
It would also examine what status should be given to the Bank
of England if the pound remained, the position of the City of
London banking district and how Britain outside the euro could
remain a magnet for inward investment.

<HEADLINE> Canada To Send Special Envoy To Assess Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Monday that it
will send a special envoy to assess the political, humanitarian
and security situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy, Parliament Member David Pratt named by
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworhy Monday, will travel to New York on
March 12 for discussions with UN and other officials in an effort
to restore peace and stability in Sierra Leone. He then plans to
travel to Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Conakry, Guinea later this
month.
</P>
<P>
"Canada remains concerned about the atrocities committed upon
civilians, including women and children, by the rebel groups,"
said Axworthy in a release.
</P>
<P>
"These visits will give Mr. Pratt the opportunity to see
first-hand how Canada can best support efforts to rebuild peace
and stability, and provide humanitarian assistance in Sierra
leone. We are exploring the means for providing additional support
to civilians, particularly children," added the Minister.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Pratt will meet with Francis Okello, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Sierra Leone, and with
Fode M.Dabor, Charge d'Affaires of the Republic of Sierra Leone,
as well as other official representatives.
</P>
<P>
This visit is in preparation for the mission to West Africa,
which will aid Pratt in making recommendations to the Minister
before Axworthy participates in the Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group(CMAG) in London on April 29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
Sierra leone is one of the three countries under review by the
CMAG, which has a mandate to recommend collective Commonwealth
responses to serious or persistent violations of the principles
contained in the harare Declaration on human rights and democracy.
</P>
<P>
As a Security Council member, Canada will also support the
extension of the UN Observer Mission in Sierra Leone(UNOMSIL),
which is due for renewal later this week, said the release.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Stages Comeback in Freetown as Situation Stabilizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
returning to Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, as the military
and political situation stabilizes, a U.N. special envoy said here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special representative for Sierra Leone, Francis Okelo
of Uganda, told reporters after briefing the U.N. Security Council
that "the situation in Freetown has very much stabilized."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Nigerian-led West African peacekeepers, known
as ECOMOG, and the Sierra Leonean Government troops intended to
"pursue this process into the other parts of the country as well."
</P>
<P>
The rebels invaded Freetown on January 6, unleashing more than
fighting before being flushed out of the capital into surrounding
suburbs and adjacent hills by ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
Up to 5,000 people were killed during the invasion and vast
areas of the city were razed by rebel-set fires, reports said. The
fighting forced the United Nations to evacuate its small observer
mission to neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
An advance party was in Freetown on Monday to prepare for the
mission's return, Okelo said, adding that U.N. relief agencies
also planned to return to Freetown to resume their work there "and
hopefully in the rest of the country."
</P>
<P>
A senior British envoy said here on Monday that the 15-member
Security Council is expected to make a decision on the extension
of the mandate of the U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone
(UNOMSIL) on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania President Guards Tanganyika-Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 8 (Xinhua) --Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa maintained Monday that it is illogical for talking about
separating Tanzania following 35 years of its existence.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is on a one-day tour to the Pemba Island under the
rule of the Zanzibar Revolutionary Government, declared that the
union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar will stay forever, sources
from Zanzibar said.
</P>
<P>
During a private session with the ruling party Chama Cha
Mapinduzi (CCM) elders, Mkapa said that both the mainland and
Zanzibar isles could help each other in the cause of implementing
their development programs.
</P>
<P>
"After all these years, there is no available forum both on the
mainland and in Zanzibar where one could speak against the union,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Mkapa said the union government would pull
its resources together with those of Zanzibar government in ending
all inconveniences to the residents of Pemba who suffer from
electricity problem and poor state of roads.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when inspecting the electricity generating
plant at Wesha in Pemba, one of the two main parts of the Zanzibar
islands in western Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Tanganyika merged with Zanzibar, forming a union -- the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. According to the Tanzanian
constitution, the union has a president and a vice-president while
Zanzibar is ruled by its own president.
