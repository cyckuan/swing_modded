<HEADLINE> Hurricane Isaac's Winds Lessen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hurricane Isaac remained deep in the Atlantic and
posed no immediate threat to land as its winds decreased to 105 mph
Monday. Farther away, Tropical Storm Joyce formed off West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Isaac was about 1,280 miles east of the northern
Leeward Islands, at the eastern edge of the Caribbean, and moving
to the west-northwest at near 9 mph, according to the National
Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very far from land and in three days it's still going to
be very far away from the islands,'' said hurricane specialist
James Franklin. ''If it continues on its present track, it would
pass well north of the islands.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters also were tracking a tropical depression about 570
miles west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands that became Tropical
Storm Joyce late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Its top sustained winds were 40 mph, 1 mph over the threshold at
which a tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm.
Tropical storms become hurricanes when their top winds reach 74
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane specialist Jack Beven said the Joyce posed no
immediate threat to land.

<HEADLINE> No Progress In Cyprus Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX EFTY
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders
rejected U.N. ideas for breaking the long deadlock in negotiations
over the divided island as their latest round of reunification
talks ended Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are now scheduled to resume with a fifth round in Geneva
in November and what a Greek Cypriot source said would be a final,
sixth round back at U.N. headquarters in January.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by the U.N. special adviser on Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto,
to bridge differences proved ''unworkable,'' said Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader,
said he rejected ideas put forward by de Soto because they did not
comply with Security Council demands outlining the form of a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders spoke to reporters after their final separate
meetings with de Soto on the final 14th day of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash said ''they are trying to take part of our views and
part of Greek Cypriot views, but the emerging result is unworkable
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his long-standing demand that a settlement must be
based on ''the realities'' created by the 1974 Turkish invasion
that split the island into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and the
Turkish-occupied north. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the
north is only recognized by Ankara which maintains 35,000 troops
there.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash refuses to meet Clerides face-to-face in the talks
unless his state is recognized as a first step to reunification in
the form of a confederation of two sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council resolutions call for reunification as a single
sovereign state with one Greek and one Turkish Cypriot federal
region.

<HEADLINE> OAU Discusses Ivory Coast Tensions  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- African leaders brought their
campaign to restore calm to Ivory Coast directly to the country's
junta leader Monday, after he snubbed their summit and blocked
opposition leaders from attending.
</P>
<P>
   Heads of state or foreign ministers of least seven African
nations flew into Ivory Coast-- each in his own jet -- for the
impromptu talks with Gen. Robert Guei, who took power after the
country's first-ever coup nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's mission represented unusually open pressure by members
of the Organization of African Unity upon a fellow African leader,
underscoring their concern over growing tensions in what had long
been one of the most stable nations of West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The OAU leaders said they presented a series of ''concrete
proposals designed to advance the cause of democracy, peace and
stability in Ivory Coast,'' where Guei has promised presidential
elections on Oct. 22 to restore civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   The day of closed-door talks ended with no accord -- only the OAU
urging both Guei and his rivals to think seriously about the
proposals it had made.
</P>
<P>
   According to opposition leader Alassane Dramane Ouattara's
account after the talks, the OAU urged Guei to share power with
leaders of all the country's political parties in a transitional
government ahead of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   The OAU also asked Guei to postpone the vote to allow tensions
time to ease. Oauttara said they requested a four-month delay.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he said, the OAU leaders urged Guei not to bar Ouattara
-- , a former International Monetary Fund official -- or other rivals
from running against him in the presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be no manipulation for exclusion,'' Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo told the BBC, acknowledging suspicions
that Ivory Coast was planning to bar Guei's rivals from the race on
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast's junta leader had no immediate comment on the OAU's
proposals. Oauttara said he agreed with some of them -- but wouldn't
say which.
</P>
<P>
   Guei had refused to meet with the African leaders Sunday when
they convened a special OAU summit in nearby Togo on Ivory Coast's
crisis. But hegreeted his surprise guests when they showed up in
the commercial capital, Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Togo, Algeria, South Africa, Nigeria, Burkina Faso,
Djibouti and Senegal also flew in.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast's political party leaders, bluntly forbidden by Guei
to leave the country for the Togo summit, were ushered in later.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast, a 40-year-old nation of 20 million, has seen its
status as a tranquil financial center for the region shaken by a
fall in cocoa prices followed by the Christmas Eve coup.
</P>
<P>
   Guei's junta has quelled two limited military uprisings since
taking power. Last week, the government claims, loyalist forces
beat back an attempt by mutinous security forces to assassinate
Guei at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have risen since the alleged Sept. 18 attack, which
Ouattara's supporters suspect was a pretext for a crackdown on
Guei's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Oauttara's followers have surrounded the opposition
leader's house day and night for more than a week, shielding him
with their bodies from any moves against him by the junta.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is dividing Ivorians along ethnic and regional
lines, leaving Ivory Coast's neighbors worrying that any conflict
might spill over its borders.

<HEADLINE> Colts Lead Jaguars 26-14 After 3Q  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Peyton Manning threw touchdown passes to
Marvin Harrison, Terrence Wilkins and Jerome Pathon as Indianapolis
took a 26-14 lead over Jacksonville after three quarters Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Smith caught TD passes of 9 and 26 yards for Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison had a 76-yard touchdown reception on Indianapolis'
third play of the game, the longest TD catch of his career.
Jacksonville tied it on Smith's 9-yarder after a successful replay
challenge by Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, who extended his streak of consecutive games with a
reception to 63 with the TD catch, got behind cornerback Aaron
Beasley to snare Manning's pass in stride around the 25.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville, 5-0 in Monday night games, tied it in the second
quarter with a five-play, 44-yard drive that ended with Smith's TD.
Officials first ruled that one of his feet was out of bounds, but
referee Mike Carey overruled the call after looking at replays.
</P>
<P>
   The score was set up when Bryan Barker's punt was kept in play
by Reggie Barlow who leaped into the end zone and knocked the ball
back to the 2. After two false starts and two incomplete passes,
the Colts punted from deep in their end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Smith punted the ball 59 yards, but R. Jay Soward
returned the kick to the Indianapolis 45. After Mark Brunell
scrambled 7 yards for a first down, Jacksonville got a first down
when Jason Belser was penalized at the 9 defending Anthony Johnson.
Brunell then threw the TD pass.
</P>
<P>
   An interception by linebacker Mike Peterson set up the second
Indianapolis TD, giving the Colts the ball at the Jacksonville 26.
On third down, Manning connected with Wilkins who was playing for
the first time following a concussion in an August exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   On Indianapolis' next possession, the Colts moved 72 yards in
four plays with Manning completing a 16-yard toss to Pathon for the
score.
</P>
<P>
   Battling the clock, Jacksonville moved 75 yards in seven plays
to score on Brunell's pass to Smith. It was Smith's sixth TD catch
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis added five points in third quarter on Mike
Vanderjagt's 41-yard field goal and a safety. Chad Bratzke tackled
Brunell in the end zone for the Colts' third sack of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Manning completed his first seven passes for 126 yards and was
19-of-29 for 328 yards in three quarters. It was the eighth
300-yard game of his career and the eighth time he threw three TD
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins was Manning's top target with career highs of eight
catches and 127 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell completed 14 of 23 passes for 162 yards, but had only
one completion in three attempts for 3 yards in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Taylor, making his first start since tearing a ligament in
his left knee, had 59 yards on 13 carries in the first three
periods. Smith, the AFC leader in receptions and receiving yards
coming into the weekend, had six catches for 108 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, playing their first Monday night in nearly three
years, held Jacksonville to a net of minus two yards on only eight
plays in the third period. Indianapolis netted 143 yards in the
quarter.

<HEADLINE> Zijlaard Wins Gold for Netherlands  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Karen Kurreck's jersey was torn across
her back. Mari Holden's elbows and knees were scraped.
</P>
<P>
   And their bikes? Well, they were in worse shape than the riders.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the fourth of seven laps, the two American road
cyclists were done in the Olympic road race Tuesday (Monday night
EDT). Holden and Kurreck withdrew after a relentless series of
mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some days you just have really, really, really bad luck,''
Holden said with a laugh. ''I think I'm going to burn my socks,
burn my shirt. Maybe I'll just burn the whole outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   Good idea, except for two things. The way the rain fell all day,
the fire probably wouldn't start. And Holden still needs her
uniform for Saturday's time trial, an event where she's a five-time
national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Leontien Zijlaard of the Netherlands won her second gold medal
of the Sydney Games, sprinting out of a soggy pack to win in 3
hours, 6 minutes, 31 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hanka Kupfernagel of Germany won the silver medal, Diana Ziliute
of Lithuania won the bronze, and the Americans were left to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by crashes and mechanical problems, Kurreck of Los Altos
Hills, Calif., and Holden of Colorado Springs, Colo., had no choice
but to pull out and preserve themselves for the time trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt really good today, but it was a good decision to stop
and have a better race later this week,'' Holden said. ''It's so
frustrating to have good form but to have so many problems with the
bike.''
</P>
<P>
   That left Nicole Freedman of Stanford, Calif., who rode with the
lead pack through the first three laps, as the lone American. She
gradually fell off the pace and finished 47th, almost 22 minutes
behind Zijlaard.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman qualified for the road race by winning the Olympic
trials in Jackson, Miss., in May, the only at-large spot awarded on
the women's team. She didn't have much international racing
experience, and eventually it showed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I had a 1 percent chance coming into this race,'' she
said with a smile and a shrug. ''There were 57 riders and my world
ranking is 105, so at least I beat my international ranking.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurreck, the 1994 world time trial champion, crashed on the
first lap with two other riders, causing problems with her wheel.
After changing it, her brakes didn't adjust.
</P>
<P>
   She was lagging behind the lead pack and when she pulled into
the pits and dropped out just before finishing her third lap. As
she left, a big tear was visible across the back of her jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today was disappointing,'' Kurreck said. ''I'm just glad I get
another chance to come back Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   After Holden worked through problems with her chain, she changed
the wheel but then had difficulty shifting gears. After fixing the
problem, she crashed as she tried to catch the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Holden went to a reserve bike while mechanics worked on
the chain and rear wheel of the first. After she finally worked her
way back in the peleton, she got a flat on the second lap.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this was the only race they had, then for sure they would
have stayed in and tried to go all the way,'' said U.S. team leader
Sean Petty. ''But it made no sense with the time trial coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the final lap, 12 riders remained on the lead
pack, setting up a sprint finish under less-than-ideal racing
conditions. Rain began falling on the third of seven laps and
temperatures dropped into the low 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Zijlaard didn't seem to mind the weather, adding another gold
medal to the one she claimed last week on the track. She set a
world record in individual pursuit and took silver in the points
race.

<P>
   EAST ISLIP, N.Y. (AP) -- An explosion at a gas station shot
flames more than 100 feet in the air Monday night, shaking houses
up to three blocks away and forcing the evacuation of part of this
Long Island town.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of injuries. Suffolk County
police and firefighters were having difficulty approaching the area
because of the intensity of the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The fire erupted at about 10:45 p.m. at a Sunoco station on a
highway that runs along the southern edge of Long Island. The area
around the station was evacuated.

<HEADLINE> Gates Installed At Bus-Train Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENNGA, Ga. (AP) -- Gates and lights have been installed at a
railroad crossing where a train hit a school bus in March, killing
three children.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the crash, the rail crossing was marked only by
cross bucks, signs with white X's on poles. The crossing sits just
over the state line in Tennessee, where state law requires signals
to be installed after a fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
   The safety measures were activated earlier this month. CSX,
which owns the tracks, installed the guards and lights; county,
state and federal funds will pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla Silvers, 6; Amber Pritchett, 9; and Daniel Pack, 9, died
from injuries suffered when their Murray County school bus was hit
by the train March 28. The bus driver, Rhonda Cloer, faces 19
charges including vehicular homicide in Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 6, Rockies 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Randy Johnson won his 19th game as the Arizona
Diamondbacks kept alive their slim playoff hopes with a 6-4 victory
over the Colorado Rockies Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (19-6) allowed four runs and 10 hits in 7 2-3 innings.
He struck out eight and walked four as the Diamondbacks won for the
fourth time in five games.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped himself at the plate with two hits and an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Mantei pitched the ninth for his 17th save.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez, who was 3-for-5 with three RBIs, gave the
Diamondbacks the lead for good with a two-run single in the fifth
inning. Greg Colbrunn added a solo home run for Arizona, which
pulled within six games of the idle New York Mets for the NL Wild
Card spot.
</P>
<P>
   A loss would have eliminated the defending NL West Division
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Neifi Perez went 2-for-5 with a home run and Juan Pierre had
three hits and an RBI for the Rockies, who lost for the eighth time
in 10 games. Brian Rose (4-4) allowed four runs and seven hits in
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Perez hit his 10th home run the year in the first inning to give
the Rockies a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona tied it at 1 in the third inning on Matt Williams
one-out sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado regained the lead in the third on Butch Huskey's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Craig Counsell singled leading off the fifth inning.
After Bautista moved up the runners with a ground out to first,
Gonzalez singled past Jeff Cirillo at third scoring Johnson and
Counsell to give the Diamondbacks a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn extended the lead to 4-2 with his 15th home run of the
year in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies got a run back in the sixth to get within 4-3 on
Adam Melhuse's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez added an RBI single off Gabe White in the seventh
inning and Johnson made it 6-4 with a RBI single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: INF Tony Womack turned 31 Monday and is scheduled to have
his left knee scoped early Tuesday. Womack had been hobbled by a
cyst behind his left knee for the past three months. ... RHP Todd
Stottlemyre was scratched from his scheduled start on Tuesday and
instead will have surgery on his right elbow on Tuesday. ... Perez
is hitting .389 with three home runs and four RBIs against Johnson.
... With Johnson on the mound, the Rockies faced back-to-back
left-handed starters. Colorado had gone 22 games without facing a
left-handed starter between the Aug. 29 when they opposed Omar Daal
of Philadelphia and Sunday when they faced Florida's Jesus Sanchez.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Bridge Shut After Bomb Scare  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A heavily traveled bridge across Lake Washington,
connecting Seattle and its eastern suburbs, was closed during
evening rush hour Monday after some men in a pickup yelled to a
city bus driver that there was a bomb on board, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The bus stopped at an old toll plaza near the east end of the
Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and let the passengers off, and the
bridge was quickly was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb squad checked the bus and found no explosives, and the
bridge reopened about three hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Metro transit spokesman Frank Abe said three young men in the
truck had chased down the eastbound bus about 5:30 p.m. and yelled
at the driver that a bomb was on board. The bus driver reportedly
was able to get a license number of the pickup involved.

<HEADLINE> Tape May Link French Head To Scandal  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE GANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France's former finance minister has admitted
possessing the master copy of a videotape that allegedly implicates
President Jacques Chirac in a campaign finance scheme in the 1980s,
when Chirac was Paris mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The development Monday quickly pushed the case of alleged
illicit campaign financing from a tawdry tale, recounted in a
videotape by man who died last year, to an affair of state.
</P>
<P>
   Like a voice speaking from the grave, the self-described former
''banker'' in the scheme, Jean-Claude Mery, alleged in the video
that Chirac's conservative Rally for the Republic party was at the
center of a system set up to pump money from contractors in the
Paris region. Mery died last year.
</P>
<P>
   With word of former Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn's
involvement, Chirac telephoned Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin on Monday demanding that potential evidence concerning the
affair be turned over to judicial authorities. Strauss-Kahn is a
leading Socialist.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's office convened a crisis meeting with key ministers,
and later announced that, in keeping with Chirac's request,
pertinent documents were ''at the disposition of the judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   Jospin also called on Strauss-Kahn to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal broke on Thursday with publication in the daily Le
Monde of Mery's posthumous account of how Chirac's party, along
with other parties, allegedly pocketed illegal funds obtained from
fixed public construction jobs in the Paris region.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the transcript, Mery describes handing over
$649,000 in cash in 1986 to a Rally for the Republic official, in
the presence of Chirac, who was Paris mayor at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, who served as Paris mayor for 18 years until assuming
the presidency in 1995, issued a fierce denial in a Thursday
television broadcast, calling the allegations ''lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The tables turned over the weekend, with a report by the news
weekly L'Express that Strauss-Kahn possessed the master copy of the
tape.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss-Kahn admitted Monday that he had the video but had never
looked at it and told Le Monde he did not know where he had placed
it.
</P>
<P>
   The video was given to him in April 1999 by lawyer Alain Belot,
who said that ''this could interest you,'' the former minister told
Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he never said the president of the republic was being
implicated,'' Strauss-Kahn was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The political stakes in the scandal are high. Both Jospin and
Chirac are expected to be the likely candidates in 2002
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, France's constitutional court, debating on another
corruption case, ruled that Chirac can't face criminal charges as
long as he is president.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands 10, Greece 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Netherlands kept its water polo
medal chances alive by winning for the first time at the Olympics,
10-7, over Greece on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Dutch (1-3) will root like mad for the winless Greeks,
who face the United States in the final round-robin contest
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A win or a tie by the Americans would send them into the
quarterfinals and eliminate the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands will meet the undefeated Croatians to close the
first round. Even a victory, though, might not help since the
Netherlands lost to the United States, 12-8, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Harry van Der Meer scored three goals for the Netherlands. Arno
Havenga, Eelco Uri and Gerben Silvis had two goals each.
</P>
<P>
   Uri's first score, a backhand wheel in front of the net, put the
Netherlands ahead for good, 3-2, with under a minute to play in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Greece came after that was 6-5 on Ioannis Thomakos'
third-quarter goal.
</P>
<P>
   Thomakos, Georgios Psychos and Georgios Afroudakis had two goals
each for the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   Things got hot at the end. Marco Booij of the Netherlands and
Greece's Antonios Vlontakis struggled in the water, then kept
arguing as teammates swam in for support. Both were ejected with
12.5 seconds remaining in the game.

<HEADLINE> Colts 43, Jaguars 14  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- If there was anything wrong with Peyton
Manning, it was cured Monday night -- with help from some unexpected
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Manning passed for a franchise-record 440 yards and threw for
four touchdowns as the Indianapolis Colts dominated the second half
to beat Jacksonville 43-14.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Wilkins, playing his first game of the season, chipped
in with nine catches for 148 yards and a touchdown. And the defense
that blew a 21-point lead at home to Oakland two weeks ago showed
up this time, sacking Mark Brunell five times, once for a safety
and picking off a pass that set up a score.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Manning's show as the Colts went on a 22-0 run in the
second half after leading by only a touchdown at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing three interceptions in his first two games, he
was perfect Monday night, starting with a 76-yard TD pass to Marvin
Harrison on the Colts' third play from scrimmage. Manning also had
a 27-yarder to Wilkins and a 16-yarder to Jerome Pathon as
Indianapolis (2-1) took a 21-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Manning added a 4-yarder in the final quarter for the first
four-touchdown game in his two-plus NFL seasons. Edgerrin James
completed the scoring with a 14-yard TD run.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, who completed 23 of 36 passes, broke his own team
record of 404 yards against San Diego last Sept. 26. Hall of Famer
Johnny Unitas' top total was 401 for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, who missed the first two games with a concussion,
almost doubled his career high of five catches as a rookie last
year.
</P>
<P>
   And the defense, which entered the game with one sack, had five
this time, two each by Ellis Johnson and Chad Bratzke. Bratzke
sacked Mark Brunell for a third-quarter safety, the first safety by
the Colts since 1997. Mike Peterson had an interception that set up
one of the first-half TDs.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell was 21-of-35 for 229 yards for Jacksonville (2-2) with
touchdown passes of 9 and 26 yards to Jimmy Smith. But after
getting 159 in the first half, Brunell had only 3 yards in the
first 25 minutes of the second half, while the Colts were putting
away the game.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Taylor, who played his first game of the season for
Jacksonville after missing the first two with a knee injury, ran
for 57 yards on 14 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The game started with an explosion, the 76-yard bomb from
Manning to Harrison behind Aaron Beasley on the Colts' third play
from scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Then it settled down until midway through the second quarter,
when Brunell hit Smith with the 9-yarder that was first ruled out
of bounds, then overturned on replay.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be the first of four touchdowns, two by each
team, in the final 7:36 before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   But the second half was no contest as the Indianapolis defense
asserted itself. Mike Vanderjagt's 41-yard field goal and the
safety made it 29-14 after three quarters and two quick TDs in the
final quarter put it away.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Tommy Haas of Germany clinched a medal
Tuesday and advanced to the Olympic final by beating Roger Federer
of Switzerland 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the match was delayed three hours by rain.
</P>
<P>
   Haas' opponent Thursday will be the winner of the other
semifinal between Arnaud Di Pasquale of France and Russian Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, at No. 5 the only seeded player remaining. Federer will

</P>
<P>
   Haas' half of the draw had just one seeded player left after the
opening round. He beat No. 8 Alex Correjta in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, 22, is a former top-10 player with just one career title --
at Memphis last year. He is ranked 48th and was runner-up at Munich
in his best finish this year.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- While tens of thousands of jubilant Yugoslavs
celebrated the apparent defeat of Slobodan Milosevic, the opposition Monday
demanded the release of election results within 48 hours, fearing Milosevic will
rig the count to stave off the end of his rule. More than 40,000 people jammed a

after the pro-Western opposition challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, claimed victory

Gore: Bush Plan Hurts Seniors
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Al Gore warned Monday that George W. Bush's
Medicare plan would strip senior citizens of their ''sense of dignity'' by
forcing many into welfare offices for prescription drug coverage. The accusation
drew protests from Bush's campaign, though GOP aides did not deny that states
could require seniors to go to welfare offices under Bush's plan. Gore's charge,
based on self-serving assumptions his staff has made about Bush's plan, caused
independent analysts to question whether the vice president was playing racial
and class warfare politics to court elderly voters, as well as suburban whites.
National polls show the race is a dead heat, with Republican intensity rising
and Bush regaining his footing.

Chavez Pursues Goals at OPEC Summit

   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- In playing host to the first OPEC summit in 25
years, President Hugo Chavez is staking out a more active role for Venezuela
within the oil cartel and attacking inequities between the Third World and
industrialized nations. Yet international pressure to lower oil prices and
differing agendas among the 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries could complicate his efforts. Starting Tuesday, ministers
will try to reshape the cartel's public role from defender of higher oil prices
to a consumer-friendly advocacy group that wants to avoid the wild price swings
of recent years. Despite three production increases this year, world prices
reached $36 a barrel last week -- levels not seen since the 1991 Gulf War.

Panama President Mulls Asylum Bid

   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panamanian leaders were persuaded to let in
Peru's ousted spy chief after being told Peru's military was on the verge of
launching a coup if he was refused refuge, the foreign minister said Monday.
President Mireya Moscoso and her advisers granted Peru's Vladimiro Montesinos a
tourist visa Monday while they considered his request for asylum -- opposed by
many here who say their country is treated as a dumping ground for deposed Latin
American strongmen. Panama has come under strong pressure from Latin American
leaders, backed by the United States, to grant asylum in order to help Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori out of a political crisis sparked by a bribery
scandal surrounding his top aide, Montesinos.

<HEADLINE> Jones Dealing With Husband's Woes  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Marion Jones, the fastest woman in the
world, may not be able to run fast enough to escape the scandal
that has suddenly engulfed her.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' pursuit of an unprecedented five golds became more than a
series of sprints and a long jump when she was swept up in the
disgrace her husband, world shot put champion C.J. Hunter, brought
by testing positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter failed four separate tests for steroid use this summer,
results that international and American track officials knew about
but never reported, the IOC's drug chief said Tuesday (Monday night
EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC's medical
commission, said Hunter failed three out-of-competition tests in
addition to a test conducted after the Bislett Games in Oslo,
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   All the tests showed Hunter with levels of nandrolone 1,000
times the allowable amount.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and Jones appeared together at a press conference, where
Jones kissed her husband in a show of support and asked reporters
to leave the couple alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aside from him being an athlete and me being an athlete, he's
my husband and I'm here to show support for him,'' she said. ''I
have full and complete respect, and believe the legal system will
do what it needs to do to clear his name.''
</P>
<P>
   With attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr., nearby, Hunter kept breaking
down and fighting back tears as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody on the planet could say that I don't love my wife and I
don't love my kids,'' he began. ''I have never in my life, nor
would I ever, do anything to jeopardize their opinion of me. I
don't know what has happened and I don't know how it has happened.
How it may affect me is the least of my concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said Cochran would represent him as he fights the doping
charges, but Cochran said he was there as a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also was accompanied by nutritionist Victor Conte, who
claimed ''C.J. was not using the anabolic steroid nandrolone. The
positive result was the product of the nutritional supplement he
was taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Conte did not identify the product or its manufacturer. He said
Jones was not using the supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Jones lined up all smiles for the 100 meters two days earlier,
as oblivious to pressure as she was to any threat from her rivals.
That was just a race and, as it turned out, not much of one as she
blew away the field as calmly as she blew kisses to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Now the daunting task the 24-year-old Jones set for herself on
the track has turned into a test of all the inner strength she can
muster, starting with the 200 heats and long jump qualifying on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge that Marion Jones was facing, a real athletic
challenge, has only been enhanced by all the developments here thus
far,'' said Craig Masback, chief executive officer of USA Track &AMP;
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marion has done a great job so far in light of the recent
situation,'' Michael Johnson said Monday night after capturing the
men's 400 gold. ''Hopefully she'll be able to focus on what she's
here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sentiment shared by all of Jones' track and field
teammates, even those angry about Hunter's alleged steroid use.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's tragic. I think it's very sad,'' said Kim Batten,
the 1996 silver medalist in the women's 400-meter hurdles. ''I hope
it doesn't affect Marion. It's tough no matter how you look at it
for her. I'm sorry for her. It's a major event in her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian gold medalist Cathy Freeman thinks Jones will come
through just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marion, being such a tough-minded person, I'm sure she's
totally supportive of C.J. I don't think it's going to affect her
on the track,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 330-pound Hunter, the most prominent of the athletes accused
during the games of drug violations, had been among the favorites
for a shot put gold medal in Sydney before he withdrew two weeks
ago. Reached in his hotel room, he declined to discuss his case or
the impact it is having on his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what's going on and I am aware of the allegations and
am going to defend myself vigorously,'' Hunter said in a statement
given to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that this news is breaking when Marion Jones is
running,'' said Istvan Gyulai, general secretary of the
International Amateur Athletics Federation. ''It's terrible whether
it's true or not. It has nothing to do with the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who finished second at the U.S. trials in June and at
the meet in Oslo, withdrew from the Olympics following surgery to
repair cartilage in his left knee. He was credentialed as an
athlete while acting as a coach for his wife, but the IOC said that
credential was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   At the IOC's request, Hunter would be left without any
credential. The USOC originally planned to replace that with a
support staff pass and tickets that would still allow him to coach
Jones in training and at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports linking Jones to use of banned
performance enhancers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an individual matter,'' said Francois Carrard, IOC
director general, adding that Jones is not under suspicion. ''If
she does not test positive, we should not infer (guilt) from one
individual to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone helps athletes gain strength and muscle bulk by
repairing the damage of high-level training and competition. It has
been involved in hundreds of recent doping cases. Some scientists
have speculated that nandrolone may be contained in improperly
labeled nutritional supplements that many athletes use.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No. 1 in the world last year after winning the world
championship with a put of 71 feet, 6 inches, Hunter also was the
bronze medalist at the 1997 world championships. He is a three-time
U.S. champion and the 1995 world indoor silver medalist. He
finished seventh at the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Five athletes -- including a Latvian rower who tested positive
for nandrolone -- have been expelled from the games for flunking
drug tests. Several Bulgarian weightlifters were thrown out for
testing positive for furosemide, a banned diuretic used by lifters
to flush fluids from their system to make the weight.
</P>
<P>
   A number of others, including weightlifters from Romania, Norway
and Taiwan, were caught cheating in tests conducted before the
Olympics, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Americans Win Beach Volleyball  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Americans Dain Blanton and Eric
Fonoimoana refused to wilt beneath unrelenting Brazilian pressure,
defeating favored Ze Marco de Melo and Ricardo Santos 12-11, 12-9
to win the gold medal in Olympic men's beach volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   The victory in the rain Tuesday brought an explosion of cheers
at the sold-out Bondi Beach stadium, with flag-waving fans chanting
''U-S-A'' as the Americans collapsed in each other's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way we played that well was to play against a team
that good,'' Blanton said to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bitter defeat for the Brazilians, who won three medals
-- the silver and bronze in women's and the men's silver -- but
failed to grab the top prize in a sport they have dominated in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans came from behind to beat De Melo and Santos in the
first set. Then they forged an early 4-1 lead in the second game
and never trailed despite desperate comeback efforts by the
Brazilians in a match that featured frantic rallies, with bodies
diving in the wet sand.
</P>
<P>
   With De Melo waving for the crowd to cheer even louder, he and
Santos fought back to 10-9 before Fonoimoana's shot went off Santos
for a point, setting up Blanton to serve for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd on its feet, he served to De Melo, who passed to
Santos and back to De Melo for a spike. Fonoimoana rose to block it
back, the Americans had the decisive point.
</P>
<P>
   In the bronze medal game, Germany's Jorg Ahmann and Axel Hager
completed an unlikely run to an Olympic medal, defeating Luis Maia
and Joao Brenha of Portugal 12-9, 12-6.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and low, gray clouds forced spectators to wear raincoats,
but the cheering remained loud and steady.
</P>
<P>
   After a stirring comeback victory in the semifinal over Maia and
Brenha, Blanton and Fonoimoana pulled off a similar recovery in the
first game of the final.
</P>
<P>
   Strong net play by Santos, with several blocks for kills, gave
the Brazilians leads of 4-1, 8-6 and 11-8, but the Americans kept
pulling even.
</P>
<P>
   With lightning reflexes, Blanton reached Santos' smash, sending
the ball back too deep for the Brazilians to get and making the
score 11-9. Fonoimoana then blocked De Melo at the net to bring the
Americans within one. The serve changed sides before Santos
couldn't handle Fonoimoana's serve to even the score at 11,
bringing an eruption from the chanting, dancing U.S. fans.
</P>
<P>
   De Melo then fired a spike wide, giving the Americans a 12-11
victory and setting off another burst of cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmann and Hager, seeded 15th, relied on the 6-foot-9 Hager's
dominating net play to overpower the Portuguese, who lost the
bronze medal match for the second straight Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Before the gold medal game, Fonoimoana said the Brazilians would
feel more pressure because of the expectations of fans in a country
where volleyball is the second most popular sport after soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians were clear favorites, coming in with a 4-0 record
against Blanton and Fonoimoana, including two victories in July
tournaments. De Melo and Santos won five tournaments this year and
have reached the final four in 27 of 39 international events. By
comparison, Blanton and Fonoimoana have reached the semifinals in
five of their 23 internationals.

<HEADLINE> Students Hurt in Seattle Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy was hit in the ankle Monday in
an apparent drive-by shooting outside a suburban high school,
following a weekend marked by two shootings in the Seattle area,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Monday's shooting near Federal Way High School as
some classes were letting out sprang from ''an ongoing conflict
between two groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Way and Thomas Jefferson high schools were both ordered
closed Tuesday, said Tom Murphy, Federal Way schools
superintendent. A dispute at a pickup game Friday night had
apparently raised tensions at the schools, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests had been made Monday and there were no reports of
other shots fired in the neighborhood. Spokeswoman Pam O'Brien at
Harborview Medical Center in Seattle said the boy's wounds were not
life-threatening and he was in satisfactory condition.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's shooting followed two attacks over the weekend, one in
which someone walked up to a car at a red light Sunday and shot
four young people inside, seriously wounding three.
</P>
<P>
   A man in his early 20s remained in critical condition Monday and
a 14-year-old girl and a second man in his early 20s were in
serious condition, according to a nursing supervisor at Harborview
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests had been made Monday in that shooting or in another
shooting less than a mile away early Saturday that injured three
people in a popular tourist area. Police believe the shooting may
have been gang-related, police spokesman Clem Benton said. Three
men remained hospitalized in serious condition Monday.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Senator Spar In Mock Debate  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush jokes that the problem with
engaging in mock debates with Sen. Judd Gregg is that often ''he
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire Republican has been playing the role of
Democrat Al Gore in practice sessions with the Texas governor. And
while Bush likes to give the impression that he isn't putting much
time or energy into such rehearsals, the preparation has been
underway for months.
</P>
<P>
   One sparring session between Bush and Gregg -- at Bush's ranch in
Crawford, Texas, during the Democratic convention last month --
found its way to the Gore campaign. Gore's camp turned the tape
over to the FBI, which is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   With the first debate a week away on Oct. 3, Bush was heading to
Austin on Wednesday for a practice session. And at least one full
90-minute session with a moderator and formal trappings is planned
for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There's a danger in rehearsing too much, Bush says. ''Either
you're ready or you're not ready,'' he says. He thinks he is.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans privately have voiced concern that Bush is not
taking debate preparation seriously enough, suggesting he chafes at
practice sessions and tries to get out of them when he can.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Texas governor has been poring over briefing books
given him by staff.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he's trying to familiarize himself with the specifics
of Gore's various proposals and also is refreshing himself with
details of his own proposals, especially those he doesn't refer to
often on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   The lean, reticent Gregg looks nothing like Gore. But, according
to Bush campaign officials, he has an uncanny ability to sound like
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him, 'You're good,''' said Bush communications director
Karen Hughes, who has been with him during all debate rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg ''has managed to capture the condescending air that Gore
uses in debates,'' said Hughes, never missing an opportunity to get
in a dig at the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush at first balked at the schedule for three debates outlined
by a bipartisan commission that has overseen presidential debates
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed initially to only one, challenging Gore to meet him in
less formal settings for the other two -- in particular, joint
appearances on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' and on CNN's ''Larry King
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore wouldn't take the bait, and Bush eventually agreed to the
schedule set forth by the commission. Gore partisans accused Bush
of trying to duck the debates.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has been practicing for formal debates since May.
</P>
<P>
   He has held many sessions during weekends in Texas -- both in
Austin and at the ranch, about a two-hour drive north. He also has
held two sessions with Gregg at Bush's parents' compound in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   This past Sunday, while in Austin, Bush engaged in ''quiet
preparation,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Bush in the past few weeks has been taking more
questions from town-hall audiences in hopes of honing his ability
to think and talk on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We view every day on the trail as debate preparation,'' said
campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said campaign officials are closely scrutinizing
videotapes of past debates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've actually gone back and asked him questions that were
asked in past debates,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's aides openly discussed his debate preparation,
Gregg himself was tightlipped and declined a request for an
interview. Gregg's spokesman also declined to discuss the sessions.

   NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- The students thought they were going to

white stretch limo pulled up, and out stepped Jackie Chan.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I saw him my heart started to beat fast,'' 11-year-old

</P>
<P>
   After the filming, Chan visited classrooms, answered questions

in the NASA program to promote learning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that can help children about education, I go,'' he
said.

<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- John Grisham plans to give nearly
1,000 acres in conservation easements to an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Grisham, whose books include ''The Firm'' and ''The Pelican
Brief,'' has spent seven years acquiring tracts of rolling
grassland near his southern Albemarle County horse farm. The most
recent acquisition came in January, when Grisham and his wife
bought a 318-acre property from a group of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no plans to ever sell it, but who knows what will
happen when we're gone,'' Grisham said Monday. ''It's just nice to
know this land will always be pristine.''
</P>
<P>
   The easements, essentially building rights, will be given to the
Piedmont Environmental Council.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Pressured To Step Down  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Determined to rid Yugoslavia of Slobodan
Milosevic's rule, the Clinton administration is threatening an
international pressure campaign to force the apparently defeated
president to accept the election results and step down.
</P>
<P>
   Having used what U.S. officials say are fraudulent tactics,
Milosevic appears to be maneuvering for a runoff against his chief
challenger, Vojislav Kostunica on grounds neither candidate tallied
50 percent of Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's party claims he got about 55 percent of the vote
while Milosevic's party claims he was leading the challenger, 45
percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials results have not been released, but the Clinton
administration is dismissing Milosevic's tactic. An official told
The Associated Press on Monday that Milosevic's opposition
apparently won a clear victory and that talk of a runoff was
academic.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen made the threat against
Yugoslavia in an exchange with reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the international community will look very closely,
carefully and bring whatever pressure it can for Milosevic to abide
by the will of his people,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people want Milosevic out,'' he said. ''Certainly the
international community would welcome that result.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher pledged, meanwhile,
that sanctions against Yugoslavia would be lifted if Milosevic
accepted defeat in his bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Other governments are apt to lift the sanctions as well, Boucher
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the democratic change occurs, we will take steps to lift
sanctions,'' he said. ''We've made that clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions include blocking international bank loans to
Yugoslavia, an oil embargo and denying visas to Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''The popular vote was a vote for democracy,'' Boucher said.
''The question is whether Milosevic will recognize the will of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   White House national security adviser Sandy Berger briefed
President Clinton on the elections aboard Air Force One on Monday,
as the president headed for political appearances in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is increasingly apparent that the opposition has prevailed
in that election, and any claims by Milosevic to the contrary are
false,'' said White House deputy spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Serbia appear to want democratic change and we
hope that the government respects those wishes,'' Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boucher repeated allegations that ''there was a
massive unprecedented effort at fraud by the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, anticipating a close race, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Milosevic was trying to ''steal the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. officials said he and his backers had gerrymandered
voting districts and prepared ballots with his name already checked
off.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Exec Sentenced to One Year  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arkansas' top elected officials are pleading
for President Clinton to pardon a longtime friend and supporter
sentenced to a year in prison for trying to illegally influence
Clinton's former agriculture secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson Foods executive Archie Schaffer III was sentenced Monday
by a federal judge who believes Schaffer is innocent and has twice
tried to acquit him, only to be reversed by an appeals panel.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, both Republicans and Democrats in Clinton's home
state called for a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer, the main spokesman for the Arkansas-based poultry
producer, was convicted under a 1907 law of trying to influence
agricultural policy by arranging for then-Secretary Mike Espy to
attend a Tyson birthday party in Arkansas in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Robertson reluctantly sentenced him to
a year and one day in prison and a $5,000 fine, the minimum that he
said was allowed under the Meat Inspection Act. The extra prison
day will make Schaffer eligible for good-behavior credits that
could free him nearly two months early, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   But Arkansas officials were frustrated that Robertson did not
agree with Schaffer's argument that probation was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's terribly sad and very unfortunate and I hope the
president will very quickly grant to Mr. Schaffer a pardon,'' said
Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., who is generally at odds with Clinton
politically.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, the entire Arkansas congressional delegation, and
Gov. Mike Huckabee had all asked Clinton to pardon Schaffer prior
to his sentencing. The prison term prompted them to intensify their
request.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee, also a Republican, urged Clinton to pardon Schaffer
immediately. ''Please don't let this man spend one day disgraced
and humiliated because of vicious politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., said she was ''extremely
disappointed'' by the sentence ''and will continue to call upon
President Clinton to listen to the bipartisan chorus of voices
supporting the pardon of Archie Schaffer.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House does not comment about clemency requests,
spokesman Jason Schechter said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the pardon pleas, Schaffer supporters also wrote nearly
100 letters to Robertson asking that he show leniency. Schaffer,
the nephew of former Arkansas governor and U.S. Sen. Dale Bumpers,
D-Ark., served in Bumpers' administrations and led a business group
studying educational reforms during Clinton's tenure as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson acknowledged the letters in court and said he would
have preferred to impose a year probation and a $10,000 fine on
Schaffer. He said Schaffer deserved a lighter sentence because of
his exceptional community involvement and because he reaped no
personal gain from arranging for Espy to attend the Tyson party.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors had sought a tougher sentence for Schaffer
because of the prominence of both Espy and Tyson Foods.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very significant company and the gift recipient a
very important official ... who was the regulator of the department
that was the chief regulator of Tyson Foods,'' prosecutor Joe
Guichet told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing was one of the final items in Independent Counsel
Donald Smaltz's six-year, $23 million investigation of Espy. Jurors
acquitted Espy in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides could appeal. Smaltz said he would make an appeal
decision in a couple of days. Attorneys for Schaffer asked the
judge to delay his prison-reporting date pending an appeal of the
sentence. The judge allowed Schaffer to remain free while he
considers the issue.

<HEADLINE> GOP Spends Millions In Dem. States  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Besides giving millions to state parties in
Ohio and Michigan, the Republican National Committee also made
seven-figure transfers last month to California and Washington
state, both of which voted Democratic in recent presidential
elections and where close races for seats in Congress are being
waged this year.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said they're not willing to concede either
state to Vice President Al Gore, least of all California, the
nation's most populous state with one-fifth of the 270 electoral
votes needed to win the White House in November.
</P>
<P>
   But the spending also came in a month that began with Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush ahead in the polls and GOP
officials looking to force Gore to defend Democratic strongholds
rather than allowing him to go on the offensive. Polls now show a
close race between Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''When George W. Bush had a big lead in national polls, they
deployed a lot of money to states that were must-win states for
Gore,'' said Bob Benenson, managing editor for politics of
Congressional Quarterly, an independent publication that tracks
presidential and congressional races. ''Now that the momentum has
changed in the race, the question is going to be raised as to
whether that was money well spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the presidential race, however, there are key
congressional races in all the million-dollar states. Republicans
hold slim majorities in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC transferred $2.3 million to Pennsylvania, $2.2 million
to Ohio and $1.7 million to Michigan last month, three key
battlegrounds. Republican incumbents are fighting to keep their
Senate seats in Pennsylvania and Michigan, while all three states
have open House seats targeted by both parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the RNC also gave $1.7 million apiece to the Washington and
California GOP. Recent polls give Gore a double-digit lead in the
Golden State, and a slight edge in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC contributed at least $1 million to nine different state
parties last month, Federal Election Commission records show.
</P>
<P>
   California, though it went for Bill Clinton in both 1992 and
1996, supported Republican presidential candidates in the six
elections before then.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're putting money into California because California's
competitive,'' RNC spokesman Bill Pascoe said. ''California has a
history of voting Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state has at least four competitive House
races, GOP Rep. Jim Rogan's bid for re-election in what is expected
to become the most expensive House race ever. Rogan helped managed
Clinton's impeachment trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has an independent streak -- Ross Perot polled
almost one-quarter of the vote in 1992 -- and is considered one of
consumer advocate Ralph Nader's strongest states, draining votes
away from Gore. GOP Sen. Slade Gorton has a tough re-election
battle, and Republicans need to gain just one seat in the state
House to take control of the chamber and have a say in
reapportionment next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be tempting for the Republicans to play there,''
Benenson said.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC also transferred $1.2 million to a state party where
Bush is expected to have no trouble winning: Texas. The state also
has some competitive House races, but the real battle is over
control of the Legislature. The GOP holds a one-seat edge in the
Senate; Democrats hold a six-seat margin in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Should Texas Republicans capture the House and keep the Senate,
they would have total control of the reapportionment process in the
nation's second most-populous state, helping to cancel the
Democrats' control over redistricting in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're putting money into legislative races in Texas, as we are
in a number of states,'' Pascoe said. ''Redistricting will be an
important fight next year and we want to make sure that Republicans
are fairly represented in the line drawing process around the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in
July transferred almost $1 million to the Texas Democratic Party to
help in legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're committed to electing Democrats at every level,'' DCCC
spokesman John Del Cecato said. ''There are some key legislative
and congressional races in Texas. We're going to continue to be
active.''

11th in its first appearance in men's Olympic basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Marks had 15 points and 11 rebounds to lead New Zealand

</P>
<P>
   Angola (0-6) got as close as 65-58 in the final minute, but New
Zealand was able to keep the lead by dominating inside, finishing
with a 36-24 rebound advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 Marks, who played at the University of California

</P>
<P>
   Carlos Bendinha de Aleida led Angola with 19 points.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Wins Synchro Swimming Duet  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- For the first time since hair gel,
makeup and noseclips entered the Olympic pool, Americans failed to
climb the medal stand.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Kozlova and Tuesday Middaugh settled for fourth in duet
synchronized swimming Tuesday behind a near-perfect Russian duo and
teams from Japan and France, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans blamed inexperience -- the pairing was selected
only in June -- and a lack of major international meets to become
familiar to the judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is our first international competition ever,'' said the
Russian-born Kozlova, who became a U.S. citizen less than a year
ago. ''You earn your ranking all the time. There's a lot of
subjectivity. We didn't see any mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had never finished lower than second since
synchronized swimming became part of the Olympic program in 1984,
winning five golds and two silvers.
</P>
<P>
   Russians Olga Brusnikina and Maria Kisseleva used a karate
routine performed to the beat of Japanese drums to defeat a team
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Brusnikina and Kisseleva picked up all 10s for artistic
impression, while their technical marks were marred by a lone 9.9
from the Japanese judge. They totaled 99.580 points.
</P>
<P>
   Russia hasn't lost a duet since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Miya Tachibana and Miho Takedo took silver with 98.650, earning
straight 9.9s from the judges. Virginie Dedieu and Myriam Lignot of
France claimed bronze at 97.437.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlova and Middaugh, performing in the same waters where the
U.S. swimmers captured 33 medals, wore sparkly, flaming-red suits
to the music of ''Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We love it,'' Middaugh said. ''We did a lot of research to
portray the different faces and attitudes of Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans couldn't ignite passion in the judges. They
failed to move up after beginning the final in fourth place,
settling for marks ranging from 9.6 to 9.8 for a 96.990 total.
</P>
<P>
   The free program, performed in a half-filled Sydney
International Aquatic Center, counted for 65 percent of the total
mark. It was added to Sunday's technical results.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlova also placed fourth in her previous Olympics. She
competed for the Unified team at the 1992 Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlova came to Santa Clara, Calif., in 1993 for the wedding of
an American swimmer. She decided to stay, finally gaining her
citizenship last October.
</P>
<P>
   This was her first major championship since becoming eligible
for the American team.
</P>
<P>
   Middaugh, of Riverside, Calif., was fortunate to be competing at
all.
</P>
<P>
   She had emergency back surgery on two herniated discs in
February and still endures pain in the water.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, she's also gone through four knee
operations, including one for a damaged anterior cruciate ligament.
She was treated by the same surgeon who reconstructed football star
Jerry Rice's leg.
</P>
<P>
   Kisseleva's presence in the Olympics was accompanied by
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   She was stripped of her European duet title after failing a
doping test July 21. The infraction carried a possible three-month
suspension, but the Russian federation made her sit out only a
month. That allowed her to compete in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the lighter penalty was fair since the banned
substance, ephedrine, was included in a supplement to control
Kisseleva's weight and gave her no advantage in the pool.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 7, Angels 5  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Giambi hit his 40th home run and
brother Jeremy hit a bases-loaded triple to lift Oakland over
Anaheim 7-5 Monday night, moving the Athletics within a half-game
of idle Seattle in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics also opened a 1&AMP;frac12;-game lead on Cleveland for the
wild card spot. The Indians split a day-night, three-team
doubleheader -- they beat Chicago 9-2, then lost to Minnesota 4-3 as
the Coliseum crowd cheered the game on the video scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss, Anaheim was eliminated from the AL West. The
Angels remained mathematically alive -- barely -- for a wild card
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Barry Zito (6-4) struck out a career-high 10, allowing
three runs on seven hits in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The A's have won five of their last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher (4-4) got into trouble early. With one out in the
second inning, he gave up consecutive hits to Ben Grieve and Miguel
Tejada, then walked Eric Chavez to load the bases. Jeremy Giambi
tripled to deep center, just to the right of the 400-foot marker.
</P>
<P>
   A's manager Art Howe ran out to argue the ball had bounced off
the top of the outfield wall and should've been a grand slam. A
replay showed the ball stayed inside the park.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Giambi scored on Terrence Long's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels narrowed it to 4-2 in the fourth on Ron Gant's
two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez hit a solo home run to lead off the bottom half. It was
his 26th homer this season. Jason Giambi hit a two-run homer in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina hit an RBI double off Zito in the seventh. Tim
Salmon hit a two-run single in the ninth off Jason Isringhausen.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was coming off a three-game suspension he served in
Texas for bumping umpire Mike DiMuro on June 27 at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up seven runs on seven hits over four innings.
Notes: The Oakland Raiders played at the Coliseum on Sunday, so
the field had to be reconfigured for baseball in an overnight
operation. As a result, neither the A's nor the Angels could take
batting practice. It took from 6 p.m. Sunday to 4 p.m. Monday to
flip the field. ... Angels third baseman Troy Glaus has hit 44 home
runs to lead the American League. The last Angel to win the home
run title was Reggie Jackson in '82. ... The only AL team Chavez
hadn't homered against -- before Monday night -- was the Angels. ...
Jason Giambi joins three other Oakland A's players to hit 40 or
more home runs in a season. Mark McGwire did it three times, Jose
Canseco did it twice and Jackson once.

<HEADLINE> Venus Williams Keeps Improving  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Venus Williams double-faults too much.
She overhits. She holds the racket wrong on backhand volleys. Her
footwork is flawed. And yet she has won 31 matches in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Scary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Venus is at 75 percent of her potential in singles,
and 50 percent in doubles,'' Billie Jean King said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be enough for Williams to win two gold medals at the
Olympics. She'll play Elena Dementieva of Russia for the singles
title Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT), and she and sister Serena
reached the final in doubles by beating the Belgian team Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Venus to me is like on automatic pilot,'' said King, winner of
12 Grand Slam titles and the coach of the U.S. team. ''She is just
playing so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at age 20, Williams has room to improve -- a daunting
prospect for the rest of women's tennis. In a quarterfinal victory
over Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, for example, she double-faulted 13
times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her serve can be a lot better,'' King said. ''She knows it.
She's working on it. We work on everything.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find with Venus, you've got to keep it fun. That's the
operative word with her -- fun. And give her new challenges.
Champions love challenges. Like, 'I bet you can't do this.' And
she'll go, 'Yeah I can. I'll show you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams sisters learned tennis mostly from their father,
Richard, who taught them from books and still works as their coach.
They're gifted and intelligent but unpolished, which means time
with King and assistant coach Zina Garrison could prove invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   King has worked with Venus before when playing Fed Cup, but
never for such an extended period as in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's extremely motivated at all times,'' Williams said. ''She
has all types of energy. I'm pretty much more laid back. I don't
talk too much, and I just hit the ball and get the job done. She's
really, really excited at all times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly she's very helpful. She knows the game. She has been
around it a long time. If I didn't take that to be important, it
would be my own fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams makes notes and reads them during changeovers.
Sometimes they involve pointers from King, and sometimes they're
for motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she needs any. She seems driven to add gold medals to a
trophy collection that includes this year's Wimbledon and U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Seeded second in Sydney, Williams will be heavily favored
against the 10th-seeded Dementieva. The 18-year-old Russian won her
only previous meeting with Williams last year in Fed Cup, but the
match was essentially meaningless because the U.S. team had already
clinched a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was last year. This is different,'' Dementieva said.
''She's playing very well now. I don't know if I can beat her, but
I'm happy to be in the final.''
</P>
<P>
   Dementieva emerged as a potential star at this year's U.S. Open,
where she reached the semifinals before losing to Lindsay
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's playing well,'' Williams said. ''She's got a good game.
I'm sure she'll want to take first place, and I will too.''

<HEADLINE> Freeh To Defend Government Lee Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI Director Louis Freeh was prepared to
defend the government's case against nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee,
but was willing to acknowledge that his agents went too far in
threatening Lee at one point with electrocution, according to an
administration official who has seen a draft of Freeh's planned
congressional testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh was ready to argue to Senate investigating committees
Tuesday that the government would have been able to prove its
charges against Lee had the case gone to trial, the official said.
Although these views were in a draft of Freeh's remarks, the
director had an opportunity to revise them up until they were
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh was among a number of top federal officials who were
expected to be grilled by senators who want to find out what led
the government to hold Lee in solitary confinement for nine months
on 59 charges, including downloading nuclear secrets onto computer
tapes, while he was employed at the national weapons laboratory in
Los Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if they had any justification for doing it,''
said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who planned to ask prosecutors why
Lee was ''manacled and kept in leg irons'' during his prison stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what the offense, you can't coerce or torture a
guilty plea out of someone,'' Specter said in advance of Tuesday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors ultimately dropped all but one charge in a plea
bargain, and Lee was released.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1999, just before Lee was fired from his job at
Los Alamos, two FBI agents were asked to conduct a confrontational
interview with the scientist in hopes of winning a confession from
him.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the agents told Lee falsely that he had failed a
polygraph test and urged him to confess by saying that the only two
spies who ever had refused to confess were Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg, who were put to death by electrocution. Lee was never
charged with spying.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said Freeh was prepared to say that the threat of
execution went too far and was a product of having to conduct the
interview with much less notice than normal.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, confrontational interviews are done after long
study of the case and preparation of psychological profiles by
bureau behavioral scientists of the interview target.
</P>
<P>
   But the official said that in this case the agents had to
prepare quickly because they didn't have much advance warning that
Lee was going to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts have ruled that law enforcement agents are
allowed to deceive suspects in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Lee walked free Sept. 13, sentenced to the time he had served
awaiting trial, after he agreed to tell the government what he did
with the tapes. His debriefing had been scheduled for Tuesday but
was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The plea bargain caused the presiding judge to apologize to Lee
for his pretrial imprisonment and lambast the government for
embarrassing ''our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he found it difficult to reconcile how
the government could ''keep someone in jail without bail, argue
right up to the 11th hour that they're a terrible risk, and then
turn around and make that sort of plea agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a U.S. citizen born in Taiwan and educated in the United
States, initially was an espionage suspect, the target of a federal
probe into how China may have obtained secret nuclear warhead
blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters contend Lee was targeted because he is
Asian-American. Some are demanding a presidential pardon and an
apology.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has refused to apologize to Lee but
ordered an internal review of Justice Department actions after
meeting with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The senator continues the questioning Wednesday in his Judiciary
subcommittee and said the questioning won't stop with the Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   Specter also planned to bring up questions about the case of
Taiwanese-American scientist Peter Lee, who reached a plea bargain
with the Justice Department and escaped prison time despite reports
that he passed advanced radar technology secrets to China.

<HEADLINE> Women's Volleyball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Russia and Cuba, with six gold medals
between them, took very different paths to women's volleyball
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams won quarterfinal matches 3-0, but while Cuba had
little trouble getting past Croatia, Russia had to come back again
and again to defeat China on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Godina provided the crucial points for Russia, which was
down 24-21 in the third game but struggled back to win 27-25.
Godina's kill put Russia ahead by one, and on match point Liobov
Chachkova drilled a comeback attempt to earn the 27-25, 25-23,
27-25 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba advanced by shutting down Croatia's Barbara Jelic, the top
scorer in the tournament, in a considerably easier 25-18, 25-23,
25-21 victory Tuesday (Monday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, seeking an unprecedented third straight gold medal, will
play the Brazil-Germany winner in the first of Thursday's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which finished first or second in every Olympics in
which it has played before a fourth-place showing in 1996, will
play the winner of the United States-South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Russia fell behind 25-24 in the first game, but Elizaveta
Tichtchenko ran around the setter on the right side three straight
times to pull out the 27-25 victory.
</P>
<P>
   China trailed almost the entire second game, but went on a run
behind backup setter Zhu Yunying.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 24-22, Russian coach Nikolai Karpol pulled the 6-foot-4
Godina and put in little-used Ekaterina Gamova, at 6-7 the tallest
player on the team. Gamova rose to spike a ball but was called for
being in the net, and Karpol glared at her as she walked off the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Godina returned for the next point and delivered a solid shot to
win the game 25-23 and give the Russians a 2-0 lead in the match.
</P>
<P>
   Godina finished with 19 kills.
</P>
<P>
   China, which barely made it out of group play, can finish no
better than fifth, a disappointing follow-up to their silver medal
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia played well in the second and third games but had little
margin for error against the more athletic Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba established its dominance early, getting consistently easy
shots from Regla Bell and Yumilka Ruiz on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6-3 Regla Torres made life difficult for Jelic, who
finished with 17 kills but came up empty on 22 other attempts. When
the blockers did let one of Jelic's shots through, the Cuban back
row collected nearly every ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought they might have been stronger,'' Bell said of
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia rallied from a 16-10 deficit in the second game to get
within 22-20. Ana Fernandez slammed a shot that froze the Croatians
for a 24-21 lead before Croatia saved two straight game points to
get within one. But Ruiz ended the comeback with a clean shot into
the back row.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia trailed the entire third game but cut the lead to 22-20
before Cuba closed it out.

<HEADLINE> Inger Miller Officially Out of 200  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- World champion Inger Miller officially
withdrew from the women's 200 meters Tuesday because the left
hamstring injury that forced her out of the 100 last week has not
healed.
</P>
<P>
   Miller still hopes to run in the 400-meter relay this weekend,
U.S. Track and Field spokeswoman Jill Geer said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was replaced in the 200 by Torri Edwards, who was fourth
in that event at the U.S. trials. Edwards also replaced Miller in
the 100.
</P>
<P>
   The other two Americans in the first-round heats of the 200 set
for Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT) are Marion Jones and Nanceen
Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Cathy Freeman, who won the 400 on Tuesday, also is
entered in the 200. Her last major victory at that distance was at
the 1994 Commonwealth Games.
</P>
<P>
   Miller hurt her hamstring while training at UCLA on Sept. 7, two
days before she left for Sydney. When she pulled out of the 100
last week, she was hopeful the injury would heal in time for the
200.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was second to Jones in the 100 and 200 at the U.S. trials
and was considered Jones' chief rival in both events.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Track Drug Coverups Alleged  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Shot put world champion C.J. Hunter,
husband of sprinter Marion Jones, failed four separate drug tests
in Europe this summer, international track and Olympic officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's nutritionist said contaminated food supplements were
responsible for the positive results.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what has happened and I don't know how it has
happened,'' said Hunter, choking back tears at a news conference.
''I promise everybody I'm going to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after confirmation that Hunter tested positive for the
steroid nandrolone at the Bislettt Games in Oslo, Norway, on Jan.
28, the Olympic and world track drug chiefs said he flunked three
other tests for the same banned substance.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Ljungqvist, head of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation's medical commission, said in an interview that Hunter
tested positive in out-of-competition doping controls in Oslo and
Milan, Italy; and an in-competition test at the Grand Prix meet in
Zurich, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ''This appears to confirm that he has been ingesting a banned
substance over a period of time,'' Ljungqvist said.
</P>
<P>
   Ljungqvist said the samples were analyzed and reported to the
IAAF by the IOC-accredited laboratories in Oslo, Rome and
Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter will be investigated only for the Bislett Games test
because that lab result was the first to reach the IAAF, Ljungqvist
said. Notification of the three other positives came later.
</P>
<P>
   ''We only address one case,'' he said. ''A second or third or
fourth violation is of no relevance. The first sample is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljungqvist confirmed the sample had a concentration of
nandrolone that was 2,000 nanograms per milliliter of urine -- 1,000
times over the permitted level. He said the levels of nandrolone
varied in the other three tests.
</P>
<P>
   Ljungqvist said he believed Hunter may have been taking
19-norandrostenediol and 19-norandrostenedione, banned steroids
that produce nandrolone in the body.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe he could well be one of the cases who has been
taking food supplements containing these precursors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under IAAF and IOC rules, an athlete is responsible for whatever
substance is found in his body, regardless of how it got there.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and Jones appeared together at a news conference Tuesday
(Monday night EDT), where Jones kissed her husband in a show of
support and asked reporters to leave the couple alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she has ''full and complete respect'' for Hunter and
confidence that he legal system will clear him.
</P>
<P>
   With attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. nearby, Hunter kept breaking
down and fighting back tears as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody on the planet could say that I don't love my wife and I
don't love my kids,'' he began. ''I have never in my life, nor
would I ever, do anything to jeopardize their opinion of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Hunter was his nutritionist, Victor Conte,
executive director of Balco labs in San Francisco. He said Hunter
did not take nandrolone itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is we think it's the result of nutritional
supplements CJ was taking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conte said Hunter took the same supplement used by sprinters
Linford Christie and Merlene Ottey, both of whom have tested
positive for nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the usual excuse,'' said IOC executive Jacques Rogge,
vice chairman of the medical commission. ''Even if he would be
positive with food supplements, it's his responsibility to take
legal substances.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who pulled out of the U.S. Olympic team before the
Olympics but remained to support his wife, said he learned of three
other positives on the radio while he rode in a car to Tuesday's
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was in a supplement, how will I know it was in a
supplement?'' he said. ''Am I really expected to take every
supplement to get tested before I take it?''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Olympic officials have accused the United States of a
long history of suppressing positive tests, including in the leadup
to the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, head of USA Track &AMP; Field, defended the U.S.
procedures Monday. He said the federation had conducted
out-of-competition tests before any another sport and any other
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've tested more people for more substances over a longer
period of time,'' he said. ''And, unfortunately, we've busted more
people than any other sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we doing it perfectly? No, we're not. But we have set the
standard for the rest of the sports world. ... I am far from being
defensive about what we are doing. I am extremely proud of what
we've done. We've been the leader in the world on this matter.
We've paid a price for being the leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Masback, White House drug policy director Barry
McCaffrey urged USA Track &AMP; Field to make a full, public accounting
of how results of the tests were handled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We share your view that the vast majority of athletes, in
particular American athletes, are clean from doping,'' McCaffrey
said. ''However, it is our view that the most appropriate way to
respond to allegations of impropriety -- in particular accusations
of complicity in doping -- is to let the fact speak for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Masback acknowledged that there may be pending positive cases
involving U.S. athletes who are not in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a minor number and let me be clear, the vast majority of
positive tests that we have, and we don't have a lot of positive
tests, are for cold medicines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that there are least two positive tests in the pipeline
at this moment that are cold medicine positives that the athletes
have chosen to contest.''

<HEADLINE> Optimism Blooms For Everglades Plan  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN FARRINGTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Half a century ago, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers bulldozed an elaborate system of roads, canals and levees
that rerouted water across South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It also put the Everglades -- the largest remaining subtropical
wilderness in the United States, home of the American crocodile and
source of drinking water for millions -- under threat.
</P>
<P>
   Now environmentalists are expressing cautious optimism about a
$7.8 billion plan to undo the damage and return natural water flows
as early as 2030 -- a plan spearheaded by the Corps itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be nice to have all that money to spend, but we will
have to watch how it's spent,'' said Juanita Green, the
environmental chair of Friends of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration plan calls for overhauling the plumbing of the
Everglades by eliminating some 240 miles of levies and canals and
building a network of reservoirs, underground aquifers and pumping
stations to capture water and better distribute it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been times when we've opposed this plan and times
we supported it, depending on how the bill is written,'' said Frank
Jackalone, the Florida field representative for the Sierra Club.
''Right now we're supporting it, but our support is lukewarm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation would authorize the first $1.4 billion
installment of the plan, subject to House approval. The overall
cost will be split between the federal government and state funds.
</P>
<P>
   The plan comes as the latest push by conservationists to restore
the nation's water flows. Since last year, more than two dozen dams
from Idaho to North Carolina have come down and more are set to
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Levies and dams create power, protect against floods, improve
navigation and provide irrigation, but environmentalists say
hundreds of them across the country have outlived their usefulness
and are causing environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists for years have pushed for a comprehensive,
long-term program to repair the damage caused by decades of
flood-control efforts that disrupted the Everglades' natural water
flow.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated half of the ecosystem already has disappeared.
Stocks of native wetland plants, wading birds, corals and fish have
declined. Nonnative animal and plant species have spread.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan calls for 60 projects, including construction of
aboveground aquifers and better distribution of water which now
rushes into the ocean to nobody's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the plan would use some of the water for South
Florida's growing population and meet the needs of agricultural
interests, especially the region's sugar industry. That's why the
Friends of the Everglades opposes the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a restoration, this is really a water supply
plan,'' said Green. ''If the bill does pass we will have to watch
very closely to make sure the Everglades gets its share.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as ''the River of Grass,'' the Everglades is critical to
the region's $13 billion annual tourist industry. Its 4 million
acres from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay also has developers eager
to build on much of the land surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the additional water proposed in the plan would be used
to revitalize the home of 1,500 varieties of plants and wildlife
from wading birds to alligators, including at least 68 threatened
or endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ''All parties have an interest in the Everglades, both good and
bad,'' Jackalone said. ''All endorsed the bill. To me that
indicates a big struggle on how those resources are used.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Hiaasen, an author and Miami Herald columnist who has often
written about the need to preserve Florida's natural resources,
said the idea of restoring the Everglades is a good one, but
putting the plan in place might be troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this being done to save the Everglades or is this being
done to create a water supply for development and municipalities?''
Hiaasen asked. ''You need water to put in subdivisions, you need
water to put in condo towers. That's as much a motivating factor as
concern for the alligators and Florida panthers.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Allison DeFoor, Gov. Jeb Bush's former environmental policy
maker, said the plan's focus is on restoration of a national jewel
-- despite what some critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ''My key advice would be quit worrying and enjoy the victory
that we all share,'' he said. ''Environmentalists, even in victory,
they have a very bad habit of worrying. This is a great victory for
the environment.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Roundup  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- After another day dominated by drug
woes, including the first gymnast stripped of a gold medal, Venus
Williams and the U.S. beach volleyball team just went out and won.
</P>
<P>
   The American volleyball tandem of Dain Blanton and Eric
Fonoimoana, longshots at the start of the Olympics, took the gold
medal Tuesday in straight sets. U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion
Williams, with the help of sister Serena, guaranteed herself two
Sydney medals with a straight-set win in doubles.
</P>
<P>
   The news wasn't all good for the Americans: The most anticipated
boxing match of the Olympics ended with Michael Bennett simply
outclassed buy Cuban veteran Felix Savon, and there were more
allegations about steroid use by Marion Jones' husband, C.J.
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has won 31 straight singles matches, teamed with
Serena to beat Els Callens and Dominique Van Roost of Belgium 6-4,
6-1, in the Olympic semifinals. The No. 2-seeded Venus already
qualified for the gold medal match in singles Wednesday against No.
10 Elena Dementieva of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses won 11 of the final 13 games to take their
doubles match. The sisters have won 32 of their past 33 matches
together, and three of the past four Grand Slam tournaments where
they played.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- DRUG TESTS: They are totally opposite in appearance: a
diminutive teen gymnast compared to Nadia Comaneci, a hulking
330-pound shot putter more like King Kong Bundy. Were the two
somehow linked in Sydney?
</P>
<P>
   Positively.
</P>
<P>
   Romanian gymnast Andreea Raducan, just 16, became the latest
drug casualty of the Sydney Games, losing her all-around gymnastics
gold medal Tuesday (Monday evening EDT) after testing positive for
a banned stimulant contained in a cold remedy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. shot putter Hunter was back in the news over his alleged
steroid use. Hunter failed four separate tests for steroids this
summer, results that international and American track officials
knew about but never reported, the IOC's drug chief said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, in a teary news conference with 100-meter gold medalist
Jones, asserted his innocence Tuesday (Monday night EDT). Jones,
who gave her husband a kiss of support, said she believed Hunter
had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what has happened and I don't know how it
happened,'' an emotional Hunter said. ''Nobody on this planet could
say that I don't love my wife and I don't love my kids.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never in my life, nor would I ever, do anything to
jeopardize their opinion of me,'' he added, his voice cracking.
</P>
<P>
   Jones asked the media to leave the couple alone so she could
concentrate on her bid for gold medals in four more events over the
next four days.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC's medical
commission, said Hunter failed three out-of-competition tests in
addition to a test conducted after the Bislett Games in Oslo,
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Raducan was permitted to keep her two other medals Tuesday after
testing positive for pseudoephedrine, the International Olympic
Committee said. The Romanian gymnast apparently ingested the drug
in two cold medicine pills.
</P>
<P>
   Both IOC and Romanian officials acknowledged it was an accident,
but the ruling did not change.
</P>
<P>
   Raducan, the first gymnast stripped of a medal for a drug
violation, becomes the second athlete to lose a Sydney gold. She is
the sixth positive drug case at these games.
</P>
<P>
   She was allowed to keep her gold from the team competition and a
silver from the vault.
</P>
<P>
   The team doctor who gave Raducan the cold medicine was expelled
from the games and suspended for the next two Olympics -- 2002 in
Salt Lake and 2004 in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BEACH VOLLEYBALL: Despite overcasts skies, it was a golden day
at the beach for Americans Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana. The
beach volleyball pair captured the gold medal with a stirring
12-11, 12-9 victory over the favored Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   The winners collapsed in the sand and hugged as the rain fell on
Bondi Beach and the crowd chanted ''USA! USA!'' The bronze medal
went earlier to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- TRACK: A bad left hamstring forced world champion Inger Miller
out of the women's 200 meters. The injury led the American to pull
out of last week's 100, although Miller still hopes to run in the
400-meter relay this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Miller hurt her hamstring while training at UCLA on Sept. 7, two
days before she left for Sydney. Miller was second to Marion Jones
in the 100 and 200 meters at the U.S. trials and was considered
Jones' chief rival in both events.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: The Olympic fight with the most hype was no match at
all. Cuban Felix Savon, the two-time Cuban gold medalist, easily
outclassed American Michael Bennett in the 201-pound quarterfinals.
The fight was stopped in the third round on the 15-point rule,
23-8.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, the defending world champion, had never faced Savon. He
started boxing in an Illinois prison and had less than 50 fights in
open competition.
</P>
<P>
   American Jeff Lacy also failed in his shot at the Olympic
semifinals, losing 18-3 in the third round to Russian Gaidarbek
Gaidarbekov.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WATER POLO: Three times, the United States took the lead. And
three times, Hungary answered to score a 10-9 victory in water
polo. Hungary (3-0-1) advanced to the quarterfinals, while the
Americans (1-3-0) need a win or a tie against in its next game
Greece to make the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- DIVING: American medals hopes remained high in the 3-meter
springboard, with Mark Ruiz sitting in fourth place after the
semifinals. Another American, Troy Dumais, also advanced to the
finals; he placed seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SOFTBALL: It took twice as much effort for the U.S. team to
make the gold medal game, as the American women swept a day-night
doubleheader against two teams that had earlier defeated them in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   To make the gold medal game against Japan, Lisa Fernandez struck
out 13 in shutting out Australia 1-0. Dot Richardson's fifth-inning
single scored the only run of the game as the Atlanta gold
medalists took a huge stride toward defending the title.
</P>
<P>
   Beating Japan would be sweet revenge, giving the Americans
victories over all three teams that beat them in the preliminary
round. In the first game Monday, the U.S. team beat China 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S VOLLEYBALL: The U.S. team heads home from Sydney with a
perfect record -- of ineptitude. The volleyballers ended their
Olympic experience with five losses in five games, the last one
Monday to Italy by scores of 21-25, 25-18, 25-18, 25-18.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Gets Bail On Sex Charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A Ugandan swimmer charged with raping a
17-year-old girl near the main Olympic venue had been granted bail.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Atuhaire, 22, appeared in court Monday night after being
extradited from Adelaide in southern Australia, where he was
arrested Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Atuhaire was ordered to appear in court Oct. 19 to enter a plea.
He faces a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   He was released on $10,940 bail and had his passport
confiscated. His Olympic credential, which acts as an entry visa
for Australia during the Sydney Games, has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Atuhaire was expected to be released from custody later Tuesday
after a Ugandan official agreed to post the bail.
</P>
<P>
   Atuhaire has been ordered to stay at an accommodation provided
by the Salvation Army until authorities issue him a new visa.
</P>
<P>
   Atuhaire, from the Ugandan capital of Kampala, was eliminated
from competition on the first morning of the games on Sept. 16. He
recorded 1 minute, 22.35 seconds in the first heat of the 100-meter
breaststroke, the slowest of 65 competitors.

<HEADLINE> House Awaits Everglades Bill  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now the $7.8 billion rescue plan for the
Florida Everglades becomes a battle against the clock in Congress.
After Senate approval, supporters are scrambling to get House
action before lawmakers quit for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate gave overwhelming approval Monday to legislation
authorizing the first $1.4 billion installment of the Everglades
restoration effort. But environmentalists and administration
officials acknowledged that getting House approval in the closing
days of the 106th Congress is uncertain. If the House does not act,
the measure will be put off until next year.
</P>
<P>
   The 85-1 Senate vote ''gives us a lot of momentum,'' said Sen.
Bob Graham, D-Fla., adding that he remained optimistic that the
measure could clear Congress this year for President Clinton's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Without action ''we could lose what is left'' of the Everglades
ecosystem, Graham said. An estimated half of the Everglades already
has disappeared because of the diversion of natural water flows.
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades project was included in legislation that also
authorized two dozen various flood control, waterway navigation and
environmental restoration projects by the Army Corps of Engineers,
which also will be in charge of the Everglades restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed blueprint for saving the Everglades, submitted to
Congress by the Army Corps last year, has widespread support from
both environmentalists and Florida's sugar industry as well as the
White House; the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Al
Gore; the GOP presidential nominee, George W. Bush; and his brother
Jeb Bush, who is Florida's Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush are running neck and neck in Florida, which, with
its 25 electoral votes, is considered important to winning the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government already has spent about $1.2 billion on
various Everglades recovery efforts and the state of Florida
hundreds of millions more in recent years, according to federal and
state officials.
</P>
<P>
   The comprehensive recovery plan, which is expected to take more
than three decades to complete, has been described as the most
ambitious environmental restoration attempt in history.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for a ''replumbing'' of the Everglades ecosystem -- the
300 miles of swampland, saw grass marshes, cypress trees and
mangrove estuaries that stretch from central Florida and the
Kissimmee River drainage north of Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay
and the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ''River of Grass'' because of the vast flow of water
that swept southward covering hundreds of square miles, the
Everglades are viewed by many as a national environmental treasure,
but one in danger of disappearing. A half century of flood control
projects begun after World War II by the Army Corps has drained
thousands of acres and destroyed half of what once had been part of
the watery ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our challenge is to assure that the environmental damage of
the last 50 years is not continued or repeated,'' said Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, hailing Monday's Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   While half of the $7.8 billion project would be paid for by the
federal government and the other half by the state of Florida, it's
scope and duration has prompted concern from some members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It could become ''a giant sucking machine,'' Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., recently complained, although he voted for the measure
Monday. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., cast the only ''no'' vote,
saying he was worried about the measure's ''open ended'' money
stream when some of the project involves still-uncertain
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan is not without risk,'' said Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H.,
chairman of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee. ''But
if we do nothing, we lose the Everglades. We need to take this risk
to save this precious ecosystem.''

<HEADLINE> Hamman Sets U.S. Lifting Records  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- U.S. champion Shane Hamman set national
records for the snatch and total lift Tuesday while finishing
second in the B group of Olympic super heavyweight weightlifters.
</P>
<P>
   Hamman substantially broke his U.S. record in the snatch,
lifting 429&AMP;frac34; pounds (195 kg) -- or 16&AMP;frac12; pounds more than the record
413&AMP;frac14; pounds (187.5) he raised during the Olympic trials in July.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hamman could not break his record of 507 pounds (230
kg) in the clean and jerk set during the trials. Hamman, his blue
singlet smeared with white chalk dust, raised 496 pounds (225

kg).
</P>
<P>
   Hamman's total lift of 925&AMP;frac34; pounds (420 kg) broke his U.S.
record of 920&AMP;frac14; pounds (417.5 kg), also set during the trials.
</P>
<P>
   A former power lifter, the Mustang, Okla., resident has been
lifting only four years, making the 28-year-old among the most
inexperienced of the world-class lifters.
</P>
<P>
   Tibor Stark of Hungary won the 14-lifter B group with a total
weight of 936&AMP;frac34; pounds (425 kg), or 88 pounds (40 kg) below German
Ronny Weller's world record.
</P>
<P>
   Raimonds Bermanis of Latvia withdrew with what was initially
diagnosed as a dislocated right elbow after dropping a bar loaded
with 396&AMP;frac34; pounds (180 kg) directly onto his elbow. He returned to
the lifting platform to wave to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The medals-round lifters in the 231&AMP;frac14; pounds plus (105 kg plus)
group, including 1996 Olympic champion Andrei Chemerkin of Russia
and Weller, competed later Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Election Results Demanded  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Heightening a tense standoff,
Yugoslavian opposition leaders afraid of vote-rigging have given
the government a Wednesday deadline to release election results or
they will proclaim their own candidate the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica has said he
won Sunday's election, while the ruling coalition claims President
Slobodan Milosevic is in the lead after incomplete returns.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 people turned out for a second straight night
Monday in Belgrade to celebrate what the opposition and much of the
international community has said was a stunning victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Election Commission has refused to release
official figures. The opposition has accused the government of
stalling while Milosevic tries to manipulate the results, either to
declare himself the winner or force a runoff Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the delay, opposition spokesman Cedomir Jovanovic
said Monday that Kostunica's supporters would give the commission
two days -- until Wednesday -- to announce results or they would
''proclaim official results no matter what the government thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic said it was becoming clear that Milosevic could not
accept defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and dozens of European countries called
clearly for Milosevic to recognize the opposition tally and step
down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We accept Milosevic as an indicted war criminal. He belongs in
The Hague. He doesn't belong at the helm of the Yugoslav
government,'' said White House spokesman P.J. Crowley. ''There's no
way that Milosevic can claim a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has pledged to lift sanctions against
Yugoslavia -- including blocking international bank loans, an oil
embargo and denying visas to Yugoslav officials -- once Milosevic
accepts defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The final results of the election are not yet known. But in
light of all the available information, it is clear that any claim
by Milosevic that he is the winner would be fraudulent,'' said the
European Union in a statement released by the French government,
which now holds the union's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Yugoslavia's neighbor and traditional ally
Greece were more cautious, but their message could not be
disguised.
</P>
<P>
   ''The large participation and manner in which the election
process was held, demonstrate the maturity and desire of the
Serbian people to proceed with democratic changes in Yugoslavia,''
said Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Panagiotis Beglitis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Milosevic's camp showed itself unprepared to give in,
reportedly jamming the last remaining independent Belgrade radio
station -- student Radio Index -- during its live coverage of the
opposition celebration.
</P>
<P>
   All other independent electronic media were banned by state
authorities on the eve of elections last week.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference to bolster morale among the president's
shocked and demoralized followers earlier in the day, Gorica
Gajevic, Milosevic's party general secretary, claimed that with 37
percent of the ballots counted, Milosevic was ahead by 45 percent
to Kostunica's 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This result gives us optimism that we can win in the first
round,'' Gajevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Ljubisa Ristic, a neo-communist Milosevic ally, while insisting
the incumbent could still win in the first round, admitted
Milosevic's coalition suffered a sweeping defeat in municipal
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was jubilant, with people celebrating what they thought
was the final end of Milosevic's neo-communist rule. Belgrade has
long been an opposition stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, we are free,'' university student Milica Danilovic,
22, said. ''We can start breathing like normal people. Smiles are
back, the pressure is gone, we are flying!''

<HEADLINE> Kazakstan 9, Slovakia 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Igor Zagoruiko scored twice in the
first quarter Tuesday as Kazakstan did what it could to advance in
Olympic men's water polo with a 9-4 victory over Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakstan (1-2-1) is tied with Australia for the final Group A
qualifying spot. It faces Italy, which has won gold and silver the
past two Olympics, in its last round-robin game.
</P>
<P>
   Australia can qualify, no matter what Kazakstan does, with
victories over Italy and Spain in its final two games.
</P>
<P>
   Karol Baco had three goals for Slovakia, 0-4-0 in its first
Olympics. The Slovaks close the opening round against Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakstan ended things early. Yuriy Smolovyy scored in the
opening minute and when Zagoruiko had his second goal, Kazakstan
led 4-0 with less than four minutes gone.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing went right for Slovakia, the youngest team in the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   It missed its first 16 shots before scoring. Baco's close-in
penalty shot in the first half was smothered by Kazakstan goalie
Konstantin Chernov.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Peter Nizny was bleeding from a hand to the face, he
could not get the referee to stop play. When he ripped his cap off,
he was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia coach Ladislav Bottlik argued Nizny's case and was
given a red card, which carries a one-game suspension.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boxers Make Coach Look Good  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Michael Bennett, boxing in open
competition for only two years, had the will, but he couldn't find
the way to beat vaunted Cuban heavyweight Felix Savon, who took
another step toward a third Olympic boxing gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot Bennett, of Chicago, who has fewer than 50 bouts in
open competition since being released from prison in 1998, landed
some hard rights. But the 6-6 Cuban veteran was able to spear the
American with hard, long-range blows to the head and stop him on
the 15-point rule (23-8) in the third round of a 201-pound match
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think I was 15 points down,'' Bennett said. ''I did
feel like I hurt him because I have the power, just like most
heavyweights have the power, to end a bout with one punch.''
</P>
<P>
   The size and experience, however, were lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came out, I was healthy and I did my very best. I can't be
anything but pleased with myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Savon, who also has won six world championships,
will box in Thursday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been a true warrior throughout the years,'' Bennett said
of Savon, who did not meet with media after the match.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Jeff Lacy's bid to become the first American to reach
the semifinals fell far short when he was stopped by a Russian
opponent in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Lacy of St. Petersburg, Fla., showed virtually
nothing in being stopped by Gaidarbek Gaidarbekov on the 15-point
rule (18-3) in the third round. Gaidarbekov became the fourth
Russian to advance to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Boxers in the semifinals are assured of at least a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Bennett, who served seven years in prison for
armed robbery, said he wouldn't be intimidated by Savon, and he
wasn't. He simply was outmatched.
</P>
<P>
   When Bennett got inside Savon's reach, he landed some solid
shots, but he took punishment on the way in. Savon led 7-2 after
one round and 17-6 after two.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, trailing 19-7 in the third round, landed two hard
rights to the head, but they were his finals scoring blows.
</P>
<P>
   Savon is trying to equal the record of Lazlo Papp of Hungary and
Teofilio Stevenson of Cuba. Papp won gold medals at 165 pounds in
1948 and at 156 pounds in the 1952-56. Stevenson won heavyweight
championships in 1972-76-80. Americans did not compete in the 1980
Olympics at Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-punching Lacy didn't land a scoring blow until there
was 1:22 left in the second round. By then he was behind 6-1. It
just got worse for Lacy, who registered all three of his scoring
blows in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing wrong with me,'' Lacy said. ''This guy was
just a very good boxer. The main thing I wanted to do was make it
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The last American boxer to win an Olympic heavyweight title was
Ray Mercer at Seoul in 1988. Those games were boycotted by Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The first Cuban to reach the semifinals was Mario Kindelan, who
stopped Tigkran Ouzlian of Greece on the 15-point rule (24-9) in
the fourth round of a 132-pound bout.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rafael Lozano of Spain, boxing in his third Olympics, who
became the first semifinalist. Lozano, a bronze medal winner in
1996, outscored Suleiman Bilali of Kenya 6-2 in the third round for
a 10-6 lead, then he held on for an 11-10 victory at 106 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   His semifinal opponent will be Kim Un-Chol, the only North
Korean in the tournament, who beat Ivan Stapovic of Lithunia 22-10.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Seniors Mull New Choices  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three years after Congress expanded health
care options for seniors, the over-65 crowd is just now getting
access to a private fee-for-service plan.
</P>
<P>
   Congress required that the elderly be given access to such plans
as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, figuring Medicare
competition would reduce costs and increase benefit choices.
</P>
<P>
   But so far Sterling Life Insurance Co. of Bellingham, Wash., is
the only company offering seniors a private fee-for-service option.
The company started the plan in July and it now is available in all
or parts of 25 states.
</P>
<P>
   Other insurers have been reluctant to step in because they think
government reimbursements are too low. And there also is concern
about whether seniors can be persuaded to switch to a privately run
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are incredibly comfortable with the traditional
Medicare program,'' said Joyce Dubow, senior policy adviser at
AARP's Public Policy Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dubow said AARP is not supporting private fee-for-service plans
now but is trying to provide information on Sterling to seniors so
they can decide whether it is right for them.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Baker, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center, a
New York-based watchdog group, said he's wary of private insurers
competing with Medicare. He suggests people wait and see how
Sterling performs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They might do a wonderful job at that,'' Baker said. ''We just
don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly
and disabled, allows beneficiaries to see any doctor who accepts
Medicare patients. The government then reimburses doctors for
services.
</P>
<P>
   With Sterling, the government pays the company a flat monthly
fee to cover enrollees, who then may see a doctor of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Rosen, senior vice president for policy at the Health
Insurance Association of America, said insurers have been reticent
to enter this market because they aren't sure it can be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   He said the companies point to the experience of Medicare HMOs,
which have been serving seniors since the mid-1980s. Lately, the
HMOs have complained that low reimbursement rates and rising costs
are forcing them to leave the market or scale back benefits.
</P>
<P>
   About 6.2 million seniors -- 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries
-- are in the HMOs. Nearly 1 million are expected to lose their
coverage Jan. 1 due to HMO pullouts. The government expects all but
160,000 people nationwide to have access to another HMO. Any of
those who lose their coverage will be able to get benefits through
traditional Medicare, although in many cases not as many as they
had with an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Moon, a health economist at the Washington-based Urban
Institute think tank, said the Balanced Budget Act that opened
Medicare to competition also kept some insurers from entering the
market by slowing the annual growth of Medicare reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it probably didn't help competition,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year boosted reimbursements in rural areas where
choices are limited to encourage private insurers to enter those
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's strategy is to capture those bonus payments and stay
out of highly competitive markets, according to Debbie Ahl, chief
operating officer for Olympic Health Management Service, the
administrative arm of Sterling. Olympic and Sterling are
subsidiaries of Chicago-based Aon Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Patients in traditional Medicare pay a monthly fee of $45.50 and
must pay 20 percent of allowed doctor's charges. Many seniors who
use traditional Medicare buy supplemental polices to enhance
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling offers lower co-payments for hospital stays and access
to a nurse advice line. But participants pay a $55 monthly premium
and a $10 co-payment for doctor's visits on top of Medicare's
monthly fee of $45.50.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sterling's $55 premium is about half of what customers
would pay for a supplementary policy with similar benefits,
according to Ahl. Moon and government officials confirmed that
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Like traditional Medicare, Sterling's plan does not include
prescription drug coverage. The benefit is the top draw of many
Medicare HMOs, but also among their biggest headaches because of
exploding drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   Senior advocates say Sterling should offer a drug benefit if it
wants to gain popularity. The plan had only about 100 enrollees on
Sept. 1, though company officials expect that to increase when they
launch a marketing initiative and begin getting doctors to agree to
participate in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering paying for a drug benefit for seniors,
and Ahl said Sterling is waiting to see what happens before taking
action on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The Sterling plan is available in Alaska, Arizona, Delaware,
Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico,
Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Washington. It also is available in
selected counties in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Texas
and West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Killings Unnerve Calif. County  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN MELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERCED, Calif. (AP) -- A pitchfork-wielding intruder stabs and
kills two children in a farmhouse. A teen-ager is accused of
beheading his mother with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a month, Merced County -- a hot, dry farming region
in the center of California -- has been jolted by two grisly crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's taken a toll on some of my detectives,'' said Assistant
Sheriff Henry Strength. ''The normal homicide is one thing, but
these are all bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   At a McDonald's, old-timers digest the latest crime news with
cups of coffee. One man wonders how someone could kill his own
mother. Others ponder a gruesome front-page story in the local
paper about a farming accident in which a man was ground up in a
corn chopper.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe what's happening,'' said Alex Flores, a
retired construction worker. ''This is supposed to happen someplace
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, death has visited Merced County -- derived from the
Spanish phrase for Our Lady of Mercy -- in a most merciless way.
</P>
<P>
   Until August, not a single homicide had been recorded this year
in this 2,000-square-mile county -- running from the Coast Ranges to
the Sierra foothills -- that is home to 209,000 people, thousands of
cows and chickens, almond trees and other crops.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of barely three weeks, however, authorities twice
found themselves at horrific crime scenes, confronting aggressive
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathon David Bruce, 27, was shot dead when, according to
deputies, he charged at them with the pitchfork after killing the
children.
</P>
<P>
   David Lange, 18, naked and blood-soaked when he was found near
his mother's beheaded body, chased firefighters from his house with
a knife when they responded to an emergency call, investigators
said. He surrendered peacefully when confronted by armed officers.
</P>
<P>
   The killings have shaken even veteran law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does exact something from you -- we're all human,'' said
Sgt. Rick Marshall, head of the sheriff's major crimes unit.
''These are very, very heinous, bizarre things. Two of these come
down, with the same people investigating, it's not that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings came at a pivotal time for the county. A new
visitor's center opened this summer to lure tourists heading to
nearby Yosemite National Park. The University of California plans
to build a campus here.
</P>
<P>
   ''Merced is not a bad place to live,'' Strength said. ''We've
had some bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The county has had brushes with notorious crimes before,
including a 1972 kidnapping that remains in its consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   A Merced boy named Steven Stayner became a local hero and the
subject of a book and movie when, after seven years, he escaped
from the child molester who kidnapped him. Stayner rescued a
5-year-old boy who had also been abducted. His tale took a tragic
turn when he died in a motorcycle accident in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That story gained a grim sequel when Stayner's brother was
accused of being the killer who stalked Yosemite last year, slaying
four women.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Stayner, a 39-year-old motel handyman raised in Merced
County, is headed to federal prison for life for murdering a
naturalist in the park. He still faces a state trial and could get
the death penalty if convicted of killing three Yosemite
sightseers.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry O'Banion, chairman of the county supervisors, is perplexed
by the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is truly a tragedy that so many of these crimes are
happening,'' O'Banion said. ''We've had crime, but nothing of this
magnitude. I don't know what can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bruce went on his pitchfork rampage, investigators thought
they had an explanation: drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Valley is widely known for a budding methamphetamine
trade. Police frequently raid primitive labs manufacturing the
mind-altering upper known to trigger paranoia, psychosis and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Before killing 9-year-old Ashley Carpenter and her 7-year-old
brother, John, Bruce was spotted in the house naked. With little to
explain the seemingly random attack, the sheriff's department
speculated that the killer was high. Strength said meth users often
strip because they overheat from the drug.
</P>
<P>
   But lab tests came back negative, and deputies are holding their
tongues before leaping to the same conclusion about the beheading
of 50-year-old Aurelia Lange.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no easy answers in the murders that haunt Merced
and unsettle its residents.
</P>
<P>
   As Mary Ornelas, 65, walked her dog on the manicured lawn
outside the county courthouse, she lamented that her hometown had
changed and that fear had crept in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just makes me sick to think those things are happening in
Merced,'' Ornelas said. ''I hate for that to happen because it's a
nice little town.''

<HEADLINE> Sex Offender Escapes San Quentin  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) -- A sex offender who escaped from San
Quentin State Prison before dawn Monday remained on the loose after
authorities mistakenly arrested his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''This happens occasionally,'' said Stephen Greene, assistant
secretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency in Sacramento.
''He apparently looks a lot like his brother.''
</P>
<P>
   The mix-up led officials to announce that they had recaptured
Eduardo Mariscal at his girlfriend's home in Santa Rosa, about 50
miles north of the prison, about 12 hours after he escaped. Police
realized they had the wrong man after taking his fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the state Department of Correction say they
are back on the hunt, concentrating their search in Marin County,
where the prison is located, and in neighboring Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal, 31, was housed in a medium-security dormitory-style
cellblock, bunking with hundreds of other inmates, when he managed
to walk out of the building unnoticed, said prison spokesman
Vernell Crittendon. About 200 feet away, near a perimeter fence 14
feet high and topped with razor wire, authorities found a pair of
gloves and a blanket on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Mariscal threw the blanket over the razor
wire before scaling the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal was sentenced in May 1994 for sex crimes involving
minors. He had a tentative release date of July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The prison, which opened in 1852, is California's oldest and
houses its death row. It was designed to hold nearly 3,300 inmates
but currently houses 5,850.
</P>
<P>
   Crittendon did not immediately know how many prisoners have
escaped from San Quentin or exactly when the last one took place,
except that it was at least three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Globalization Forces Mobilize  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREA LORINCZOVA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Activists of all stripes are
setting out to spoil the opening of a major money meeting opening
here in Prague, hoping to pull off a repeat of the mass
anti-globalization protests that disrupted similar summits last
year in Seattle and this spring in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But early signs are that protests at the joint meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank -- which begins
Tuesday -- may be weaker than expected. Fewer demonstrators arrived
and Czech authorities stopped at the border almost 300 people with
arrest records from previous anti-globalization rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Plainclothes police officers on Monday hauled away three
protesters who had chained themselves to a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Among the protesters' goals is to march on the convention center
where the world's top finance officials are meeting and then form a
human chain around the building, trapping the delegates inside.
They've also threatened to block roads and shut down the city's
underground train system.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations over the last few days have been mostly peaceful,
although anarchists and skinheads fought briefly Saturday without
causing any serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Czech authorities have mobilized 11,000 police to maintain
control. As of late Monday afternoon, it appeared highly possible
police would outnumber protesters.

   Many local shops have closed for fear of being trashed by

   While protest organizers stuck to their prediction of 20,000
demonstrators, they said that 7,000 had arrived by Monday, while
police put the estimate at 3,000. An entrepreneur who set up a tent
city that could hold 15,000 people said he had only 1,000 campers
by Monday afternoon -- even after halving prices to try to cut his
losses.

<HEADLINE> Cuba 3, Japan 0  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- New tournament format, same result.
Orestes Kindelan drives in runs and Cuba plays for the baseball
gold.
</P>
<P>
   Kindelan, the cleanup hitter on Cuba's two gold medal teams,
drove in three runs with a pair of singles Tuesday (Monday night
EDT) for a 3-0 victory over Japan in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing its all-red uniforms, the Big Red Machine of Olympic
baseball advanced to its third consecutive title game. The Cubans
will play either the United States or South Korea, who met in the
other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   International baseball leveled the field by switching from metal
to wood bats and allowing professionals in the Olympic tournament
for the first time. Cuba had its 21-game winning streak snapped and
had two more close calls -- a pair of one-run wins -- during the
preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   A team featuring 13 gold medal players was at its best when the
gold was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably they have better concentration and their pitching is
probably better than ours,'' Japan manager Kozo Ohtagaki said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which sent eight top players from its major leagues to
the Olympics, got outhit, outpitched and -- during the game's
turning moment -- outcoached.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ariel Contreras, Cuba's top pitcher, held a lineup
featuring four Japanese major leaguers to six hits while striking
out nine. Contreras, who mixes a 90 mph fastball with a nasty
breaking ball, allowed only four balls out of the infield in the
first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think Japan's hitters were very good, but we have a saying
in baseball: good pitching stops good hitting,'' Cuba manager
Servio Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed by rain for 68 minutes in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which lost the gold medal game to Cuba in 1996, chose not
to use top starter Daisuke Matsuzaka, who had only two days of rest
after his nine-inning start against South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it went with Tomohiro Kuroki, who took Hideki Irabu's
place as the top starter for the Chiba Lotte Marines three years
ago. Kuroki lost because he couldn't handle Kindelan.
</P>
<P>
   Kindelan's line-drive single to left drove in a run for a 1-0
lead in the fourth. A strategic mistake gave Kindelan a chance to
break the game open in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Ulacia reached on an infield single and took second on
Yasser Gomez's single. Kindelan came up with two outs, and both
runners advanced on Kuroki's first-pitch wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Even though first base now was open and Cuba's top run-producer
was at bat, the Japanese chose to pitch to him. The 36-year-old
power hitter lined the next pitch to left with a resounding
''Whack!'' for a two-run single, spinning and pumping his arm after
he rounded first.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese knew first-hand that Kindelan was dangerous -- he
hit a three-run homer and drove in four runs Sunday in Cuba's 6-2
preliminary-round win over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was prepared for him,'' Kuroki said. ''I got the ball up and
he got a hit. He's the best in the world, so it's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Contreras was pitching, Japan had no chance to come
back. Japan got only four balls out of the infield in the first six
innings and got only one runner as far as third.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras escaped a two-on threat in the fourth when Nobuhiko
Matsunaka, who hit a grand slam during Japan's gold-medal game loss
to Cuba in 1996, grounded softly back to the mound to start a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras also pitched out of a two-on threat in the seventh and
another in the eighth, leaving Japan to play the loser of the
United States-South Korea game for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans got a couple of breaks early, as Japan hit two line
drives right at German Mesa. The slick-fielding shortstop was part
of the 1992 gold medal team but didn't go to Atlanta because of a
two-year suspension for introducing Cubans players to baseball
agents.

<HEADLINE> Protests May Overshadow Money Summit  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Brewing anti-globalization
protests threaten to tarnish a so-far successful money summit where
the world's finance ministers managed to temporarily brake Europe's
sliding common currency and clip the wings of soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about the euro and oil prices topped the agenda during
the three days of policy-setting meetings that preceded Tuesday's
opening of the joint annual meetings of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But conference goers were greeted with good news Monday, when
markets rallied to their strong words about coordinated efforts to
push oil prices lower and their implied threat that rich nations
might intervene again to buy more euros and keep the currency
buoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices fell, but the euro held firm after Friday's central
bank intervention to stop its worrisome slide.
</P>
<P>
   But all that good news could be overshadowed Tuesday by
protesters who have pledged to repeat the anti-globalization
message they made through mass demonstrations last year at a World
Trade Organization meeting in Seattle and in the spring at the IMF
and World Bank meetings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite the calls for mass protests, the number of
protesters actually in town by late Monday was far below the 20,000
organizers had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the convention halls, delegates are expected to endorse a
World Bank proposal outlined Monday to double the number of poor
countries receiving special debt relief packages by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   So far only 10 of 40 eligible nations have managed to get
through what has proven to be a lengthy qualification process.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for various global poverty organizations expressed
pleasure at the new goal, but they complained that other portions
of their agenda were not taken up, including a U.S.-pushed
initiative to achieve universal education in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank President James Wolfensohn insisted the IMF and his
organization were heeding the demands to accelerate help for those
left behind in the new global economy, but he insisted that
globalization -- the movement toward greater economic connections
between countries -- is a force that cannot be turned back.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank statistics predicted the inclusion of 20 nations in
the debt relief effort will result in forgiveness of 65 percent of
those countries' foreign debt, saving them about $30 billion. The
money is intended to be used to fight poverty and provide medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance with Wolfensohn, Bono, the Irish rock musician
who has made global debt relief his cause, called the World Bank
president a ''bold'' man for his efforts on debt relief and called
it ''the door we must pass through'' to solve global poverty.

<HEADLINE> Freeman Focuses On Next Race  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Less than 24 hours after winning gold
in the women's 400 meters, Cathy Freeman was asked about her
long-term future but preferred to focus only on her next race.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was asked about retirement, about a possible career in
politics and about where she plans to live in the future during a
news conference Tuesday with other Australian medalists from the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said she's concentrating on the first round of the
women's 200 meters on Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly more relaxing going into the deuce. The
expectations aren't as high as going into the 400,'' she said. ''I
don't know if it gets any better than this. I don't know if I care
to search for that answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, 27, said she was not sure whether she'll still be
running at the time of the 2004 Athens Games, and brushed aside
continuing suggestions by Australian political leaders that she
enter public service.
</P>
<P>
   Some political leaders have suggested that Freeman, the first
Aborigine to win an individual Olympic gold medal, could be a
powerful voice on indigenous affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politics is something that isn't for me just for the moment. I
haven't had the time to focus my energy in that field. My running
career isn't over yet,'' she said. ''But who knows down the track,
when you're supposedly older and wiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman is married to an American and spent most of the past six
months in the United States and Europe while preparing for the
Olympics. But Freeman said she is trying not to think too far
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every second my thoughts take me somewhere else. Retirement?
Sure, it's crossed my mind. Living in another country? Sure it's
crossed my mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I love so much about life is that it's a mystery and who
knows what lies ahead. My plan right now is just to run the 200
tomorrow. And I want to get a massage right away.''

<HEADLINE> Legally Blind Runner Enjoys Sydney  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Marla Runyan is roaming around the
cafeteria in the Olympic athletes' village with a plastic tray and
silverware, hunting for broccoli. She finds a veggie that looks
right, only to discover she's filled her plate with spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Such everyday chores are difficult for Runyan, who is legally
blind. Operating her cellphone in Sydney is a major undertaking, as
is reading her watch.
</P>
<P>
   But running is not tough at all. In fact, she does it so
naturally -- and so well -- that she'll be in the field when the
first round of the women's 1,500 meters is contested Wednesday
(Tuesday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Runyan has an incurable retina condition called Stargardt's
Disease that has reduced the middle of her eyesight. Though she can
use peripheral vision for activities such as running, other
competitors appear to her as streaks of color.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan, who won four events at the 1992 Paralympics and is the
first U.S. paralympian to make the Olympics, insists her restricted
vision is no handicap when she's competing -- even though she can't
read the lap clock during a race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Running on the track is one of the things I can do well. I
just don't see it as being a barrier. I have a sense of strength on
the track that in other areas of my life I don't have,'' says
Runyan, who can't decipher opponents' race numbers but recognizes
them by body shape or hairstyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a very good sense of moving around in a pack of
runners,'' she says. ''I just feel I have a really good sense of
people's mechanics moving next to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some routine tasks away from the track are much more difficult.
Such as finding her green vegetable of choice. Or figuring out how
to use her cellphone, a task that consumed 2&AMP;frac12; hours. Or reading her
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why I even wear it, but I guess I want to look
like everybody else,'' she says. ''It's just day-to-day life things
that are hard. I use a lot of types of visual aids to get through
day-to-day life.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyan first had trouble with her eyes in the fourth grade, when
she couldn't read the blackboard. The condition has degenerated to
the point that Runyan now has 20-300 vision in her left eye and
20-400 in her right eye.
</P>
<P>
   But that has never stopped her from playing sports. She competed
in gymnastics and soccer until she couldn't see the ball any
longer. She switched to track, excelling as a high jumper in high
school and as a heptathlete at San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ''I struggled in the classroom,'' she says. ''Everything was
very laborious. When I went outside and played sports, I felt as if
I could do as well as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning the 100, 200, 400 and long jump at the 1992
Paralympics, and the pentathlon at the 1996 Paralympics, she was
10th in the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials heptathlon. Then she turned
exclusively to middle-distance running.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Eugene, Ore., where some of the world's best
runners train, but was sidelined for two years by a series of
injuries. Runyan was teaching aerobics to senior citizens at a
YMCA, earning $7 an hour, before beginning her comeback -- winning
the 1,500 at the Pan American Games last year, and finishing 10th
in that event at the 1999 world championships.
</P>
<P>
   She injured tendons in her left leg while jumping out of the way
of a child on a bicycle this June, and nearly had to pull out of
the U.S. Olympic trials. But she fought through pain and finished
third at the trials, claiming a spot for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan has reveled in the excitement of being at the games. On
her personal Website, she recounts standing at an Olympic village
bus stop with a U.S. woman who was carrying the gold medal she had
won earlier in the games in rifle shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her medal was beautiful,'' Runyan says in her on-line diary.
''I held it close to my right eye and could see an image on one
side and then flipped it over and saw the Olympic rings. While this
may seem strange, it made me want to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyan has been cheered by the help of Sydney volunteers, such
as a cafeteria worker who offered to read her the entire
nutritional chart for foods in the athletes' village. And she has
been overwhelmed by e-mail from fans worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   She has received hundreds of messages -- including a letter from
a boy in Turkey, an e-mail from Israel and phone calls from
Argentina, South Africa and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ''A positive side effect is the impact it's having on people's
lives,'' she says. ''I had no idea this would happen. I had no idea
it would reach this many people.
</P>
<P>
   ''My race will last only four minutes, but I think the
difference it's going to make in other people's lives is more
longlasting.''

<HEADLINE> Xuan China's Most Successful Gymnast  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The cold medicine that downed Romanian
gymnast Andreea Raducan made history for China's Liu Xuan: she
became the first Chinese woman ever to win three gymnastic medals
at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Liu was awarded the all-around bronze -- the first all-around
medal ever won by a Chinese woman -- after Raducan was stripped of
her gold Tuesday for testing positive for a banned stimulant
contained in two cold medicine pills she took to fight the flu.
</P>
<P>
   For Liu, it was a bitter-sweet end to a career that had carried
two people's dreams: her own and those of her mother who was forced
to give up gymnastics during the chaos of China's 1966-1976
Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very sorry for her,'' Liu said of Raducan. ''I'm very
happy for myself -- a very surprised sort of happy -- but I think
that the all-around champion really is very good. I feel sorry for
her and sad that this problem occured.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu, who originally had placed fourth in the all-around
competition, said Raducan was the better gymnast and she appeared
to accept that the Romanian had taken pseudoephedrine
inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
   The drug was contained in Nurofen, a common over-the-counter
medicine, given to 16-year-old Raducan by her team doctor. Held
responsible, he was expelled from the games and suspended through
the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake and the 2004 Summer Games in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just couldn't make sense of it,'' Liu said of Raducan's
positive test. ''I thought this was impossible because in
gymnastics we rely on technique to complete our moves. It's not
possible to rely on drugs or strength to complete them, you have to
rely entirely on skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu already had a bronze medal from the team competition -- only
the second time China's women have won a team medal. The first,
also a bronze, was at the boycotted Los Angeles Games of 1984, when
communist China made its summer Olympic debut.
</P>
<P>
   She also won the beam title Monday, the first Chinese woman to
so so. She shared the victory with her mother, saying: ''It's
possible that I realized her dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu said she had hoped to bring her mother to Sydney but she
wasn't able to get a visa.
</P>
<P>
   Liu's three medals put her ahead of Ma Yanhong and Lu Li as
China's most successful Olympic female gymnasts. Ma won team bronze
and gold on the uneven bars at Los Angeles, while Lu took gold on
the bars and silver on the beam in Barcelona in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Liu, 21, almost retired after the Atlanta Olympics, having
failed to win a medal. But she stayed on, providing stability and
experience to her teenage teammates at Sydney, helping them to an
unprecedented five women's medals.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Chinese gymnasts, Liu was just a kid when she
was picked by a coach to do gymnastics at a sports institute in her
hometown of Changsha, in the southern Chinese province of Hunan.
She boarded and was allowed home just once a week. Since she
transferred to the national team in Beijing at age 13, she has
gotten to see her parents once a year or less.
</P>
<P>
   Liu said Sydney would likely be her last competition and that
she wants to go to college. While she has not decided what to
study, she said she was interested in news media. As with other
Chinese gymnasts, Liu's academic aspirations had to take second
place to training, until now.
</P>
<P>
   ''Intellectually, I feel that I'm missing a lot,'' she said.
''We know a lot about gymnastics but I won't do gymnastics for the
rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   With her three medals, Liu should be able to live comfortably.
The government has promised gold medalists at least 80,000 yuan
(dlrs 9,600) -- ten times the average annual earnings of many
Chinese -- and 30,000 yuan (dlrs 3,600) for each bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities often also build a free home, called
''champions houses,'' for winners at the Olympics or China's
four-yearly National Games, said gymnastics coach Chen Xiong.

<HEADLINE> Freeman Win Seen As Big Step Forward  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PASSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Viji Reddy, a South African-born
registered nurse, had been waiting in line for nearly three hours
Tuesday at the Martin Place post office in central Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Along with nearly a thousand others, she was there to get a
special-issue stamp of Australian 400-meter gold medalist Cathy
Freeman that went on sale at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't miss getting this for the world,'' said Reddy, who
has lived in Sydney for 12 years. ''What she has done in the past
two weeks under such incredible pressure will always be my Olympic
highlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman became the first Aborigine to win an individual Olympic
gold medal when she sprinted past her nearest rivals in the final
150 meters of the race before a capacity crowd of 110,000 at the
Olympic stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days earlier, on Sept. 15, she lit the cauldron in the same
stadium before another capacity crowd at the opening ceremony,
firmly establishing her as a symbol of black and white relations in
Australia, a position galvanized by her gold medal win.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she lit that flame, it became such a focal part of
reconciliation in this country,'' said Reddy. ''People say it was
an important step, but I think it will prove to be the defining
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation is a highly charged political issue in Australia,
with many Aborigines saying is not possible to achieve it until
conservative Prime Minister John Howard offers a formal apology for
past government injustices -- something he has refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   Some Aborigines claim the inclusion of strong indigenous themes
in the opening ceremony, which was watched by an international
television audience estimated at more than 3 billion, condemned
Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's original inhabitants, Aborigines number about
360,000 of a total population of 19 million people. After 212 years
of white settlement, Aborigines have a life expectancy 20 years
shorter than the rest of society and are the community's poorest,
least educated and most jailed people.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to Reddy in the post office lineup was retired
medical doctor Ado Pumpalov of Sofia, Bulgaria. He admitted to
never having heard of Freeman until he arrived in Australia for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''She showed everyone what it meant to be a winner, in every
sense of the word,'' said Pumpalov. ''I can see how she can be an
important step for improving race relations in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Pumpalov thinks Freeman's place in history could have been
achieved without her win.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say that in the Olympic Games, winning is not all that
important, it's being here that counts,'' said Pumpalov. ''I think
Cathy Freeman has been an inspiration to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Morning Herald's front-page headline agreed, saying
she was the ''Pride of the Land.'' The Australian newspaper called
her ''Catherine the Great'' on its front page.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the stadium erupted into cheers during the race
and for Freeman's lap of victory she held aloft two flags -- one
Australian, one Aboriginal. In the stands, dozens of the ochre red,
yellow and black Aboriginal flags were dotted among a sea of the
national ensign in red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's terrific,'' the prime minister said of
Freeman's decision to carry both flags. ''I've never had any qualms
about that. She's proud of her Aboriginality and she's proud of
being an Australian.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's race captured the interest of Australians like no
other event at the Sydney Games, even surpassing the gold medal
swims of Ian Thorpe and Susie O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   The Seven network said Tuesday that 8.787 million people saw her
race on home televisions, making it the most-watched competition
event of the games. Nearly 10.5 million viewers saw Freeman light
the flame during the opening ceremony, the most-watched program in
the history of Australian television.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, some of those viewers were blacks and whites in
the racially divided northern New South Wales town of Moree,
sitting together in several bars.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and whites have openly fought in the town in the past,
and race relations have traditionally been poor. Blacks have
complained of being evicted for no reason from some of the town's
bars, but that wasn't the case Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was absolutely packed in here and for about three minutes
before the race and until it finished everything stopped, including
the bartending,'' said Amaroo Tavern manager Ross Paddon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blacks and whites, everybody, were tickled pink by the win.
It's because she's Australian, that's why.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Men Survive Another Close Game  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Now that the end is near, maybe the
American men's basketball team will snap out of its collective
daze.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary round featured games against Lithuania and
France that were way too close for comfort, and the competition
only gets tougher the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever you compete there's always the chance that any team
can win,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ''I know we're the
favorite, but competition -- that's what it's all about. There's
going to be emotion, there's going to be a lot of factors in a lot
of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the Americans is a quarterfinal game Thursday
against Russia, which finished fourth in Group B behind Canada,
Yugoslavia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The semifinals are Friday and the gold medal game is Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the biggest surprise from the Americans has been their
inability to dominate the opposition the same way the 1992 and 1996
teams did.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary round games against China and New Zealand were
cakewalks, but Italy stayed close for 18 minutes, Lithuania had a
chance to pull within three points in the final minute and France
led for most of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's got to understand that everyone is going to be at
their best for the first 10-12 minutes against us,'' Tim Hardaway
said. ''But we have the superior depth that wears these teams
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said his team was doing two things wrong -- fouling
too much and being too unselfish.
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania shot 43 free throws in its nine-point loss, while
France shot 38 in its 12-point defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also have been hurt by their lack of size -- a
factor that was exacerbated by the absence of Alonzo Mourning in
their final two first-round games. Opponents have kept things close
by getting layups and tip-ins rather than trying to fire away from
3-point range as they tended to do in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Another important factor has been the lack of awe among the
opposition. As Gary Payton put it, no one is asking the Americans
for autographs anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team has been on the road together for almost five
weeks, and the weariness has shown. But with only a few days left
until they get to go home, the Americans should be rejuvenated
heading into their final three games.
</P>
<P>
   That should be bad news for Russia on Thursday, and then for
Yugoslavia or Lithuania on Saturday. If the Americans advance to
the gold medal game, the opponent will be Canada, Australia, Italy
or France.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be fun trying to get there,'' said Rowan Barrett
of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   America's northern neighbor pulled off the biggest shocker of
the tournament by defeating previously unbeaten Yugoslavia on
Monday night to finish first in Group B.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash had a spectacular all-around game with 26 points,
eight rebounds and eight assists for Canada, which came back from a
nine-point halftime deficit and won going away.
</P>
<P>
   So big was the victory that Canadians were comparing it
afterward to one of the greatest moments in that country's sports
history -- the 1972 Summit Series hockey victory over the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach (Jay Troiano) said this is one of those games you wait
your whole life for, so don't leave anything out there on the
floor,'' Barrett said. ''At halftime, he asked if we were quitters
and the answer was a resounding 'No'.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their slim margin of victory, the Americans will have
fond memories of the France game because of a spectacular dunk
pulled off by Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
   With France trying to move the ball upcourt and nine of the 10
players running the same way, Carter was headed the other way as he
intercepted a pass some 30 feet from the basket and bore down on
7-foot-2 center Frederic Weis with a full head of steam.
</P>
<P>
   He took off from a step or two inside the foul line, spread his
legs in mid-air and went right over Weis, scraping the top of the
tall Frenchman's buzzcut.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew he could jump, but I didn't know he could jump over
me,'' Weis said. ''Everybody will know my face now, or my number at
least. It's going to be on a poster for sure.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Riders Solid Third Midway  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARET FREEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- U.S. dressage riders sat securely in
third place midway through the Olympic team competition Tuesday,
with the Germans and Dutch out to their accustomed lead.
</P>
<P>
   The United States finished the day with 3,403 points, behind
Germany with 3,765 and the Netherlands with 3,661. Australia was
well back in fourth with 3,317.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dover of Flemington, N.J., was first up for the U.S. and
had a generally smooth ride on Ranier to score 1,678 points (67.12
percent), although the horse kicked out at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall, I started out our team with a nice score,'' said
Dover. ''The other U.S. horses are more experienced. It looks like
a real horse race for the bronze.''
</P>
<P>
   The team competition is also a qualifier for the individual
medals. The battle for individual gold developed as expected with
the return of Atlanta champion Isabell Worth of Germany on Gigolo
and silver medalist Anky van Grunsven of the Netherlands on
Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Both rode in pouring rain, while the showers stopped briefly for
the two U.S. riders. Bonfire was unusually tense and scored 75.0
percent. Gigolo showed both more spark and steadiness and was
rewarded with 76.32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Simons de Ridder of Germany was third on Chacomo with
74.28 percent. Susan Blinks of Wellington, Fla., was sixth
individually, with Dover in ninth out of the 25 riders on the first
day.
</P>
<P>
   Blinks saw her horse, Flim Flam, give a buck just before
entering the he entered the ring and then turned that energy into
brilliance, earning 1,725 points or 69.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was feeling great,'' Blinks said. ''I knew he would do
that. God bless him, he's never done that in the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Two riders from each team rode Tuesday, and the last two will go
Wednesday, with the top three scores to determine the medals. The
German, Dutch and American teams finished 1-2-3 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dressage involves performing classical horsemanship movements in
an enclosed arena, scored by five judges.

<HEADLINE> 5 State Department Officials Cited  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department doesn't take strong
enough action against diplomats who violate security regulations, a
senator charged following news that five department employees
temporarily lost security clearances for such breaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't say they fired anyone, did they?'' said Sen. Rod
Grams, R-Minn., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
''They don't take security violations very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright almost certainly
would be asked about the issue when she appeared before a hearing
of the committee Tuesday to assess foreign policy during the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Grams commented to The Associated Press after department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday that as of Jan. 1, officials
have suspended the security clearances of five employees for
violations of security policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another 27 employees had their security clearances suspended for
other reasons in the past 18 months to two years, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure followed announcement over the weekend that
Martin Indyk, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, was under FBI and
State Department investigation for suspected security violations.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk has lost his security clearance and no longer can
participate in Mideast diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's highly regarded for his contributions,'' Boucher said
Monday. ''Obviously, the fact that he doesn't have a security
clearance, and therefore is not able to participate in the
deliberations, makes things more difficult, because he has been an
important member of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said there was no indication of espionage and ''there
has been no indication that any intelligence information has been
compromised. This is a question of security procedures that have
not been followed.''
</P>
<P>
   He provided no details of the other cases. He said he did not
know which employees had been reinstated, but said he assumed some
had been.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Grams dropped a hold he had placed on the appointment
of seven career foreign service officers who had been nominated for
ambassadorships. They had accumulated about 100 security
violations.
</P>
<P>
   The violations reportedly included leaving safes open and
removing classified documents from embassies.
</P>
<P>
   The first American ambassador stripped of his security
clearances, Indyk was sidelined as U.S. mediation to break a
deadlock between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat entered another critical stage.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were due to resume talks
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk said in a statement this weekend: ''I regret that my
trying to do the best possible job under very difficult conditions
has led to the temporary suspension of my security clearances.
Jeopardizing the national security interests of the U.S. is
absolutely abhorrent to me, and I would never do anything to
compromise those interests.''

<HEADLINE> McKees End Olympics in Sailing Rush  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- If Jonathan and Charlie McKee are
indeed done with their Olympic sailing careers, they couldn't have
finished with a much better adrenaline rush or in a more
spectacular setting.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Seattle brothers would have preferred a gold medal to
the bronze, but the Finnish crew was too dominating in the speedy
new 49er class and Britain sailed steadily enough to get the
silver.
</P>
<P>
   The McKees, who have been sailing together off and on for 25
years, stood together to receive their bronze medals at the steps
of Sydney Opera House on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   They hugged and clasped hands in a celebration that was a little
tamer than earlier in the day, when they took their final thrill
ride of these Olympics aboard their speedy winged skiff. They
needed a big performance to clinch the medal, and they got it by
winning the 16th and final match race.
</P>
<P>
   Each had won an Olympic medal before. It was a much different
experience to receive medals together.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was so long ago I almost forgot the other one,'' said
Jonathan McKee, 40, the Flying Dutchman gold medalist in 1984.
''But it sure was exciting to be up there with Charlie.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie McKee, 38, was the bronze medalist in the 470 class in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first time, it's something special,'' Charlie McKee said.
''This was a lot harder, a lot longer road. Being able to do it
with my brother at the end of our career, that was really a dream
come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sailing officials expect to see the McKees back in the
Olympics. First, though, is the America's Cup in 2002-03 in New
Zealand. They'll sail for the team backed by billionaire Craig
McCaw.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday (Monday night EDT), racing started in rain and
shifting 12-knot winds. But it turned into the kind of day that
gives sailing a bad name as the wind died to about 3 knots on
Sydney Harbor and the Finn fleet creaked along to the finish of its
second race. There wasn't enough wind on the Laser course to get in
the day's second race.
</P>
<P>
   Finn skipper Russ Silvestri of Tiburon, Calif., played the
shifts right in the first race and finished second, but was 16th in
the next race to drop to sixth overall with five races to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything kind of went my way,'' Silvestri said. ''It seemed
easy. That was the problem. I thought it was going to be easy the
next race, too. I probably just got a little too cocky in between
races.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't pay as close attention to the shifts that race, which
left him well back in the 25-boat fleet.
</P>
<P>
   On the Pacific, four-time Olympian Mark Reynolds of San Diego
finished sixth and 10th and is seventh overall in the Star class
with five races to go in the 16-boat fleet. Reynolds is a former
gold and silver medalist.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have our best day,'' Reynolds said. ''We just
weren't in sync. A lot of people are up and down, and with five
races to go, guys up there can certainly have some bad ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtenay Becker Dey of The Dalles, Ore., the 1996 Europe bronze
medalist, was 15th overall with three races remaining. She finished
15th and sixth on Tuesday. Laser skipper John Myrdal of Kailua,
Hawaii, finished second in the seventh fleet race and is 17th
overall.
</P>
<P>
   The two U.S. 470 skippers, Paul Foerster of Rockwall, Texas, and
J.J. Isler of San Diego, are in position to join the McKees as
medalists.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster is second and Isler is third going into the deciding
470 races Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT). Foerster won the silver
medal in the discontinued Flying Dutchman in 1992 and Isler won the
470 bronze that year.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster sailed the Flying Dutchman in the 1988 and '92
Olympics, and was world champion in 1991 and '92. The FD was
replaced in the Olympic lineup after 1992, and Foerster sat out
1996 before taking up the 470, also a two-person boat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been three years of really, really hard work to get
enough ability to have a chance to win here,'' said Foerster, who's
crewman is Bob Merrick of Portsmouth, R.I. ''The FD is a harder
boat to sail, but the thing about the 470 is, when it's easier to
sail, that means you can have a lot more people that are good at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foerster is five points behind Tom King and Mark Turnbull, the
reigning world champions from Australia.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Over for Flagbearer Meidl  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENRITH, Australia (AP) -- Angel Perez says hi when he sees any
Cubans in the athlete's village or in the boathouse. He doesn't
take it personally if they don't respond.
</P>
<P>
   Perez understands what they're going through because eight years
ago he was one of them. Now, though, he's an American and on
Tuesday (Monday night EDT) he finally got to paddle a kayak in the
Olympics for his new country.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you believe in the place and the people around you, it's
different,'' Perez said after helping the U.S. K-4 team finish
third in a first-round heat, securing a spot in the finals. ''You
feel like you're representing something. I think that's what the
United States means -- everybody equal, everybody the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez defected to the United States in 1993 and became a citizen
last year. He didn't have his passport long enough to qualify for
the Olympics, but got in after convincing arbitrators that he gave
up his Cuban citizenship when he defected.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee was staunchly behind Perez's legal
fight, even recruiting the U.S. ambassador to Australia to help.
USOC chief executive Norm Blake and ambassador Edward W. Gnehm were
at the dock waiting to congratulate Perez following his race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pretty exciting for me,'' Perez said. ''I felt like I
had to do good because I had so many eyes watching me. After all
this situation, everyone was like, 'OK, what's Angel going to do
now?'''
</P>
<P>
   Perez sat in the back seat of a boat that also included Mooney,
Peter Newton and Stein Jorgensen. The seat assignment meant it was
he was expected to provide the last burst of speed on each stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. boat led the first quarter of its 1,000-meter race,
settled into third by the midway point and held off the Czech
Republic at the finish. The Americans' next race will be Saturday,
with medals on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used today to release stress,'' Perez said. ''Normally, you
use the first day to gain confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   All Cliff Meidl was hoping to do was make the semifinals of the
two-man kayak.
</P>
<P>
   But with a new partner, a new spot in the boat and many of the
medal favorites in his heat, Meidl wound up finishing last, ending
his Olympics after just one race.
</P>
<P>
   He's not too disappointed, though. After all, he did get to
carry the U.S. flag in the opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely want to be remembered by that,'' said Meidl, who
earned the honor in recognition of his amazing recovery from a
30,000-volt jolt that blew off several toes, cracked his skull and
burned his back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of all the things I went through in the past, getting
to this point was pretty tough. And carrying the flag for the U.S.
was like winning the gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Malloch didn't even plan on being in Sydney, so he wasn't
too upset by failing to advance in the men's 1,000-meter solo canoe
event.
</P>
<P>
   Malloch expected to be spending Tuesday attending the first day
of the fall quarter of business school at the University of
Washington. He was about to buy his books when the head of the U.S.
canoe-kayak federation called and told him to start packing for
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had been third on a waiting list for a canoe
spot and one finally opened. Malloch got the nod because he won the
U.S. Olympic trials earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal was to make the Olympics in 2000 and medal in 2004,''
said Malloch, 22. ''I hope to be competing strong internationally
long before then.''
</P>
<P>
   Six more events hold first-round heats Wednesday. The United
States is in five of them, including Perez and Peter Newton in the
500-meter K-2.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Mix Fun With Hoops  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- They've held koalas and fed kangaroos.
Nikki McCray cheered herself hoarse as Marion Jones and Maurice
Greene won gold. And they've all cruised under the Olympic rings
that adorn the Sydney Harbor bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's basketball team came to Sydney first and
foremost to win a gold medal, but they've still found time to act
like camera-toting, backpack-wearing tourists and have some fun.
</P>
<P>
   With a 5-0 record going into the medal round, they seem to have
found the right mix. After all, how much time can you spend
practicing and watching tape of your next opponent?
</P>
<P>
   This is the Olympics. This is Sydney. Go see it, said coach Nell
Fortner, who took her own advice and cheered on the U.S. softball
team one day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's got to be fun,'' Kara Wolters said. ''Nell's really into
the whole Olympic experience and not just the games, but the whole
experience and that's what we've been doing. We're very focused,
but at the same time she wants us to relax a little and be
tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolters and her teammates are doing just that. Packing cameras
and camcorders, several headed for a wildlife park where they saw
wallabies, had kangaroos eat out of their hands and cuddled koala
bears.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very touristy thing,'' Wolters said. ''But before I
left, everybody said, 'Oh, you're going to Australia. You're going
to see koala bears.' So that was really neat to do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the men's team joined the women on a Sydney
Harbor cruise hosted by the NBA. No, Vince Carter did not jump over
the bridge, but after his soaring, split-legged dunk against France
hours earlier, he might have felt like trying.
</P>
<P>
   Several players were in the stadium the night Jones and Greene
won their 100-meter races. McCray, who used to run track, was still
hoarse Tuesday from all her cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sprinting is fun,'' said McCray, who ran the 100, 200 and 400,
long jumped and threw the shot in high school. ''I was telling my
teammates, 'Man, I could be in the same position as Marion Jones
right now if I had just stuck with track.' I wanted to be the next
Flo Jo. She was my big idol. Now I can only sit back and watch.''
</P>
<P>
   And cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I was the only USA person rooting. I mean, my voice is
completely gone,'' McCray said. ''Track was my first love. But God
said something otherwise. He wanted me to play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been a bad calling. McCray played on a Final Four
team at Tennessee, starts for the WNBA's Washington Mystics and
already has one Olympic medal -- a gold from the 1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Staley joined McCray at the track and immediately turned
into a fan, taking her camera down to the athletes' tunnel so she
could snap a picture of Jones coming out. They had met before and
when Jones emerged, Staley waved.
</P>
<P>
   ''She kind of looked at me and waved back. That kind of made my
night,'' Staley said. ''She's a media darling. She's so innocent,
so humble. You only want the best for those type of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the true highlight for Staley was boxing. A longtime fan of
the sport, Staley often hosts parties for her brother and his
friends when a big fight is on television.
</P>
<P>
   Given a chance to watch the Olympic version, she jumped at it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boxing is incredible,'' she said, ''because I see they're
throwing with all their might in every punch. I see them more than
fighting for gold, but fighting for pride, fighting for their
neighborhood, fighting to get out of the position they're in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a beautiful thing to see, yet it's brutal. But I see what
plays into that. Winning the gold medal is important, but I also
see what kind of boxer I would be. I would hate to go back home
losing because I would have felt I let people down. I see that when
they're fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Williams joined Wolters at the wildlife park, battled
the mobs buying merchandise at the Olympic Superstore and is
spending as much time as possible with her family.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother and father are in town, some aunts made the trip and
so did a friend. All are staying in the team's hotel in Parramatta,
a western suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like we own the sixth floor,'' Williams said. ''It's not
really like we're in a foreign country because everyone we know is
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Their trip will be complete if they get to see Williams wearing
a gold medal. The next step comes Wednesday, when the United States
plays Slovakia in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that it's the medal round, it's really starting to hit
that this is the Olympics,'' Wolters said. ''It's really going to
hit when we have that gold medal around our necks. That's what
we're shooting for.''

<HEADLINE> Tony Blair To Rally Labor Party  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIGHTON, England (AP) -- The government has offered more money
to pensioners and no immediate tax cuts to fuel protesters. Now
Prime Minister Tony Blair has to give his battered Labor Party
activists some hope.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's speech Tuesday will be the high point of the party's
annual conference, which comes at a nadir in Labor's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Buffeted by fuel protests and complaints about miserly pensions,
Blair's personal popularity has plummeted and his party suddenly
trails the opposition Conservatives for the first time since the
1997 election.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's aides said he will speak of a government making ''hard
choices,'' choices which don't always win votes, while stressing
the current strength of the British economy.
</P>
<P>
   That's a continuation of the hard line Blair took earlier this
month when a loose coalition of truckers and farmers blocked
refineries and fuel depots, and closed down nearly all of Britain's
gas stations within days.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to offer any concessions to what he regarded as
illegal protests, and Treasury chief Gordon Brown reaffirmed that
policy Monday: the government would listen, but it won't move at
least until the annual budget is published next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''This national debate is too important to ever be decided by
those who shout the loudest or push the hardest,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The government apparently is content to let the Conservatives,
who hold their annual conference next week, remain alone in
offering a fuel tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Brown promised more cash for pensioners but rejected their
demand for the restoration of a link between the level of pensions
and average earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Increases targeted on lower-income people would provide ''more
cash that either an inflation rise or an earnings link would
provide,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised a hike in the minimum wage, but did not give a
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Party leaders have struck a contrite tone this week,
admitting that the public is angry about fuel prices, confessing
that the costly Millennium Dome in London failed to draw the public
and promising repeatedly that the government will listen to
people's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A National Opinion Poll survey released Saturday showed the
Conservatives had pulled ahead, with 40 percent support to Labor's
32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fourths of the sample said that Blair appeared ''out of
touch'' in handling the fuel crisis, 62 percent described him as
arrogant, 47 percent said he was incompetent and 43 percent said he
was weak.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll published Monday in The Daily Telegraph said 37
percent of the sample believed things had gotten worse under Labor,
compared to 16 percent who felt that way a year ago; 77 percent
thought Blair handled the fuel crisis badly.
</P>
<P>
   Each survey had a margin of error of about three percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Giving Kennewick Man to Tribes  </HEADLINE>
By AVIVA L. BRANDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Kennewick Man, one of the oldest and most
complete human skeletons ever found in North America, is one step
closer to returning to the earth -- and one step farther from the
lab.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department decided Monday that the remains should
be given to five American Indian tribes for reburial, disappointing
scientists who had hoped to continue studying the bones.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew in our heart that this one is an ancestor, but we are
saddened that it took the federal government so long to make this
determination,'' said Armand Minthorn of the Confederated Tribes of
the Umatilla Indian Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was the reverse of the one following a similar
debate over the fate of Spirit Cave Man, skeletal remains
discovered 60 years ago in Spirit Cave in western Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Spirit Cave Man and Kennewick Man have been the subject of
battles between scientists who want to study them and the American
Indian tribes who claim them as ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   In the Spirit Cave Man case, the Bureau of Land Management
decided the ancient mummy, tightly wrapped in tulle mats and a fur
robe, was not affiliated with any contemporary tribe or group.
</P>
<P>
   But Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the 9,000-year-old
bones of Kennewick Man were ''culturally affiliated'' with the five
tribes because the bones were found in the Columbia River shallows
near the tribes' aboriginal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why they did it, I don't know,'' said Paula Barran, co-counsel
for eight scientists who have sued for the right to study the
bones. ''It's so astonishing, particularly given the government's
decision in the case of the Spirit Cave mummy, which was about the
same age, and they concluded it could never be culturally
affiliated even though they had textiles in that case and this is
just bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank McManaman, Interior chief archaeologist, said it was that
lack of artifacts that made it impossible to dispute the tribes'
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Found in 1996, the 380 bones and skeletal fragments of Kennewick
Man were determined to be between 9,320 and 9,510 years old. Pieces
of the skeleton were sent to three laboratories, but none was able
to extract DNA for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The bones were found on federal land managed by the county
government in Kennewick, Wash., and the Interior Department agreed
to determine what should happen to them under the Native American
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Professors who studied the bones for the Interior Department
have said Kennewick Man appears to be most strongly connected to
the peoples of Polynesia and southern Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The find helped force researchers to consider the possibility
that the continent's earliest arrivals came not by a land bridge
between Russia and Alaska -- a long-held theory -- but by boat or
some other route.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers was prepared to turn the bones over
to five tribes for immediate reburial when the scientists filed
their lawsuit. The tribes said study of Kennewick Man would violate
their religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes -- on reservations in Washington, Oregon and Idaho --
are the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, the
Colville Confederated Tribes, the Wanapum Band, the Yakama Nation
and the Nez Perce Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said Monday he was persuaded by the geographic data and
oral histories of the tribes that claim Kennewick Man as an
ancestor, although, he said, ''ambiguities in the data made this a
close call.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the fate of the bones may be decided in court.
</P>
<P>
   Eight anthropologists, including one from the Smithsonian
Institution, have filed suit in federal court in Portland for the
right to study the bones. The remains are being kept at the Burke
Museum of Natural and Cultural History in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was put on hold pending the Interior Department
research. Now that Babbitt has issued his determination, the
scientists say they will ask the judge to let the lawsuit go
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every decision they have made in the four years since the
litigation was filed has been consistent with having a closed mind
from the start,'' Barran said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Early Treatment Can Limit MS  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the drugs used to control multiple sclerosis also sharply
slows the rate at which people develop the crippling nerve disease,
according to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, from an international study halted early because
the results were so strong, could help thousands of patients who
currently don't get treatment until they have substantial brain or
nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very important finding because it really shows if one
starts treatment early on, one can change the fate of a patient,''
delaying or even preventing the onset of the disease, said Dr.
Thomas Leist, director of the Comprehensive Multiple Sclerosis
Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It opens up a new perspective about treatment of multiple
sclerosis,'' said Leist, who was not involved in the study, which
will be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, people who suffer inflammation of nerves in the eye,
spinal cord or lower brain -- indications that MS might be
developing -- have not been diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder,
let alone treated. The diagnosis only follows a second flare-up
elsewhere in the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   However, researchers at the State University of New York School
of Medicine at Buffalo and about 50 other U.S. and Canadian sites
concluded that giving patients a drug called interferon beta-1a
within weeks of the first nerve inflammation cut the likelihood of
developing MS symptoms within three years by 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-third of patients who gave themselves weekly thigh
injections of the drug developed MS within three years, compared
with half the patients who injected a harmless substance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Reingold, vice president for research programs at
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said the findings will
push doctors to promptly order magnetic resonance imaging in
patients with an initial nerve flare-up.
</P>
<P>
   If brain lesions -- scarring that indicates past inflammation --
are spotted during the MRI, Reingold said, ''it should encourage
treatment with this interferon.''
</P>
<P>
   In multiple sclerosis, the body's immune system goes awry and
attacks the nerves and brain, slowly stripping away the protective
''insulation'' coating nerve fibers. That damage builds up over
years to cause muscle weakness or paralysis, fatigue, dim or
blurred vision, memory loss and other problems with thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Some people merely suffer mild weakness for decades, while
others steadily worsen from repeated attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Along with giving patients steroids to reduce inflammation
during each attack, doctors have offered three drugs that reduce
the frequency and severity of attacks and slow the progression of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, interferon beta-1a, known by the brand name Avonex,
is a genetically engineered replica of a naturally occurring human
protein, said the lead researcher, Dr. Lawrence Jacobs, professor
of neurology at SUNY-Buffalo and head of neurology at Buffalo
General Hospital. It works by reducing inflammation and quieting
down the overactive immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Along with delaying the onset of MS, Avonex cut the number of
new or actively inflamed lesions detected by MRIs by more than
half, compared with patients in the comparison group. It also cut
the total volume of such lesions in the nervous system by 91
percent over the comparison patients, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   European researchers recently came up with a similar finding on
Avonex's effects when it is used early.
</P>
<P>
   The 383 people in the latest study had suffered an initial nerve
flare-up and had at least two brain lesions detected by an MRI,
Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Until MRIs recently enabled doctors to see inside live brains,
they would not begin treatment for MS until the second nerve
flare-up confirmed the diagnosis; in about half the patients,
something else, such as infection, caused the initial inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the meantime, half of them have lesions in the brain that
are smoldering and doing further damage,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   About 350,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, and one-fifth
of them are in this group with ''silent'' brain damage who could be
helped by aggressive treatment. Leist said its price tag of about
$10,000 annually could limit use.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that patients need to be followed for longer than
three years to determine how long they need the interferon
treatment and that other MS drugs should be studied to determine if
there are similar benefits when given earlier.

<HEADLINE> The Law &AMP; Order of Dick Wolf  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Say, Dick Wolf: How's it feel to be a television
magnate?
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I knew,'' he replies.
</P>
<P>
   False modesty? Prudent restraint? Either way, let's examine the
record:
</P>
<P>
   -- Wolf's ''Law &AMP; Order'' begins its 11th season Oct. 18 on NBC.
This celebrated cops-and-courtroom drama is not only the oldest
dramatic series on the air, but with its guaranteed renewal through
2004-05, will stand second only to ''Gunsmoke'' as the
longest-running non-news-or-sports series in TV history.
</P>
<P>
   -- Spinoff ''Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' returns for its
second season on Oct. 20, already blessed by NBC with a pickup
through 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
   -- ''Deadline,'' starring Oliver Platt as a crusading newspaper
columnist, premieres on NBC next Monday (Oct. 2).
</P>
<P>
   -- ''Arrest &AMP; Trial,'' Wolf's first venture into reality fare,
begins a weekday syndicated run next Monday (Oct. 2) on 170
stations. Hosted by Brian Dennehy, each half-hour examines a
criminal case through interviews, news footage and dramatic
re-creations.
</P>
<P>
   -- And a third series carrying the ''Law &AMP; Order'' imprint could
be in production as soon as January.
</P>
<P>
   ''That deal isn't closed-closed,'' Wolf says, ''but I would say
that there's a pretty good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, not bad at all for the 53-year-old
ad-man-turned-producer who, during the past decade, logged his
share of flops, including ''Gideon Oliver,'' ''Christine
Cromwell,'' ''Nasty Boys,'' ''Mann &AMP; Machine,'' ''Crime &AMP;
Punishment,'' ''The Wright Verdicts,'' ''Feds'' and ''D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, he had ''Law &AMP; Order,'' which premiered on Sept.
13, 1990. But for years, even this series struggled in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   '''Law &AMP; Order' can hardly be thought of as a commercial hit,''
Wolf told The Associated Press in 1994. ''It's a critical success
that people know about and think fondly of, but I'm still looking
for a show that's a commercial hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily for Wolf, that first hit was right under his nose. After
enjoying steady growth, ''Law &AMP; Order'' the last couple of seasons
has landed just outside the Top 10 in households.
</P>
<P>
   These days, not only is the ''Law &AMP; Order'' franchise a linchpin
of NBC's prime-time schedule, but also, according to a report in
the New York Post, it may even inspire a true-crime magazine from
Time Inc. (On this, Wolf isn't commenting.)
</P>
<P>
   ''Law &AMP; Order,'' says Wolf, ''kind of settled into the
consciousness.'' The Little Engine That Could became the Bullet
Train.
</P>
<P>
   And so has Wolf. Watch him move through the newsroom set of
''Deadline'' (actually, the Post's old newsroom), a big man with a
big voice and laugh who, not infrequently, wears the look of a cat
after lunching on canary.
</P>
<P>
   Between fielding calls on his cell phone, he watches the filming
approvingly and huddles with his stars between takes. He is
particularly proud of ''Deadline,'' a fresh dramatic take on
crimefighting that also captures the quirkiness of journalists and
of New Yorkers overall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the best first-year cast I've ever been associated with
or can remember,'' he declares a week or so later from Los Angeles,
en route from one meeting to another. Into his cell phone he lists
names that include Platt, Bebe Neuwirth, Lili Taylor, Tom Conti and
Hope Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the strongest element of 'Deadline' is the storytelling,''
he adds just before he loses contact in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the new series, ''Deadline'' won its 13-episode
deal not with an expensive pilot episode but with a thrifty
three-minute presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, scores of pilots are filmed for network
consideration. Just a handful win a series order. The rest -- to
quote an old joke -- are only good as raw material for guitar picks.
Wolf has been among the most vocal critics of this system,
describing it as ''broken.'' Now he's broken free.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not making pilots anymore,'' he says once phone contact
is restored. ''As far as we're concerned, the pilot process on
shows that I create for NBC is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way Wolf breaks ranks: In a youth-obsessed business, he
doesn't mind a graying staff.
</P>
<P>
   He took one conspicuous blow against ageism this season by
signing Arthur Penn as the new executive producer of ''Law &AMP;
Order.'' The director of the 1967 masterpiece ''Bonnie and Clyde''
turns 78 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's one of the great American filmmakers,'' Wolf explains in
a what's-the-big-deal? tone.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget the trend Wolf is bucking in his industry: Two
years ago, a writer for ''Felicity'' was outed as being not 19, as
she had claimed, but 32 -- an age she had feared put her over the
hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The essence of drama is a depth of experience in the human
condition,'' says Wolf, who pegs the average age of the ''Law &AMP;
Order'' writing staff at 46. ''It's pretty hard to write about
adult problems if you're 22.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining a pace that could age anyone, Wolf a day later will
be back in New York, where all his drama shows are filmed.
Meanwhile, the question persists: Shouldn't two coasts and four,
maybe five, TV series certify Wolf as a magnate?
</P>
<P>
   ''The question's a little premature,'' he insists. ''Ask me in
November or December if everything is happening the way I hope it
will.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in television ...
</P>
<P>
   FINALLY!: Two fall series (''Girlfriends'' and ''Grosse
Pointe'') have already jumped the gun. But the race of 28 other
series introductions begins Sunday with a preview of the
comedy-drama ''That's Life.'' Heather Paige Kent plays Lydia
DeLucca, a New Jersey gal who at 32 ditches the lug she was going
to marry, takes the money she saved for the wedding, and steers her
rusted-out sedan to a nearby university. Ellen Burstyn plays
Lydia's mom, Paul Sorvino is her tollbooth-attendant dad, Debi
Mazar is her hairstylist chum, and Kevin Dillon plays her little
brother. The preview airs Sunday at 8 p.m. Eastern, before ''That's
Life'' settles into its regular Saturday slot Oct. 7.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Said Discharged Over Vaccine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Another active duty pilot at Dover Air Force
Base has been discharged for disobeying an order to receive an
anthrax vaccination, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former 1st Lt. Jamie C. Martin, 27, said he was given three
shots at the base last year and refused the fourth in the six-shot
series in May after he got sick.
</P>
<P>
   Martin told the Delaware State News that he developed severe
headaches, dizziness, muscle aches and ringing in his ears. He said
the side effects continued for months, but doctors told him they
could find nothing wrong with him.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said his offer to resign was refused and he received an
honorable discharge, effective Sept. 1. He said he now flies for a
private charter service in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Base spokesman Maj. Frank Smolinsky confirmed Martin had been
discharged, but declined to discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The military plans to inoculate all 2.4 million of its employees
worldwide to protect them from the odorless, colorless biological
weapon. But dwindling supplies of the vaccine this summer forced
the Pentagon to scale back its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Former Maj. Sonnie G. Bates was ousted from the Dover base on
March 30 for refusing to submit to the vaccine program.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 to 300 service personnel have disobeyed the order.
Some have been prosecuted, and some reservists have quit instead of
taking the shots.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading Tuesday as
the market struggled to rally following an earnings warning from
Eastman Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average
fell 77.32 to 10.730.83.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were higher. The Nasdaq composite was up

</P>
<P>
   With third-quarter earnings reporting season less than two weeks
away, investors have been unloading stocks whose companies even
warn of lower-than-expected profits.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern continued after Dow component Kodak said its
profits will be hurt by rising material costs, among other factors.
The photographic products manufacturer fell $9.38 to $49.63, a

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Ky. Nursing Union Case  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed to use a Kentucky
case to clarify when nurses and other employees should be
considered supervisors and therefore exempt from union coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Tuesday it will hear the National Labor Relations
Board's argument that some employees are considered non-supervisors
even though they direct less-skilled employees' work.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky River Community Care of Hazard, Ky., operates the Caney
Creek Rehabilitation Center in Pippa Passes, a facility for
mentally ill people seeking to develop the skills they need to live
independently.
</P>
<P>
   The center's employees, including nurses and rehabilitation
workers, voted in 1997 to join the Kentucky State District Council
of Carpenters union. The center refused to bargain with the union,
saying the nurses were supervisors and should not be part of the
bargaining unit.
</P>
<P>
   The NLRB ordered the center to bargain with the union, including
the nurses. But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
the nurses were supervisors and therefore exempt from union
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses exercise independent judgment when they direct other
employees' work, fill staff shortages, and serve as the highest
ranking employees in the center during nighttime hours, the appeals
court said. It also said the NLRB had the burden of proving the
nurses were not supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on Monday, government lawyers representing
the NLRB said the burden should be on the center to prove the
nurses were supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Employees are not supervisors if they exercise ''ordinary
professional or technical judgment'' to direct others in performing
their work according to standards set by the employer, government
lawyers said. Congress sought to exclude from union coverage only
genuine management workers and not those with minor supervisory
duties, they added.
</P>
<P>
   The center's lawyers said the 6th Circuit court ruled correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The case is National Labor Relations Board v. Kentucky River
Community Care, 99-1815.

<HEADLINE> Court To Address Water-Use Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed to tackle an
important dispute over the scope of a federal law aimed at
curtailing government secrecy, wading into a water-use dispute from
Oregon and California.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Tuesday it will decide whether the federal
Department of Interior must release copies of documents it received
from several Indian tribes to non-Indians who compete with the
tribes for irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ordered release of the seven documents
under the Freedom of Information Act, but government lawyers say
one of the law's exemptions should apply.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Bureau of Reclamation administers the Klamath
Irrigation Project, which uses water from the Klamath River Basin
to irrigate over 200,000 acres in Klamath County, Ore., and two
counties in northern California.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is part of the Department of the Interior. Another
Interior agency, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, regularly
corresponded with various Indian tribes in the Klamath Basin -- the
Klamath, Hoopa Valley, Karuk and Yurok Tribes -- to consult about
their water rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a group of Klamath Project irrigators filed a series of
FOIA requests seeking access to all communications between the
Bureau of Indian Affairs and the tribes regarding water issues.
</P>
<P>
   The agency released some documents but refused to release seven
of them. At issue is whether those documents should be considered
''inter-agency or intra-agency'' communications that are exempt
from public release under the FOIA.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled that the government did not have to
surrender the documents, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed that ruling last August and ordered them released.
</P>
<P>
   Because the tribes had an interest in water-use rights,
communications between them and the government cannot be regarded
as intra-agency or inter-agency documents, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on Monday, Justice Department lawyers said
the 9th Circuit court's ruling ''threatens substantial disruption
of the trust relationship between the United States and Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal noted the huge amount of Indian land located within
the nine Western states that comprise the 9th Judicial Circuit --
Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon
and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   About 28 million of the 45.5 million acres of land the federal
government holds in trust for tribes and individual Indians are
located in the 9th Circuit, the justices were told.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government cannot fulfill its fiduciary duties
with respect to Indian trust resources without receiving candid,
unfiltered information and assessments from the tribes and
individual Indians who hold the beneficial interest in those
resources,'' the government's appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the group of water users seeking the seven documents
said the government appeal sought ''a whole new exemption to the
FOIA,'' and argued that ''any such expansion must be left to
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's appeal was supported in friend-of-the-court
briefs submitted on behalf of the National Congress of American
Indians and numerous tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The case is U.S. Department of Interior v. Klamath Water Users
Protective Association, 99-1871.

<HEADLINE> Freeh To Defend Government Lee Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI Director Louis Freeh was prepared to
defend the government's case against nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee,
but was willing to acknowledge that his agents went too far in
threatening Lee at one point with electrocution, according to an
administration official who has seen a draft of Freeh's planned
congressional testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh was ready to argue to Senate investigating committees
Tuesday that the government would have been able to prove its
charges against Lee had the case gone to trial, the official said.
Although these views were in a draft of Freeh's remarks, the
director had an opportunity to revise them up until they were
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh was among a number of top federal officials who were
expected to be grilled by senators who want to find out what led
the government to hold Lee in solitary confinement for nine months
on 59 charges, including downloading nuclear secrets onto computer
tapes, while he was employed at the national weapons laboratory in
Los Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if they had any justification for doing it,''
said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who planned to ask prosecutors why
Lee was ''manacled and kept in leg irons'' during his prison stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what the offense, you can't coerce or torture a
guilty plea out of someone,'' Specter said in advance of Tuesday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said they couldn't let Lee tell someone else
what he had done with the weapons secrets before he told the
government. They point out that he spent six hours a day, four days
a week in the courthouse with his lawyers preparing his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors ultimately dropped all but one charge in a plea
bargain, and Lee was released.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1999, just before Lee was fired from his job at
Los Alamos, two FBI agents were asked to conduct a confrontational
interview with the scientist in hopes of winning a confession from
him.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the agents told Lee falsely that he had failed a
polygraph test and urged him to confess by saying that the only two
spies who ever had refused to confess were Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg, who were put to death by electrocution. Lee was never
charged with spying.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said Freeh was prepared to say that the threat of
execution went too far and was a product of having to conduct the
interview with much less notice than normal.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, confrontational interviews are done after long
study of the case and preparation of psychological profiles by
bureau behavioral scientists of the interview target.
</P>
<P>
   But the official said that in this case the agents had to
prepare quickly because they didn't have much advance warning that
Lee was going to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts have ruled that law enforcement agents are
allowed to deceive suspects in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Lee walked free Sept. 13, sentenced to the time he had served
awaiting trial, after he agreed to tell the government what he did
with the tapes. His debriefing had been scheduled for Tuesday but
was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The plea bargain caused the presiding judge to apologize to Lee
for his pretrial imprisonment and lambast the government for
embarrassing ''our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he found it difficult to reconcile how
the government could ''keep someone in jail without bail, argue
right up to the 11th hour that they're a terrible risk, and then
turn around and make that sort of plea agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a U.S. citizen born in Taiwan and educated in the United
States, initially was an espionage suspect, the target of a federal
probe into how China may have obtained secret nuclear warhead
blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters contend Lee was targeted because he is
Asian-American. Some are demanding a presidential pardon and an
apology.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has refused to apologize to Lee but
ordered an internal review of Justice Department actions after
meeting with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The senator continues the questioning Wednesday in his Judiciary
subcommittee and said the questioning won't stop with the Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   Specter also planned to bring up questions about the case of
Taiwanese-American scientist Peter Lee, who reached a plea bargain
with the Justice Department and escaped prison time despite reports
that he passed advanced radar technology secrets to China.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tumbling in Morning Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today after an earnings
warning from Eastman Kodak intensified the market's worries about
third-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
114.87 to 10,726.76.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite was up 5.53
at 3,746.75 and the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index fell 2.23
to 1,436.80.
</P>
<P>
   Dow component Kodak warned of disappointing profits, saying its
business has been hurt by rising material costs and other factors.
The photographic products manufacturer fell $12.88 to $46.13, a 21
percent decline, in morning trading Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dow is down because we got a warnings announcement from
Eastman Kodak. In fact, that may be responsible for the whole move
in the Dow,'' said Bill Barker, an investment strategy consultant
at Dain Rauscher. ''These earnings preannouncements are continuing
to keep the market off balance, whether they're Kodak, Intel,
DuPont or whoever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors are very nervous and reluctant to put money to work
right away until we get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   With third-quarter earnings reporting season less than two weeks
away, the market has been unloading stocks whose companies even
warn of lower-than-expected profits. While Kodak has struggled in
recent years amid intense competition in the film industry, its
announcement Tuesday increased Wall Street's uneasiness about
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak also fell as its rating was cut to ''neutral'' from
''attractive'' by a Paine Webber analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Lexmark International tumbled $13.06 to $38.94, a 25 percent
drop, after the company warned of lower-than-expected third-quarter
earnings and analysts at Paine Webber and Bear Stearns downgraded
the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq struggled to stay in positive territory, helped
somewhat by limited bargain hunting. Cisco Systems climbed 38 cents
to $57.56 after ending Monday down, as did Sun Microsystems, up 50
cents to $118.50.
</P>
<P>
   Oil service providers were also higher. Halliburton was up 77
cents at $47.50; Exxon Mobil climbed 90 cents to $86.75. The price
of a barrel of sweet crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was
$31.58, a penny higher than Monday, after moving slightly higher
earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 332.97 million shares, ahead
of the 306.68 million in the previous session.
</P>

   The Russell 2000 index fell 0.91 to 514.47.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: Broken Hearts Club  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTY LEMIRE
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''The Broken Hearts Club'' has one good thing going for it: The
film is refreshing in its portrayal, for the most part, of gay men
as normal people with normal jobs, looking for love like everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to write a film about gay men that was more the way I
knew the gay world to be, which is very mainstream and regular,''
said writer-director Greg Berlanti, who is making his big-screen
directorial debut.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeds there. But his characters are so whiny and
self-absorbed, it's hard to care about any of them. And that
transcends sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Berlanti, co-executive producer of TV's ''Dawson's Creek,''
follows a group of friends living in West Hollywood who sit around
and talk about dating -- and not much else. Several of them work at
the same restaurant, where the owner (John Mahoney) is the coach of
their softball team.
</P>
<P>
   Howie (Matt McGrath) is the neurotic one. Patrick (Ben Weber) is
self-conscious about his looks. Cole (Dean Cain) is the gorgeous
actor they all want to be like.
</P>
<P>
   Their leader is Dennis (Timothy Olyphant), a photographer who
just turned 28 and wonders what he's doing with his life. He
realizes he's tired of meaningless sexual encounters and wants to
fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   There's a subplot involving Patrick's lesbian sister (Mary
McCormack) and her girlfriend (Nia Long). They want to have a baby
and they want Patrick as the sperm donor. This seems out of place,
and probably could have been its own movie.
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's few funny moments occurs when the gay softball
team plays a team of Hollywood firefighters. (One of the guys
comments, ''Not only are they better than us, they're a physical
distraction.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Berlanti ruins the scene with a montage of the gay softball
players dropping the ball in the outfield and striking out while
''Sing a Song'' plays in the background. This feels forced.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the dialogue does, too. The banter is just a bit too
quick and witty. The guys stand around at a party debating which
''Little House on the Prairie'' character was the hottest. (They
choose Albert, the one Charles Ingalls adopted who got hooked on
morphine.)
</P>
<P>
   Later, they argue over which ''60 Minutes'' correspondent -- Mike
Wallace or Morley Safer -- they would kick out of bed. This is
slightly amusing, but Berlanti is once again trying too hard to
inject pop culture references into the film.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most uncomfortable moments occur courtesy of Taylor
(Billy Porter), the only character who truly is a gay stereotype.
After learning that his boyfriend is in Hawaii with another man, he
falls apart, demanding to listen to Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler
or Judy Garland. (One of his friends finds the ''Beaches''
soundtrack, which assuages him temporarily.)
</P>
<P>
   Later, Taylor wallows on the couch all day watching Joan
Crawford movies. Does anyone like this truly exist?
</P>
<P>
   Berlanti's intentions are good. There are some solid themes of
friendship and loyalty. Too bad they're lodged between all the
sappiness and self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Broken Hearts Club,'' a Sony Pictures Classics release, is
rated R for language, drug use and some sexual content. Running
time: 95 minutes.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: Barenaked in America  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTY LEMIRE
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Priestley really wants you to like the Barenaked Ladies.
</P>
<P>
   The former ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' star portrays the Canadian
pop group so positively in his documentary ''Barenaked in America''
that if you haven't heard of them before, you'll be a fan by the
time the film is over. And if you're already a fan, you'll listen
to their catchy tunes with a different ear.
</P>
<P>
   Priestley, directing his first full-length film, follows the
band for two weeks of their 1998 U.S. tour, including stops in
Buffalo, N.Y.; Philadelphia; Boston; and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian native, Priestley seems to have a twofold purpose: He
really likes these guys as friends and musicians and wants everyone
else to enjoy them, too. And he hopes to enlighten Americans who
may have some misperceptions about Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Between backstage joking and onstage jamming, Priestley
sprinkles comments from music experts and the band members
themselves about how hard it is for Canadian artists to make it big
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Terry David Mulligan, labeled in an interview as a ''Canadian
music guru,'' goes so far as to say his countrymen's ears are
better attuned to quality music. Judging by the success of the
Barenaked Ladies south of the border, it would seem that Americans
share this superhuman quality. In 1998, the group's first No. 1
hit, the upbeat, free-flowing ''One Week,'' got constant airplay on
U.S. radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Barenaked in America,'' we meet the band members in
one-on-one interviews in which they describe each other.
Singer-guitarist Ed Robertson is the responsible one. Lead singer
Steven Page is unpredictable. Drummer Tyler Stewart is loud.
Bassist Jim Creeggan is dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   They also choose their favorite ''Sesame Street'' characters,
which seems a bit contrived, but is amusing. (Robertson likes
Ernie. Stewart prefers Oscar the Grouch.)
</P>
<P>
   The guys spend a lot of time in front of the camera discussing
how they got together and what inspires their often bizarre lyrics.
A sample: ''Watchin' 'X-Files' with no lights on/We're dans la
maison/I hope the Smoking Man's in this one.'' But we learn more
about the Barenaked Ladies just by watching them joke around.
</P>
<P>
   They have fun onstage and off, and you get the sense that's how
they really are; they're not being witty because a camera is
rolling. These are not moody, tortured artists. They are talented
performers in a happy pop band who don't take themselves too
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   One fan interviewed on the street says the group members ''look
like guys you'd see working at The GAP.''
</P>
<P>
   Also revealing is the way they handle the cancer diagnosis of
keyboardist Kevin Hearn. Just as the band starts to find success in
the United States, Hearn learns he has leukemia. They find a
temporary replacement for him in Chris Brown, but steadfastly
support Hearn and promise that his spot will be waiting for him.
When Hearn gets better, he makes an emotional return to play a few
songs at a Buffalo concert.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a great showcase for Page's vocal talent. He has a
textured, powerful voice, and his animated stage performance makes
him even more dynamic. He and Robertson, who grew up together in
Toronto, play beautifully off each other, often composing entire
songs spontaneously in the middle of concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barenaked in America'' also lets Priestley show he can direct.
He already proved he could act in 1997's ''Love and Death on Long
Island.'' Here, his timing and pacing prove he's more than just a
pretty face.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barenaked in America'' is part of the Shooting Gallery Film
Series. It is not rated but contains language, some nudity and
raunchy humor. Running time: 90 minutes.

to $57.50 after ending Monday down, as did Sun Microsystems, up
$1.25 cents to $119.25.
</P>
<P>
   Oil service providers were also higher. Halliburton was up $1.21
at $47.94; Exxon Mobil climbed $1.77 cents to $87.63. The price of
a barrel of sweet crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was
$31.58, a penny higher than Monday, after moving slightly higher
earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 482.63 million shares, ahead
of the 456.24 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 2.90 to 512.48.

<HEADLINE> VH1 'Behind the Music' Starts Anew  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rapper MC Hammer couldn't keep his eyes off
the television set in his dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   On the screen, a montage of video clips showed many of the music
industry's biggest names, the legendary and the infamous, telling
their stories on VH1's ''Behind the Music.'' There were bits about
their rise to fame, their fall from glory and, for some, their
resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer was among them -- one of the first, more than three years
ago, to tell about his rocket ride to fame and his subsequent
bankruptcy, after losing more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to say I was blown away when I first saw it,'' he said
at a recent taping for the show's anniversary special. ''I kept
thinking, 'That's my life. I'm not watching TV, I'm watching me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since those first episodes, nearly everyone in the music
industry has been lining up for a shot on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Behind the Music'' begins a new season Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT
with the story of 1970s singer Cat Stevens, now Yusuf Islam, who
renounced popular music after having a religious epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of those willing to tell the good, the bad
and the ugly on the show, says Jeff Gaspin, the VH1 executive who
masterminded the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not planning on doing a biography series,'' he said.
''It began as an idea to find out whatever happened to so-and-so.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of his list was Milli Vanilli, the Grammy-winning duo
who turned the music industry upside down with the discovery that
they were lip-syncing songs performed by somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   A ''Behind the Music'' formula quickly developed: detail the
performer's beginnings, the rise to fame, the glory moments, the
fall and, finally, redemption and resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   VH1 doesn't do unauthorized ''Behind the Music'' episodes. The
artists must agree to tell all and allow use of their music.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the episode featuring heavy metal band Poison
revisited the group's meager beginnings, in a roach-infested studio
space where they depended on handouts from girls (read: drugs,
liquor and sex).
</P>
<P>
   It then followed their rise to fame and the excesses that
followed (read: more drugs, liquor and sex). The band then fired
its guitarist, and fell off the charts and into oblivion until last
year, when it launched a comeback tour.
</P>
<P>
   The episode ''gave the tour more legs,'' said Poison's Rikki
Rockett. ''What it did was let a lot of fans know where to find
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance also aided members' solo projects. A snippet of a
single from guitarist CC Deville's new band, Samantha 7, helped
land that group a record deal.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, appearances on ''Behind the Music'' have helped many
groups with slumping record sales.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Springfield, who rode to fame in the 1980s with his No. 1
hit ''Jessie's Girl,'' said his initial episode and the reruns
helped his latest release, ''Karma.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time the episode airs, we see a spike in sales,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with using the show to get their side of a story out, many
artists say that without its ''where are they now'' angle, it
wouldn't be worth doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't want it to be just a nostalgia thing,'' Springfield
said. ''I'm still performing, I'm still writing, I'm still
recording. I haven't disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every story has a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Pilatus, half of the Milli Vanilli duo, died of a drug and
alcohol overdose shortly after his interviews with ''Behind the
Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The story needed to be told. It wasn't all the story. But it
was more than anybody had ever done about it,'' said Fabrice
Morvan, the duo's other half. ''I saw it the first time. I haven't
been able to watch it since. It's painful. When I watch it, I see
this young man with his whole life ahead of him, and now he's
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   It also generated a lot of sympathy from unlikely sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''What that showed was the side of business that's so ugly,''
said Hammer. ''It was excellent journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Excellent? Well, entertaining, at least.

<HEADLINE> Court To Consider Heat Warrant Need  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to use the
case of a man convicted of growing marijuana to decide whether
police need a search warrant to use a device to detect heat coming
from someone's home.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear an Oregon man's argument that the
use of a heat-detecting device without a search warrant violated
the Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Lee Kyllo was arrested in January 1992 and charged with
growing marijuana at his home in Florence, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they used a thermal imaging device and detected an
unusual amount of heat coming from the roof over the garage and
from one wall. Officers then got a warrant and searched his home,
finding marijuana plants, growing equipment and dried marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Kyllo contended the marijuana plants should not be used as
evidence against him, saying the police could not use the
heat-detecting device without a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled against him, and Kyllo pleaded guilty on
condition he could appeal the search issue. He was sentenced to one
month in jail.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial ruling in his favor, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals upheld the use of the device, saying it did not amount
to a search.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal granted review Tuesday, Kyllo's lawyer said the
case ''raises the fundamental question of whether the Fourth
Amendment's guarantee of personal security in one's home must yield
to scientific advances that render our traditional barriers of
privacy obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said use of the device did not
intrude on any reasonable expectation of privacy. Kyllo did not try
to conceal the heat emissions, they said, and the device sent no
intrusive rays into his home but ''passively detected and recorded
heat that escaped from the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Kyllo v. U.S., 99-8508.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Oil Tap Is Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Republican senators accused the Clinton
administration Tuesday of tapping the emergency petroleum reserve
to help Al Gore's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency oil ''is for a severe shortage and not to help a
candidate seven weeks before the election,'' Sen. Don Nickles,
R-0kla., said at a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who has said that politics
played no role in Friday's decision to tap 30 million barrels of
oil from the government reserve, said the administration remains
committed ''to let the market dictate prices.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
was directed at cushioning against a sudden supply shortfall this
winter
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the government oil will ease a current 40
percent shortfall in heating oil inventories in the eastern part of
the country and ''make sure American families keep warm this
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The temporary infusion of the oil, beginning in November, is
expected to put 4 to 5 million additional barrels of heating oil
into the market, said Richardson. He disputed contentions by some
senators that refineries, now operating at near peak capacity,
wouldn't be able to handle the oil.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million barrels of heating oil are used daily during the
winter with two-thirds of it used in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
states, according to the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he planned to meet with refinery representatives
to discuss ways for refineries continue operating at high
production rates as winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, was skeptical. He
maintained that tapping the government reserve ''will do little for
consumers who face staggering heating cost increases this winter.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're facing an energy crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D, characterized the attack on the
administration as ''partisan elbow throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither political party has distinguished itself on energy
policy'' over the years, said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Energy Department said average crude oil and
heating oil inventories remain well below normal and ''are expected
to be below normal throughout the winter and into 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   But the department's Energy Information Administration predicted
that inventories would begin returning to normal levels by next
year. ''This recovery (will be) a slow process,'' said Mark Mazur,
acting EIA administrator, in remarks prepared for the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the EIA predicted heating costs will be
substantially higher this winter than last.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming a moderate winter, the agency estimated that a consumer
using 680 gallons of heating oil during this winter is expected to
pay $900 for fuel, about $140 more than last heating season.
</P>
<P>
   An average household in the Midwest -- where natural gas is
widely used for heating -- paid $511 last heating season, but is
expected to pay $734 this coming winter, a 44 percent increase,
according to the EIA forecast.
</P>
<P>
   In other testimony, John Felmy of the American Petroleum
Institute said refineries are working at full capacity to build
heating oil stocks. He disputed some of the dire predictions of
expected fuel shortages this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time remains for these inventories to build before the
beginning of the heating season,'' said Felmy, whose group
represents the major oil companies.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Touts Military Gains  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban declared
Tuesday that recent military gains have put 95 percent of the
country under their control, and reiterated that it was time the
movement received Afghanistan's U.N. seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Taliban have freed regions one by one,'' Mullah Abdul
Salam Zaeef, the Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan, told a news
conference. ''The opposition is psychologically weak and has lost
its morale.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have captured a series of northeastern towns and
villages over the past month, and have advanced to the border with
Tajikistan in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   The battlefield successes are bringing greater stability to
war-ravaged Afghanistan, the Taliban say, adding that the Islamic
militia deserved international recognition as the country's
government.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia, one of the Taliban's leading critics, fears the
recent fighting could spread Islamic fundamentalism, unleash a
refugee crisis and lead to general disorder in parts of Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, another leading opponent of the Taliban, says
the group should not receive recognition until it improves its
human rights record, removes restrictions against women and hands
over suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says bin Laden was behind the bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1988 that killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
   In Kabul, Afghanistan's Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil
again called on the United States to supply evidence linking bin
Laden to terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries have called for peace talks in Afghanistan,
but the Taliban appeared intent on pressing their offensive against
the opposition, which holds a shrinking enclave in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the near future the remaining part of the country under
opposition rule will be freed by the (Taliban) army,'' Zaeef said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Taliban have controlled most of Afghanistan for the
past four years, including the capital Kabul, only three countries
formally recognize the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Zaeef said: ''Afghanistan has the full qualification to be
recognized by the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The ousted government, led by former President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, still holds the seat, though he and most of his colleagues
are in exile, mostly in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, a Russian envoy arrived Tuesday for
talks on Afghanistan with senior leaders in Pakistan, the Taliban's
main backer.
</P>
<P>
   The envoy, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, delivered a letter from Russian
President Vladimir Putin, but details of the talks were not made
public.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, meanwhile, accused Russia of supporting the Afghan
opposition, and said they have not forgiven Moscow for its 1979
invasion, which ignited the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moscow is the source of all these miseries for the people of
Afghanistan,'' Zaeef said. ''It is our policy not to be friendly
toward Moscow, but we will not do anything against it.''

<HEADLINE> S.C. Death Row Case To Be Heard  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide
whether some convicted killers facing the death penalty in South
Carolina still have the right to tell jurors there is no chance
they could be paroled if sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said they will review a ruling by the state's
highest court that such instructions no longer are needed when
South Carolina murderers are sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 decision, the nation's highest court struck down a
South Carolina law that barred jurors, many of whom might think a
''life sentence'' does not really mean a lifetime behind bars, from
learning that parole was impossible for some defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Not allowing such instructions violate defendants' due-process
rights, the justices ruled back then.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature amended the capital sentencing law in 1995
to include three options for juries: Impose death, life in prison
without possibility of parole or -- if finding no aggravating
factors -- a minimum prison sentence of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in the case of Wesley Shafer Jr. earlier this year, the
South Carolina Supreme Court said last May that the new sentencing
scheme makes the 1994 ruling no longer applicable.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer was convicted of killing Ray Broome while trying to rob a
convenience store in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for more than three hours, the sentencing
jury asked the presiding judge whether there was ''any remote
chance'' that Shafer might be eligible for parole. The judge told
the jurors that ''parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for
your consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier the judge had told the jury: ''In deciding whether to
sentence the defendant to death or life imprisonment, I remind you
that death means just what it says, death. Life imprionsment means
incarceration of the defendant until his death.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Shafer v. South Carolina, 00-5250.

<HEADLINE> Structure of Dresden Church Rebuilt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) -- More than 55 years after it was
destroyed by Allied bombs, workers have rebuilt the main structure
of Dresden's landmark Frauenkirche church, opening the way for
religious services to resume.
</P>
<P>
   A series of services and concerts, including a rendition in
English of Handel's ''Messiah,'' are planned for December, Bernhard
Walter, chairman of the foundation overseeing the rebuilding of the
church, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Religious services have so far only been held in the crypt,
which was reopened four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Work to rebuild the Baroque church began in 1994 as part of
efforts to restore the city to its prewar splendor. The communist
rulers of former East Germany had left the church in ruins as a
reminder of the evils of war.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, many of whom have made donations toward the cost of
the repairs, have for years marked the anniversary of the 1945 raid
with candlelight vigils.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the cost of the $110 million project has been
raised from 600,000 private donors worldwide. The foundation still
needs $29 million to fund the project, Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   After December, the main body of the Protestant church will be
closed to visitors again until 2005 while its inner and outer domes
are rebuilt. The project is to be completed in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Britain's Duke of Kent marked the anniversary of
the Anglo-American raid on Dresden that killed about 35,000 people
by giving the city a replica of a gilded orb and cross that once
sat atop the church's dome.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Seniors Now Have a Choice  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three years after Congress expanded health
care options for seniors, the over-65 crowd is just now getting
access to a private fee-for-service plan.
</P>
<P>
   Congress mandated such plans as part of the Balanced Budget Act
of 1997, figuring Medicare competition would reduce costs and
increase benefit choices.
</P>
<P>
   But so far Sterling Life Insurance Co. of Bellingham, Wash., is
the only company offering seniors a private fee-for-service option.
The company started the plan in July and now it is available in all
or parts of 25 states.
</P>
<P>
   Other insurers have been reluctant to step in because they think
government reimbursements are too low. And there also is concern
about whether seniors, who generally like Medicare, will switch to
a privately run plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are incredibly comfortable with the traditional
Medicare program,'' said Joyce Dubow, senior policy adviser at
AARP's Public Policy Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dubow said AARP is not supporting private fee-for-service plans
now but is trying to get information on Sterling to seniors so they
can decide if it is right for them.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Baker, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center, a
New York-based watchdog group, said he's wary of private insurers
competing with Medicare. He suggests people wait and see how
Sterling performs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They might do a wonderful job at that,'' Baker said. ''We just
don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly
and disabled, allows beneficiaries to see any doctor who accepts
Medicare patients. The government then reimburses doctors for
services.
</P>
<P>
   With Sterling, the government pays the company a flat monthly
fee to cover enrollees, who then may see a doctor of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Rosen, senior vice president for policy at the Health
Insurance Association of America, said insurers have balked at
entering the market because they aren't sure it's profitable.
</P>
<P>
   He said the companies point to the experience of Medicare HMOs,
which have been serving seniors since the mid-1980s. Lately, the
HMOs have complained that low reimbursement rates and rising costs
are forcing them to leave the market or scale back benefits.
</P>
<P>
   About 6.2 million seniors -- 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries
-- are in the HMOs. Nearly 1 million are expected to lose their
coverage Jan. 1 because of HMO pullouts. The government expects all
but 160,000 of them to have access to another HMO. The others will
be able to get benefits through traditional Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Moon, a health economist at the Urban Institute, a
Washington-based think tank, said the Balanced Budget Act that
opened Medicare to competition also kept some insurers from
entering the market by slowing the annual growth of Medicare
reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it probably didn't help competition,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year boosted reimbursements in rural areas where
choices are limited to encourage private insurers to enter those
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's strategy is to capture those bonus payments and stay
out of highly competitive markets, said Debbie Ahl, chief operating
officer for Olympic Health Management Service, the administrative
arm of Sterling. Olympic and Sterling are subsidiaries of
Chicago-based Aon Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Patients in traditional Medicare pay a monthly fee of $45.50 and
must pay 20 percent of allowed doctor charges. Many seniors who use
traditional Medicare buy supplemental polices to enhance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling offers lower co-payments for hospital stays and a nurse
advice line. But participants pay a $55 monthly premium and a $10
co-payment for doctor visits on top of the monthly fee of $45.50.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sterling's $55 premium is about half of what customers
would pay for a supplementary policy with similar benefits,
according to government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Like traditional Medicare, Sterling's plan does not include
prescription drug coverage. The benefit is the top draw of many
Medicare HMOs, but also is among their biggest headaches because of
exploding drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   Senior advocates say offering a drug benefit would make Sterling
more popular. The plan had only about 100 enrollees on Sept. 1,
though company officials expect more when they start a marketing
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering paying for a drug benefit for seniors,
and Ahl said Sterling is waiting to see what happens before taking
action on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The Sterling plan is available in Alaska, Arizona, Delaware,
Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico,
Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Washington. It also is available in
selected counties in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Texas
and West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Bossa Nova Pioneer Baden Powell Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Composer and musician Baden
Powell, a pioneer of bossa nova who was more popular abroad than at
home, died Tuesday. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was hospitalized Aug. 22 at Sorocaba Clinic in Rio de
Janeiro, his publicist Alexandre Raine said. His kidneys began to
fail and he developed a general infection, relying on a respirator
to breathe. He died of pneumonia and multiple organ failure, Raine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell is regarded as a key figure in the history of bossa nova,
Brazil's jazzy samba music that gained worldwide popularity in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, he moved with his family from the rural interior to
Rio, where his music teacher introduced him to the legendary
musician and composer Pixinguinha. Powell later worked with other
top names in Brazilian music, including Antonio Carlos Jobim and
Vinicius de Moraes.
</P>
<P>
   With his trademark turtleneck and acoustic guitar, Powell
attracted a following in Europe and lived for years in Germany. In
Brazil, bossa nova's popularity soon waned and Baden Powell
remained little known.
</P>
<P>
   ''That shows how subjugated we are to American music,'' said
popular singer Leila Pinheiro, who often performs Powell's works.
''Baden Powell was a genius of the guitar and Brazilian music ...
he symbolized an era.''
</P>
<P>
   Baden Powell is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were not made public.

<HEADLINE> Vodka Dispute Shows Russia Chaos  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Heading the Kristall vodka distillery should be a
businessman's dream -- the chance to manage one of Russia's most
prestigious enterprises, with a world-renowned array of products, a
diligent work force and awards from the government. But it's closer
to a waking nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   For seven weeks, Kristall has been split between two men, each
claiming to be the manager. One runs the executive offices, the
other runs the production floor, and both are backed by squads of
guards.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff highlights the perils of doing business in Russia,
where the legal system is often ineffectual. How the dispute is
resolved could indicate whether President Vladimir Putin's
government can improve the business climate by upholding the law
and public accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Kristall is among the most famous of Russia's approximately 180
vodka distilleries, producing the Western hit Stolichnaya as well
as home-country favorites such as Gzhelka. The plant's red-brick
complex on a leafy Moscow side street looks like a 19th century
fortress. The resemblance was especially strong on Aug. 4, when
gun-toting men arrived in waves.
</P>
<P>
   First came masked tax police, who seized documents as part of a
tax-evasion investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Alexander Romanov and his private guards showed up
and moved into the building's executive offices. Romanov said he
was staking his claim to the post of general director, to which the
board had elected him in May.
</P>
<P>
   Before the day was over, Vladimir Svirsky and another group of
guards moved into the production facilities. Svirsky, who had been
Kristall's acting director since April, pointed out that a Moscow
court had voided Romanov's election.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sept. 1, the same court reversed itself. Svirsky said an
appeal has been filed.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is further complicated by allegations of deceptive
stock trading. Romanov says that about 20 percent of company stock
that once belonged to the factory workers' collective has gone
offshore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I admit that 19 percent of the stock belongs to an offshore
company in Cyprus,'' Svirsky said. ''But this is a friendly
company, and the stocks never vanished: they are working for the
collective.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanov spent the first couple of weeks of the standoff living
in the executive offices, saying he was afraid to leave because ''I
see many men with guns out there.'' But recently, he has had to go
out occasionally on business duties because the office phone lines
have been cut.
</P>
<P>
   Vodka is a cornerstone of Russian life, despite attempts by a
succession of leaders right up to Mikhail Gorbachev to curb
drinking. And Kristall has done its part in slaking Russians'
thirst. Despite the tensions, it met its usual monthly production
level of over 2 million gallons, said Kiril Peskov, a Romanov
deputy.
</P>
<P>
   The guards, meanwhile, seem relaxed and amused.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never saw such a situation as this,'' said one guard,
laughing and glancing at his rivals a few yards down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, however, has seen many such disputes over lucrative
firms. Workers seized a paper mill last year to protest foreign
ownership of the plant, and troops shot one worker when they raided
the plant to end the occupation. This month, rival factions brawled
for control of a chemical plant in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kristall dispute is in a class of its own because the
state owns 51 percent of its shares. It is also notable because the
government had lauded Kristall's previous management, naming the
plant Russia's Outstanding Taxpayer of 1999 ($89 million on profits
of $142 million, according to Svirsky).
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the Kristall case sends a discouraging message to
foreign investors who have been otherwise heartened by the Russian
economy's recent tentative expansion after years of decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're watching it closely. What happens to a Russian company
can just as easily happen to a foreign one,'' said Scott Blacklin,
head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, he said, it seems to demonstrate a pattern that
has plagued Russia under czarism, communism, and nascent democracy:
''The power elite has never been a friend of the entrepreneur.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Z. Blake Marshall of the Washington-based U.S.-Russia
Business Council said the attention-grabbing dispute could be seen
as ''a step forward'' if it is resolved in court.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Pressured To Step Down  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a runoff election was being announced in
Belgrade, President Clinton said Tuesday that it's clear the
opposition party has defeated Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and that if the will of the Serbian people is respected, the United
States will lift economic sanctions against the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the government's attempts to manipulate the vote, it
does seem clear that the people have voted for change,'' Clinton
said. ''The question is, will the government listen in response?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks in a foreign policy speech at Georgetown
University came just minutes before the State Election Commission
in Belgrade announced that opposition presidential candidate
Vojislav Kostunica finished first in the weekend presidential
elections but without enough votes to avoid a runoff with
Milosevic, state television said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the will of Milosevic to retain his grip of power
cannot be underestimated. But he said the will of the Serbian
people to seek freedom in the face of violence and intimidation
from Milosivec's government should not be underestimated either.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the will of the people is respected, the doors to Europe
and the world will be open again to Serbia. We will take steps with
our allies to lift economic sanctions, and the people of Serbia,
who have suffered so much finally will have a chance to lead normal
lives,'' Clinton said at a ceremony to announce the university's
new international law center named after 1951 graduate Eric K.
Hotung, a former member of its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions include blocking international bank loans to
Yugoslavia, an oil embargo and denying visas to Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the world must wait for the results of a
runoff election.The commission said opposition party candidate
Kostunica won 48.22 percent of the vote in Sunday's ballot to 40.23
for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to rid Yugoslavia of Milosevic's rule, the Clinton
administration is threatening an international pressure campaign to
force him to step down. Defense Secretary William Cohen made the
threat against Yugoslavia in an exchange with reporters at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the international community will look very closely,
carefully and bring whatever pressure it can for Milosevic to abide
by the will of his people,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people want Milosevic out,'' he said. ''Certainly the
international community would welcome that result.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said ''there was a
massive unprecedented effort at fraud by the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, anticipating a close race, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Milosevic was trying to ''steal the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. officials said he and his backers had gerrymandered
voting districts and prepared ballots with his name already checked
off.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinian Relations Evolve  </HEADLINE>
By JAMIE TARABAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHA VILLAGE, West Bank (AP) -- Mohammed Hassa haggled with a
customer over the price of a wooden chest. The Palestinian
furniture store owner and the Israeli shopper gesticulated, waving
hands in the air, before finally agreeing.
</P>
<P>
   Hassa negotiated the deal in Hebrew, something he does every
Saturday when the main market of his West Bank village is crowded
with Israeli bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis travel to Palestinian areas as easily these days as
Londoners might go to Calais, France, to buy cheap liquor.
</P>
<P>
   The market scenes -- a far cry from angry encounters during the
1987-1993 Palestinian uprising -- are a snapshot of a new
relationship between the two peoples that is flourishing regardless
of the deadlock in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Saturdays are the busiest and most profitable working days for
Palestinian merchants. Many Israelis use the Jewish Sabbath to
venture into Palestinian towns and villages, encouraged by a drop
in tensions since the gradual withdrawal of Israeli troops from
parts of the West Bank in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday in Masha Village, near Nablus in the West
Bank, some 2,000 shoppers, most of them Israelis, crowded the
mile-long main shopping street, inspecting colorful rugs and
factory-made stone reindeer figurines.
</P>
<P>
   Tali Nikolu, from Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv, was searching for
a table and chairs, in addition to the wooden chest she bought from
Hassa, the furniture dealer. ''In Tel Aviv it's 990 shekels ($247),
here it's 117 shekels ($29), but you must have a car. If I had my
own car I would be here every week,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar scenes are played out every weekend throughout the West
Bank, with thousands of Israelis converging on shops and
restaurants, especially in towns and villages that border Israel.
Some areas are still considered dangerous, though, and draw few
visitors, including the divided West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Nafiz Taha, a household goods vendor who has been running his
stall in Masha for two years, said the market scene has changed
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before there ... were threats to security. With the peace
process the situation is better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amin Abu Khalaf, a travel agent in east Jerusalem, organizes
group package tours into the Palestinian territories. A typical
two- to three-day stay includes a full day for shopping.
</P>
<P>
   He said many first-time visitors express concern over security.
''But there are no problems regarding their safety. They see that
once they visit,'' Abu Khalaf said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is different in the Gaza Strip, kept apart from
Israel by a barbed-wire fence. Complicated entry procedures by the
Israeli army deter most Israelis from traveling there just to shop.
Some, however, go on package tours and spend weekends as tourists
in the area, taking advantage of cheaper local prices.
</P>
<P>
   In Masha, five Israeli soldiers walked up and down the market to
keep an eye on shoppers. Like most villages in the West Bank, Masha
is under joint Israeli-Palestinian control, with Israel remaining
in charge of security, for now.
</P>
<P>
   Hedva Bitton, a housewife from Netanya, said she felt reassured
by the army presence, but she said relations with the Palestinians
have also improved.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's changed because of the peace process. It is better to
live together in peace, it is better for both sides,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Blamed for Stocks Drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell Tuesday after an earnings
warning from Eastman Kodak intensified the market's worries about
third-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 126.15 at 10,682.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite was down
9.47 at 3,731.75 and the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index fell
3.72 to 1,435.31.
</P>
<P>
   Dow component Kodak warned of disappointing profits, saying its
business has been hurt by rising material costs and other factors.
The photographic products manufacturer fell $13.06 to $45.94, a 22
percent decline, in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dow is down because we got a warnings announcement from
Eastman Kodak. In fact, that may be responsible for the whole move
in the Dow,'' said Bill Barker, an investment strategy consultant
at Dain Rauscher. ''These earnings preannouncements are continuing
to keep the market off balance, whether they're Kodak, Intel,
DuPont or whoever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors are very nervous and reluctant to put money to work
right away until we get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   With third-quarter earnings reporting season less than two weeks
away, the market has been unloading stocks whose companies even
warn of lower-than-expected profits. While Kodak has struggled in
recent years amid intense competition in the film industry, its
announcement Tuesday increased Wall Street's uneasiness about
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak also fell as its rating was cut to ''neutral'' from
''attractive'' by a Paine Webber analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Lexmark International tumbled $13.50 to $38.50, a 26 percent
drop, after the company warned of lower-than-expected third-quarter
earnings and analysts at Paine Webber and Bear Stearns downgraded
the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq struggled to stay in positive territory, helped
somewhat by limited bargain hunting. Widely traded Sun Microsystems
was up $1.14 to $119.14. And Microsoft rose $1.69 to $62.94 after
the Supreme Court ruled that the software giant's appeal of its
antitrust case should be heard in a lower court.
</P>
<P>
   Oil service providers were also higher. Halliburton was up $1.21
at $47.94; Exxon Mobil climbed $1.58 to $87.44. The price of a
barrel of sweet crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was
$31.58, a penny higher than Monday, after moving slightly higher
earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 726.34 million shares, ahead
of the 664.98 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 3.13 to 512.25.

<HEADLINE> Retooled Finance Meetings Proceed  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank tried their best Tuesday to proceed with
retooled annual meetings they hoped would highlight efforts at
poverty reduction, even as protesters stormed the police lines
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Many delegates sadly conceded that their acronym-laden poverty
programs with initials such as HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor
Countries) and PRGF (Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility) had
little chance competing for time on the television news with scenes
of police using tear gas and water cannons to battle demonstrators
close to a bridge leading to the conference center.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's top officials still insisted that the
demonstrators have it all wrong -- that the IMF and World Bank are
not the enemies of the world's 2.8 billion poor but the single
biggest providers of government loans aiding countries in economic
crisis and providing development loans to Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meetings of the 182 nations that belong to the two
agencies got under way as scheduled after many delegates, heeding
advice, got up early to catch shuttle buses that began running at 5
a.m., ahead of the midday appearance of demonstrators seeking to
block intersections.
</P>
<P>
   As the battles with police raged outside, the 14,000 delegates
and staff listened to a series of speeches inside a large hall,
beginning with welcoming remarks from Czech President Vaclav Havel,
a jailed dissident himself during his country's communist era.
</P>
<P>
   Havel, who on Saturday had tried to bridge the gap with a
get-together featuring bank officials and their leading critics,
told the delegates that he hoped their meetings would be remembered
in Prague's 1,000-year history as a turning point in ''global
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Prague seemed more likely to join other cities that
have fallen victim to anti-globalization protesters. Demonstrators
stormed Seattle last December, disrupting meetings of the World
Trade Organization, and the area around the White House was turned
into an armed camp in April as authorities staged a massive show of
force to allow the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both institutions have been scrambling to refashion
the annual program to place greater emphasis on poverty reduction,
hoping to blunt the claims of protesters that the two giant
bureaucracies exist mainly to do the bidding of rich countries who
hold the majority of voting shares.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, this year's gathering attracted hundreds of
representatives from the world's largest banks, who have been
hosting swanky cocktail parties in the ornate splendor of Prague's
storybook-like landmarks, hoping to snare business from the finance
and development ministers in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank President James Wolfensohn and IMF Managing Director
Horst Koehler insisted in their opening addresses Tuesday that
their institutions have heeded the calls of responsible critics for
reform and more openness.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn tried to extend an olive branch to the protesters in
his address, saying that many of those demonstrating against
globalization ''are asking legitimate questions and I embrace the
commitment of a new generation to fight poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, whose motorcade got
him to the convention site ahead of the demonstrators so he could
hold talks with finance officials from Brazil and Egypt, said those
trying to turn back globalization, the increasing economic
connections between countries, were making a huge mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no single development today with greater
potential to set back the prospects of the world's poorest than a
rejection of the goal of successful global economic integration,''
Summers said. ''The world pursued that course with great vigor and
great cost in the late 1920s and 1930s and countries have spent
more than 50 years undoing the effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration of President Clinton scored a number of
successes during the preliminary discussions leading up to
Tuesday's meetings, winning approval of various reform proposals,
many of them an answer to critics in the U.S. Congress who blamed
the two organizations for being slow to deal with the 1997-98 Asian
currency crisis. It also won support for a proposal backed by other
countries to double from 10 to 20 the number of poor nations
receiving debt relief by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the United States did not win all of its battles.
Britain objected to an American proposal to expand World Bank
lending on education projects, arguing that the institution was
being stretched too thin.

<HEADLINE> Airman killed, another injured when shed collapses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) - One airman was killed and another
injured after a picnic shed collapsed at the Campbell Army
Airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Master Sgt. Stephen Friedman, 38, of San Antonio,
Texas, was killed Monday. Friedman was assigned to the 621st Air
Mobility Operations Group, based at McGuire Air Force Base, N.J.,
the Army said. The 621st operations group provides support services
for Campbell Army Airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, an air transport craftsman, had been assigned to Fort
Campbell for about one year. He had been selected for promotion to
the rank of senior master sergeant, the Army said.
</P>
<P>
   The injured airman, Air Force Tech. Sgt. James Johnson, suffered
only minor injuries, the Army said. Johnson, whose age and hometown
were not available, is also an air transport craftsman.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and Johnson were attempting to dismantle a wooden
picnic shed when it collapsed, according to a Fort Campbell
military police report. Friedman sustained injuries to his head.
Johnson suffered cuts to his hand. A third airman escaped injury.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and Johnson were taken by ambulance to the emergency
room at Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, where Friedman was
pronounced dead at 12:30 p.m. CDT. Johnson was treated and
released.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into the cause of the building collapse is
continuing, the Army said.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear 'English Only' Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By tackling an ''English only'' dispute from
Alabama, the Supreme Court set the stage Tuesday for an important
ruling on a federal law that bans discrimination based on national
origin.
</P>
<P>
   The justices agreed to decide whether private citizens can
invoke the law, aimed at fighting bias in all federally funded
programs. Their decision is expected by June, after arguments are
heard in January.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 states in recent years have designated English as
the official state language, but many of the laws appear to be
symbolic and do not restrict government use of other languages.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the Alabama case is the state's invalidated policy
of offering written driver's license tests only in English.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts said the policy violated the federal anti-bias law
and ordered the state to offer the tests in other languages as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama offered its written driver's license test in numerous
foreign languages for two decades, until 1991. The state Department
of Public Safety changed its policy about a year after Alabama
voters added an English-only amendment to the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment declared English the state's official language and
instructed state officials to ''take all steps necessary'' to
preserve and enhance ''the role of English as the common
language.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Sandoval, a permanent resident alien from Mexico who
lives in Mobile, Ala., sued the state Department of Public Safety
in 1996. Her lawsuit alleged that the English-only policy violated
a federal law known as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The law bars discrimination based on, among other things,
national origin by any program that receives federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's Department of Public Safety receives more than $1
million each year from the federal Department of Transportation and
Justice Department -- for such things as overtime pay for troopers
and hostage-rescue training.

<P>
   In Sandoval's lawsuit, a federal trial judge was told that about
13,000 Alabama residents would have difficulty obtaining a state
driver's license because of the department's English-only policy.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the policy would result in a ''disparate impact
on the basis of national origin'' in violation of the federal law,
and ordered the state to offer tests in other languages. The 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last November.
</P>
<P>
   Both lower courts rejected state officials' arguments that the
1964 law does not allow lawsuits by private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   All the federal appeals courts that have studied that issue have
reached the same conclusion, but the Supreme Court has never
definitively decided whether such a ''private right of action''
exists under Title VI.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Alexander v. Sandoval, 99-1908.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Hunter Honored by France  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Serge Klarsfeld, a Nazi hunter who refuses to let
France forget its Holocaust victims, on Tuesday was named Officer
of the Legion of Honor -- the nation's highest award.
</P>
<P>
   Klarsfeld, 65, has crisscrossed the globe tracking down Nazis.
His books were among the first to recount France's sordid role in
the deportation of Jews during World War II. He has lobbied
successfully on behalf of Jewish Holocaust orphans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each of your battles has been waged in the memory of your
father and all the victims of the Holocaust, which you miraculously
escaped,'' President Jacques Chirac told a ceremony at the Elysee
palace.
</P>
<P>
   Klarsfeld was only 8 when his father was arrested, deported and
died in Auschwitz. Serge, his mother and sister escaped the raid by
hiding in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Klarsfeld is a man who is deeply committed to justice, a
tireless human rights advocate,'' said Chirac, underlining
Klarsfeld's ''particularly important'' role in preparing the
complex legal cases against French wartime militia chief Paul
Touvier and Vichy police official Maurice Papon.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the government-appointed commission established to
study the confiscation of Jewish assets during the war, Klarsfeld
has compiled comprehensive lists of the names, addresses, convoy
number and date of deportation of every Jew shipped from France to
Nazi death camps.

<HEADLINE> 5 State Department Officials Cited  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department doesn't take strong
enough action against diplomats who violate security regulations, a
senator charged following news that five department employees
temporarily lost security clearances for such breaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't say they fired anyone, did they?'' said Sen. Rod
Grams, R-Minn., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
''They don't take security violations very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked about the issue
when she appeared before a hearing of the committee Tuesday to
assess foreign policy during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Grams commented to The Associated Press after department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday that as of Jan. 1, officials
have suspended the security clearances of five employees for
violations of security policies.
</P>
<P>
   Another 27 employees had their security clearances suspended for
other reasons in the past 18 months to two years, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure followed announcement over the weekend that
Martin Indyk, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, was under FBI and
State Department investigation for suspected security violations.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Grams complained that Albright did not inform
the committee that Indyk's security clearance had been suspended.
''It would be better to alert the committee,'' he told Albright,
who was testifying on a range of foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said, ''we have been handling this in a very
responsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the administration had briefed the intelligence
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk has lost his security clearance and no longer can
participate in Mideast diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's highly regarded for his contributions,'' Boucher said
Monday. ''Obviously, the fact that he doesn't have a security
clearance, and therefore is not able to participate in the
deliberations, makes things more difficult, because he has been an
important member of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said there was no indication of espionage and ''there
has been no indication that any intelligence information has been
compromised. This is a question of security procedures that have
not been followed.''
</P>
<P>
   He provided no details of the other cases. He said he did not
know which employees had been reinstated, but said he assumed some
had been.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Grams dropped a hold he had placed on the appointment
of seven career foreign service officers nominated for
ambassadorships after the department agreed to tighten its
procedures. They had accumulated about 100 security violations.
</P>
<P>
   The violations reportedly included leaving safes open and
removing classified documents from embassies.
</P>
<P>
   The first American ambassador stripped of his security
clearances, Indyk was sidelined as U.S. mediation to break a
deadlock between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat entered another critical stage.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were due to resume talks
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk said in a statement this weekend: ''I regret that my
trying to do the best possible job under very difficult conditions
has led to the temporary suspension of my security clearances.
Jeopardizing the national security interests of the U.S. is
absolutely abhorrent to me, and I would never do anything to
compromise those interests.''

<HEADLINE> Goldie Hawn Fights Timber Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Goldie Hawn wasn't laughing after the
Bureau of Land Management named a timber sale for her.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said it was trying to be creative when it named a
100-acre timber sale near the headwaters of Fawn and Evans creeks
the ''Goldie Fawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawn was told of the sale by an Oregon conservation group and
complained, with a spokeswoman saying the actress didn't want to
see ''beautiful timber land destroyed in her name.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau changed the name of the sale to ''Fawn Creek,'' and
this week said it will be more careful about naming timber sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sticking to drainages and creeks from now on,'' said
Trish Hogervorst, a spokeswoman for the BLM's Salem office.
</P>
<P>
   Hawn, 54, played a ditsy blonde in the late '60s variety show,
''Laugh-In.'' She won an Oscar for best supporting actress in
''Cactus Flower.''

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor,' Hatch Gets Book Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Richard Hatch has reached a book deal
two weeks after an agreement to pen a tell-all about ''Survivor''
fell through.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous million-dollar winner of the CBS show has signed
a deal with The Lyons Press of New York City to write a paperback
entitled, ''101 Survival Secrets: How to Make $1 Million, Lose 100
pounds and Live Happily Ever After.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, 39, has been friends with Lyons Press president and
publisher Tony Lyons for about 15 years. Neither Hatch nor Lyons
would disclose terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has already started working on the 128-page book, which is
due out Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press had reportedly agreed to pay nearly $500,000
for the tell-all, which Hatch was not authorized to write because
of a strict contract. CBS has veto power over how the 16 castaways
can trade in on their fame.

<P>
   OCALA, Fla. (AP) -- The stolen guitar of Matchbox 20 guitarist
Adam Gaynor has been returned along with an apologetic letter from
the thief.
</P>
<P>
   The green Taylor acoustic guitar was returned undamaged Monday
to an Ocala radio station by two men.
</P>
<P>
   The guitar was stolen Sept. 18 during the band's performance at
the University of Florida. Gaynor had made appeals on radio
stations in Gainesville and nearby Ocala for the guitar to be
returned.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of the thief called a hot line set up by the band's
record label to say he knew who took the guitar and that the person
wanted to return it.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'I think he did something stupid and felt really bad
about it,''' Atlantic promotions manager Shirley Torlucci said of
the caller.

<HEADLINE> CIA Spy Testifies on Lockerbie  </HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR MAX
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- A CIA spy testified Tuesday that
two Libyans kept bricks of explosives in a desk at Malta airport
for at least two years, until a few weeks before Pan Am Flight 103
blew up, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
   But the Libyan, who became a CIA mole four months before the
bombing on Dec. 21, 1988, unexpectedly ended his testimony after
less than a day Tuesday, providing only tenuous links between two
Libyan defendants and the explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are charged
with murder and conspiracy to murder the 259 passengers on the
Boeing 747 and 11 people killed by the flaming debris that plunged
30,000 feet onto the Scottish town of Lockerbie. Most of those on
the plane were Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Identified by the pseudonym Abdul Majid Giaka and billed as the
prosecution's star witness, Giaka said he worked in Malta since
1986 for Libya's Jamahriya Security Organization, using his job as
the assistant station manager for Libyan Arab Airlines as a cover.
</P>
<P>
   He said Fhimah, his immediate boss, kept bricks of explosives
locked in a desk at Malta airport for two years -- until just a few
weeks before the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Fhimah ''told me he had 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of TNT
delivered by Abdel Basset,'' Giaka said, referring to the
co-defendant, Megrahi. He said he was told to keep the existence of
the explosives quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka also said he saw Megrahi, who had been in charge of
airline security, with a ''brownish'' suitcase similar to the one
the indictment says contained the bomb that blew up the airliner.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that a senior Libyan intelligence officer asked him
if it would be possible to put an unaccompanied suitcase aboard an
airplane at Malta. That was in 1986, shortly after U.S. aircraft
bombed the Libyan capital of Tripoli to avenge an alleged
Libyan-sponsored terrorist attack on U.S. servicemen in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But in four hours of direct testimony in Arabic, Giaka drew no
direct connection between the explosives he saw at the Libyan
airlines office and the suitcase Megrahi allegedly carried to
Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   After Fhimah left his post in 1988, Giaka said Megrahi told him
to take care of the explosives, but he refused, and summoned the
Libyan consul in Malta to take it away.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka was unclear about the timing of several key incidents,
including the date he saw Megrahi arrive in Malta and collect a
hard-shelled ''shiny brownish'' suitcase from the baggage carousel
-- the same kind the prosecution says concealed the Lockerbie bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka said it was ''two or three weeks'' after an earlier trip
by Megrahi on Dec. 7, 1988, and Fhimah was there to greet him. Dec.
7 was 14 days before a bomb destroyed Pan Am Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   The witness testified after nine years of hiding in the U.S.
witness protection program. Only the people in the courtroom could
see or hear him. Video images broadcast to the public gallery were
blocked and his voice was distorted to keep his identity secret.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka said he became a CIA agent in August 1988 because he was
''uncomfortable'' with his organization's ''involvement in
terrorism and the way it handled dissidents'' against the regime of
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   But Giaka admitted he was afraid of losing his Libyan
intelligence job -- and the exemption from military service --
because of an incident at the airport involving an Egyptian
teen-age girl's complaint of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Initially he wanted help to flee to the United States, but
agreed to stay and spy for the CIA, which paid him $1,000 per month
and helped him avoid military service.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower on Kodak Earnings Warning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chips led Wall Street lower Tuesday after
an earnings warning from Eastman Kodak intensified the market's
worries about third-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   Investor enthusiasm for individual stocks including Microsoft
and Palm wasn't enough to offset an overall selloff that began late
last week.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
168.69 at 10,639.46.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite was down
46.48 at 3,694.74 and the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index fell
11.00 to 1,428.03.
</P>
<P>
   Dow component Kodak warned of disappointing profits, saying its
business has been hurt by rising material costs and other factors.
The photographic products manufacturer fell $14.63 to $44.38, a 25
percent decline, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dow is down because we got a warnings announcement from
Eastman Kodak. In fact, that may be responsible for the whole move
in the Dow,'' said Bill Barker, an investment strategy consultant
at Dain Rauscher. ''These earnings preannouncements are continuing
to keep the market off balance, whether they're Kodak, Intel,
DuPont or whoever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors are very nervous and reluctant to put money to work
right away until we get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   With third-quarter earnings reporting season less than two weeks
away, the market has been unloading stocks whose companies even
warn of lower-than-expected profits. While Kodak has struggled in
recent years amid intense competition in the film industry, its
announcement Tuesday increased Wall Street's uneasiness about
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak also fell as its rating was cut to ''neutral'' from
''attractive'' by a Paine Webber analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Lexmark International tumbled $14.56 to $37.44, a 28 percent
drop, after the company warned of lower-than-expected third-quarter
earnings and analysts at Paine Webber and Bear Stearns downgraded
the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq struggled to stay in positive territory, helped
somewhat by limited bargain hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmaker Intel fell for the third straight session since it
issued a profit warning, down $2.38 at $43. But widely traded Sun
Microsystems was up 56 to $118.56. And Microsoft rose 75 cents to
$62 after the Supreme Court ruled that the software giant's appeal
of its antitrust case should be heard in a lower court.
</P>
<P>
   Handheld computer maker Palm rose $3.75 to $56 after it said
quarterly profits would be above expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Oil service providers were also higher. Halliburton was up $1.02
at $47.75; Exxon Mobil climbed $1.46 to $87.31; and Enron jumped
$1.38 to $85.81. The price of a barrel of sweet crude on the New
York Mercantile Exchange was $31.53, a 4 cents less than Monday,
after moving slightly higher earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The market's overall tumble came the same day as an economic
report which showed consumer confidence in the economy remains
steady, but is at significantly lower levels than at the beginning
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index now
stands at 141.9, up slightly from the revised 140.8 reported in
August but down considerably from the record 144.7 registered in
January and May.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 868.29 million shares, well
ahead of the 782.73 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 4.69 to 510.69.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Activists at Prague Summit  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Unleashing a fresh round of fury
against economic globalization, 5,000 protesters marched on the IMF
and World Bank summit Tuesday, throwing firebombs, sticks and rocks
at police who responded with clubs, tear gas and water cannons.
</P>
<P>
   The enemies of capitalism didn't get the 20,000 activists they
had hoped for but were still able to raise a ruckus that left at
least 69 people injured and turned Prague into a smoky battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and rocks they had made by
breaking up a cobblestone sidewalk. Authorities pushed
demonstrators back each time they approached the communist-era
convention center where the titans of global capitalism had huddled
to ponder economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of activists got so close, however, that officials
temporarily stopped the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
delegates and staff from leaving before evacuating them through a
subway station closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The skies over Prague filled with black smoke after some of the
demonstrators built barricades in the streets and set them ablaze,
also torching cars in what they billed as a sequel to riots that
marred recent economic meetings in Seattle and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main goals of the protesters had been to trap the IMF
and World Bank delegates inside the convention center, which
happened briefly. The fighting hurt at least 69 people, including
51 police officers attacked by wave after wave of protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Czech President Vaclav Havel appealed for calm, urging
demonstrators to ''abstain from violent forms of protests.''
</P>
<P>
   After nightfall, a group of 200 people was moving through the
streets, smashing bank windows and demolishing a McDonald's outlet
-- the second to be struck in the riot -- and a KFC. Some 1,500
activists blocked the road outside the State Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police were exhausted, so reinforcements were being brought
in, said Interior Minister Stanislav Gross.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fear that the protesters will divide into smaller groups,
and we don't know what they will do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters call globalization a menace to humanity that
helps the rich get richer at the expense of the poor and the
environment. The IMF and World Bank have become favored targets, as
have capitalist icons such as McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, chairman of the
summit, said it was ''a pity that it has descended into violence''
but added it was unclear what the activists were seeking as they
fight the economic globalization trade officials call irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what they're against but have no sense of what they're
for,'' Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters -- mostly from Europe and representing a
wide variety of groups including anarchists, communists and
environmentalists -- also seemed a bit fuzzy on their goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bankers decide to spoil the world during the day, and at
night, they go to listen to music and to rest,'' said Daniel Gomez,
an activist from Barcelona who joined the demonstration outside the
opera house. ''That's a bad joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a battle for equal justice worldwide,'' explained a
naked Swiss protester, identifying himself only as Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   In a throwback to U.S. anti-war demonstrations of the 1960s,
some activists waved banners saying ''Make love not trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Rioters smashed the windows out of eight ambulances, and for
several hours, Prague officials shut down an entire subway train
line.
</P>
<P>
   Czech authorities had mobilized 11,000 police to try to maintain
control. Police spokeswoman Iva Knolova said an undetermined number
of activists were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the summit, Czech authorities at the
border stopped almost 300 people with arrest records from previous
anti-globalization rallies.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters' goals Tuesday included blocking the roughly
14,000 IMF and World Bank delegates and staff inside the meeting
hall. For a while the delegates were prevented from leaving, as mob
violence raged. Prague's mayor said a Japanese delegate was
injured, but the delegation was not immediately able to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates eventually got out on a subway train brought in
as a special evacuation vehicle, picking them up at a station that
remained closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   An official who sets schedules for the Japanese delegation
admitted he was nervous after looking through a window at the riot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not comfortable at all for us,'' said Kunio Matsuda.
</P>
<P>
   Many local shops have closed -- with boards placed over their
windows -- after owners worried their property could be trashed by
rampaging mobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it neither amusing nor sad,'' said Ahmed Mahrous
El-Darsh, the top Egyptian delegate to the summit. ''It reminds me
of the good old days when I was in the states during the '60s.
These young people have a message to convey.''

<HEADLINE> Blair Sets Election Battle Lines  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIGHTON, England (AP) -- Contrite about the collapse of his
government's popularity but defiant toward the fuel protesters who
caused it, Prime Minister Tony Blair said Tuesday the test of
leadership is ''how you explain why you're saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech pitched to a national TV audience as well as to
shaken party activists, Blair was apologetic over a recent rash of
problems but talked of ''a second term more radical than the
first'' -- and of ambitious 10-year plans that suggest he's
determined to win a third five-year term as well.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Blair set the battle lines for the next election
between an opposition focusing on tax cuts and his party's emphasis
on improving public services.
</P>
<P>
   ''The test of leadership in politics is not how eloquently you
say yes,'' Blair told delegates. ''It's how you explain why you're
saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair pointed to three reasons why the government will not meet
the 60-day deadline for relief set by the truckers and farmers who
effectively ran British gasoline stations dry earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government's priority was to help 2 million elderly
people by boosting pensions, he told truckers that many of their
taxes are lower than in European countries with cheaper fuel, and
he repeated his determination not to give in to blockades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would it ever be right to choose a priority simply on the
basis of a fuel blockade? What of those who can't protest, whose
voice isn't supported by the media, who go neglected unless we
speak for them?'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   The message impressed some key supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tony Blair has clearly signaled that the days of governments
buying power through tax cuts are over,'' said John Edmonds,
general secretary of the GMB union. ''It is obvious that he intends
to earn power at the next election through investment in public
services for all, rather than the Tory offer of tax bribes for the
affluent few.''
</P>
<P>
   However, John Bridge, chairman of the Road Haulage Association,
said the government still needs to tackle the fuel price issue ''in
a practical and urgent way.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Over 80 percent of the population believe the government has
got to change its policy,'' Bridge said.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel protests, which caught the government surprised and
apparently powerless to act, knocked Labor below the opposition
Conservative Party for the first time since the 1997 election.
Overwhelming majorities told pollsters the government handled the
protests badly, and Blair's popularity dived from the record levels
of his first months in power.
</P>
<P>
   The government also has been hurt by the failure of the
Millennium Dome to attract as many visitors as planned, and for the
tight budget policies that produced only a $1.10 per week increase
in the state pension for retirees this year. New questions have
been raised about a $1.45 million contribution from Formula One
chief Bernie Ecclestone, who subsequently lobbied the government
for an exemption from a ban on tobacco sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Blair is frequently described -- by opponents and ordinary voters
-- as arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since he became party leader in 1994, he
faced the conference with his leadership in question. For the first
time, the party heard an apologetic prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, there are things we have done that have made people angry
and we should be open enough to admit it,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dome. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if I had my time
again, I would have listened to those who said government shouldn't
try to run big visitor attractions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Treasury chief Gordon Brown promised larger increases
in the pension, targeted on lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell you now, as Gordon made crystal clear yesterday,''
Blair said, ''we get the message.''

<HEADLINE> Y2-Kids! Hospital nurseries are booming in 2000  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) - The Y2K bug may have been a bust. But apparently,
many couples were bitten by something else last New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   From Los Angeles to Milwaukee, Mississippi and New York,
hospitals are booming with babies nine months later.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the babies 2000 month!'' says Sara Howley, a spokeswoman
at one busy hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   National figures have yet to be tallied. But several hospitals
and obstetricians around the country say their numbers have been up
all year. And September - traditionally a big month for babies -
has been particularly busy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like everyone we run into is pregnant,'' says Trish
Reynolds, an architect from Coventry, R.I., whose daughter Abigale
was born last Wednesday and spent her first hours of life in a
packed hospital nursery.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds says it is very possible that Abigale was conceived on
New Year's Eve - a night she and husband Kevin Prest decided to
cozy up at home to avoid any Y2K madness. And it looks like they
weren't the only ones.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Mississippi Medical Center, for example, has
seen an 18 percent increase in nursery admissions in September
compared with the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh gosh, it's definitely busier for us,'' says Diane Dukes,
the hospital's director of nursing services. ''We've had to fund
additional staff positions.''
</P>
<P>
   At WakeMed, the largest hospital in Raleigh, N.C., the staff
expects to deliver about 500 babies in September - a 13.5 percent
increase over September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened to the hospital nine months after
Hurricane Fran hit in 1996, says hospital spokeswoman Debbie
Laughery. ''You know - no power, candlelight.''
</P>
<P>
   And they're expecting even more births in October, since a
record snowfall on Jan. 24 and 25 kept many North Carolinians
inside for days.
</P>
<P>
   Wintertime is, in fact, the most common time to conceive in
cold-weather states, says Dr. Laura Riley, an obstetrician at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who thinks the higher
numbers there have more to do with that than the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Across town at Boston's South Cove Community Health Center -
where many new mothers are immigrants from China - another sort of
New Year seems to be the culprit. Nurse midwife Mary Hackett says
births have been up since Feb. 4, the beginning of the Year of the
Dragon, which is considered the luckiest in the 12-year Chinese
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Wendell, a Little Rock, Ark., obstetrician whose
birthday is Sept. 10, says he has always suspected that he may have
been the result of a little New Year's revelry way back when. His
city is now going through a baby boom nine months after New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always tease that it's after the New Year,'' Wendell says.
''I don't know if it's related to that or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say a good economy and a general feeling of optimism
encouraged them to have children.
</P>
<P>
   ''After you've made it here, you have to find something very
exciting to do - so having kids is one of those things,'' says
Bennett Kleinberg, a New York-based high-tech consultant. He and
wife Elaine had a daughter, Mara, last month.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Kleinberg says he likes the idea of having a baby born in
2000: ''If my child lives to be 92, that's 2092! That's like the
date of a science fiction novel.''

<HEADLINE> Truckers Block Berlin Streets  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Thousands of truckers staged a decidedly German
protest against rising fuel prices Tuesday, lining up peacefully to
block Berlin's central thoroughfare in a demonstration nothing like
the chaotic protests elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has watched other governments cave in to demands, but so
far has stood firm against scaling back a controversial ''ecology
tax'' on fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-nation European Union said Tuesday it had no immediate
plans to follow the United States' lead and offer relief by
releasing strategic oil reserves. But EU officials said that could
change after finance ministers meet Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder tried to deflect German truckers'
ire onto his EU neighbors Tuesday, arguing that other countries'
capitulations -- and not the ecology tax -- were creating unfair
competition.
</P>
<P>
   After France, the first hit by the recent wave of protests,
offered gas tax rebates, drivers in other countries followed suit,
creating traffic havoc across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Unilateral French action ''has further intensified the
competitive situation for German firms,'' Schroeder said. ''That is
no good sign for the European single market.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany offered low-interest loans Tuesday to cash-strapped
trucking companies, but the truckers' association and demonstrators
said that was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks, tractors and buses started streaming into Berlin Monday
night. By Tuesday, about 7,000 vehicles filled the tree-lined
street running through central Tiergarten park to the Brandenburg
Gate, but they still left a lane open for public transport.
</P>
<P>
   Police closed off feeder roads and motorists mostly kept their
distance. Truckers started clearing away by the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want any trouble, but we have to do something as our
jobs depend on it,'' said Harald Grueninger, a 41-year-old trucker
from the western city of Fulda.
</P>
<P>
   After a midday rally at the Gate which organizers said was
attended by 7,000 protesters, hundreds went to knock on the
Reichstag's back door. Police held back the demonstrators who
screamed ''Cowards!'' and ''We are the people!''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a megaphone, parliament's vice president, Anke
Fuchs, sympathized with the protesters and invited seven truckers
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was Germany's largest protest so far, the country
has yet to experience anything like the chaos in France, Britain
and Spain. There, protesters blocked oil refineries, choking gas
supplies and prompting panic-buying at gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   Protests continued in some parts of Europe. Greek motorists
lined up at gas pumps Tuesday for a second day, fearing a trucker
strike would lead to fuel shortages. In Spain, fresh fish ran out
at Barcelona markets after a week of blockades and fishermen's
strikes. In Seville, tractors and trucks blockaded a regional fuel
depot, stopping deliveries leaving.
</P>
<P>
   But in consensus-oriented Germany, where politicians of all hues
regularly seek common ground with industry and labor, the truckers
patiently gathered at pre-agreed points and were escorted by police
into the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a warning, and it won't be the last action. Still,
blockading refineries is against the law and we don't want to go
that far,'' said Peter Kofahl, 43, a hauler from the eastern city
of Rostock. ''But if we just stayed at home for a week, Germany
would fall apart.''

<HEADLINE> Census: Poverty down, income up in New York state  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York state's poverty rate dropped to an
average of 15.4 percent in 1998-99, according to Census Bureau data
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's down from the average 16.6 percent rate in 1997-98. The
statewide 1.2 decrease compares with a national 0.7 decrease to
12.3 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   New York was one of seven states - along with the District of
Columbia - to show a decrease in poverty rates when comparing the
two-year averages. The other states with decreases were Arizona,
Arkansas, California, South Dakota, Utah and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   No state showed an increase in poverty rates, according to the
census data.
</P>
<P>
   Median income was up in New York state to $39,139 for 1998-99,
compared to $37,689 in 1997-98. The statewide 3.8 percent increase
compares to a national increase of 3.1 percent to $40,280.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Drinking and Accidents  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- People who began drinking while underage are up
to three times more likely to get hurt in car crashes and other
alcohol-related accidents than those who started at 21 or older, a
study found.
</P>
<P>
   The national survey of 42,862 adults offers another sobering
argument against underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents don't appreciate that alcohol is the No. 1 drug of
abuse of kids,'' said Dr. Mary Dufour, deputy director of the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. ''They say,
'Well, he's only drinking.' This is yet another reason why they
need to pay attention and why kids need to pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings appear in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University researcher Ralph Hingson and colleagues
examined data from a 1992 NIAAA survey of randomly selected adults
age 44 on average. About half said they had started drinking before
age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Accidental alcohol-related injuries were more common in youth as
well as in adulthood among people who started drinking before age
21. The accidents included car crashes, burns and serious cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers theorized that people who start drinking at
young ages ''may be less fearful of injury and situations that pose
risk of injury.'' They may even derive pleasure from taking such
risks, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   Car accidents and other unintentional injuries are the leading
cause of death for adolescents and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Others studies have shown that underage drinkers are more likely
to become alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Kranzler, a psychiatry professor at the University of
Connecticut, said the findings fall in line with previous research
suggesting that early-onset alcoholism differs from the disease in
older people and is associated with more psychiatric, legal and
antisocial problems.

<HEADLINE> Whole Grains Cut Women Stroke Risk  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Women who eat lots of whole-grain foods can
significantly reduce their risk of strokes, researchers say in
another study suggesting that healthy eating leads to healthy
living.
</P>
<P>
   Those who ate the most whole grains -- the equivalent of two to
three slices of whole-grain bread daily -- were 30 percent to 40
percent less likely to have an ischemic stroke than women who ate
less than half a slice or the equivalent daily.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, based on data on 75,521 participants in Harvard
University's Nurses Health Study, appear in Wednesday's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   From 1984 to 1996, 352 strokes occurred in the study group. Most
were ischemic strokes, caused by blockages in brain-feeding
arteries. Most of the estimated 600,000 strokes reported each year
nationwide are this type.
</P>
<P>
   Strokes, the nation's third leading cause of death, afflict men
and women equally but are more likely to be fatal in women.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the more whole grains women ate, the less likely
they were to have a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest that ''replacing refined grains with whole
grains by even one serving a day may have significant benefits in
reducing the risk of ischemic stroke,'' wrote the authors, led by
Dr. Simin Liu of Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Whole grains consumed by study participants included whole-wheat
bread, whole-grain cereal, popcorn, wheat germ, oatmeal, bulgur and
couscous. Refined-grain foods included sweet rolls, white bread,
white rice and English muffins.
</P>
<P>
   Liu said it is unclear exactly how whole grains might prevent
strokes, although they have been linked to lower levels of the
so-called bad cholesterol that can clog arteries.
</P>
<P>
   His study sought to determine if components of whole grains such
as vitamin E and fiber might be responsible. But he found a risk
reduction independent of those factors, suggesting that other
mechanisms are at work.

<HEADLINE> Station records show Corzine spends $12 million on TV  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Democratic candidate Jon Corzine has spent
or signed contracts to spend $12 million on TV advertising on
network-affiliated stations in New York and Philadelphia for the
nine weeks of the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Records examined by The Associated Press at the six stations
also show Corzine is going for the gold, plowing almost $5 million
into the NBC affiliates in both cities for commercials to air
mostly during the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponent Bob Franks has yet to contract for any TV
air time and is expected to be weeks away from airing his first
spots, although a Republican group in Washington D.C. began running
an independent attack ad against Corzine on radio this week.
</P>
<P>
   Not until recently has Franks been able to reach the $2 million
mark in his own fund raising, according to GOP party officials.
Neither the Franks nor Corzine campaigns will confirm or discuss
their finances or spending.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine spent $36.7 million to win the Democratic primary,
according to the last required Federal Election Commission report
in June, a sum that shattered national records.
</P>
<P>
   The TV contracts examined by The AP document that Corzine has
now dumped almost $50 million into this race, according to the
spending that can be specifically documented. FEC reports due out
Oct. 15 are likely to show his spending is actually much higher
with spending on mailers, billboards, polling, staff and field
offices for Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The previous top-spender in the nation was California Republican
Michael Huffington, whose $30 million outlay in a losing effort in
1994 was eclipsed by Corzine just for the June 6 primary race in
which he defeated former Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, New Jersey's two U.S. Senate candidates, Republican
Dick Zimmer and Democrat Robert Torricelli, spent $18 million
combined. Torricelli won.

<HEADLINE> Independence Party candidate files FEC complaint over debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Jeff Graham's U.S. Senate campaign may not
attract the same attention as Hillary Rodham Clinton's and Rick
Lazio's.
</P>
<P>
   But in a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission,
Graham, the Independence Party candidate, says he should either be
included in the Senate debates or told why he was being left out.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint seeks to get the former Watertown mayor included
in upcoming Senate debates, the next of which is scheduled for Oct.
8 in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Tuesday that attempts by his campaign to be added to
the Sept. 13 Senate faceoff in Buffalo were turned down. Efforts by
his campaign to find out the criteria for inclusion ''were met with
evasive responses ... or no response at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said his campaign has also been unable to obtain an
answer for the upcoming debate being staged by WCBS in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm appealing to their good sense and fair mindedness,''
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the Clinton and Lazio camps
or from WCBS.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's review of the first debate between Clinton and Lazio
was less than glowing.
</P>
<P>
   ''That debate was God awful,'' he said. ''When you take away the
theatrics and the dramatics there was no substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham is one of three minor party candidates running in the New
York Senate contest. The others are on the Green and Right to Life
party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's complaint names the Buffalo News, NBC News and WNED,
the PBS affiliate in Buffalo. Those outlets staged the Sept. 13
debate. It also names WCBS.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Brings Negotiators To Wash.  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
returned here Tuesday at the request of President Clinton to try
again to arrange a peace settlement. ''We are giving it the
full-court press,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   With the two sides deadlocked over Jerusalem's future, the
Clinton administration appeared to be staking out a more aggressive
role. But Albright told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
''unless the leaders, themselves, make the final decisions, we
cannot do that for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiterating the oft-sounded warning that time was running out to
conclude a deal, Albright said ''we are clearly in the end-stretch
here.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, meanwhile, spokesman Joe Lockhart said ''we
continue to play a role in trying to bridge the differences between
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's obviously very important for these discussions to
continue, particularly at the leader level,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli delegation was headed by Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami, and the Palestinians' by senior negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
   The met with Clinton in New York earlier in the month, but the
deadlock over Jerusalem persisted. In July, Clinton was unable to
persuade Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to be more compromising to each other at a summit he hosted
at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is insisting on transfer of East Jerusalem to the
Palestinians as a capital for the state Barak has already offered
in most of the West Bank and Gaza. The Israeli leader has offered
some local control to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat held a nighttime meeting Monday in Jerusalem in
an apparently friendly atmosphere but did not make any concrete
headway toward an agreement, officials on both sides said in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian official said the United States was working on a
position paper, but would present it formally only if both sides
appear prepared to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's senior adviser, Danny Yatom, said: ''We did not have
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmed Qureia, the Palestinian parliament speaker, told The
Associated Press that ''it was a very constructive meeting that
created a new atmosphere between the two leaders, and I believe it
will have the effect on public opinion on the peace process on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Barak and Arafat had promised to ''do their best to
reach an agreement.'' But he said none of the issues were
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Barak had called Clinton Tuesday with a 10-minute
summary of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Quizzed at the Senate hearing, Albright repeatedly stressed only
the United States could ''bring the parties together,'' and that
Clinton was trying a variety of approaches to accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   While the Jerusalem dispute has center stage, there are other
touchy issues still to be resolved. They include the disposition of
hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who claim their families were
expelled by Israel as it established a state 52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The borders between Israel and the prospective Palestinian state
also must be drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is in the Israelis' court,'' Qureia said.
</P>
<P>
   Also emphasizing the atmosphere but not the unsettled issues,
Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said on television ''both we
and the Palestinians understand that there is a rare opportunity to
make peace here, and if we don't make peace now we won't forgive
ourselves later.''

<HEADLINE> FBI: Colombia Bomb Fragments Match  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Fueling charges of a military cover-up
in the 1998 bombing deaths of 16 villagers, an FBI analysis has
found that fragments from the site matched a type of bomb that
Washington has provided to the Colombian air force.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, contained in a ballistics report seen by The
Associated Press, would appear to cast doubt on claims by the
Colombian air force that the deadly explosion in Santo Domingo was
caused by a truck bomb set by leftist guerillas.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the FBI analysis, a Colombian air force commander
claimed Monday that rebels planted the bomb fragments at the scene
in an attempt to frame the military.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy puts the Colombian military's already tarnished
reputation into further question at a time when Washington is
vastly increasing military aid to this South American country.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers and their lawyers, citing eyewitness accounts, claim
the air force dropped a bomb on the hamlet of Santo Domingo, near
the country's eastern border with Venezuela, killing 16 villagers,
including six children.
</P>
<P>
   Troops at the time were battling guerrillas in nearby fields,
and the air force itself acknowledges helicopters fired rockets and
machine guns as close as six-tenths of a mile to Santo Domingo, a
strip of about two dozen wooden houses and a gas station straddling
a paved country road.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report, given to Colombian investigators in May, says
fragments found at the scene of the Dec. 13, 1998 blast are
''consistent with'' a 20-pound AN-M41 bomb designed in the United
States. The bomb is meant to be dropped from at least 400 feet.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman, Paul Bresson, verified Tuesday that the report
seen by the AP was produced by the FBI and confirmed its contents.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's military has received that type of bomb from the U.S.
government, which is dramatically increasingly support for
Colombia's military as part of a $1.3 billion anti-drug aid
package.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of a Colombian helicopter crew face possible
homicide charges in the case in a military court.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Monday, acting Air Force Commander Gen.
Jairo Garcia said rebels set off the explosion with a truck bomb
and later planted the bomb fragments at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tail piece they had for some time and placed it
there, a very old and rusted tail section,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   While not disputing that the FBI had correctly identified the
bomb parts, Garcia said the Air Force has not used the AN-M41 bomb
for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia also dismissed a report by Colombia's Medical Forensic
Institute concluding that shrapnel found in bodies could not have
come from a car bomb. He said medical examiners were unqualified to
make that judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy has confirmed that the Washington donated or
sold to Colombia all seven of the aircraft used during the fighting
near Santo Domingo, including two Black Hawk helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. lawmaker opposed to military aid to Colombia was
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know yet whether or not this was a tragic accident.
But it does appear that there has been an attempt to cover up what
happened by the Colombian military,'' Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
told the AP through an aide on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the FBI report, Leahy has demanded explanations from the
State Department, and suggested that human rights restrictions
placed on U.S. military aid to Colombia have been violated.
</P>
<P>
   Tito Gaitan, a lawyer for families of the victims, said Monday
in a phone interview from Chicago that the Colombian Air Force has
obstructed official inquiries and conducted a ''systematic cover
up'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The country's air force has been relatively untainted by
accusations of human rights violations, which usually focus on
alleged ties between the country's army and violent right-wing
paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   But air power is playing an increasingly important role in the
36-year war. Washington is supplying dozens of new combat
helicopters capable of firing rockets and equipped with machine
guns.

<HEADLINE> Earnings Concerns Sent Stocks Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - (AP) -- Worries about earnings have once again sent
stocks tumbling. The Dow Jones industrial average led the decline
as component Eastman Kodak warned that its third quarter will fall
short. The Dow sank 175 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 10,632.
Losing issues topped winners four to three, with about 1.1 billion
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. The Nasdaq
composite lost 51 points, or about 1.4 percent, to close at 36,089.
The S &AMP; P 500 closed down almost 12 points at 14,027.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak warned of disappointing profits, saying its business has
been hurt by rising material costs and other factors. The
photographic products manufacturer fell 25 percent to end at a
52-week low of about $44. With the third-quarter earnings reporting
season less than two weeks away, the market has been unloading
stocks whose companies even warn of lower-than-expected profits.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Arsenic Therapy  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A form of arsenic once used as insect poison
won Food and Drug Administration approval Tuesday as a leukemia
treatment after studies found small doses helped patients with a
rare but deadly form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of Trisenox, the brand name for arsenic trioxide,
marks the first official arsenic-based therapy in the United States
in over 100 years -- one that came when U.S. scientists noted China
was having some success with a compound much of the world had
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the rare ''acute promyelocytic leukemia,'' or APL,
which strikes about 1,500 Americans a year. About 400 will not
respond to, or will quickly relapse after, standard chemotherapy.
These patients have had few options but to try standard therapy
again in hopes of buying some time.
</P>
<P>
   But in a study of Trisenox, 28 of the 40 patients given the drug
intravenously went into remission -- an impressive 70 percent
response rate, the FDA said. How long remission lasts varies,
cautions FDA medical officer Dr. Steven Hirschfeld, but a few have
lasted several years.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have a 70 percent response rate in patients who have failed
conventional treatment is an exceptionally good result,'' said Dr.
David Scheinberg, leukemia chief at New York's Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, which is responsible for arsenic
trioxide's comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenic alone is a poison and can cause cancer, but
arsenic-containing compounds have been used medically for more than
2,000 years. Ninteenth-century U.S. doctors tried arsenic to treat
leukemia, but abandoned it with the discovery of radiation and
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Chinese scientists noticed traditional
Chinese practitioners were giving leukemia patients an
arsenic-containing paste that in some cases seemed to work,
Hirschfeld said. Those scientists eventually figured out that
arsenic trioxide was the beneficial ingredient, and hunted for
intravenous forms. Successful Chinese studies attracted the
attention of Sloan-Kettering, which began U.S. tests in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   APL is a cancer where abnormal or immature white blood cells
crowd out proper white cells and red blood cells in the bone marrow
and blood. Arsenic trioxide apparently works like another common
APL treatment, retinoic acid: Instead of killing cells, it causes
those immature white cells to mature into normal cells, Scheinberg
said. Scientists now are testing whether it might help certain
other cancers, too.
</P>
<P>
   It can cause very serious side effects, the FDA cautioned. The
sudden increase of working white blood cells can cause inflammation
and fluid accumulation, especially in the heart and lungs, that can
be fatal. Twenty percent of patients who tested Trisenox had the
side effect, but all were successfully treated.
</P>
<P>
   Trisenox also caused a heartbeat irregularity called an
increased QT interval in 40 percent of patients. This irregularity
can lead to arrhythmias, so the FDA urged that patients be closely
monitored. Other side effects included nausea, vomiting, headache
and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturer Cell Therapeutics Inc. of Seattle said Trisenox
will be available within three weeks, and a complete course of
therapy will cost between $12,000 and $16,000.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Tax Cut for Abducted Kids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted 419-0 Tuesday for a bill to
allow parents to take tax deductions for kidnapped children.
</P>
<P>
   The move came four days after the Internal Revenue Service
reversed an advisory opinion that had restricted the deduction to
the year in which a child is kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Ramstad, the bill's sponsor, said the legislation was
needed to give the reversed IRS opinion the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't get any worse from out-of-touch Washington
bureaucrats than to deny the family of a kidnapped child the
dependency exemption, even though the family continues to spend
money searching for their child and maintains the child's
bedroom,'' said Ramstad, R-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ramstad's bill, any parent whose child is abducted by a
person outside the family may take the same deduction as any other
parent with a dependent child -- $2,800 -- until the missing child's
18th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation is pending in the Senate. The Clinton
administration supports the bill.

<HEADLINE> Private firm to pursue delinquent taxes for state agency  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state has hired a private collection
agency to go after $200 million in delinquent taxes owed by
out-of-state residents and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Taxation and Finance retained
Minneapolis-based Allied Interstate Inc. to find tax delinquents
outside New York's borders. In return, the company will get 10
percent of any collection the state recovers or 20 percent of
payments from litigation brought as a result of pursuing unpaid
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they do is get a percentage of the recovery. It costs
taxpayers nothing,'' Marc Carey, a tax department spokesman, said
Tuesday. ''Every dollar we get back is found money.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey said the department has tried to track down out-of-state
delinquents on its own, but the process is time-consuming and
costly. Professionals at the collection agency have the resources
to find scofflaws and transfer tax liability judgments to the state
where the person or corporation is based.
</P>
<P>
   The department hired Allied Interstate last month and has
already forwarded to the company 20,000 out-of-state cases dating
back to 1990. The contract lasts two years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Allied Interstate has recovered $60,000, Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And that number's going to rise,'' he added. ''The message is
simple: You can run but you can't hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Within New York state, there are 55,000 tax delinquents owing a
total of $427 million, records showed. Carey said the department is
thinking of hiring a private collection agency to pursue the
''hard-core'' in-state cases.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post first reported the tax department's collection
contract with Allied Interstate Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Department is not the only state agency resorting to an
outside firm to track down delinquent payments.
</P>
<P>
   The Higher Education Services Corporation, which administers
state student loan programs, has contracts with as many as 30
private collection firms to help recoup late loan repayments,
spokesman Laurence Sombke said.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency has an in-house collection department that
tries to track down delinquents for the first 270 days. After that,
the process becomes more cost-efficient if it is passed onto
private companies, Sombke said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the state Office of Court Administration announced it
would retain Outsourcing Solutions Inc. on a trial basis to collect
unpaid fines and surcharges imposed by judges in six courts. Under
the contract, the company would receive 14.9 percent of what it
collects in this state fiscal year up to a maximum of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Court administrators said the aggressive collection methods of
professionals in the field may generate tens of millions of dollars
but did not provide an estimate of the amount they expect to
collect through the Outsourcing Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the Office of Court
Administration, said Tuesday authorization from the state
comptroller's office to begin the collection process should be
''imminent.''

<HEADLINE> Syria Wants Iraq Sanctions Lifted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syria called Tuesday for lifting the U.N.
sanctions against Iraq as pressure mounted on the world body to
ease the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the policy of keeping sanctions on Iraq is
groundless, especially since the Iraqi people are suffering the
most,'' Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa told reporters
after talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in the
Syrian capital, Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa's call comes as pressure mounted on the United Nations
to lift or ease the sanctions, with Russia and France leading the
challenge against them. In the past few days, French and Russian
civilian planes flew to Baghdad without prior permission from the
U.N. Sanctions Committee. A Jordanian flight to Baghdad is
scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government, intensively pushing for an end to the
sanctions, now says it will reject flights to Baghdad by those who
even seek U.N. permission.
</P>
<P>
   Imposed to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990, the
sanctions can only be lifted if Iraq complies with U.N. Security
Council resolutions ordering the Arab nation to dismantle its
arsenal of mass-destruction weapons. Iraq must also settle
compensation claims arising from its invasion and occupation of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's Aziz, who arrived in Damascus late Monday on a previously
unannounced visit, also met with President Bashar Assad on Tuesday
for talks that he later described as ''friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   His visit is the latest sign that neighbors Iraq and Syria are
continuing to reconcile after years of hostility. In August, they
agreed to re-establish passenger rail links for the first time
since 1981 and Iraq Airways opened a Damascus office after a
20-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   The two Arab nations are also discussing ways to increase trade,
and on Monday Syria announced that it will open a trade center in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and Syria, ruled by rival factions of the Arab Baath Party,
resumed diplomatic relations in 1997 after a 17-year break. Syria
backed Iran in its war with Iraq in the 1980s and sided with the
U.S.-led coalition against Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As yet another nation lined up in opposition
to U.N. sanctions against Iraq, U.S. congressmen called for a
better policy to deal with President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to have a policy based on the reality in the world,''
Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said at a House International
Relations Committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., criticized
what he called ''the gravity of the threat posed by Saddam and the
inadequacy of our nation's response to that threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing took place as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the other side of
Capitol Hill that she was ''very concerned'' about recent
unapproved Russian and French flights to Iraq and that she was
trying to persuade Jordan not to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, Culture Minister Mahmoud Kayed told The Associated
Press, ''The plane will leave tomorrow'' whether it has U.N.
approval or not.
</P>
<P>
   The development drew attention again to crumbling international
resolve 10 years after the United Nations imposed sanctions for
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the House committee, former Iraq weapons inspector
Richard Butler said division among members of the U.N. Security
Council is largely to blame for the stalemate in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (U.S.) administration must make clear to Russia that its
... policy of giving support and comfort to regimes such as the
Saddam regime is simply not acceptable,'' he said, also noting
efforts by France and China to chip away at sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Butler is an Australian who once headed the now-defunct U.N.
Special Commission for weapons inspections in Iraq, an initiative
that broke down at the end of 1998 after Iraq refused further
cooperation with Butler and his team.
</P>
<P>
   While France, Russia and China have launched a new campaign to
try to chip away at the sanctions, the United States and Britain
are determined to maintain the embargoes until U.N. inspectors
certify that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said ''evidence available strongly suggests'' that while
Iraq has thwarted weapons inspections for two years, it has
''embarked again on the business of making more weapons of mass
destruction.'' He said the regime is working to extend the range of
its missiles, has recalled its nuclear weapons design team and
rebuilt its chemical and biological warfare factories.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Security Council our closest friends and allies abandon
us regularly,'' Gejdenson said. ''In virtually every country in the
region ... there are editorials attacking us for sustaining the
embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's ''highly unlikely'' that the Iraqi National Congress,
an opposition group supported financially by the United States
could ''lead a revolution to overthrow Saddam militarily,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have to do is figure out a policy that we can get
broad international support for,'' Gejdenson said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Link Gene to Diabetes  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A previously unknown gene appears to influence
the risk of developing diabetes, particularly in Mexican-Americans,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists called the work a landmark in the effort to find
genes involved in common illnesses such as heart disease and
schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   For diabetes, the work might lead to better prevention and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of diabetes among Hispanic adults in the United States
is nearly double that of white adults. Mexicans account for about
two-thirds of all Hispanics in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on type 2 diabetes, the most common kind,
which generally shows up in adults and affects about 15 million
Americans. If untreated, the disease can lead to blindness, kidney
failure, heart attacks, stroke and amputations.
</P>
<P>
   Other genes have been implicated before in type 2 diabetes. But
the newfound gene is from a class that had not been linked to
diabetes before, so it reveals a biological pathway to the disease
that scientists didn't know about.
</P>
<P>
   Further studies may provide insights that could lead to better
treatments, said Graeme Bell of the University of Chicago and the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Bell presented the study with
co-authors in the October issue of the journal Nature Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed, the finding might also help doctors identify
susceptible people who might be able to delay or avoid the disease
through exercise, weight control and perhaps other measures.
</P>
<P>
   The gene tells the body how to make a protein called calpain-10.
Such proteins cut other proteins, which either activates or
inactivates them.
</P>
<P>
   Like other genes, the calpain-10 gene comes in subtly different
forms. The research indicates a heightened risk of diabetes in
people who inherit one particular form from one parent and another
particular form from the other parent.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers calculated that this combination could roughly
triple the risk of diabetes. They estimated that it played a role
in 14 percent of cases in a sample of Mexican-Americans from Texas,
but only 4 percent of cases in a European sample from Finland and
Germany. The combination was less common in this European sample.
</P>
<P>
   Experts called the study important, but some said the
statistical evidence does not prove the gene really affects the
risk of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an open-and-shut case,'' said geneticist Leonid
Kruglyak of the Fred Hutchison Cancer Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steve Elbein, who studies diabetes genetics at the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, called
the statistical results ''really quite convincing. These
investigators have done nearly everything that one can do to prove
this gene alters diabetes risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the study conclusion is puzzling from a biological point
of view for a variety of reasons, Elbein said, and ''I have a hard
time judging the biological importance of these data.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruglyak called the work groundbreaking in terms of the more
general challenge of finding susceptibility genes for common
disorders like diabetes, heart disease or schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   These genes are hard to find because their effect is so subtle;
rather than causing disease outright, they merely tip the scale of
susceptibility. And different people can be affected by different
susceptibility genes.
</P>
<P>
   Bell and colleagues used a technique called ''positional
cloning.'' It relies on statistical analysis and landmarks along
chromosomes to zero in on target genes, without any prior knowledge
about what the genes normally do.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, this technique hasn't identified any genes that
make people more susceptible to common forms of widespread,
genetically complex disorders, Kruglyak said. The researchers in
the latest study have at least come closer than other scientists to
identifying a gene with this technique, he said.

<HEADLINE> Family Research Names President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Family Research Council Tuesday named
Florida lawyer Kenneth L. Connor as president. He will succeed
former GOP presidential hopeful Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer stepped down last year from the conservative policy group,
which came to rival the Christian Coalition as the voice of
grass-roots conservative activism in American politics under his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Chief Executive Charles Donovan has assumed Bauer's
duties until Connor's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Connor, a Tallahassee lawyer, has been active in Florida on
issues such as nursing home reform, adoption and corrections
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt this really represented an extraordinary opportunity to
influence the public conversation and thinking hopefully on a
number of issues that are of import to me,'' he said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   He said the council will continue to speak out against abortion
while pushing for tax relief. He also plans to focus on adoption,
care of the elderly and judicial activism.
</P>
<P>
   The council made news last week when it posted an article on its
Web site that said allowing a Hindu priest to give the opening
prayer in Congress was another indication that the nation is
drifting from its Judeo-Christian roots.
</P>
<P>
   The Founding Fathers, the article said, ''would have found
utterly incredible the idea that all religions, including paganism,
be treated with equal deference.''
</P>
<P>
   The council later pulled the article from its Web site and
issued a statement clarifying its position.
</P>
<P>
   ''We affirm the truth of Christianity, but it is not our
position that America's Constitution forbids representatives of
religions other than Christianity from praying before Congress,''
Donovan said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Pans Amtrak 'Blank Check'  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain panned a plan that would give
Amtrak a ''multibillion-dollar blank check'' even though the
railway is under orders to become independent from federal
operating subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican, chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, led a highly critical oversight hearing Tuesday that
painted a sobering portrait of Amtrak's financial status and
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amtrak is largely no better off today than one year ago,''
said Phyllis Scheinberg, associate director for transportation
issues at the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   Both Scheinberg and Kenneth Mead, inspector general in the
Department of Transportation, said Amtrak is not on track to meet
congressional demands that it achieve financial self-sufficiency by
2003. Amtrak could face liquidation if it fails to meet the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Mead forecasts that Amtrak will lose $1.4 billion more than it
anticipates from 2000 through 2004 because rising costs are
counteracting gains in riders and revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The ''blank check'' derided by McCain is a measure that comes
before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday. It would let
Amtrak issue bonds, sweetened by federal tax credits, to raise $10
billion over 10 years to build high-speed rail lines around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak advocates say the money represents an investment in
intercity rail that should be considered independent of Amtrak's
future as a corporation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain disagreed. ''Amtrak needs to make more progress before
any further funding schemes are enacted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from McCain, Mead said $10 billion will not
come near to covering the cost of building the eight to 11 proposed
high-speed rail corridors. He estimated the price tag will be at
least twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's hearing was a dramatic departure from the last time
Amtrak's fate was considered by Commerce Committee members.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a subcommittee led by Amtrak supporter Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, endorsed the railway's plan to expand
rather than cut service as the route to fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchison and pro-Amtrak Democrats Max Cleland of Georgia
and John Kerry of Massachusetts had to settle for supporting roles
Tuesday as McCain offered an unflattering history lesson about
Amtrak, which runs two routes that cross Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created Amtrak in 1971 from a collection of failing
passenger railroads. The promise, McCain said, was that Amtrak
would be self-sufficient after two years of federal operating
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is now in its 29th year of subsidies and has consumed
more than $23 billion in federal operating support.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am now embarrassed to admit that I worked to create
Amtrak,'' Joseph Vranich, a former Amtrak spokesman turned critic,
told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave Amtrak in 1997 an infusion of aid along with a
2003 deadline to become self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak Chairman Tommy Thompson, Wisconsin's governor, told the
committee the railway will meet the deadline. He said Amtrak's
governing board met last week and addressed much of the criticism
in Mead's audit.
</P>
<P>
   ''For much of Amtrak's history, it was not run like a
business,'' Thompson said. ''It did not have an entrepreneurial
focus. It did lack a serious business plan. But in recent years we
have made remarkable progress in turning Amtrak around.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, Mead and Scheinberg agreed that, even if Amtrak weans
itself from federal operating subsidies by 2003, it will need
significant continuing federal support for capital expenses like
track repair. Mead put the number at $500 million to $700 million
per year.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak President George Warrington told the committee that the
railway expects delivery next week of the first of 20 high-speed
trains for the Boston-to-Washington Northeast Corridor.
</P>
<P>
   The long-delayed Acela Express service, which will reach speeds
of 150 mph, will begin running ''within a month,'' Warrington said.

<HEADLINE> Preschool official says 'There were two mothers.'  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A nursery school director, testifying
in a child-visitation dispute between two lesbians, said Tuesday
that when they enrolled their little boy, they made clear ''there
were two mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the director was called as a witness by the biological
mother, Christine, her testimony appeared to aid the ex-lover,
Janis, who is seeking what could be a landmark ruling granting
visitation with two children she helped raise but to whom she has
no legal link.
</P>
<P>
   The women's last names have not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   The school director also seemed to help Janis' case when she
said Janis was not on the school's list of ''emergency contacts,''
but rather was listed ''as a parent.'' Janis was the family's
principal wage-earner while Christine stayed at home and usually
brought the boy, now 4, to school.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Janis testified that her relationship with the boy and
a 2-year-old girl, both born to Christine after artificial
insemination, ''started when they took their first breath'' and was
interrupted only when Christine took the children and left Janis'
house in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Janis said it was she who worked to develop the children's'
interest in the outdoors, the arts and travel. She said her
extended family had been a part of the children's lives. And she
said that in the mornings, the kids ''were in the bathroom with me
while we were getting dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy, she said, ''called me mama.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Did you have plans for the children?'' asked her lawyer, Joan
Iacono.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still do,'' Janis said, adding that her will includes a
bequest to Christine and the kids. ''I want them to dream big.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she could still be a friend to Christine ''for the sake
of the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Janis occasionally stood during her testimony because of
discomfort from two broken legs and a broken pelvis suffered when
she was hit by a car last month.
</P>
<P>
   Christine's lawyer, Carolyn Mann, asked Janis about a dog bite
suffered by the boy while in Janis' care and about Janis' own
medical problems. When Janis said she was in the process of
adopting the children at the time of the breakup, Mann asked her,
''If they're your children, why would you have to adopt them?''
</P>
<P>
   The court session started with a dispute over Christine's
refusal to let a psychiatrist see the children interact with Janis.
Westchester Family Court Judge Joan Cooney told Mann that unless
the doctor was allowed to observe the children and Janis together,
the judge would assume, in considering her ruling, that the
children would have reacted positively to Janis' presence. The
doctor is scheduled to testify Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said that decision may be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Cooney granted Janis temporary visitation rights -
every other Sunday - pending her ruling on permanent visitation.
The ruling, apparently the first of its kind in the state, was
stayed by an appeals judge in Brooklyn. The full appeals court has
yet to rule on temporary visitation, but the trial over permanent
visitation is going ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Other New York courts have ruled that lesbian ex-partners are
not entitled to visitation rights with children with whom they have
no biological tie. Last November, without setting a precedent, the
U.S. Supreme Court let stand a Massachusetts ruling that said a
lesbian who helped her partner raise a son had become a ''de
facto'' parent entitled to visitation rights.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court on Tuesday, Mann said New York law is clear about
who has and who doesn't have parental rights. ''Some laws leave
judges room to interpret and some don't,'' she said. ''This one
doesn't.''

<HEADLINE> SUNY enrollment of full-time students is up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The State University of New York reported
Tuesday that its full-time graduate enrollment of more than 18,000
was a record high while this fall's freshman class is its largest
in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60,000 full-time freshmen entered the SUNY system this
fall, preliminary enrollment figures showed. Overall, full-time
enrollment of 373,000 students was a 2 percent increase from last
fall and the university system's largest since 1995, administrators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A good deal of (the increase) goes to the campuses, which do a
good job of marketing themselves,'' SUNY spokesman Dave Henahan
said. ''They're letting New Yorkers know about the quality of
education we offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30 SUNY community colleges reported enrollment increases of
3,590 students, with the number of freshmen going up by 863. Among
the campuses reporting freshmen enrollment increases of 30 percent
or more were: North Country (37 percent), Hudson Valley (31
percent) and Corning (30 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment at SUNY's four university ''centers'' at Buffalo,
Binghamton, Albany and Stony Brook and the rest of its campuses
went up by 1,900 students to 192,646 this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Campuses reporting double-digit growths included: College of
Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse (40 percent),
Brockport (16 percent), Plattsburgh (11 percent) and Farmingdale
(11 percent).
</P>
<P>
   SUNY administrators said they would have final student
enrollment figures in the next few weeks when reports are complete
on the number of part-time students signing up for classes this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY operates 64 campuses, including 30 community colleges.

<HEADLINE> Another DWI arrest comes to light after county lawmaker is sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Erie County Legislator Michael Fitzpatrick
was arrested on drunken driving charges in New Orleans in February,
two weeks before his arrest on similar charges in suburban Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The two arrests this year brought to four the number of times
Fitzpatrick has been arrested on drunken driving charges in the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old lawmaker, who was sentenced last week on a
lesser charge of driving while impaired in the town of Evans,
denies he was driving the rented Lincoln Town Car that was found in
a ditch in New Orleans. The case is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Evans Town Justice Anthony Barone Jr. said he knew about the New
Orleans arrest while presiding over the Evans case, but did not
consider it because there has been no resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick was sentenced to four weekends in jail, fined $800
and his license was suspended for six months after his conviction
in the incident near his Evans home Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark said his office did
not know about the New Orleans arrest at the time of the trial in
western New York, but that it would not have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''An out-of-state matter has no effect on what we do here,''
Clark told The Buffalo News. ''It's still what it was - with that
arrest or without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Obad, president of the local chapter of Mothers
against Drunk Driving, said news of the New Orleans arrest adds to
the outrage of MADD members, who said the sentence was too light.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many chances is this man going to have?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick, an official in the International Iron Workers
Union, told the newspaper he was in New Orleans on union business
and was driving with a union friend when the accident took place.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick said that his friend, who was driving, left the
scene but that he waited with the damaged car for a tow truck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told the policemen I wasn't driving,'' Fitzpatrick said. ''I
just stayed with the car because it was being towed. We were going
out (to the airport) to pick up my daughter and my friend made a
wrong turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Police reports indicate Fitzpatrick gave a different version to
police at the scene. He said at the time his daughter had been
driving, but his daughter was not there. He said he had called her
a taxi and that she had left. Police said Fitzpatrick did not have
a phone with him and had no access to a phone.
</P>
<P>
   A security guard who saw the accident and called police told
officers he had seen Fitzpatrick drive the car into the ditch and
climb out of the driver's side door.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, Fitzpatrick told officers at the
scene: ''You didn't catch me in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   A breath test showed Fitzpatrick had a blood-alcohol content of
more than 0.2 percent, well over the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans charges of driving under the influence and
careless operation of a motor vehicle are still pending.

<HEADLINE> Cop Defends White House Aides Stop  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Maryland police chief on Tuesday defended
the way his officers handled a recent traffic stop involving two
black White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 6, Bob Nash, director of the White House office of
Presidential Personnel, and his wife, Janice Kearney, President
Clinton's personal historian, were stopped, 43 minutes after police
received a report of an armed carjacking in Wheaton, Md., north of
the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made a felony stop, which is different from a routine
traffic stop,'' Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose said
during an appearance on a radio call-in program.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not racial profiling,'' Moose said.
</P>
<P>
   At least six officers with guns drawn, including one armed with
a shotgun, took part in what Moose described as a ''high-risk
traffic stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash was handcuffed, ordered to walk backward inside of a cordon
of police cars, and searched. Kearney was ordered to remain in the
car while police checked her husband's identification.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred just five days after Montgomery County
Police began recording race, ethnicity and gender for all traffic
stops. The new program was part of a settlement with the U.S.
Department of Justice to end a three-year investigation of racial
profiling allegations made by the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's blue 1997 Infiniti sport utility vehicle was not the 1998
black Infiniti sport utility vehicle police were searching for,
although both vehicles had temporary license tags.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that was ever profiled in this incident was the
car,'' said Capt. William O'Toole, a department spokesman. An
officer who observed Nash's vehicle heading south toward the
District reported seeing a dark sport utility vehicle. Officers
blocked northbound traffic on Georgia Avenue so the vehicle could
be stopped in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ''We explained our actions well, we gave our names and we
apologized,'' said O'Toole, adding that the encounter lasted eight
minutes. The stolen vehicle has not been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Police provided transcripts of the computer-aided dispatch
records to allay any concerns Nash or Kearney may have had that
their treatment was racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Nash has had at least two conversations with Montgomery County
police since the incident, including one with Moose, who helped
develop anti-racial profiling measures as chief of the Portland,
Ore. police department. He has implemented similar policies since
arriving in Montgomery County last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nash and Kearney have declined requests for interviews.

<HEADLINE> Second 'Survivor' Airing Flops  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television viewers have passed on a return trip
to Pulau Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' plan to capitalize on the huge interest in ''Survivor'' by
quickly rerunning the series has largely been a bust, with the show
attracting a fraction of its original viewers in competition with
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Viewership for the six episodes aired last week ranged from 4.3
million to 6.1 million, Nielsen Media Research said on Tuesday.
Original episodes routinely drew more than 20 million viewers, and
51 million people watched the conclusion on Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   To put last week's showing in perspective: none of the six
''Survivor'' episodes had a bigger audience than a ''King of the
Hill'' rerun on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was too soon,'' said Stacey Lynn Koerner, a television
analyst for TN Media.
</P>
<P>
   With the mystery of who survives solved, people were more
interested in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokesman Chris Ender said the expectations were modest.
''We don't think in any way it affects viewers' appetites for
'Survivor II,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second series will begin after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With the week dominated by Olympic coverage, NBC averaged 25.4
million viewers in prime-time (16.1 rating, 26 share). The Olympics
have performed relatively poorly in the ratings, but rebounded on
Sunday with nearly 26 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, a distant second, earned a silver medal for the week with
9.8 million viewers (6.8 rating, 11 share), CBS had 7.6 million
viewers (5.5, 9), Fox also had 7.6 million viewers (5.0, 8), UPN
had 3.4 million (2.3, 4), the WB had 2.6 million (1.9, 3) and Pax
TV had 1.2 million (1.0, 2).
</P>
<P>
   With the elections nearing, the evening news ratings race is
tightening up. NBC's ''Nightly News'' had 9.4 million viewers to
9.1 million viewers for ABC's ''World News Tonight.'' But the ABC
broadcast, with a 7.0 rating and 15 share, actually outdid NBC's
6.9 rating and 15 share, indicating more people were watching ABC
alone in their homes. The ''CBS Evening News'' had 8.2 million
viewers (6.4 rating, 13 share).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,022,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 102.2 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of Sept. 18-24, the top 10 shows, their networks
and ratings: ''Summer Olympics'' (Sunday), NBC, 16.1; ''Summer
Olympics'' (Tuesday), NBC, 15.5; ''Summer Olympics'' (Friday), NBC,
15.0; ''Summer Olympics'' (Thursday), NBC, 14.9; ''Summer
Olympics'' (Wednesday), NBC, 14.6; ''Summer Olympics'' (Monday),
NBC, 13.8; ''NFL Monday Night Football: Dallas at Washington,''
ABC, 13.5; ''Summer Olympics'' (Saturday), NBC, 13.5; ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 12.4; ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 10.6.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear 'English Only' Case  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By tackling an ''English only'' dispute from
Alabama, the Supreme Court set the stage Tuesday for an important
ruling on a federal law that bans discrimination based on national
origin.
</P>
<P>
   The justices agreed to decide whether private citizens can
invoke the law, aimed at fighting bias in all federally funded
programs. Their decision is expected by June, after arguments are
heard in January.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 states in recent years have designated English as
the official state language, but many of the laws appear to be
symbolic and do not restrict government use of other languages.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the Alabama case is the state's invalidated policy
of offering written driver's license tests only in English.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts said the policy violated the federal anti-bias law
and ordered the state to offer the tests in other languages as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama offered its written driver's license test in numerous
foreign languages for two decades, until 1991. The state Department
of Public Safety changed its policy about a year after Alabama
voters added an English-only amendment to the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment declared English the state's official language and
instructed state officials to ''take all steps necessary'' to
preserve and enhance ''the role of English as the common
language.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery, Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor said the case
is a question of states' rights. ''This case presents important
legal issues of federal intrusion into state affairs which need to
be resolved,'' Pryor said in a statement. ''I am pleased that the
U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to consider our arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the Hispanic woman who brought the case after
failing to pass an English-language test predicted the high court
would uphold a citizen's right to sue. Any other decision, said
Rhonda Brownstein of the Southern Poverty Law Center, would upset
legal precedents, which she said the court never has done in
similar cases.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Sandoval, a permanent resident alien from Mexico who
lives in Mobile, Ala., sued the state Department of Public Safety
in 1996. Her lawsuit alleged that the English-only policy violated
a federal law known as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The law bars discrimination based on, among other things,
national origin by any program that receives federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's Department of Public Safety receives more than $1
million each year from the federal Department of Transportation and
Justice Department -- for such things as overtime pay for troopers
and hostage-rescue training.
</P>
<P>
   In Sandoval's lawsuit, a federal trial judge was told that about
13,000 Alabama residents would have difficulty obtaining a state
driver's license because of the department's English-only policy.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the policy would result in a ''disparate impact
on the basis of national origin'' in violation of the federal law,
and ordered the state to offer tests in other languages. The 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last November.
</P>
<P>
   Both lower courts rejected state officials' arguments that the
1964 law does not allow lawsuits by private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   All the federal appeals courts that have studied that issue have
reached the same conclusion, but the Supreme Court has never
definitively decided whether such a ''private right of action''
exists under Title VI.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Alexander v. Sandoval, 99-1908.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman calls Bush plan 'real problem' for seniors  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION, N.J. (AP) - Joseph Lieberman took a swipe at George W.
Bush's claim that he offers ''real plans for real people,'' telling
senior citizens Tuesday that Bush's Medicare package is ''a real
problem for real seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lieberman's decision to run for the vice presidency
and for Senate re-election at the same time prompted criticism from
Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, who said
it showed a lack of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman aides denied that. Spokeswoman Kiki McLean said,
''He's committed, optimistic, and proud'' of his vice presidential
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to some 300 senior citizens at the Union Township
Senior Center, Lieberman said that with the prices of prescription
drugs increasing and the number of baby boomers entering the
Medicare system expected to skyrocket, ''that's not just a price
crisis in my opinion. It is a prescription for a humanitarian
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Often referring to his 85-year-old mother, Marcia, Lieberman
said he and Vice President Al Gore would protect Medicare, the
federal health care program serving 39 million elderly and disabled
Americans, by putting its $360 billion surplus in a ''lock box'' so
that politicians could not use the money for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important adviser that I've had on this issue, the
one person who repeatedly will never let me forget how important it
is, is my ... mother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida on Monday, Gore distributed ''Medicare at the
Crossroads,'' a booklet that included new details on how he would
stabilize HMO participation in Medicare so that older Americans
choosing managed care over the traditional Medicare fee-for-service
plan would have reliable coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The $198 billion Medicare plan of Republican presidential
candidate Bush would give states $48 billion to provide
prescription drug coverage while he implements a market-based
approach on the national level.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Tuesday that Bush's plan would leave millions of
seniors ''to fend for themselves'' in trying to find an HMO.
''That's not a real plan. That's a real problem for real seniors,''
he said, mocking a Bush slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hoped Lieberman's appearance before seniors and later,
before union bricklayers in Atlantic City would help solidify the
Democratic lead in New Jersey. The state, with 15 electoral votes,
favors the Gore-Lieberman ticket, according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   He also attended a $500,000 fund-raiser in New Jersey for the
Democratic National Committee. He had two others later in New York
that were expected to raise $1.5 million. One was at the home of
Revlon Chairman Ronald Perelman and his wife, actress Ellen Barkin.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman's campaign plane, which was to fly from Teterboro
Airport in northern New Jersey to Atlantic City, never got off the
ground. A spokeswoman said mechanics decided to ground the plane,
''The Spirit,'' until further notice after finding that an engine
was burning oil.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and a few staffers took a private jet to Atlantic City
while the reporters who travel with him were rerouted by bus to New
York to meet up with him later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lieberman took a side trip from the vice presidential
campaign to his home state of Connecticut, where he is also seeking
re-election to the Senate for a third term. That shows a lack of
confidence in the national campaign, Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Otherwise he wouldn't be working so hard to hang onto his day
job,'' Cheney told a radio interviewer in Traverse City, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, state law allows the incumbent to compete for
both offices at the same time. If Lieberman wins both the Senate
and the vice presidency, Republican Gov. John G. Rowland would
choose his interim replacement.

<HEADLINE> N.J. weighs helmet laws for kickboard scooters  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Prompted by the death of a 6-year-old boy
who was killed when he rode his kickboard scooter into traffic, New
Jersey and several local governments plan to enact laws requiring
children to wear protective helmets while using the scooters.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Pino was riding one of the popular scooters last Thursday
when he was struck by a car outside his Elizabeth home, suffering
severe head injuries. He died the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Elizabeth City Council already had been
considering a law requiring children under the age of 14 who ride
scooters to wear protective helmets - the same requirement that has
applied to young bicycle riders for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the council discussed extending the helmet law to
cover scooter riders, said 3rd Ward Councilman Robert Jaspan, in
whose district the accident occurred
</P>
<P>
   ''Council thought it was a great idea, and that we should
proceed with it,'' he said. ''This was just a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth's law is expected to be introduced in two weeks,
Jaspan said. Medford Township in Burlington County introduced a
similar law earlier this month, and Jefferson Township in Morris
County is considering one as well.
</P>
<P>
   And a state lawmaker has drafted legislation to make the helmet
law a statewide requirement. Assemblyman Gary Guear (D-Mercer)
plans to introduce a bill calling for $25 fines for the parents of
children under age 14 who don't wear helmets while riding scooters.
They can avoid paying the fine if they come to court with proof
that they've bought a helmet after receiving the summons, he said.
A second offense would result in a $100 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not looking to fine people or make money off this,''
Guear said. ''We want to make parents aware of the need for these
helmets.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has required helmets for young bicycle riders since
1991, and added in-line skates to the law in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we have collapsible scooters, and the potential for severe
head trauma and even death is real,'' he said. Pino's death is
believed to be the first scooter-related death in New Jersey, and
the second nationwide, Guear said.
</P>
<P>
   A father in Richmond, Va., who was trying to teach his daughter
how to ride one of the scooters died earlier this month when he
fell and struck his head.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recently issued a
report on scooter injuries, noting that almost 90 percent of the
11,300 injuries reported so far this year involved children under
the age of 15. There were more than 5,900 scooter-related injuries
requiring emergency room visits in August alone.
</P>
<P>
   The organization recommends kids wear helmets and knee and elbow
pads while riding the scooters, and advises that children under the
age of 8 not ride them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids younger than 8 really don't have the dexterity and the
skills to handle them,'' spokesman Russ Rader said. He said the
commission is unaware of any states that have extended helmet laws
to cover scooters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael Cerra, a spokesman for the New Jersey State League of
Municipalities, said few, if any, local governments have adopted
laws requiring helmet use for scooter riders because the fad is so
new.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw those scooters all over the place this summer,'' he
said. ''There wasn't a perceived need for them before. What
happened in Elizabeth has crystallized some concerns.''

<HEADLINE> BPU to hold additional public hearing in Verizon case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The Board of Public Utilities has scheduled
a third public hearing to hear comments on Verizon Communications'
proposal to raise its basic telephone rates.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing will be Oct. 18 at 1 p.m. in the Marlboro Township
Administration building.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens and consumer advocates complained at hearings
over the past week in Newark and Trenton that the two hearings were
not publicized enough and, for senior citizens, held too late in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon has proposed raising its basic telephone rate from $8.19
a month to as much as $17.50 a month. The new price would include
three premium services like call waiting and caller ID. The company
has also asked the BPU to declare New Jersey a competitive
telephone market.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon contends the rate increases are long overdue because it
costs the company much more than $8.19 a month to provide the basic
telephone service, and says the increases will foster competition
for rivals who say they can't afford to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the new rates will provide consumers with
expensive premium services they don't need.

<HEADLINE> Fund Raising Helping House Races  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Strong fund-raising has improved the chances
of several candidates of both parties in this fall's House races.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky's 3rd District, state Rep. Eleanor Jordan has raised
$938,559 in her bid to oust GOP Rep. Anne Northup, according to
Federal Election Commission figures released Tuesday. In
Minnesota's 1st District, incumbent Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht's
chances of keeping his seat improved as he outraised Democratic
challenger Mary Rieder by a 3-1 margin. In Kansas' 3rd District,
Democratic Rep. Dennis Moore raised $1.1 million through June 30 --
more than he raised for his entire 1998 campaign -- and is favored
to be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the money rolls in, you become a more viable candidate,''
said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for
Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that studies campaign
finance. ''That's the unfortunate reality we're faced with this
year. That's why candidates are pursing the funders with even
greater vigor than they're pursing the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, this fund-raising prowess has made the road to
re-election a lot smoother than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Rep. Ken Lucas, D-Ky., representing a district that had
been in Republican hands for 32 years before his win in 1998,
should have been a top GOP target. Instead, he's strongly favored
to win re-election. Lucas raised $761,142 through June 30;
Republican challenger Don Bell raised $24,240.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., raised $1.4 million for
her re-election through June 30, and is favored to defeat Democrat
John Kelly, who raised less than half that.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, California state Sen. Adam Schiff raised $2.9
million through June 30 -- more than any other challenger -- in his
race against GOP Rep. Jim Rogan, one of the lawmakers who presented
the case for impeaching President Clinton to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan raised $4.6 million, second only to the $5.6 million
reported by Democrat Jim Humphreys, running for an open House seat
in West Virginia. But $5 million of Humphreys' total came from his
own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong Democratic challenger, state Rep. Elaine Bloom of
Florida, raised $1.5 million through June 30 -- more than her
Republican opponent, Rep. Clay Shaw, who took in $1.4 million. In
California, Democratic challengers Jane Harman, a former U.S.
representative trying to regain her House seat, and Susan Davis, a
state representative, have outraised the Republican incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, former GOP Rep. Dick Zimmer of New
Jersey, trying to regain his former House seat, raised $1.4 million
through June 30, keeping pace with Democratic incumbent Rush Holt,
who raised $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   And Ohio state Rep. Pat Tiberi has raised almost twice as much
as Columbus City Council member Maryellen O'Shaughnessy in the race
for the House seat being vacated by retiring Rep. John Kasich.
Tiberi raised $1.6 million through June 30, to $856,182 for
O'Shaughnessy.
</P>
<P>
   National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Jim
Wilkinson said he expected candidates in competitive races to have
little trouble raising money through Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we've known all along is any candidate who's in a close
race this year will have all the money they want,'' Wilkinson said.
''These races will come down to who controls message, money and
organization in the month of October.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman John Del
Cecato argued that the money raised by several of his party's
candidates have made their races more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why the political landscape has shifted so dramatically
in our favor,'' Del Cecato said. ''Many Democratic candidates who
were not viewed by Republican incumbents as major threats in 1999
are now seen as top-tier challengers who have the ways and means to
win on Nov. 7.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate side, Democrat Jon Corzine of New Jersey reported
receipts of $35.7 million -- $33 million from his own pocket --
setting a new record for campaign fund raising. The old record was
$30 million by self-financed Republican candidate Michael
Huffington, who ran for a Senate seat in California in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Subway push victim testifies at assailant's trial  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Edgar Rivera said Tuesday that his first memory
after being pushed into the path of an oncoming subway train in
Manhattan is that he woke up in a hospital bed with no legs.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, 37, seemed in good spirits while testifying at the
attempted murder trial of the man who shoved him - until Assistant
District Attorney Peter Casolaro asked him the first thing he
remembered after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's eyes filled with tears and he stopped speaking. After
drinking a cup of water and taking a moment to compose himself,
Rivera replied, ''I remember at some point waking up and slowly
coming to realize that I no longer have legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where were you?'' Casolaro asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a wheelchair, Rivera testified that he remained in a
hospital for about three months and he believes doctors performed
three operations on him. He said he is currently working with a
prosthetics company learning to use artificial legs.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said he has no memory of the push, of his legs being cut
off, or of Julio Perez, the 44-year-old former mental patient
charged with trying to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is accused of shoving the father of three onto the
northbound tracks of the station at 51st Street and Lexington
Avenue on April 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, who was working as a messenger the day his life changed,
said he had a specific spot where he waited everyday after work for
the train to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   He was in his usual place when Perez, lurking behind him, sprang
forward, shoving him ''in a deliberate attempt to kill Mr.
Rivera,'' Casolaro told the jury Monday when the trial opened.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said they heard Rivera scream, ''Oh, my God!'' after
he was pushed, and subway motorman Timothy Quigley testified
watching Rivera make a desperate dive to escape death as the train
bore down on him.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said that when he climbed down from the train, he saw
Rivera's legless torso slumped in a crawl space under the passenger
platform. He said he believed Rivera was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera lost both legs and suffered a serious head injury.
Doctors said it was a miracle that he survived.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you remember anything of what happened?'' Casolaro asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't,'' Rivera replied.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Stephanie Kaplan admits that Perez pushed Rivera
but says he did it because he is severely mentally ill. During a
brief, gentle cross-examination of Rivera, she tried to elicit
testimony to make that point.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question from Kaplan, Rivera said he and Perez
had never met. He also told her that he had filed lawsuits against
doctors and hospitals that Perez had visited for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice James Yates granted a request that
allowed Rivera to hear the psychiatric testimony about Perez. Yates
explained that witnesses usually are not allowed to hear other
witnesses but he would make a limited exception for Rivera.

<HEADLINE> Census: Poverty Lowest in 21 Years  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The poverty rate in America dipped last year
to 11.8 percent, the lowest point in 21 years, while median
household incomes reached a record high, new Census Bureau data
showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 32.2 million Americans lived in poverty, down from
34.4 million, or 12.7 percent, the previous year, according to the
agency's annual reports on income and poverty. The all-time low
poverty rate was 11.1 percent in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the percentage of children in poverty fell to 16.9
percent, also the lowest figure since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting for inflation, the median household income level rose
2.7 percent to $40,816 last year, a record high since the Census
Bureau began collecting the data in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   With six weeks before the election, both Democrats and
Republicans were quick to take credit for the good news.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called it ''another economic milestone'' for
the administration, while House GOP leaders cited their own
leadership on passing welfare reform as the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''God bless the economy,'' said Tim Smeeding, professor of
economics and public policy at Syracuse University. ''Overall, this
is the best report I've seen in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Others stressed that more work needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern is that there not be a view out there that poverty
has been eradicated,'' said Debra Roth, spokeswoman for the
National Association of Community Action Agencies. ''Our main
concern is how many people who have climbed out of poverty who work
two or three jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The average poverty threshold for a family of four in 1999 was
$17,029 in annual income; for a family of three, it was $13,290.
Therefore, a family making less than those amounts would be
considered in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Every racial and ethnic group experienced a drop in both the
number of poor and the percent in poverty, as did children, the
elderly and people ages 25 to 44, said Census Bureau analyst Daniel
Weinberg.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate for Americans age 18 and under declined 2
percent between 1998 and 1999 to 16.9 percent. The poverty rate for
Americans 65 and older decreased from 10.5 percent to a record-low
9.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Except for whites, the poverty rates for the nation's major
racial and ethnic groups set or equaled historic lows, the Census
Bureau said:
</P>
<P>
   --African-Americans, 23.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Hispanics (can be of any race), 22.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Asian and Pacific Islanders, 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Non-Hispanic whites, 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The median household incomes among the major racial and ethnic
groups were:
</P>
<P>
   --African-Americans, $27,910.
</P>
<P>
   --Hispanics, $30,735.
</P>
<P>
   --Asian and Pacific Islanders, $51,205.
</P>
<P>
   --Non-Hispanic whites, $44,366.
</P>
<P>
   Median income was also up in central cities, areas that in
general have experienced the slowest growth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Within central cities, median income rose 5 percent to $35,573
from 1998 to 1999. In metropolitan areas, median income rose 2.1
percent to $42,785. Median income for households in suburbs and
outside metropolitan areas remained statistically unchanged from
1998 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Declines in poverty were concentrated in metropolitan areas,
particularly central cities. And, on the income side, this was the
fifth consecutive year that households experienced a real annual
increase in income,'' said Weinberg of the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good day for America,'' Clinton said, addressing
staffers of the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of
Economic Advisers. ''We have proved that we can lift all boats in a
modern, global, information-based economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., a member of the House Ways and
Means Committee: ''These exciting developments are the direct
result of the welfare reform law Republicans wrote and finally
pushed into law in 1996.'' He said that without welfare reform,
there would be ''more children in poverty and more adults getting a
welfare check instead of a paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Though median income went up across all classes, advocates
voiced concern that the gap between the rich and poor was growing
larger. The top 20 percent of earners accounted for 49.4 percent of
total income in 1999, up 0.2 percent from the previous year. The
top 5 percent of earners accounted for 21.5 percent of total
income, up 0.1 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rich are getting richer, but the poor are getting richer,
too,'' Smeeding said.

<HEADLINE> Reform, Green party candidates upset they were shut out of TV debate </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Independent candidates for U.S. Senate are
unhappy with the state chapter of the League of Women Voters for
excluding them from the only network television debate scheduled so
far in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   League executive director Patricia Tieman said her group has
criteria for selecting candidates for its debates, and neither
Reform Party candidate Pat DiNizio nor Green Party candidate Bruce
Afran has met them.
</P>
<P>
   The League has scheduled a debate between Republican Bob Franks
and Democrat Jon Corzine for Oct. 20. It will be taped and then
broadcast Oct. 22 on ABC-TV affiliates in New York and
Philadelphia. It is the only network TV debate of the fall campaign
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Other debates have been set up on News 12 New Jersey, a cable TV
network, and on New Jersey Network Public television, both also
with just Franks and Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Afran criticized the League for
not even contacting him for information to show his legitimacy as a
candidate. ''A third voice must be heard in these debates,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   DiNizio said the League is biased against his party because it
has a liberal agenda. ''I have the support and endorsement of
(Minnesota) Gov. Jesse Ventura and the independent party as well as
well as the Natural Law Party of John Hagelin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tieman said all 10 independent candidates who filed
petitions with the state Division of Elections were evaluated for
inclusion in the Oct. 20 debate. The criteria say candidates must
represent parties that attracted 5 percent of the vote in the
previous general election, or they must show they have raised 5
percent of the money spent by the previous winning candidate. The
League also wanted to see establishment of campaign offices,
phones, staff and events.
</P>
<P>
   No third parties met the League's minimum standard during the
1999 election, when only county officers and the 80 members of the
state Assembly were on the ballot. As for money, the rule as
applied this year would require a candidate to raise more than
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it just proves that there is consistency in the party,
consistency in their running candidates,'' Tieman said. ''We do let
everybody in a lot of our debates. It is just not the televised
debate, which is what they focused on.''
</P>
<P>
   Afran and DiNizio both said they found the money requirement
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   DiNizio said his entire candidacy is about rejecting the
dependence of politics on cash. ''I find it unconscionable to have
to ask these people for money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Afran said he is running to broadcast the corrupting influence
of money on political campaigns, and he intends to spend $10,000 to
$50,000 at most.
</P>
<P>
   Tieman said the League has organized debates for decades and has
found it useful to stick to firm criteria to avoid accusations of
favoritism. As for the criticism, Tieman said, ''These things
happen, I guess, to us, and we just sort of roll with the
punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Afran is a noted civil-rights attorney based in Princeton.
DiNizio is the lead singer and songwriter of the rock band The
Smithereens.

<HEADLINE> Congress Moves on Two Health Plans  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Congress scrambling to complete
last-minute legislation, momentum gathered Tuesday for two major
health proposals -- a measure to allow the reimportation of
U.S.-made drugs sold cheaper abroad, and a bill restoring Medicare
cuts made three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton endorsed both in a late-night letter Monday,
and Tuesday, Republican leaders said they have agreed to a version
of the reimportation measure. Also, the House Commerce Committee
Tuesday approved a $21 billion boost for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll continue to work on these and other issues,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said before a meeting
with GOP leaders on a number of health care issues.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas said of Clinton's
endorsement, ''We're enthusiastic about that. It was one thing we
can do. We're going to continue to work with the White House ...
(we) hope we can get them to accept that we must do something on a
wider scale than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement on the two issues comes as Republicans and
Democrats are gridlocked on their two major goals of the year --
passing a prescription drug benefit for seniors and a patients'
rights proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Clinton said he supported the Senate version of
the reimportation measure, which includes additional safeguards to
ensure the reimported drugs pose no health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though this initiative does not address seniors' most
important need -- meaningful insurance to cover the costs of
expensive medications -- it still has real potential to allow
consumers to access prescription drug discounts,'' Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, while not finalized, aims to allow pharmacists
and drug wholesale distributors to import American-made drugs sold
abroad for less than they cost in the United States. The Food and
Drug Administration would be required to certify that all
reimported drugs are safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is now attached to the Senate version of the
agriculture spending bill, which awaits approval by House and
Senate budget negotiators. There's been no movement on the farm
bill yet, however, because lawmakers are stalled over a proposal to
ease sanctions on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Still, congressional leaders are confident that the
reimportation measure would pass, and both Lott and Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill. said it would be written to include the Senate
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare bill aims to deal with cuts that were part of 1997
legislation to balance the federal budget. Hospitals and nursing
homes have threatened to shut down, saying they are now unable to
operate on the lower reimbursement levels from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the White House generally agree that there should
be some Medicare increase. Last year, Congress passed $16 billion
in additional Medicare money.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Committee's version, approved by a voice vote, is
estimated to cost $21 billion over five years. The tax-writing
House Ways and Means Committee is expected to pass its version of
the measure soon. The two versions likely will be joined before
going to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The agriculture spending bill is H.R. 4461. The Medicare bill,
known as the Beneficiary Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, is
H.R. 5291.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Milosevic Clearly Lost  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Tuesday it seems clear
that the opposition party defeated Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in weekend presidential elections ''despite government
attempts to manipulate the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the comment shortly before authorities in Belgrade
called a runoff election for Oct. 8 on grounds no clear winner
emerged from Sunday's balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, speaking to a business audience
in Chicago, said he is uneasy about a runoff, fearing it would give
Milosevic and his supporters ''more time to steal the election.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Election Commission in Belgrade announced that
opposition presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica finished first
the voting but without enough votes to avoid a runoff with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said Kostunica finished with 48.22 percent to
40.23 percent for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In a foreign policy speech at Georgetown University, Clinton
said the extent of Milosevic's will to retain his grip of power
cannot be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   But he said neither should the will of the Serbian people to
seek freedom in the face of violence and intimidation from
Milosivec's government be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the will of the people is respected, the doors to Europe
and the world will be open again to Serbia. We will take steps with
our allies to lift economic sanctions, and the people of Serbia,
who have suffered so much, finally will have a chance to lead
normal lives,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a ceremony to announce the university's new
international law center named after 1951 graduate Eric K. Hotung,
a former member of the center's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department responded in low-key fashion to the runoff
announcement, urging Milosevic to ''respect the will of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   It made no direct reference to the runoff. To do otherwise, an
official said, would make the United States the issue as the
election process in Yugoslavia unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have made clear over the last week that Milosevic would
commit fraud in these elections. We believe the official count
reflects manipulation and fraud,'' State Department spokesman
Charles Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a Senate committee
Tuesday that the authorities in Belgrade ''have used every trick in
the book to prevent a fair campaign, rig the election and distort
the results. In so doing, they have fooled no one.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly now, Milosevic is a figure of the past,'' Albright
said. ''For too long, his lawlessness has weakened Yugoslavia; his
cronies have robbed Yugoslavia; and his mismanagement has all but
bankrupted Yugoslavia.''

<HEADLINE> Dems Concede Defeat on Visas Bill  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats conceded defeat Tuesday on their
efforts to attach other immigration measures to a bill that both
parties have promised to the high-tech industry to let them have
more foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   But they vowed to sustain a presidential veto of one of the
spending bills that must be enacted before Congress adjourns if it
doesn't include grants of amnesty to more illegal immigrants and
offer permanent residency to more political refugees from Central
America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration fight has snarled votes for months in the Senate
and House on the broadly popular bill to provide more six-year
visas wanted by software and other high-tech firms that have become
major campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the
Senate and House minority leaders, said the appropriations bill for
the State, Justice and Commerce departments has become the new
vehicle of choice for the immigration measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''It serves as an exclamation point,'' Daschle said. ''This will
happen. As I've often said, we can do it the easy way or we can do
it the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three senators and 152 representatives signed a letter
urging a veto of the spending measure if it doesn't include the
immigration provisions. The figures are more than one-third votes
needed in one chamber or the other to sustain a veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's fair to say one of the hardest bills to sustain a
veto on is an appropriations bill,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Under present law, the government issued 115,000 H-1B visas this
year for skilled workers from abroad. That ceiling would fall to
107,500 in fiscal 2001 beginning Oct. 1, and to 65,000 a year after
that. The legislation would grant about 200,000 high-tech visas for
each of the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies contend that 300,000 jobs are going
unfilled for lack of qualified workers; labor unions argue the
companies want more immigrants to put downward pressure on the
wages of Americans holding the same jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials welcomed any action on the visa bill, even if
the prospects remain murky.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's encouraging because it's movement,'' said Thom Stohler,
director of workforce policy for the American Electronics
Association of major computer manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the immigration amendments would offer permanent
residence to political refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras and Haiti similar to that granted those from Cuba and
Nicaragua. Another would grant amnesty for illegal immigrants who
have lived in the United States since 1986. The current registry
deadline is 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The bills are S.2045, H.R. 3183 and H.R. 4227.

<HEADLINE> Convicted cop-killer admits to second killing  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A New Jersey man already serving life in prison
for the vicious murder of an off-duty New York City police officer
has admitted killing a pharmacist nearly 20 years ago in a case
that drew criticism from gay activists.
</P>
<P>
   The convict, Tony Francesehi, pleaded guilty Tuesday in state
Supreme Court in Brooklyn to manslaughter and burglary charges in
the slaying of Jan Schenley. He now will serve a sentence of 5 to
15 years simultaneously with his 25-year-to-life term - part of a
deal with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Francesehi, an acquaintance of Schenley, had long been a suspect
in the unsolved killing. But he was never charged with murder until
this week, prompting gay activists and Schenley's family to accuse
authorities of neglecting the case because the victim was gay.
</P>
<P>
   The nude body of Schenley, 38, was found gagged and handcuffed
to a pipe in the basement of his burglarized Brooklyn home in 1982.
Missing were the victim's collection of antique clocks and his car;
there were no signs of a break-in.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Justice Neil Firetog if he and an accomplice - his
cousin - caused the suffocation death of Schenley, Francesehi
replied, ''That's correct.'' The defendant showed no emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Both prosecutors and Francesehi's attorney, Sanford Talkin,
declined comment outside court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's sister, Laureen Schenley, said the plea, while not
giving Francesehi more prison time, should worsen his chances for
parole. It also will bring some peace to his family, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels like my brother finally had his day in court,'' she
said. ''Now when people ask about the case, I can say, 'Yes, the
person who did this has been convicted.'''
</P>
<P>
   The sister has maintained that Schenley was involved in a
volatile sexual relationship with Francesehi before the killing -
an allegation neither the prosecution or the defense will discuss.
Francesehi was married with children at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Brooklyn jury found Francesehi - a former truck
driver from Jackson, N.J., whose real name is Manuel Gonzales -
guilty of killing Officer Ronald Stapleton during a botched 1977
holdup in a parking lot outside a Sheepshead Bay bar. Prosecutors
said he and the same cousin, who has since died, jumped the
officer, gouged his eye out with a meat hook and then shot him with
his own gun.
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton, a 32-year-old father of two, remained hospitalized
for several weeks before dying. The murder investigation went cold
until an admitted mobster, Frank Gioia Jr., agreed to become a
government informant to avoid going to prison for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   A former soldier in the Luchese crime family, Gioia testified
that in a 1992 conversation Francesehi - in a bid to be included on
a hit team - bragged about the Stapleton slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators used that tip to locate the mother and brother of
the accomplice. According to police, the family said the cousin
confessed before his death to helping Francesehi kill both
Stapleton and Schenley.
</P>
<P>
   Francesehi has appealed the verdict in the Stapleton killing. If
the conviction is overturned, he would have the option to withdraw
his guilty plea in the Schenley case and go to trial.

<HEADLINE> Protesters March at Prague Summit  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Unleashing a fresh round of fury
against economic globalization, 5,000 protesters marched on the IMF
and World Bank summit Tuesday, throwing firebombs, sticks and rocks
at police who responded with clubs, tear gas and water cannons.
</P>
<P>
   The enemies of capitalism didn't get the 20,000 activists they
had hoped for but were still able to raise a ruckus that left at
least 69 people injured and turned Prague into a smoky battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and rocks they had made by
breaking up a cobblestone sidewalk. Authorities pushed
demonstrators back each time they approached the communist-era
convention center where the titans of global capitalism had huddled
to ponder economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of activists got so close, however, that officials
temporarily stopped the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
delegates and staff from leaving before evacuating them through a
subway station closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The skies over Prague filled with black smoke after some of the
demonstrators built barricades in the streets and set them ablaze,
also torching cars in what they billed as a sequel to riots that
marred recent economic meetings in Seattle and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main goals of the protesters had been to trap the IMF
and World Bank delegates inside the convention center, which
happened briefly. The fighting hurt at least 69 people, and 44 were
hospitalized, including 34 police officers who were attacked by
wave after wave of protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Czech President Vaclav Havel appealed for calm, urging
demonstrators to ''abstain from violent forms of protests.''
</P>
<P>
   After nightfall, a group of 200 anarchists moved through the
streets, smashing out bank windows and demolishing a McDonald's
outlet -- the second to be struck in the riot -- and a KFC. Police
chased them away and the city was mostly calm late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1,500 activists had blocked the road outside the State
Opera House, where a reception for dignitaries was canceled, but
that protest faded without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation now is more stabilized,'' Interior Minister
Stanislav Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police were exhausted, so reinforcements were being brought
in, said Interior Minister Stanislav Gross.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters call globalization a menace to humanity that
helps the rich get richer at the expense of the poor and the
environment. The IMF and World Bank have become favored targets, as
have capitalist icons such as McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, chairman of the
summit, said it was ''a pity that it has descended into violence''
but added it was unclear what the activists were seeking as they
fight the economic globalization trade officials call irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what they're against but have no sense of what they're
for,'' Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters -- mostly from Europe and representing a
wide variety of groups including anarchists, communists and
environmentalists -- also seemed a bit fuzzy on their goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bankers decide to spoil the world during the day, and at
night, they go to listen to music and to rest,'' said Daniel Gomez,
an activist from Barcelona who joined the demonstration outside the
opera house. ''That's a bad joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a battle for equal justice worldwide,'' explained a
naked Swiss protester, identifying himself only as Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   In a throwback to U.S. anti-war demonstrations of the 1960s,
some activists waved banners saying ''Make love not trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Rioters smashed the windows out of eight ambulances, and for
several hours, Prague officials shut down an entire subway train
line.
</P>
<P>
   Czech authorities had mobilized 11,000 police to try to maintain
control. Police said some 5,000 people had turned out for the
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokeswoman Eva Miklikova said at least 34 people had
been detained for investigation of hooliganism and attacking public
officials, including 11 Germans, two Poles and one British
journalist, who was soon released. The rest were Czechs.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the summit, Czech authorities at the
border stopped almost 300 people with arrest records from previous
anti-globalization rallies.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters' goals Tuesday included blocking the roughly
14,000 IMF and World Bank delegates and staff inside the meeting
hall. For a while the delegates were prevented from leaving, as mob
violence raged. Prague's mayor said a Japanese delegate was
injured, but the delegation was not immediately able to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates eventually got out on a subway train brought in
as a special evacuation vehicle, picking them up at a station that
remained closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   An official who sets schedules for the Japanese delegation
admitted he was nervous after looking through a window at the riot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not comfortable at all for us,'' said Kunio Matsuda.
</P>
<P>
   Many local shops have closed -- with boards placed over their
windows -- after owners worried their property could be trashed by
rampaging mobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it neither amusing nor sad,'' said Ahmed Mahrous
El-Darsh, the top Egyptian delegate to the summit. ''It reminds me
of the good old days when I was in the states during the '60s.
These young people have a message to convey.''

<HEADLINE> Rep Faults White House on E-Mail  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican committee chairman on Tuesday
revealed new evidence in the White House e-mail controversy he said
suggests White House lawyers were aware of a computer problem that
kept thousands of computer messages from being reviewed for various
criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton disclosed that Earl Silbert, a private
Washington attorney hired by a White House computer contractor,
Northrop Grumman, had two brief telephone calls in 1998 with the
White House counsel's office after the computer problem was
discovered. The problem resulted in e-mails not being properly
archived.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides have testified that computer technicians at
the White House were aware of the archiving ''glitch,'' but that
White House lawyers were not.
</P>
<P>
   Silbert's two calls -- disclosed in billing records of Silbert's
law firm -- raise the possibility that White House lawyers could
have learned about the computer problem from Silbert.
</P>
<P>
   Silbert's telephone conversations with the White House counsel's
office on Sept. 28 and Dec. 30, 1998, came around the time of
impeachment proceedings against the president in the Monica
Lewinsky scandal. The second phone call occurred a few weeks after
a magazine article referred to the computer problem. The problem
didn't become widely known until early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, R-Ind., said Silbert told the House Government Reform
Committee staff this week that he doesn't remember whom he talked
to at the White House counsel's office or what was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Elliot Diringer said, ''We have not been
able to establish who Mr. Silbert may have spoken with.'' Diringer
said Charles Ruff, the White House counsel in 1998, has testified
he doesn't recall talking to Silbert.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing, Burton said it appears that Northrop Grumman hired
Silbert after complaints by three employees that they were
threatened by a White House aide who told them to keep their mouths
shut about the computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Silbert called the White House on Sept. 28, 1998 ... at
the height of the impeachment investigation'' and ''you bet'' the
White House ''would take notice'' of any e-mail archiving problem,
said Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman, the committee's ranking Democrat, said Burton
was engaging in ''speculation'' and said ''the facts don't fit''
Burton's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop Grumman has refused to allow Silbert to describe his
work for the company, which entailed less than five hours of legal
work in September, October and December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The two phone calls are listed in billing records as lasting 15
minutes apiece, but Silbert's law firm noted that the calls could
have been shorter since 15 minutes is the minimum amount of billing
time.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been using backup computer tapes to
reconstruct the lost e-mails that were never archived. The first
reconstructed e-mails, released last Friday, related to the 1996
campaign fund-raising controversy. The e-mails show that Vice
President Al Gore's staff referred to White House coffees and a
Buddhist temple event attended by the vice president as
fund-raisers. The White House has said the coffees were not
fund-raisers, and Gore has said that he does not view the temple
event as a fund-raiser.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard rescues seven fishermen from sinking boat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BARNEGAT, N.J. (AP) - The U.S. Coast Guard on Tuesday rescued
seven fishermen whose 82-foot vessel began taking on water in rough
seas and eventually sunk about 47 miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
   The Michele and Mara from New Bedford, Mass., sent a mayday call
just before 7 a.m., according to Petty Officer Andrew Fabbo of the
Coast Guard in Atlantic City. None of the fishermen were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The problem on the vessel was caused by a broken water pipe
below the water line that ran through the hull, Fabbo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just sucking in the Atlantic Ocean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the fishermen were immediately hoisted by a rescue
helicopter and taken to the Coast Guard Air Station at the Atlantic
City Airport. A Coast Guard rescue swimmer and the other fishermen
stayed on the vessel to fight the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel was declared beyond saving at about 11 a.m. and they
abandoned ship, the Coast Guard said. The remaining fishermen were
then rescued by helicopter as well.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen were identified as Michael Willett, the captain,
40, of New Bedford; Keith Carter, 32, of Fairtown, Mass.; Alfredo
Loya Sr., 49, of New Bedford; Alberto Echasa Reta, 36, of New
Bedford; Antonio Mi Viera, 39, of New Bedford; Terrance Smith, 36,
of Fairhaven, Mass; and Jose Pedro, 39, of New Bedford.

<HEADLINE> Man extradited to face murder charge is held without bail  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The first person to be brought to the United
States from Colombia to face murder charges since the Colombian
government permitted U.S. extraditions in 1997 was ordered held
without bail Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Baez was charged in an indictment returned in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan with racketeering, murder and robbery,
among other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Baez is charged with the murder of retired New York City Police
Detective Donald Pagani during an Aug. 27, 1999 armed robbery of a
meat company in the South Bronx. Baez was charged along with seven
others with participating in a racketeering organization that
conspired to commit armed robbery, murder and issue threats of
violence as it stole jewelry, money and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Rice Jr., special agent in charge of the New York office
of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said the extradition
of Baez sends a ''clear and strong message that individuals
involved in violence and narcotics trafficking cannot hide behind
political boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik said Pagani
served the city and state for 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   Baez, listening to court proceedings through an interpreter,
appeared briefly before U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman, who
ordered the suspect held without bail at least until his next court
appearance. Authorities are unsure of his age.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian government amended its constitution in December
1997 to allow extradition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in New York City at 11:30 p.m. Monday, after being
held in Colombia since December, when he was arrested at the
request of the U.S. government, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan
Himmelfarb said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the murder of the detective, Baez was charged in the
February 1996 armed robbery of two jewelers at the Hilton Hotel in
midtown Manhattan and the attempted murder of one of the jewelers.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Baez could face up to life in prison without
parole.

<HEADLINE> Clinton wants ban on ads in schools and ads aimed at preschoolers  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday called for a
ban on advertising in schools and on ads directed at preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are commercializing our children and interfering with the
proper upbringing by their parents, by their religious leaders,
schools and civic groups,'' she told several hundred senior
citizens at a Young Men's Hebrew Association in Riverdale, the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has made child welfare and education themes of her
Senate run, proposed a ban on ads that seek to sell a product
directly to preschoolers rather than to their parents; called on
the Federal Trade Commission to study the extent of such
advertising; and said schools should not be allowed to receive
federal funding if they accept commercial ads.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the General Accounting Office reported that
cash-strapped schools around the country are making deals that
bring soda machines, PG-rated movie commercials and marketing
surveys onto their grounds.
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of a handful of states that already prohibits
commercial activity in schools, including banning Channel One, a
daily news broadcast complete with commercials that offers free TV
sets and satellite dishes to schools that incorporate the broadcast
into class time.
</P>
<P>
   But the city Board of Education is considering a commercial deal
to finance free laptop computers for students. The computers would
be paid for by selling ads on a Board of Ed Web site geared to
students, parents and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ''the constant barrage of materialistic marketing''
makes it ''difficult for families to feel like they have authority
over their own children.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Republican opponent in the Senate race, Rep. Rick
Lazio of Long Island, spent the day campaigning in Brooklyn,
meeting with business owners, realtors and senior citizens. At the
Bay Ridge Center for Older Adults, he got a kiss from 109-year-old
Natalie Cresci, which he said would bring him luck.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lazio threw his arm around proprietor Rocco Loccisano at
Rocco's Pizza, where he ate lunch. Outside, several abortion rights
supporters held signs that said ''Anti-choice Supreme Court
justices? Lazio: How would you vote?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton, Lazio refuses to use Roe v. Wade in choosing
justices.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's stops included a Jewish day school in Cedarhurst, Long
Island, and a speech to a meeting of the National Council of Jewish
Women in East Rockaway. Lazio had also been invited to address the
council on Tuesday, but instead stuck to his Brooklyn itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has ceded the Jewish vote to Clinton, he said: ''Not
at all,'' and added that he has a ''mainstream New York record that
is very attractive to the Jewish community.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accompanied at her stop in the Bronx by Hadassah
Lieberman, wife of the Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen.
Joseph Lieberman. Mrs. Lieberman's mother, Ella Froelich, still
lives in Riverdale and attended the event at the YMHA. ''I wanted
to just look around at all my friends in Riverdale, my mommy in
particular,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio met privately Tuesday with state Assemblyman Dov Hikind,
D-Brooklyn, an Orthodox Jew who has been critical of Clinton in the
past but over the last few months has had nothing but praise for
her. Hikind is expected to make an endorsement in the race next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio touted his plans to cut taxes, improve education by giving
states and localities more flexibility in spending, and require
periodic competency tests for teachers. He also promised to work to
lower oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to stay on the path to fiscal responsibility,
because that means in the end, prosperity, jobs and growth,'' he
said at a Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce lunch. ''There's no question
that my opponent would have to raise taxes to pay for all these new
federal spending programs (she's proposed.)''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later defended as ''fiscally responsible'' her support
for using the budget surplus to pay down the national debt, shore
up Social Security and modernize Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was also asked about the Lazio campaign's criticism of
her associations with Jim Levin. The Lazio campaign described Levin
as a former strip-club owner who gave a $5,000 check to one of
Clinton's campaign committees and stayed overnight twice at the
White House. ''I don't know anything about his business,'' the
first lady said. ''He's been a friend and supporter of the
president's and I don't have anything further to add.''

<HEADLINE> Man accused of stealing bank info of prominent executives pleads guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Tennessee man has pleaded guilty to charges
that he bought nearly $750,000 worth of diamonds and Rolex watches
using credit card numbers stolen from some of the nation's top
executives.
</P>
<P>
   James Rinaldo Jackson, 39, of Memphis admitted victimizing John
Alm, chief operating officer of Coca-Cola Enterprises, Richard
Fuld, chairman of Lehman Brothers Holdings and the late Gordon
Teter, former chairman of Wendy's International, among others.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the plea Monday before U.S. District Judge Deborah A.
Batts, who set sentencing for Jan. 16. A plea agreement in the case
called for a sentence of at least four years and three months and
as much as five years and three months.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was originally charged along with Dereck Cunningham, 28,
also of Memphis. Charges against Cunningham are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in December, the men allegedly obtained about 20
diamonds, including at least two more than five carats and at least
two more than four carats. One diamond was valued at more than
$54,000 and two others were worth more than $48,000.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accused the men of targeting prominent members of
the nation's business community and then stealing their personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   The men impersonated their victims in telephone calls to banks
and credit card companies, persuading them to change the billing
addresses on the accounts to hotels in Tennessee, Arkansas and
Mississippi, prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> Nielsen, Maloney squabble over poll results dlstf </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERTOWN, Conn. (AP) - Republican Mark Nielsen on Tuesday
released internal poll results he claimed show he has closed to
within 7 percentage points of Democratic U.S. Rep. James Maloney
for the 5th District Congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   But in what has become a familiar theme in the hotly contested
race, Maloney quickly denounced Nielsen's poll results as ''fake''
and released his own numbers showing him with a 25-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The race is a rematch of 1998, when Maloney defeated Nielsen by
just 2,300 votes in one of the closest congressional contests in
the country. No public polls have been conducted on the race.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen said he decided to release his poll results to prevent
Maloney from claiming the race is over. Neilson claims that in 1998
Maloney tried to make himself seem like a shoo-in so those likely
to vote for Nielsen would not turn out on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important for me to remind folks that this is a
competitive race,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, however, claimed Nielsen manipulated his own poll
numbers in 1998 and again in the recent poll.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen's poll, conducted last Wednesday and Thursday, showed
the Republican trailing Maloney 44 percent to 37 percent in a
head-to-head race. Nineteen percent said they were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll also showed that many voters still are not familiar
with Nielsen. In a question on his favorability, 35 percent said
they had a favorable opinion of Nielsen, while 18 percent said they
had an unfavorable opinion. But nearly 48 percent said they had no
opinion or had never heard of Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred registered and likely voters were surveyed. The
poll, conducted by Fabrizio, McLaughlin and Associates, of
Alexandria, Va., had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen claims the poll showed him closing the gap since April,
when a benchmark poll conducted for his campaign showed Maloney
leading 49 percent to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Maloney's campaign staff said they did not believe Nielsen's
poll and accused him of ''cooking the numbers'' in an effort to
attract more funding from the national Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''His numbers are fake,'' Maloney said. ''He knows it, and he's
not going to persuade the Republican Party officials in Washington
with phony numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said he believed Nielsen's polls gave voters only
selected information to skew the results in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt at a pre-emptive strike, Maloney's campaign held a
hastily scheduled a news conference and released their own poll
results just before Nielsen released his.
</P>
<P>
   In Maloney's poll, conducted more than six weeks ago, from Aug.
9-12, Maloney led Nielsen 53 percent to 28 percent in a
head-to-head race. Sixteen percent said they were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney's campaign manager, Jason Linde, said it would be
''unfathomable'' for Nielsen to have closed that gap in the last
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Maloney is likely to have increased his lead since
the August poll because of U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman's nomination
as the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Linde said. Maloney
has also run three television commercials compared to just one run
by Nielsen, Linde said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is just no way that, faced with a steep hill like that,
that all of a sudden he is going to pick up 17 points. It is
mind-boggling and unfathomable,'' Linde said.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen said his numbers show that Maloney is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ''They desperately want to be ahead by double digits, but this
poll suggests that they're not,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Domestic Violence Plan  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A long-stalled bill renewing landmark federal
programs for victims of domestic violence passed the House on
Tuesday after President Clinton accused lawmakers of treating the
measure like a political football.
</P>
<P>
   The renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, which passed
415-3, authorizes $3.6 billion over five years for programs that
include law enforcement and judicial training, grants for domestic
violence shelters, child abuse prevention programs and a national
domestic violence hot line. It was originally passed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Members voting against the measure were Republican Reps. Helen
Chenoweth-Hage of Idaho, John Hostettler of Indiana and Mark
Sanford Jr. of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''Domestic violence is a national tragedy,'' said Rep. Connie
Morella, R-Md., sponsor of the legislation. ''Reauthorization ...
will continue to provide safe alternatives for victims while
helping them to rebuild their lives and the lives of their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas: ''This bill is crucial.
It is necessary. It is imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he was pleased the House acted.
</P>
<P>
   ''This vote affirms our commitment to support the work of state
and local prosecutors, law enforcement agencies and health care and
social service professionals throughout the country who every day
respond to women who are victims of domestic violence, stalking and
sexual assault,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark measure is to expire Sept. 30. Legislation to
reauthorize the law has broad bipartisan support but has been held
up in the last-minute crush of bills as Congress tries to meet a
planned Oct. 6 adjournment date.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Chairman Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said even if the
bill has not received final passage by Saturday's expiration,
action has been taken to keep money flowing. ''It remains a
priority of this Congress,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, speaking before an audience that included many women
who were victims of family abuse, Clinton told Congress: ''It is
wrong to delay this one more hour. Schedule the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said the bill is being ''used as a political
football in Washington'' as both parties jockey for advantage in
the final days of the session.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore called violence
against women ''a national concern that requires a strong, national
response.'' He said the House ''has taken an important bipartisan
step toward final passege of this much-needed legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure remains without a key provision that would allow
rape victims to sue their attackers in federal court. The Supreme
Court said in May that it is up to states, not Congress, to choose
whether to protect women in that way, and Congressional Democrats
tried but failed this year to reinstate the provision in acceptable
language.
</P>
<P>
   As left by the Supreme Court, the law now essentially provides a
federal dispensary for grants and programs aimed at preventing
family violence and helping abused spouses -- normally women -- flee
it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill awaits action in the Senate, and Clinton demanded in
his statement that action come quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now time for the Senate to act,'' he said. ''With over
70 sponsors in the Senate, there is no reason for delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans have floated the idea of attaching the
legislation to a bill that would overhaul the nation's bankruptcy
laws. The twinned proposals would then be appended to one of the 11
appropriations bills that Congress still must enact to keep the
government in operation.
</P>
<P>
   National Organization for Women president Patricia Ireland
praised the House for passing the bill but accused Republicans of
delaying passage for political advantage. ''I do think that the
timing is for the purpose of having a recent vote hit the news at a
time when they thought it would be advantageous,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Freeh, Reno Defend Govt. Lee Case  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI Director Louis Freeh told Congress on
Tuesday that prosecutors could have sent scientist Wen Ho Lee to
prison for years but agreed to let him plead guilty to a single
charge out of fears atomic weapons secrets would become public at a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Justice and the FBI stand by each and every
one of the 59 counts in the indictment of Doctor Lee,'' Freeh told
the Senate Judiciary and Select Intelligence committees. ''Each of
those counts could be proven in December 1999 and each of them
could be proven today.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The facts of this case have not changed, although recent
rulings by the trial court posed serious obstacles to proving those
facts without revealing nuclear secrets in open courts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh was joined by Attorney General Janet Reno in defending the
government's investigation and treatment of Lee, who was held in
solitary confinement without bail for nine months and had to wear
leg shackles.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was not at the hearing. In a statement, Lee's lawyers said
they want fair treatment for their client from the government, and
Lee hopes that in time ''the world will better understand that he
has been and continues to be a loyal and proud citizen of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Doctor Lee is no hero,'' Reno said, rejecting his portrayal as
a victim. ''He is no absent-minded professor. He is a felon. He
committed a very serious, calculated crime and he pled guilty to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director acknowledged in written testimony that the
agents who interrogated Lee should not have reminded him that
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in the 1950s for
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Confrontational interviews often call for tough statements by
investigators but that implication was inappropriate,'' he said.
Lee was never charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Lee was treated no worse than other prisoners in
solitary confinement at the Santa Fe County Detention Facility. All
were required to wear leg shackles when being moved outside their
cells, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately those shackles were removed and, unlike the other
prisoners in solitary confinement, Lee was allowed to have a radio
to listen to music, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee walked free Sept. 13, sentenced to the time he had served
awaiting trial, after he agreed to tell the government what he did
with nuclear weapons design secrets he downloaded from computers
while employed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plea agreement is our best chance to find out what
happened to the computer tapes containing some of the nation's most
important nuclear designs,'' Reno said at the joint hearing of the
two Senate committees.
</P>
<P>
   The plea bargain, however, prompted U.S. District Judge James
Parker to apologize to Lee for the nine-month pretrial imprisonment
and to accuse the government officials in charge of the case of
embarrassing ''our entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers at Tuesday's hearing also found much to complain
about.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the FBI's counterintelligence investigation was a
gravely flawed exercise characterized by inadequate resources, lack
of management attention and missed opportunities,'' said Senate
Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a textbook example of how not to conduct an
investigation,'' added Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada, the top
Democrat on that committee, calling it a ''Keystone Kops''
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's supporters also contend that the fired Los Alamos
scientist, a U.S. citizen born in Taiwan and educated in the United
States, was targeted because he is Asian-American. Some are
demanding a presidential pardon and an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has refused to apologize but has ordered an internal review
of Justice Department actions. She and Freeh deny, however, that he
was unfairly targeted because he is Asian-American.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh listed several instances starting in 1982 that led them to
Lee, including allegations that he had met with and helped Chinese
nuclear scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is critical to understand that Doctor Lee's conduct was not
inadvertent, it was not careless and it was not innocent,'' Freeh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also deleted some files he had downloaded from Los Alamos
weapons computers after the FBI questioning began and tried to
access secure areas at Los Alamos after losing his security
clearance, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''After his access was revoked to the part of the lab where the
secure computer resided, he tried over and over to get in,
including at 3:30 a.m. one Christmas Eve,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   But convicting Lee likely would have required revealing those
secrets in court to prove their importance, ''crossing an exposure
threshold we had already determined at the highest level of
government posed an unacceptable risk,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., asked Reno to appoint an
independent investigator, saying Congress and the Justice
Department are too close to the matter to be perceived as being
fair.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, The New York Times, which played a lead role in
bringing the Lee investigation to public attention, said in Tuesday
editions that there were flaws in its stories.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary 1,680-word message from editors, the
newspaper said an internal review ''found some things we wish we
had done differently in the course of the coverage to give Dr. Lee
the full benefit of the doubt.'' The blame ''lies principally with
those who directed the coverage, for not raising questions that
occurred to us only later.''

<HEADLINE> Blair Defends Fuel Protest Stance  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIGHTON, England (AP) -- Apologizing for his mistakes to voters
who increasingly find him arrogant and out of touch, Prime Minister
Tony Blair on Tuesday defended his tough stance against fuel
protests and warned of more hard choices ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech pitched to a national TV audience as well as to
shaken party activists, Blair talked of ''a second term more
radical than the first'' -- and of ambitious 10-year plans that
suggest he's determined to win a third five-year term as well.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Blair set the battle lines for the next election
between an opposition focusing on tax cuts and his party's emphasis
on improving public services.
</P>
<P>
   ''The test of leadership in politics is not how eloquently you
say yes,'' Blair told delegates. ''It's how you explain why you're
saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   Protests earlier this month against high fuel prices by truckers
and farmers -- who effectively ran British gas stations dry with
blockades -- caught the government off guard. Blair refused demands
for a cut in fuel taxes, and though the protests stopped he saw his
popularity plummet from the record levels of his first months in
power.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's speech, Blair explained why the government will not
meet the 60-day deadline for relief set by the truckers and
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government's priority was to help 2 million elderly
people by boosting pensions, he told truckers that many of their
taxes are lower than in European countries with cheaper fuel, and
he repeated his determination not to give in to blockades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would it ever be right to choose a priority simply on the
basis of a fuel blockade? What of those who can't protest, whose
voice isn't supported by the media, who go neglected unless we
speak for them?'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   The message impressed some key supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tony Blair has clearly signaled that the days of governments
buying power through tax cuts are over,'' said John Edmonds,
general-secretary of the 700,000-member GMB union, representing
workers in the public and private sectors. ''It is obvious that he
intends to earn power at the next election through investment in
public services for all, rather than the Tory offer of tax bribes
for the affluent few.''
</P>
<P>
   However, John Bridge, chairman of the Road Haulage Association,
said the government still needs to tackle the fuel price issue ''in
a practical and urgent way.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Over 80 percent of the population believe the government has
got to change its policy,'' Bridge said.
</P>
<P>
   The government also has been hurt by the failure of the
Millennium Dome to attract as many visitors as planned, and for the
tight budget policies that produced only a $1.10 per week increase
in the state pension for retirees this year. New questions have
been raised about a $1.45 million contribution from Formula One
chief Bernie Ecclestone, who subsequently lobbied the government
for an exemption from a ban on tobacco sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls showed wide public disapproval of the government's
handling of the fuel protests and put Labor below the opposition
Conservative Party for the first time since the 1997 election
brought Blair and his party to power.
</P>
<P>
   Blair is frequently described -- by opponents and ordinary voters
-- as arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since he became party leader in 1994, he
faced the conference with his leadership in question. For the first
time, the party heard an apologetic prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, there are things we have done that have made people angry
and we should be open enough to admit it,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dome. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if I had my time
again, I would have listened to those who said government shouldn't
try to run big visitor attractions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Treasury chief Gordon Brown promised larger increases
in the pension, targeted on lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell you now, as Gordon made crystal clear yesterday,''
Blair said, ''we get the message.''

<HEADLINE> House Revives Sick Workers Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after talks broke down, House leaders
said Tuesday they would resume negotiations with the Senate on a
compensation plan for workers made sick by Cold War-era jobs in
nuclear weapons plants.
</P>
<P>
   A new House proposal was being drafted and will be presented to
conferees on the Defense Authorization Act, said John Feehery,
spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and other House Republican leaders were criticized
harshly by Democrats from weapons-plant states and from some fellow
Republicans, such as Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., after talks broke
down Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said ''the House leadership refused to even consider
the issue,'' and Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., called their failure
to agree ''callous disregard to people who gave their lives to this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the Energy Department reversed 50 years of federal
policy by declaring that workers injured or killed by radiation
exposure at weapons plants should be compensated. The agency
proposed minimum lump sum payments of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate passed its version of the Defense Authorization
Act, it included a provision awarding $200,000 plus health benefits
to harmed workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated the measure would cost
$1.7 billion over 10 years, based on a Department of Energy
estimate that at least 4,000 workers either contracted
life-threatening diseases from radiation, silica or beryllium
exposure or already have died from the diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of an entitlement program with uncertain costs, the House
passed only a resolution recommending compensation.
</P>
<P>
   During negotiations, senators backed off from the $200,000 offer
and told the House they could accept $100,000 as the minimum
payment if that would get the proposal passed.
</P>
<P>
   House negotiators offered a $250 million down payment on a
compensation program that would need to be set up in future
legislation following additional study.
</P>
<P>
   David Michaels, the Energy Department's top health official,
said sick workers should not have to wait for more government
study.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the last decade we've spent more than $150 million
studying the health of workers at DOE sites,'' he said. ''We don't
think additional studies are needed, and we don't think additional
legislations are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The DOE has said most people likely to qualify for compensation
would come from the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington
state; Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee; Savannah River Site in
South Carolina; Nevada Test Site; Rocky Flats Complex in Colorado;
Pantex Plant in Texas; Mound Plant and Fernald Environmental
Management Project in Ohio; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
in California; Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico; and
gaseous diffusion plants at Piketon, Ohio; Paducah, Ky.; and Oak
Ridge, Tenn.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Calls For Runoff Vote  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic conceded Tuesday
that his challenger finished first in Yugoslavia's presidential
election and declared a runoff -- defying demands at home and abroad
that he step down.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica rejected an Oct. 8
runoff, calling it a ''fraud'' and insisting that he won Sunday's
election outright. At the same time, he warned against any moves
that could raise tensions and called on the opposition to keep to a
''nonviolent'' response.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition called for a rally Wednesday night in downtown
Belgrade to ''celebrate its victory'' -- apparently hoping for a
show of strength to demonstrate to Milosevic the public's refusal
of a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said it was clear the opposition had defeated
Milosevic, who has led Yugoslavia for 13 years. He said that the
United States would take steps to lift economic sanctions if the
election result is honored.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the government's attempts to manipulate the vote, it
does seem clear that the people have voted for change,'' Clinton
said in a speech at Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of a runoff raises the stakes in the
confrontation between Milosevic and the opposition, which faced the
choice of accepting a runoff it considers fraudulent or trying to
pressure the hardline leader -- believed to have a firm grip on the
top ranks of the police and military -- to back down.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the voting, the State Elections Commission
released its first results Tuesday, saying Kostunica finished first
with 48.22 percent to 40.23 percent for Milosevic. The law provided
a runoff Oct. 8 if none of the five candidates received more than
50 percent of the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   Before the announcement, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia
released its own tally, showing Kostunica with 55 percent to
Milosevic's 35 percent. It said the figures were based on 97.5
percent of the ballots and were taken from reports by opposition
poll watchers at each precinct.
</P>
<P>
   State television said the turnout was 64 percent, far below the
74 percent figure given by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are talking about political fraud and blatant stealing of
votes,'' Kostunica said. ''This is an offer which must be
rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the opposition would avoid ''careless moves which
could raise tensions in society, which could lead to unforeseeable
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is obvious, and we will defend it by all nonviolent
means,'' the opposition leader said. ''The people have given their
political 'no' to Milosevic and his policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Yugoslavs jammed the main squares in
Belgrade and other major cities for two straight nights after the
balloting, celebrating the opposition win and demanding Milosevic
step down. Both nights, the rallies ended without friction with
police, and Tuesday night there were no crowds in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, there is no runoff,'' Vladan Batic, an anti-Milosevic
activist, said. ''We won honestly and those who falsified the
results have to face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic, another opposition leader, demanded the
electoral commission inspect the official returns, saying the
government had removed 400,000 votes from Kostunica and given half
of them to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were aware of their intentions because it was obvious they
were cooking up something to get Milosevic in the second round at
least,'' Djindjic said, ''But we have firm evidence in our hands
and we will defend the will of the people till the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The influential leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Patriarch
Pavle, met with Kostunica on Tuesday and urged the ruling coalition
''to accept the electoral will of the people and contribute to the
welfare of the nation and the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The runoff announcement came despite growing international calls
for Milosevic to accept an opposition victory.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Defense Secretary William Cohen said the United
States would not stand by and watch Milosevic steal the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the international community will look very closely,
carefully and bring whatever pressure it can for Milosevic to abide
by the will of his people,'' Cohen said. ''The people want
Milosevic out. Certainly the international community would welcome
that result.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held out to Yugoslavia the prospect of the end of the
country's isolation. ''If the will of the people is respected, the
doors to Europe and the world will be open again to Serbia,''
Clinton said. ''We will take steps with our allies to lift economic
sanctions, and the people of Serbia, who have suffered so much
finally will have a chance to lead normal lives.''
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said: ''I say to Milosevic:
You lost. Go. Your country and the world has suffered enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 150 miles northwest of Yugoslavia's pro-Western republic of
Montenegro, U.S. and Croat forces held naval exercises Tuesday,
including a simulated Marine landing on an island in the Adriatic
Sea. It was part of their largest joint exercise to date.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. William Crow, commander of the USS Austin, said the
exercise was planned months ago and was unrelated to the Yugoslav
elections.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Evolution &AMP; Schools,730  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - In a new chapter of a dispute that pits
science against religion, a national organization of scientists
gives schools in 19 states unsatisfactory grades for teaching
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The report, commissioned by the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and
released Tuesday at the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, grades 49 states and the District of Columbia on the basis
of how well evolution is included in the state science education
standards.
</P>
<P>
   California, Connecticut, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina and
Rhode Island received the highest rank. Kansas, whose standards
were described as ''disgraceful,'' got the lowest grade.
</P>
<P>
   Following the six states graded at 100 were four states graded
in the 90s and given A's in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen states were graded at B, 7 got C, 6 were given D's and
13 flunked. Iowa was not included because it has no statewide
education standards, leaving that up to each local district.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway, former chairman of the Kansas State Board of
Education, said the report was deceptive and ''very unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly they have an ax to grind about evolution,'' she said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas last year rekindled the issue of teaching evolution in
public schools when the state board of education, lead by Holloway,
approved science teaching standards that minimized the importance
of evolution and omitted the big-bang theory of the origin of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have considered similar curriculum changes and some
state legislatures have proposed laws that would forbid completely
the teaching of evolution in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, a theory developed by Charles Darwin and others,
holds that the Earth is billions of years old and that all life,
including humans, evolved from simple forms through a process of
natural selection.
</P>
<P>
   Related to biological evolution is the concept that the universe
began with a ''big bang'' and that only later were the sun and the
planets formed.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching of evolution has been opposed by people who believe
that the universe, the Earth and its creatures were created
abruptly by God.
</P>
<P>
   Some proponents of divine creation have organized a concept,
called creationism, that they proposed be taught along with
evolution. In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court barred states from
requiring the teaching of creationism. Now some of the same
proponents support other concepts, such as ''abrupt appearance'' or
''intelligent design,'' that are linked to divine creation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence S. Lerner, who compiled the report for the Thomas B.
Fordham Foundation, said that the conflict ''is not really about
science, but about religion and politics.'' He calls creationism
''a pseudoscientific rival to evolution that the courts have
repeatedly held to be thinly veiled religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner, a former professor at California State University, Long
Beach, said that Kansas got such a poor grade because its
guidelines forbid teaching anything about the age of the Earth or
the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not a reference to the age of the universe because it
changes all the time,'' explained Holloway. ''Within a month after
we adopted the standards, I heard three different ages of the
Earth. That is kind of ludicrous to get them (teachers) to stick to
one age when it changes all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner called the Kansas science education standards ''a
disgraceful paean to antiscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, however, said that the report was part of ''a campaign
of deception'' and that all districts in Kansas are still teaching
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we did was allow local groups to decide how they wanted to
teach evolution,'' she said. ''That is a reasonable thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Nord, a member of a panel assembled by AAAS to comment on
the report, spoke in favor of education standards that would
include religious concepts of creation along with concepts of
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Nord, director of the Program on Humanities and Human Values
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the report
failed to evaluate the completeness of science education.
</P>
<P>
   ''A good science education should not limit itself to what
scientists think, but should also explore the cultural context in
which scientific claims are made,'' said Nord, noting that the
report ''doesn't address that.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan To Send Aid Flight To Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan said Tuesday it would send a plane
carrying humanitarian aid to Baghdad, becoming the third nation in
a week flying passengers to Iraq in an escalating challenge to U.N.
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States stepped up its protest against the
unauthorized flights, which it maintains violate the sweeping U.N.
embargo on Baghdad that followed Iraq's August 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the U.S. Senate
Tuesday she was ''very concerned'' about unapproved Russian and
French flights to Iraq in recent days. She was trying to persuade
Jordan not to follow suit, and said the United States could invoke
a law that cuts off assistance to countries that violate the U.N.
embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan plans to fly to Iraq on Wednesday whether or not it gets
clearance from the U.N. sanctions committee, a Jordanian government
spokesman said. France and Russia sent planes to Iraq in the last
few days without waiting for clearance, maintaining that
authorization is not required for humanitarian or passenger
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether there is a response or not, the plane will leave
tomorrow,'' Jordanian Culture Minister Mahmoud Kayed told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did our duty, informing the U.N. on the flight,'' said
Kayed, also the government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jordan can ill afford to anger the United States, which
gives the impoverished nation $270 million a year in economic and
military assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions committee gave its members until 10 a.m EDT
Wednesday to raise any objections to the flight. If the flight
enters Iraq before that deadline, it could be seen as having done
so without U.N. approval. By late Tuesday, the United States had
not made an objection.
</P>
<P>
   The developments heightened a growing call by Iraq's supporters
for lifting the U.N. sanctions. Russia's state-controlled airline
Aeroflot said Tuesday it was negotiating with Iraq on resuming
regular passenger flights to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa called for lifting
the sanctions after talks in Damascus, the Syrian capital, with
visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the U.N. embargo say it deprives the Iraqi people of
desperately needed medical help, food and other basic items.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian government said its plane will carry government
officials, doctors and medical supplies, in a step it hopes will
lead to a resumption of passenger flights to its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. sanctions committee procedures regarding flights are in
deep dispute. France and Russia say nations wishing to send
humanitarian goods into Iraq need only notify the committee of the
intended flight, not receive its approval.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain -- backed by the Dutch committee
chairman -- say committee members must signal their approval by not
raising an objection to the proposed flight within 24 hours. That
24-hour period would have ended Tuesday evening, but the committee
extended it to the new Wednesday deadline while consultations
continued.
</P>
<P>
   France's refusal to give the committee time to consider its
flight last week prompted the United States to accuse France of
violating the sanctions. On Monday, the United States asked that
the committee send letters of inquiry to the countries involved to
determine what violations had occurred, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other proposed flights are being considered by the
committee: one from Iceland and another from Russia to take off in
the next few days. On Tuesday night, the United States and Britain
put ''holds'' on those flights pending more information, said a
spokesman from the Netherlands, which chairs the sanctions
committee.

<HEADLINE> Christie's acknowledges its part in settlement  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Christie's International announced Tuesday that
it had reached a deal on charges that it conspired with Sotheby's
Holdings Inc., agreeing to pay half of the $512 million settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's had announced two days earlier that it would pay its
$256 million share.
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Dolman, chief executive officer of Christie's
International, said in a release that the company ''is in the
strongest shape it has ever been and we fully expect that strength
to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the settlement, reached last Thursday, would have no
impact on the company's operations in an economy in which the art
market ''remains robust.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Christie's was cooperating fully with a Department of
Justice investigation into claims that the world's two largest
auction houses had conspired to set commissions artificially high
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''The settlement that we are announcing today will compensate
our clients with the shortest possible delay and permit us to
continue to focus on providing the highest quality service in the
industry,'' Dolman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice's
antitrust division, said Tuesday that investigators are still
looking into possible antitrust behavior in the fine arts industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's officials have said they were negotiating with the
Department of Justice and were optimistic that an agreement could
soon be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's in January said it was given conditional amnesty in
the probe after supplying new information on its own practices.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was reached in a civil lawsuit brought this year
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on behalf of 120,000 buyers and
sellers. Several lawyers who originally filed the lawsuit did not
immediately return telephone messages Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They had noted in court papers that Christie's indicated to
plaintiffs on Jan. 29 that the company turned over documents
confirming that Christie's and Sotheby's had colluded on their
charges to customers. Both companies changed their pricing
structure earlier this year, the papers noted.
</P>
<P>
   The New York art world was shaken in 1997 when it was disclosed
that the government seized truckloads of documents as part of an
inquiry into alleged improprieties involving the two auction houses
and a dozen or so art galleries and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Christie's and Sotheby's boosted buyers' fees. In 1995,
Christie's replaced its long-standing 10 percent commission to
sellers with a sliding scale of 2 percent to 10 percent, and
Sotheby's soon adopted a similar policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits collusion in such
arrangements as illegal restraint of trade, punishable by fines and
imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Helps Small Businesses  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Small businesses could avoid liability under
the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund program under
legislation that was approved by the House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed 253-161, would exempt from lawsuits families or
small businesses with 100 or fewer employees and $3 million or less
in gross revenues, if the amount of hazardous materials disposed of
is not greater than 110 gallons or 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses would also be exempted from Superfund liability
if it has disposed only municipal solid waste, such as household
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption would not cover commercial trash operations. The
bill also directs the president to expedite settlements for parties
that contribute less than 1 percent of the total amount of
hazardous materials at a Superfund site.
</P>
<P>
   The Superfund program aims to force businesses to pay to clean
up toxic sites they created or to which they contributed. It has
been criticized for spawning costly and lengthy lawsuits that have
crippled some smaller companies, but Congress has made little
headway in years of efforts to reform the program.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, said sponsor Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, would
''provide long overdue liability relief to individuals, families
and small business owners unfairly trapped in the litigation
nightmare of the Superfund program for over two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., another sponsor, said it was
''absolutely scandalous'' that people had been targeted under
Superfund for dumping mashed potatoes or pizza boxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation was opposed by many Democrats who said that,
although they supported exemptions for small businesses, the bill
had been brought to the House floor at the end of the congressional
session without hearings or discussions with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., added that ''it creates incentives
for businesses or entities to destroy or lose records or to engage
in other rascality to achieve a preference at the expense of all of
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters, in a letter to members of
Congress, also urged opposition to the bill, noting that ''the
bill's failure to ensure that a business's parent corporation,
affiliate or subsidiary is liable for cleanup costs, may enable
businesses to escape responsibility for their pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., has introduced similar legislation
in the Senate, but it is unclear whether the Senate will take up
the issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The House bill is H.R. 5175.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill is S. 2634.

<HEADLINE> Paris Opens Finance Minister Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A Paris court opened a judicial inquiry Tuesday
into whether a former finance minister concealed evidence of an
alleged corruption scandal that has tarnished parties left and
right and poisoned relations between France's president and prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Jean-Pierre Dintilhac said in a statement that he had
decided to open an inquiry into former Socialist Finance Minister
Dominique Strauss-Kahn's possible involvement in concealing
evidence in a case of alleged kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry also targets ''all others'' who could be involved in
concealing evidence and will investigate allegations of influence
peddling.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged kickbacks scheme was revealed in a videotape by
Jean-Claude Mery, a property developer and member of the party of
conservative President Jacques Chirac. Mery made the tape before he
died last year.
</P>
<P>
   The video, whose contents were made public Thursday by the daily
Le Monde, implicates Chirac in an alleged party financing scheme in
the Paris region that dates to the 1980s. Chirac was Paris mayor,
and prime minister, at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Mery claimed in the tape that public construction contracts were
fixed, with kickbacks filling the coffers of Chirac's Rally for the
Republic party and other parties -- with the alleged knowledge of
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac denounced the allegations as ''lies'' in a television
interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The tale then took a twist, with the revelation that the
original copy of the tape had been given to the former finance
minister, turning the focus from the conservatives to the
Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss-Kahn, who was once close to Socialist Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin but resigned last November, has admitted that he was
given the tape by Mery's lawyer but says he never looked at it.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday his return to the spotlight is but a
diversionary tactic to cover up the real focus of the affair -- the
alleged kickback scheme on public works contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss-Kahn's alleged involvement brings the whiff of scandal
perilously close to Jospin, who has always prided himself on his
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Under the French legal system, the opening of a judicial inquiry
precedes an eventual decision to place a person under formal
investigation. The next step would then be the formulating of
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Leading members of Chirac's RPR lashed out at Jospin for denying
any knowledge about the alleged kickback scheme.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Chirac telephoned Jospin and, according to Le Monde,
angrily demanded that relevant documents in the affair be made
available to judicial authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac and Jospin have politely shared the political stage since
1995, but the scandal has visibly soured their relations.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Spirit Airlines-FAA,200  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) - The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday
that discount carrier Spirit Airlines should be fined $67,000 for
violating agency regulations on markings and placards on eight of
its aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said one or more of the DC9 and MD80 aircraft allegedly
had incorrect emergency markings; posted placards with incorrect
locations of emergency equipment; flew without ''Fasten Seatbelt
While Seated - Life Vest Under Your Seat'' placards; or incorrectly
replaced those placards with placards stating ''Use Seat Bottom
Cushion for Flotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Those and other alleged violations of FAA regulations were
revealed during inspections conducted on New Year's Eve and New
Year's Day, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Spirit, which moved its corporate headquarters last year from
Eastpointe, Mich., to Miramar, Fla., had 30 days to respond to the
FAA's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Spirit said the FAA notified the airline in July
of violations regarding its signage and that the airline
immediately corrected all discrepancies. The airline has requested
a conference with the FAA and ''believes this is an administrative
matter and that no civil penalty is warranted,'' Spirit said.
</P>
<P>
   Spirit maintains a fleet of 24 jet aircraft. It serves six
airports in Florida, two in New Jersey and Detroit Metropolitan
Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, LaGuardia International
Airport in New York and Myrtle Beach (S.C.) Airport.

<HEADLINE> Offspring Won't Release Web Album  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The rock group The Offspring has abandoned a
plan to release an entire album for free on the Internet before it
goes on sale in stores.
</P>
<P>
   The band will instead release only one song online but will
proceed with a $1 million Web-based contest designed to promote the
album, Sony Music Entertainment, the band's distributor, said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are extremely happy that Sony Music has worked out a
solution with The Offspring and its management that supports the
integrity of the band' s creative idea and enables them to proceed
with their promotion,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the band's publicist was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with Sony, the band will post the single
''Original Prankster'' from the new album on its Web site on
Friday. The album, ''Conspiracy of One,'' will go on sale in stores
Nov. 14. The band originally had planned to gradually release the
entire album in advance of the store release.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who downloaded the songs would automatically be registered
to win the $1 million prize. Now, those who download ''Original
Prankster'' will be registered electronically for the contest. The
money winner will be announced Nov. 14 on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Music and other record companies go to trial Oct. 2 against
the music-sharing Web site Napster. The companies claim the site
violates copyright laws by making music available without
compensation to record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Sony had raised piracy concerns in its discussions with The
Offspring. Band members had argued that free downloading may have
enhanced sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Offspring's 1998 hit single ''Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)''
was traded on Napster and other Web sites. At the time, Rolling
Stone magazine listed The Offspring as the No. 1 downloaded band
nationwide. Wired magazine said 22 million computer users
downloaded ''Pretty Fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the illegal downloads, the album that included ''Pretty
Fly'' has sold nearly 12 million copies worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Joyce strengthens as Hurricane Isaac weakens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) - A new tropical storm strengthened in the deep
Atlantic on Tuesday as Hurricane Isaac weakened, but neither posed
any immediate threat to land, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Joyce, which formed late Monday off West Africa,
should reach hurricane strength winds of 74 mph by Thursday, said
Jack Beven, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EDT, Joyce's maximum sustained winds were 50 mph. It
was centered near latitude 11.6 north, longitude 36.1 west or about
1,575 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. It was moving
west-northwest at 13 mph and was expected to stay on that course
through midday Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beven said the weakening Isaac, now with top winds of 90 mph,
was no longer affecting Joyce's development.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are only about 800 miles apart, but they are small enough
that they aren't affecting each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac had top winds of 120 mph Saturday, but began losing power
Sunday as other weather systems began affecting it.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a day or two, Isaac could make a comeback,'' Beven said.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., Isaac was near latitude 19.1 north, longitude 45.5
west or about 1,200 miles east-northeast of the northernmost
Leeward Islands. It was moving west-northwest at 15 mph and was
expected to stay on that path through midday Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Station records show Corzine to spend $12 million on TV  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Democratic candidate Jon Corzine has spent
or signed contracts to spend almost $12 million on TV advertising
in New York and Philadelphia for the nine weeks of the fall
campaign, pushing total spending on his U.S. Senate race close to
$50 million for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Records examined by The Associated Press at the six network
affiliates show the former Wall Street executive has been spending
an average of $1.7 million a week since Labor Day on television
commercials, with ad contracts in place for another $6.9 million
between now and the Nov. 7 election.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, some 1,500 30-second spots Corzine has purchased
on the ABC, NBC and CBS affiliates in New York and Philadelphia
mean his face has been on television more than 12 hours in just
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's media buyer, Barbara Abar of Alexandria, Va., has
already reserved time for at least 90 commercials on the day before
Election Day, at a cost of some $320,000, and is in position to
reserve more.
</P>
<P>
   The ad records also show Corzine is going for the gold, plowing
almost $5 million into the NBC affiliates in both cities for
commercials to air mostly during the three-week Olympic Games,
including 30-second spots costing $63,000 each during the opening
ceremonies Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponent Bob Franks has yet to contract for any TV
air time and is expected to be weeks away from airing his first
spots, although a Republican group in Washington, D.C., began
running an independent attack ad against Corzine on radio this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Franks just recently reached the $2 million mark in his fund
raising, according to GOP party officials. Neither the Franks nor
Corzine campaigns will confirm or discuss their finances or
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine spent $36.7 million to win the Democratic primary,
according to the last required Federal Election Commission report
in June, a sum that shattered national records.
</P>
<P>
   The TV contracts examined by The AP document that Corzine has
now dumped at least another $11.9 million into this race, according
to the spending that can be specifically documented. FEC reports
due out Oct. 15 are likely to show his spending is actually much
higher with other money going for mailers, billboards, polling,
staff and field offices for Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   TV stations are required to allow public access to political
advertising contracts, but no other businesses are under such rules
and so other such spending records are not available for
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The previous top-spender in the nation was California Republican
Michael Huffington, whose $30 million outlay in a losing effort in
1994 was eclipsed by Corzine in his effort just to win the June 6
primary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, New Jersey's two U.S. Senate candidates, Republican
Dick Zimmer and Democrat Robert Torricelli, spent $18 million
combined. Torricelli won.

RETRANSMITTING
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) - The U.S. Department of Interior was
within its rights when it allowed the Mashantucket Pequot tribe to
expand its reservation in eastern Connecticut in 1995, a federal
appeals court has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a decision released
Monday, said the tribe has the right to annex land outside the
reservation boundaries that Congress set forth when it settled land
claims and granted the tribe federal recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the three-judge panel overturned a 1998 ruling
by U.S. District Court Judge Robert N. Chatigny.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Settlement Act was not, as the Connecticut plaintiffs
argue, a comprehensive statute intended to settle once-and-for-all
the extent of the Mashantucket Pequots' sovereignty,'' Judge John
M. Walker Jr. wrote. ''Nothing in the act indicates that Congress
intended to establish the outermost boundaries of the tribe's
sovereign territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on 165 acres the tribe owns across Route 2
from its reservation and its Foxwoods Resort Casino. Including that
land in the reservation would exempt it from state and local taxes,
zoning restrictions and other state jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and the three towns
that surround the reservation- Ledyard, Preston and North
Stonington - said that allowing the tribe to annex that land would
open the possibility of putting other huge chunks of tribal-owned
real estate beyond state and local jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said Monday evening that the Second Circuit decision
is likely to be challenged. ''We intend to pursue the issues
vigorously,'' Blumenthal said. ''We believe the interest of the
state and the citizens of Connecticut should be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the appeals court said it saw no reason to
restrict the 300-member tribe from seeking to annex land ''simply
because the Mashantucket Pequots now have the purchasing power to
make substantial real estate acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's decision noted that the tribe has applied to have an
additional 1,200 acres taken into trust by the Interior Department
for its reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council, in a written statement,
said they were excited by the ruling, and hope it will lead to
meaningful discussions with ''residents or the town leaders of
North Stonington, Ledyard and Preston.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We always believed that this case and the resolution of the
underlying issues were based on well-settled principles of federal
Indian law, including the long-standing foundation of
government-to-government relationships between the federal
government and Native American tribes,'' the council said.
</P>
<P>
   Preston First Selectman Robert Congdon said he had not seen the
written decision, but he promised it would be appealed.

<HEADLINE> French News Agency Chairman Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Eric Giuily, the head of the French news agency
Agence France-Presse, resigned Tuesday after a long battle to
revamp the organization's financial structure that put him at odds
with his employees and the French government.
</P>
<P>
   Giuily, who took over the post in March 1999 for a three-year
term, said in a written message to his staff that he was resigning
after the government rejected his proposals for a new financing
strategy that called for a deficit in the 2001 budget. Giuily had
proposed financing the deficit with debt.
</P>
<P>
   AFP's statute says it must have a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''I accepted the presidency of AFP in March 1999 because the
mission entrusted to me was to develop the agency,'' Giuily wrote
in the message that was released to news media. ''Today, I refuse
to share the responsibility and assume the consequences for a
decision that risks preventing the unprecedented development that
was undertaken in the 2000 budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's office declined Tuesday
night to comment on Giuily's resignation. Jospin's bureau has been
overseeing the chairman's proposals that would change the laws
governing the agency's semi-public statute to allow it to raise
public capital and take shares in other private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Agence France-Presse, known as AFP, is one of the world's top
three news agencies along with Reuters and The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Giuily said he had handed in a resignation letter to Jean-Louis
Prevost, the vice president of the board of directors, and said
departure would become effective after the next meeting of the
administration that is expected this week. Prevost will head the
agency in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   In his message to AFP employees, Giuily said that AFP had
everything it needed to stay among the top three and face the
challenge of the Internet revolution. But he said that AFP ''lacked
the capacity of financing investments necessary to adapt to the
evolution of technology and markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuily defended his strategy, saying that it was based on the
premise that the Internet was a ''historic chance for AFP'' that
would have allowed the agency to return to a path of growth.
</P>
<P>
   However, unions at the agency had opposed Giuily's plans to seek
public capital, a move that would partially privatize the company.
</P>
<P>
   AFP employs about 1,250 people in about 165 countries. Last
year, the French government provided about 43 percent of the AFP's
revenues.

<HEADLINE> Small Business Bill Fails in House  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would have allowed small
businesses to avoid liability under the Environmental Protection
Agency's Superfund program failed in the House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which was unable to get the two-thirds majority of
votes needed for passage, was voted down on a 253-161 vote. The
measure would have needed 23 other supporters in order to pass
because it was brought up under a procedure designed to limit
debate.
</P>
<P>
   It would have exempted from lawsuits families or small
businesses with 100 or fewer employees and $3 million or less in
gross revenues, if the amount of hazardous materials disposed of is
not greater than 110 gallons or 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders quickly blamed the Clinton administration for
refusing to support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''For years, the EPA talked a good game about helping innocent
small businesses but when it was time to walk the walk, the
administration did nothing but drag its feet,'' said Dan Danner,
senior vice president of the National Federation of Independent
Business. ''It's a total betrayal of small business.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, small businesses would also have been exempted
from Superfund liability if it had disposed only municipal solid
waste, such as household garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption would not have covered commercial trash
operations. The bill also would have directed the president to
expedite settlements for parties that contribute less than 1
percent of the total amount of hazardous materials at a Superfund
site.
</P>
<P>
   The Superfund program aims to force businesses to pay to clean
up toxic sites they created or contributed to. It has been
criticized for spawning costly and lengthy lawsuits that have
crippled some smaller companies, but Congress has made little
headway in years of efforts to reform the program.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, said sponsor Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, would
''provide long overdue liability relief to individuals, families
and small business owners unfairly trapped in the litigation
nightmare of the Superfund program for over two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., another sponsor, said it was
''absolutely scandalous'' that people had been targeted under
Superfund for dumping mashed potatoes or pizza boxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation was opposed by many Democrats who said that,
while they supported exemptions for small businesses, the bill had
been brought to the House floor at the end of the congressional
session without hearings or discussions with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., added that ''it creates incentives
for businesses or entities to destroy or lose records or to engage
in other rascality to achieve a preference at the expense of all of
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters, in a letter to members of
Congress, also urged opposition to the bill, noting that ''the
bill's failure to ensure that a business's parent corporation,
affiliate or subsidiary is liable for cleanup costs, may enable
businesses to escape responsiblity for their pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., has introduced similar legislation
in the Senate, but it is unclear whether the Senate will take up
the issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The House bill is H.R. 5175.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill is S. 2634.

<HEADLINE> Manhattan school district bans sponsorship of Boy Scout troops  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan school board has banned its schools
from sponsoring Boy Scout troops because the national organization
bars gay troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The board of Community School District Two passed the resolution
at a meeting Tuesday night, becoming the first district in the city
to enact such a ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an important message to send that discrimination will not
be tolerated in our schools,'' said board member Brian Ellner, who
wrote the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The ban keeps the 42 schools in the district, primarily
elementary and middle schools, from sponsoring troops, which none
of them currently do.
</P>
<P>
   It does not prevent the Boy Scouts from having access to school
grounds for meetings, or bar them from using the schools in the
same ways that other groups are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Boy Scouts can
keep homosexuals from serving as troop leaders. Since then, some
companies and organizations that have sponsored and funded the
Scouts have stopped giving and others are pondering whether to
continue doing so.
</P>
<P>
   At the public hearing before the board vote, a series of state
legislators and community residents spoke in favor of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Carson, whose son was a Cub Scout for three years,
said she appreciated the good that the Scouts did, but that it was
important to speak out against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is a way to strengthen families,'' she said of Boy
Scout activities. ''It should be something all families can enjoy
and grow from, not just some families.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone supported the resolution. Former board member
Delco Cornett called the ban a ''political attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're attacking the children,'' Cornett said of the board
members. ''The children are not attacking anybody in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of the eight board members voted to pass the resolution,
with one abstention and one absence.
</P>
<P>
   The ban is binding only on the District 2 schools, and not on
any of the 31 other community school districts. Ellner said he
hoped other districts would follow District Two's lead, and that
the board would be sending a letter to Schools Chancellor Harold
Levy in hopes of getting the city Board of Education to adopt a
similar ban.
</P>
<P>
   District Two covers schools from the southern tip of Manhattan
to 96th Street on the East Side, and up to 59th Street on the West
Side.

<HEADLINE> Polish Pres Apologizes For Video  </HEADLINE>
By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski
apologized Tuesday for goading an aide to mock Polish-born Pope
John Paul II in video footage now being used against him in an
election campaign ad.
</P>
<P>
   The video, first broadcast over the weekend, showed the aide
imitating a papal gesture and kneeling to kiss the ground at
Kwasniewski's encouragement as they arrived on a 1997 visit to the
Polish city of Kalisz.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no bad will in it. I'm very sorry that it can be
interpreted in that way,'' the Polish news agency PAP quoted
Kwasniewski as saying on a campaign trip to the southern city of
Myslenice.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no intention to offend anybody, and especially such
a great man as the pope.''
</P>
<P>
   The footage appeared in a campaign ad for Solidarity trade union
leader Marian Krzaklewski, who is among a dozen candidates
challenging Kwasniewski in presidential elections Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   It was meant to discredit Kwasniewski, an ex-communist who has a
huge lead in opinion polls, among Roman Catholics in predominantly
Catholic Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The president lashed out at what he said was an attempt by his
opponent ''to create a row between the president and the Catholic
majority in Poland.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide involved in the incident, Marke Siwiec, resigned, but
Kwasniewski has not yet accepted the resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial has sparked in uproar in an otherwise low-key
campaign in which Krzaklewski and other opponents have struggled in
vain to chip away at the president's lead in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Most surveys indicate that between 60 percent and 70 percent of
voters favor Kwasniewski, suggesting he should win easily in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident, police said Tuesday that seven people
were arrested -- including two members of Krzaklewski's local
campaign staff -- in a disturbance at a rally.
</P>
<P>
   Krzaklewski's staff said they were watching the rally
peacefully. They said the trouble started when the president's
supporters tried to wrest away a banner.
</P>
<P>
   PAP said some of those arrested had been shouting ''Drunkard!''
and ''Apologize to the pope!''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Stopgap Spending Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the two parties mired in budget disputes
and a midnight Saturday deadline looming, the House easily approved
a stopgap measure Tuesday that would keep federal agencies
functioning for six more days.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, approved 415-2, would keep government agencies open
through October 6, while White House and congressional negotiators
work through their disagreements. The Senate is expected to approve
the bill quickly and ship it to President Clinton for his promised
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Just two of the 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 2001, which
starts Sunday, have become law. The rest have bogged down as
Clinton seeks billions more dollars for schools and other programs.
Policy fights over issues including federal standards on drunken
driving and Cuban sanctions are also to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming passage underlined how, with the presidential
and congressional elections just six weeks away, neither party
wants a federal shutdown that it might be blamed for. Even so,
Democrats used the debate to criticize Republicans for not
completing their budgetary responsibilities on time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an admission of failure, a failure of the partisan ways
the Republicans run this House and their failure to do the people's
business,'' said Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legislative train derailments have become as much a part of
autumn as football,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, top
Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in turn blamed the Democrats for raising obstacles
to smooth passage of budget bills so they can talk about a GOP-led
''do-nothing'' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Put America ahead of your ambitions,'' Rep. Kevin Brady,
R-Texas, told the Democrats. ''Set aside just for a few days your
all-consuming drive to take power.''
</P>
<P>
   Several stopgap bills are likely to be needed before all the
spending bills can be completed. White House budget office
spokeswoman Linda Ricci said Clinton would sign a series of
short-term measures ''if that's what it takes for Congress to
buckle down and finish its work.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the bill were Reps. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and
Fortney ''Pete'' Stark, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term spending bills have been a fixture of autumn budget
battles in Congress for years. Since the current budget process
began in 1977, such measures have been unnecessary only three
times: in fiscal years 1989, 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, negotiations on many of the overdue spending bills
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Bargainers agreed to bar the Transportation Department from
issuing a final rule in fiscal 2001 limiting truckers' hours, said
an official familiar with the talks who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The department has been working on a rule that would
have dropped the maximum number of daily driving hours to 12 from
its current 16.
</P>
<P>
   Leading lawmakers of both parties reached a compromise to create
a major new land conservation program, a proposal that has been one
of the biggest remaining problems.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would create a six-year program, growing to $3 billion
annually by 2005, for federal and state land purchases, wildlife
management, historic preservation and other initiatives. But it was
unclear if the measure would get support from other members of
Congress or from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, House-Senate bargainers neared agreement on a $23.6
billion measure financing energy and water projects.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter, White House chief of staff John Podesta wrote
that Clinton would veto the measure if it contained a provision
blocking the Army Corps of Engineers from raising water levels on
the Missouri River, a fight that has pitted environmentalists
against downstream farmers and shippers. Republicans vowed that, at
least for now, the provision would stay in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in the latest example of the spending bills' steadily
rising price tags, the compromise energy and water measure was $1.9
billion bigger than the House-passed version, and $1.1 billion
larger than the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Included were millions for projects included in neither measure,
including $3 million for a new water project in DeSoto County,
Miss., and $3 million for work on Baltimore's harbor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young,
R-Fla., said Republicans had agreed to provide $4 billion of the $6
billion extra the White House has been demanding for a measure
financing education, health and labor programs. The overall bill
will cost more than $300 billion. But disputes remain over how much
local control to provide over federal funds for hiring teachers and
repairing schools.

<HEADLINE> Retransmitting to fix slug  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Joseph Lieberman painted Dick Cheney
as an unsympathetic and callous politician Tuesday, saying he voted
against various measures to help women and children when he served
in Congress in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's remarks, in a speech before a convention of 800
brick layers, marked his first criticism of Cheney, the Republican
vice presidential candidate. It came the same day that Cheney
criticized Lieberman for running for vice president and senator at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Cheney had opposed Head Start, the federally
funded program for preschoolers, among other measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he was in Congress in the 1980s, he voted against Head
Start funding five times, against measures important to the school
lunch program six times. He was one of only 33 members of the House
of Representatives to vote against a plan to provide a lump sum
benefit to widows and children of federal law enforcement officers
and firefighters killed in the line of duty,'' said Lieberman, the
Democratic nominee for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said
Cheney always supported Head Start, school lunches and law
enforcement officers and firefighters and their families.
</P>
<P>
   She said any votes against these programs were because he
thought the bills deserved more discussion in the House or because
he was concerned about the growing federal deficit at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss also said Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore voted
against a Head Start bill in 1981 that would have increased funding
by 16 percent, while Cheney voted for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign said Gore voted against the bill, which included
the funding increase for Head Start, because it would have slashed
funding for a host of social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss characterized Lieberman's comments as a personal attack
and said ''Gore and Lieberman would better serve the country if
they focused on producing an adequate plan to better our schools
rather than attacking Dick Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Cheney noted Lieberman's detour from the
campaign trail Monday to return home to Connecticut to stump for
his Senate re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said Lieberman's decision to proceed with his Senate
campaign showed a lack of confidence in his prospects of being
elected vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Otherwise he wouldn't be working so hard to hang onto his day
job,'' Cheney told a radio interviewer in Traverse City, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman aides denied that. Spokeswoman Kiki McLean said,
''He's committed, optimistic, and proud'' of his vice presidential
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   At the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied
Craftworkers convention, Lieberman said he was offended by
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush's claim that the
nation has fallen into an ''education recession.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I take that to be unfair and a slap to the tens of thousands
of American students, teachers, administrators, members of boards
of education that have been working so hard to ... reform America's
public schools, and they're making progress,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said SAT math scores last year were the highest since
1969 and that average test scores have risen. He admitted there is
room for improvement, but asked, ''Will we do better under George
Bush and Dick Cheney? No!''
</P>
<P>
   Before Altantic City, Lieberman visited with seniors in Union,
where he took a swipe at Bush's claim that he offers ''real plans
for real people.'' Lieberman painted Bush's Medicare proposal as
''a real problem for real seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman almost didn't make it to Atlantic City after his
campaign plane was grounded indefinitely due to a mechanical
problem. He arrived by private jet while the reporters who travel
with him were rerouted by bus to New York to rejoin him later in
the evening.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, he attended a $500,000 fund-raiser for the
Democratic National Committee. He was attending two others in New
York that were expected to raise $1.5 million, including one at the
home of Revlon Chairman Ronald Perelman and his wife, actress Ellen
Barkin.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Group To Probe FBI E-Mails  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department hired a Chicago-based
research group Tuesday to analyze whether the FBI's ''Carnivore''
e-mail surveillance system has adequate protections against abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The IIT Research Institute is an independent, nonprofit research
and development organization associated with the Illinois Institute
of Technology. The department said the review team would include
senior faculty members from the Chicago-Kent College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   The review of Carnivore, which has drawn criticism from Congress
and civil libertarians, will begin immediately and is to be
completed in December. An interim draft report will be made public
for comment in late November. The final report will be released for
public comment in December.
</P>
<P>
   The government will continue to use the system during the study.
David Sobel, counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to obtain
documents about the system, has criticized the decision to keep it
in operation while questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   The department estimated the study would cost $175,000, but the
exact amount will depend on time and materials consumed.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnivore system, installed by the FBI on the network of
Internet service providers, has software that scans Internet
traffic as it moves through that provider's network. The FBI says
it configures the software to capture e-mail to or from someone
under investigation and that court orders limit which e-mails
agents can see.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates say only the FBI knows what Carnivore can
do, and Internet providers are not allowed access to the system.
They ask why the FBI retains control of Carnivore equipment and
doesn't give it to Internet providers so they can comply with court
orders.
</P>
<P>
   The project's goal is to see whether Carnivore increases the
risk that FBI agents or someone else -- intentionally or
unintentionally, legally or illegally -- will see electronic
communications they have no right to see and whether Carnivore can
safeguard against that risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''The review team will have full access to any information they
need to perform their review,'' said Assistant Attorney General
Stephen R. Colgate, who led the selection team. ''This organization
has both the technical expertise and the dedication to the project
to provide the most thorough, independent and timely review.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said 11 private and academic organizations bid to
do the project.
</P>
<P>
   Some academics objected to department insistence on both
security checks of evaluation panel members and on veto power over
any changes in that panel, saying it could exclude critics of
government surveillance. They also criticized Justice's insistence
on the right to edit the report. The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology withdrew from the bidding because of its objections,
said a senior Justice official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   That official said the security checks were designed only to
exclude anyone with a criminal record and the veto power over
changes was to prevent the government from paying for a Nobel Prize
winner if the work was done by a graduate student. The editing
power, the official said, was included only so business secrets of
Carnivore software providers could be kept from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Rowe, a senior vice president of the IIT Research
Institute, said he was confident ''what we find will be made
available to the public.'' The work will be done at the institute's

   Legal experts were added to the team to help evaluate how a
court order would apply to the system, Rowe said. One of the team's
legal experts, Harold Krent, associate dean of Chicago-Kent College
of Law, said legal questions might include how Carnivore
differentiates between people with the same names, or those who use
aliases. He said the system also must account for people who might
be using more than one Internet service provider, such as America
Online or Compuserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''Often there are more protections with concern to government
surveillance than private ... but as citizens we should be
concerned about both,'' Krent said.
</P>
<P>
   An internal Justice team headed by Colgate will review the
report and recommend to Attorney General Janet Reno whether any
changes are needed in Carnivore's design or use.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tries To Put Myanmar on Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States wants the U.N. Security
Council to take up the issue of Myanmar's confinement of Nobel
Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, but several countries are
reluctant to put the issue on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row on Tuesday, the United States spoke
out in the council against the Myanmar military junta's crackdown
against the pro-democracy leader.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants the U.N. Secretariat to brief the
council on Myanmar's actions against Suu Kyi and her backers -- a
move that most likely would lead the council to issue a statement
taking a position on the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of delegations are reluctant to raise the issue on
grounds that it involves internal politics, or that it doesn't
constitute a threat to peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said Russia, China and Malaysia raised these
issues.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. deputy ambassador Nancy Soderberg said Tuesday that
Washington will continue to consult with council members ''to try
to work out a way forward,'' and will keep raising Myanmar's
actions in the council.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's disagreement within the Security Council on exactly
how to handle it procedurally, but we're all very concerned about
the situation there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi and eight other central executive committee members of
her party have been under virtual house arrest since Friday in the
latest crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   ''We strongly condemn these actions by the government in Burma
and call once again on them to lift the restrictions against Aung
San Suu Kyi and her supporters,'' Soderberg said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, Suu Kyi and 14 party colleagues were blocked by
security forces outside Yangon as they traveled to a party meeting
in the countryside. They were put under house arrest for two weeks,
then tried last week to travel out of the capital by train. Once
more they were stopped and confined once more.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi led a pro-democracy uprising against the military in
1988 and was put under house arrest a year later. Her National
League for Democracy won general elections in 1990, but was
prevented from taking power.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of its members have since been jailed, and the military
has rejected calls for a political dialogue with the opposition.
Suu Kyi was let out of house arrest in 1995, but her movements
remain severely restricted.

<HEADLINE> Bolivian Soldiers Fire at Farmers  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Soldiers and police fired rubber bullets
and tear gas at farmers who have paralyzed the country with
blockades to protest government efforts to destroy the country's
coca-leaf crop. Eight farmers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the government began laying off hundreds of
striking teachers and arrested the leader of the teacher's union to
halt two weeks of widespread protests. Authorities also broke up
teachers' protests with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Government ministers were negotiating with protest leaders
Tuesday evening to end what was considered the most serious
political and social unrest since democracy returned to Bolivia in
1982. President Hugo Banzer, a former military dictator, says
extremist groups linked to the cocaine trafficking industry are
trying to destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes over the coca crop took place on the road linking
Cochabamba with the Chapare, a tropical region in the heart of
Bolivia, when hundreds of soldiers cleared a roadblock. Farmers
started throwing rocks and sticks at the soldiers, who responded
with tear gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The roadblocks have seriously affected traffic and commerce in
this country of 8 million people, while blockades around the
capital, La Paz, and other major cities were resulting in food
shortages that could become critical by the weekend. The government
estimates commercial losses to have reached dlrs 65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Evo Morales, the head of the coca-leaf farmers organization in
the Chapare region in Bolivia's tropical heartland, said ''Banzer
would do us a great favor by resigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Banzer says Bolivia will no longer be producing cocaine by the
end of the year. Some 4,940 acres of coca leaf remain in the
Chapare -- just 5 percent of what existed four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, national protests have left six dead and dozens injured.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police used tear gas to break up marches Tuesday by
teachers who have been on strike for two weeks demanding a
50-percent wage hike. Some burned notices of dismissal, a day after
an order to return Monday to classrooms by Education Minister Tito
Hoz de Vila.
</P>
<P>
   Union leader Wilma Plata, who also heads a Trotskyite political
movement calling for revolution, was arrested on charges of
sedition and inciting violence. She called for the removal of
President Hugo Banzer and violent reprisals against teachers who
returned to work Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Information Minister Manfredo Kempff warned striking teachers
that if the conflicts continued the government would consider
canceling the school year, two months before its scheduled end.

   Defense Lobby Group Pushes for More Military Spending
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The military should get another $2 billion a year
to restore the forces to their former levels of readiness, the
country's largest defense lobby says.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference of Defense Associations, an umbrella group for
defense-oriented organizations, argues in a report to be released
Wednesday that increased military spending will bolster national
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investment in defense is a necessary expenditure which
benefits all Canadians either directly or indirectly,'' the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a decade of budget cuts, the military got modest
increases in the last two federal budgets, but the report says
those increases fall well short of what is needed to meet the
obligations laid out in the 1994 white paper on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Peace Alliance, which represents 300 peace-related
organizations across the country, strongly opposes more defense
spending and rejected the report's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our basic argument is that we need a public consultation,''
said Carolyn Bassett, acting co-ordinator for the umbrella
organization for peace activists.
</P>
<P>
   The present defense budget of $11.2 billion amounts to only 1.1
per cent of gross domestic product, compared with the NATO average
of 2.1 per cent.

   Ontario Urges Ottawa To Stay Out of Toronto Garbage Debate
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Ottawa should butt out of the debate over
Toronto's decision to ship millions of tons of garbage to an
abandoned mine in northern Ontario, Premier Mike Harris said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that there's any federal jurisdiction here,''
said Harris, who believes it would be ''silly'' for Ottawa to get
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that they've ever had an environmental assessment
on a dump anywhere in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan, including aboriginals in the area, say the
federal government should conduct an environmental assessment
because of concerns that toxic liquid from the mine near Kirkland
Lake, Ontario, could contaminate waterways and lakes in neighboring
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Environment Minister David Anderson has asked the
Canadian Environmental Review Agency for advice on whether Ottawa
has jurisdiction and whether it should carry out its own
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency meeting of the federal government's standing
committee on environment and sustainable development was scheduled
Tuesday night to hear concerns about the proposal.

   Saskatchewan Cabinet Ministers Weigh Chances To Replace
Romanow
</P>
<P>
   REGINA, Saskatchewan (AP) -- The political posturing to replace
Roy Romanow began in earnest Tuesday as cabinet ministers met for
the first time since the Saskatchewan premier's announcement he was
going to quit.
</P>
<P>
   And with the resignation earlier this summer of Dwain
Lingenfelter -- former deputy premier, agriculture minister and once
thought heir apparent to the throne -- the field is wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Of Romanow's senior ministers thought to be interested in the
post, so far only Janice MacKinnon, acting deputy premier and
economic development minister, has said she won't enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a decision I made some time ago,'' said MacKinnon, who
was first elected when the NDP took power in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has to do with timing. To me, being leader of the NDP means
a commitment to running in three or four more elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Health Minister Pat Atkinson said she was waiting to see who
else would be interested in running for leader before she made any
decisions about her own bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something I'm thinking about and I'll have something to
say about in the days ahead,'' said Atkinson.
</P>
<P>
   Environment Minister Buckley Belanger said he was also weighing
his options and expected to make an announcement soon.
</P>
<P>
   The NDP holds 28 seats in the legislature, compared with the
Saskatchewan Party's 26. There is one vacancy.

   Federal Fisheries Launch Raid on New Brunswick Aboriginal
Fishermen
</P>
<P>
   BURNT CHURCH, New Brunswick (AP) -- Native warriors took to the
waters of Miramichi Bay as federal Fisheries Department vessels
launched another raid Tuesday on aboriginal lobster traps.
</P>
<P>
   RCMP and coast guard helicopters swept overhead as the two sides
played cat-and-mouse just off the shores of the Burnt Church
reserve in northeastern New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   About six native warrior boats raced after a dozen Department of
Fisheries and Oceans vessels. The speedier fisheries boats were
able to escape direct confrontation with the aboriginals after
quickly seizing several steel traps and destroying some wooden
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a bunch of crooks and thieves, stealing our traps --
and our lobster, too,'' said Mi'kmaq Chief Wilbur Dedam, who was
aboard one of the warrior boats.
</P>
<P>
   Just offshore, two native fishermen in a small boat quickly
pulled lobsters from their traps, baited their pots, then tossed
them back in the water.
</P>
<P>
   RCMP and warriors who were on the water confirmed there were no
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Allain, regional director for DFO, said a small number of
traps were seized.
</P>
<P>
   The latest raid came hours after native fishermen replaced some
of the more than 1,300 lobster traps already seized recently by
government boats and moved others into more productive waters.
</P>
<P>
   Allain said only about 250 to 300 traps, located directly in
front of the reserve, remain.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Abortion Procedure Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to ensure that a fetus
that is breathing when it leaves the mother's womb, even if during
an abortion procedure, would be treated as a person under federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, passed 380-15, states
that an infant would be considered to have been born alive if he or
she is completely extracted or expelled from the mother and
breathes and has a beating heart and definite movement of the
voluntary muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the bill was needed because of several recent
Supreme Court decisions stated that the government's interest in
protecting the unborn child is related to ''viability,'' or the
point at which the child can survive independently of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is intended to clarify misconceptions that may arise
because of the court's ruling, said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.,
the measure's sponsor. ''As members of this House, we should do
everything we can to protect the most innocent and helpless members
of the human family.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the measure was unneeded because children born
alive are protected under existing laws. Some accused Republicans
of trying to score political points.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of this bill is only to get the pro-choice members
to vote against it. . . so they could say we support infanticide,''
complained Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ''This bill is
unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights groups said the legislation was another effort
to chip away at the 1972 Roe v. Wade decision making most abortions
legal.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League said
the bill ''would effectively grant legal personhood to a pre-viable
fetus -- in direct conflict with Roe -- and would inappropriately
inject prosecutors and lawmakers into the medical decision-making
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has not taken up the bill and is unlikely to do so in
the few remaining days of this session. In that event, the measure
would die, although the next Congress could come up with its own
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes have made little headway in other legislative
efforts this session. Both the House and Senate passed bills
banning the abortion procedure opponents call ''partial birth''
because it involved partially extracting the fetus through the
birth canal. But they have not sent a compromise bill to President
Clinton, who has promised to repeat his vetoes of 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in June also threw out Nebraska's state ban on
the procedure, saying it violated women's constitutional rights by
imposing an ''undue burden'' on their decisions to end their
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The House has also passed a Canady-backed bill that would make
it a crime to harm a fetus during a violent act against a pregnant
woman. But again the Senate, generally more reluctant to take up
abortion-related measures, has not acted.
</P>
<P>
   Members voting against the latest bill were Reps. Julia Carson,
D-Ind., Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., John
Dingell, D-Mich., Jesse Jackson, D-Ill., Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga.,
Chaka Fattah, D-Penn., Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., Nydia Velazquez,
D-N.Y., Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Maxine
Waters, D-Calif., Charles Gonzalez, D-Texas, Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. and
Mel Watt, D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Three members voted present -- Reps. Maurice Hinchey, D-N.Y.,
Janice Schakowsky, D-Ill. and Louise McIntosh Slaughter, D-N.Y.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Safe Beaches Measure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coastal states would begin monitoring the
safety of its beach waters and notifying the public under a measure
passed by the House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of the bill on a voice vote now sends the measure to
President Clinton, who is expected to sign it into law. The Senate
gave final approval to the bill last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real triumph for coastal communities, ocean
enthusiasts, and in fact all beach users across the country,'' said
Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., who sponsored the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Families from across the country will be able to go to the
beach with the expectation that it is either safe to go into the
water, or they will be informed if it is not,'' Bilbray said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner said
the bill ''will greatly expand the public's right-to-know about
threats from pollution to our beaches and to our health.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure provides coastal states with incentives and money to
develop and implement a specific monitoring and notification
program for its recreational waters.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Loses Congress Majority  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- In the turbulent wake of his former spy
chief's escape to Panama, President Alberto Fujimori lost his slim
majority in Congress on Tuesday as lawmakers defected from his
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   With the defections of three lawmakers opposed to his plan for
new elections, Fujimori appeared to no longer be able to count on a
majority to pass laws at his whim -- a difficult situation for an
iron-fisted president unaccustomed to negotiations or compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori seems intent on charting his own exit from power and
maneuvering a candidate of his choosing into the presidential
palace next July. But laying the necessary legislative groundwork
will be difficult with only 59 seats in the 120-member Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The new resignations from his ruling party raise the number of
legislators who have abandoned Fujimori's ranks to five since the
Sept. 14 release of a video apparently showing deposed spy chief
Vladimiro Montesinos bribing an opposition congressman to join
Fujimori's block in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Undoubtedly, today we are left in the minority,'' Congressman
Carlos Leon Trelles, a member of Fujimori's Peru 2000 political
alliance, told Radioprogramas on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have to view the situation and with the utmost order
try to be able to share the government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders upped their call for Fujimori's immediate
ouster after he allowed Montesinos to flee to Panama, escaping a
deepening corruption scandal that forced Fujimori's Sept. 16 call
for a special election in which he would not be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hold President Alberto Fujimori personally responsible for
Vladimiro Montesinos' escape,'' said Congressman Jorge del
Castillo. His left-leaning Aprista party issued a statement saying
Fujimori should be tossed from office ''for moral incapacity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Panama, where many officials have resisted giving Montesinos
asylum, the Foreign Ministry ordered seven Peruvians who arrived
with the spy chief Sunday -- including a general -- out of the
country. It gave no reason, saying only that they were ''not
tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Peruvian legislators came to Panama to ask its leaders not
to grant Montesinos asylum. One, legislator Mercedes Cabanillas,
said the Peruvian opposition might seek to have him extradited home
to face charges.
</P>
<P>
   Panama is still considering whether to grant asylum to
Montesinos, who the government said Monday it gave a 30-day tourist
visa.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Peru fear the judiciary -- seen as under Montesinos'
control -- will never follow through with charges against the former
spy chief.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, prosecutor Nina Rodriguez submitted a motion to
quash the investigation into the bribery scandal, a Public Ministry
spokesman told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Alejandro Toledo called the move
''counterproductive'' to negotiations with Fujimori's government,
which resumed Tuesday under the auspices of the Organization of
American States. The opposition had demanded Montesinos' arrest as
a condition for progress in the dialogue on the democratic
transition.
</P>
<P>
   The United States backed OAS efforts to press Panama to take in
Montesinos, whose powerful military allies, it was feared, would
rebel if he were prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori met Tuesday with U.S. Ambassador John Hamilton and Gen.
Peter Pace, recently appointed commander of U.S. military
operations in Latin America, in the country on a routine
introduction tour, according to the U.S. Southern Command in Miami.

<HEADLINE> Novelist Jeffrey Archer Charged  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- He couldn't have written it better himself.
</P>
<P>
   Best-selling novelist and fallen politician Jeffrey Archer,
whose public life has been a series of cliffhangers, was charged
Tuesday with perjury, just hours before his stage debut in a
production of his new play ''The Accused.''
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Archer, 60, showed up at Wimbledon police
station in southwest London in a chauffeur-driven BMW to be charged
with perjury and perverting the course of justice for allegedly
asking a friend to lie in a libel case 13 years ago. The friend
also was charged.
</P>
<P>
   Archer then went straight to the Theatre Royal in Windsor, 25
miles west of London, joined the cast in a final dress rehearsal,
then -- in the best show biz tradition -- went on with the show when
the curtain went up in the evening for the opening.
</P>
<P>
   He portrays a doctor accused of poisoning his wife, and at the
end of the play the audience is left to decide whether his
character is guilty or not, using special electronic keypads. On
Tuesday, at least, fate swung in Archer's favor: The audience ruled
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   A former legislator and former deputy chairman of the
Conservative Party, the novelist became Lord Archer in 1992, when
he received a life peerage.
</P>
<P>
   A flamboyant character and successful fund-raiser who has
maintained a position on the fringes of political power for
decades, Archer has bounced back time and again from brushes with
scandal, financial ruin and the law.
</P>
<P>
   The libel case resurfaced in November as Archer was making his
most recent bid for political office -- as Conservative Party
candidate for London mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1987, Archer had filed and won the libel suit after the
tabloid Daily Star accused him of hiring a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   However, under tabloid pressure last year, Archer acknowledged
that he had asked his friend Ted Francis to lie in the libel case
and say they had dinner together on a night when he was actually
dining with a close female friend.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, who is married to a former Cambridge University
academic, said the lie was not relevant to the lawsuit and was only
intended to protect the woman he was with.
</P>
<P>
   Archer dropped out of the mayoral race and was expelled from the
party for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Archer could face a maximum of seven years in jail if convicted
of perjury. Attempting to pervert the course of justice can
theoretically result in a life sentence, but such a harsh penalty
is virtually never imposed.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for ''The Accused,'' meanwhile, found themselves in
possession of the hottest tickets in town.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Lee Menzies said Archer was coping with his new role.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an actor and he is working very hard and taking it very
seriously,'' said Menzies. ''He's got a job of work to do, which
he's doing wonderfully well.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The play is sold out until Thursday and sales are going very
well,'' said theater spokesman Craig Titley, who insisted it was a
coincidence that opening night fell on the day Archer was charged.
''There is no way this is a publicity stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The play, inspired by the libel affair, was not the first time
Archer had drawn on personal experience in his writing.
</P>
<P>
   Archer was elected to the House of Commons at age 29 in 1969,
but within five years he had to resign after bad investments drove
him to bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   That experience inspired his first book, ''Not a Penny More, Not
a Penny Less.''
</P>
<P>
   His third novel, ''Kane and Abel'' and the U.S. television
miniseries it spawned, transformed Archer into a publishing
powerhouse. In 1991, he signed a three-book deal with HarperCollins
for $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Archer was scheduled to appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court
in central London on Oct. 3.

challenger finished first in Yugoslavia's presidential election and declared a
runoff -- defying demands at home and abroad that he step down. Opposition
candidate Vojislav Kostunica rejected an Oct. 8 runoff, calling it a ''fraud''
and insisting that he won Sunday's election outright. The opposition called for
a rally Wednesday night in downtown Belgrade to ''celebrate its victory'' --
apparently hoping for a show of strength to demonstrate to Milosevic the
public's refusal of a runoff.

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Unleashing a fresh round of fury against
economic globalization, 5,000 protesters marched on the IMF and World Bank
summit meeting on Tuesday, throwing firebombs, sticks and rocks at police who
responded with clubs, tear gas and water cannons. The enemies of capitalism
didn't get the 20,000 activists they had hoped for but were still able to raise
a ruckus that left at least 69 people injured and turned Prague into a smoky
battle zone.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- In the turbulent wake of his former spy chief's escape to
Panama, President Alberto Fujimori lost his slim majority in Congress today as
lawmakers defected from his ranks. With the defections of three lawmakers

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is hanging onto a slim lead in the hotly contested
state of Michigan, a new poll suggests, aided by his appeal with union voters
and a public perception that he is running a more positive campaign than George
W. Bush. The poll in this battleground state with 18 electoral votes comes as
national tracking polls indicate the race has grown very close nationwide. The
Democratic vice president leads Bush, the Republican governor of Texas, 45
percent to 41 percent in Michigan in a new CBS-New York Times poll of likely

had wanted the nation's highest court to hear arguments this winter and issue a
ruling in the spring, but the justices granted Microsoft's request to send the
case to the federal appeals court.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Prod GOP on Minimum Wage  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats in Congress prodded congressional
Republicans Tuesday to pass legislation raising the minimum wage,
at the same time accusing them of trying to use the issue to strip
some workers of their ''overtime protections.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it is imperative that the more than 10 million
workers who earn the minimum wage receive an increase as soon as
possible,'' Democrats said in a letter prepared for delivery to
Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have pressed without success for the past two years
for passage of a minimum wage increase, but thus far majority
Republicans have not brought any legislation to the floor of either
house of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, R-Ill., wrote President Clinton a month ago with the
outlines of a minimum wage proposal. The elements included a $1 an
hour increase in the $5.15 minimum wage in two steps over the next
15 months; several changes in work rules; and tax breaks he said
were designed to help small businesses adjust to the increased
labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hastert's office nor Lott's had any response to the
letter, signed by Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, his House
counterpart, Rep. Dick Gephardt, as well as other lawmakers
including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and House
Democratic Whip David Bonior, Democratic point men on the minimum
wage fight.
</P>
<P>
   Talks aimed at achieving a bipartisan compromise have sputtered
since then and the letter to the GOP leaders, signed by top
Democrats in the House and Senate, marked a public point-by-point
rebuttal to several of the points the speaker outlined a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not fair to raise the minimum wage, while at the same
time taking away overtime protections for millions of hard-working
Americans,'' the Democrats wrote. They charged that the speaker's
proposal would adversely affect some sales personnel, computer
professionals and funeral home employees, as well as some hourly
workers who are paid bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   They also called for an increase in the wage floor set for
restaurant workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot support your proposal to strip states of the power
to raise their guaranteed base wage for tipped employees above the
current federal level,'' they said. ''In fact, federal tip wages
have not been increased since 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also expressed concerns about the overall size of
Hastert's proposed tax breaks, estimated to cost $76 billion over
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   They said a proposal to make it easier for individuals to take
tax deductions for their health costs could ''discourage employers
from providing health coverage for their workers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We would also like a clearer understanding of how this tax
proposal fits in with your commitment to devote 90 percent of the
surplus to paying down the debt,'' they said.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Naked Neighbor Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A man who did not recognize a naked
intruder as his neighbor and fatally shot him was arraigned Tuesday
on charges of voluntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Bruce L. Castor Jr. said Paul J. Bellina was
justified in firing the first of several shots at Craig Holtzman
when Holtzman entered his home Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   But Bellina, 52, committed a crime when he chased the wounded
man into another neighbor's back yard and shot him three times in
the head, Castor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presumption that you are in danger ends when the threat
leaves your home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Castor said Holtzman, 31, had returned from a night of drinking,
taken off his clothes before going to sleep, and later walked into
his backyard to relieve himself. Holtzman then mistakenly went into
Bellina's home, thinking it was his own, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Castor said he did not believe murder charges were justified
because Bellina did not appear to have had malicious intent.
</P>
<P>
   Bellina, who was freed on $30,000 bail, declined to comment
Tuesday but said shortly after the shooting that he did not
recognize Holtzman and had never seen him before.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he could be sentenced to 20 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Ivorian Junta Leader Rejects Efforts  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Defiant under pressure from fellow
African heads of state, Ivory Coast's junta leader on Tuesday
rejected outside efforts to resolve his nation's mounting political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders will not be allowed to ''impose what must be in Ivory
Coast,'' Gen. Robert Guei told a throng of 300 supporters outside
presidential offices in the main city of Abidjan. ''We have all the
solutions to all our problems,'' Guei said.
</P>
<P>
   Guei spoke the day after seven African state leaders, including
the presidents of regional powerhouses South Africa, Nigeria and
Algeria, traveled to Abidjan to meet with Guei and a spectrum of
Ivory Coast political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Guei said the visit, which came after he declined to attend a
Sunday crisis summit held in neighboring Togo and forbade
opposition leaders to go, took place ''in the spirit of
brotherliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Some among the cheering crowd chanted anti-foreigner slogans and
angrily denounced the African delegation for alleged meddling in
Ivorian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Simmering xenophobia and ethnic tensions have added to Ivory
Coast's political crisis, which centers on questions of whether one
of Guei's top rivals, opposition leader Alassane Dramane Ouattara,
should be allowed to run against Guei in presidential elections set
for Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The regime has suggested he may be ineligible under a new
constitutional provision because at least one of Ouattara's parents
was born in Burkina Faso. Ouattara, a northerner in a political
arena long dominated by southerners, insists both his parents were
Ivorian-born.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommendations by the African delegation Monday was a
proposal to allow all candidates on the ballot. Ouattara, a former
International Monetary Fund deputy managing director, was prime
minister for three years in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of supporters have surrounded his home in the capital,
Abidjan, fearful the junta is planning his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have stayed high since an alleged assassination attempt
Sept. 18 on Guei -- with strengthened roadblocks and new rumors
daily sweeping the capital of upcoming measures against opposition
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Guei came to power in a December coup, the first in the 40-year
history of Ivory Coast. The junta has weathered two smaller
military uprisings since then, shaking the stability that has
helped make the country a financial center in troubled West Africa.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Fla. Investor Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said Tuesday it will use the
case of a Florida investor who lost $515,000 in a never-developed
golf and beach club to decide how much protection from lawsuits
should be accorded to federal banking insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The justices voted to consider reinstating Bruce Murphy's
lawsuit stemming from the 1991 insolvency of Southeast Bank. Their
decision, expected by late June, should resolve a point of bank
insurance law that has split the federal appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who resides in Palm Beach County, Fla., invested 11
years ago in Orchid Island Associates Limited Partnership as part
of a development project for a golf and beach club in Indian
County, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Bank lent Orchid about $50 million for the project and
foreclosed on the property when the limited partnership defaulted
on its loans.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy sued after the bank was declared insolvent and placed
into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Co. His 1992
lawsuit against the FDIC contended that Southeast Bank had acted as
a joint venturer with Orchid and that their joint misdeeds caused
the loss of his investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused
last April to send Murphy's case against Jeffrey H. Beck, appointed
by the FDIC to handle Southeast Bank's affairs, to a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court relied on a 1942 Supreme Court decision that
barred private investors from holding federal insurers responsible
for some alleged secret agreement not found on a bank's records.
</P>
<P>
   There was no formal joint-venture agreement between Orchid and
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Other federal appeals courts have ruled that a 1989 federal law,
the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,
supersedes the rule announced by the Supreme Court in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's Supreme Court appeal asks the justices to resolve that
split.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Murphy v. Beck, 00-46.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rallies Echo Prague Protests  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Demonstrators marched through downtown
Tuesday, one of several U.S. rallies held in sympathy with protests
in the Czech Republic against the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, demonstrators targeted companies for allegedly
ignoring workers' rights. In Hartford, 300 people demonstrated to
accuse United Technologies Corp. of allowing subcontractors to pay
low wages to janitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone deserves dignity and a living wage,'' said Jeff
Klein, a student at Wesleyan University. About 20 people were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington D.C., 35 people were arrested after blocking a
downtown street.
</P>
<P>
   In Prague, thousands of people demonstrated outside the IMF and
World Bank summit, throwing firebombs as police responded with
clubs and tear gas. Dozens were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters say economic globalization helps the rich get
richer at the expense of the poor and the environment. Top
officials with IMF and World Bank insist they are major providers
of economic assistance and development loans.
</P>
<P>
   Rallies in the Boston area were aimed at pharmaceutical giant
Pfizer Inc. and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Activists accuse Pfizer of profiting on its AIDS drugs even as
infection rates rise in Africa and other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''My country is being destroyed by AIDS, my country is sinking
under the weight of debt,'' said the Rev. Tsitsi Moyo of Zimbabwe.
''If the debt is not canceled, if AIDS is not curtailed there is no
hope for my country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, Ore., about 80 people marched through downtown.
Fifteen protesters were arrested after a police officer was
assaulted and an anarchist symbol was painted on a billboard,
according to Lt. Mike Hefley, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Most were charged with interfering with a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, about a dozen protesters sat in a line in front of
police in riot gear. Officers removed them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want peace against the brutality, the harassment, the
animal cruelty, we have a right to be here. We didn't bring any
weapons or anything,'' said Brandy Carroll, 16.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, roughly 100 protesters gathered downtown,
chanting rhymes and carrying signs and banners including one that
read, ''Citi Bank: Rainforest Destroyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Protests also were held in Denver and Indianapolis, where about
20 people gathered outside a Citigroup bank to protest Salomon
Smith Barney's underwriting of World Bank bonds.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Raoul Berger, a former Cincinnati Symphony
Orchestra violinist who changed careers to become a law professor
and author of books about presidential issues, died Saturday. He
was 99.
</P>
<P>
   Among his seven books, Berger wrote ''Impeachment,'' published
just before President Richard Nixon left office in 1974. Berger
contended that the Constitution allowed impeachment for abuse of
office and that it was not necessary for the president to have to
be indicted on criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Berger wrote ''Executive Privilege'' after Nixon resigned from
office. In it, Berger dismissed arguments that the president had
authority to keep governmental matters secret from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was the Cincinnati Symphony's associate concertmaster
from 1928 to 1932. He founded the Cincinnati String Quartet and
co-founded the Cincinnati Chamber Music Society.

</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy veteran made his name as president of the Cahill
Construction Co. of San Francisco, the business his father started
in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Among the firm's more famous buildings: St. Mary's Cathedral,
the San Francisco Hilton, Opera Plaza and the California Academy of
Sciences in Golden Gate Park.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, the American Institute of Architects honored Cahill for
the construction of San Francisco's John Hancock building.

Heberto Padilla
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Heberto Padilla, a Cuban poet who was
persecuted in his homeland for his criticism of Fidel Castro, died
Monday. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, he composed odes to love and life in the tropics. But
in 1968, he criticized the Castro regime with his book ''Out of the
Game.'' The state-sponsored Union of Cuban Writers and Artists gave
him its highest literary prize, but then was forced to issue a
statement that ran as an appendix to his book and criticized it as
counterrevolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla, placed under state surveillance, was arrested in 1971
when Cuban officials learned he was writing a novel the government
considered an affront.
</P>
<P>
   In virtual house arrest by the Cuban government since 1971,
Padilla moved to the United States in 1980 after Sen. Ted Kennedy
intervened. President Reagan honored Padilla in a nationally
televised address.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Padilla taught literature at several
universities, including Princeton, New York University and the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he published ''Heroes Graze My Garden,'' the novel that
Cuban police had been seeking in 1970 and which Padilla smuggled
out of Cuba as a satchel of letters.
</P>
<P>
   A memoir of his two decades under Castro was published in 1990
as ''Self-Portrait of the Other.''
</P>
<P>
Baden Powell
</P>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Baden Powell, a pioneer of bossa
nova who was more popular abroad than at home, died Tuesday of
pneumonia and multiple organ failure. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The composer-musician is regarded as a key figure in the history
of bossa nova, Brazil's jazzy samba music that gained worldwide
popularity in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, he moved with his family from the rural interior to
Rio, where his music teacher introduced him to the legendary
musician and composer Pixinguinha. Powell later worked with other
top names in Brazilian music, including Antonio Carlos Jobim and
Vinicius de Moraes.
</P>
<P>
   With his trademark turtleneck and acoustic guitar, Powell
attracted a following in Europe and lived for years in Germany. In
Brazil, bossa nova's popularity soon waned and Baden Powell
remained little known.

Horacio Rivero
</P>
<P>
   CORONADO, Calif. (AP) -- Horacio Rivero, the U.S. Navy's first
four-star admiral of Hispanic ancestry, died Sunday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Rivero received an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1927
and graduated third in his class in 1931 and earned a Bronze Star
during World War II as a gunnery officer in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War, Rivero commanded the amphibious transport
Noble for a year, then returned to the United States. During the
Cuban missile crisis in October 1962, he was commander of
amphibious forces for the Atlantic Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first four-star admiral of Hispanic heritage with
a 1964 appointment. The first Hispanic admiral appointed by the
Navy, before the four-star designation, was David G. Farragut, the
son of a Spanish immigrant, in 1866.
</P>
<P>
   From 1961 to 1968, Rivero held the No. 2 post in the Navy as
vice chief of naval operations. He later became commander of Allied
Forces in Southern Europe before retiring in 1972 and accepting an
appointment as U.S. ambassador to Spain.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese World War II fighter ace Saburo Sakai, who
downed 64 enemy planes and then went on to reconcile with his
former foes and urge his nation to face its wartime past, died
Friday of a heart attack. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   While Sakai gained fame as a young man for his aviation
exploits, he later became known as a symbol of reconciliation and
an advocate of confronting Japan's war guilt head-on.
</P>
<P>
   Late in life, Sakai said he felt no bitterness toward his former
enemies, even though he was wounded four times and blinded in one
eye.

R.S. Thomas
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- R.S. Thomas, a priest and Welsh nationalist who
became one of Britain's most admired poets, died Monday. No cause
of death was given. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   His style was spare, his words plain, and he was sometimes
compared to Robert Frost.
</P>
<P>
   As a Welsh nationalist he advocated legislation barring English
people from buying property in Wales, but his poetry was all
written in English. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in
literature in 1996.

Bush Sees 'Really Close Race'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George W. Bush said today that recent swings in the polls
point to a ''really close race'' against rival Al Gore and that he is eager to
go ''toe to toe'' with him next week in the first televised debate. The
Republican presidential nominee also predicted the FBI would soon find out how a
bootleg tape of his debate preparations ended up with the Gore camp. ''I believe
we're going to get to the bottom of it and I look forward to finding out who it
was,'' Bush said in an interview on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''

Milosevic Calls For Runoff Vote

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic conceded Tuesday that his
challenger finished first in Yugoslavia's presidential election and declared a
runoff -- defying demands at home and abroad that he step down. Opposition
candidate Vojislav Kostunica rejected an Oct. 8 runoff, calling it a ''fraud''
and insisting that he won Sunday's election outright. The opposition called for
a rally Wednesday night in downtown Belgrade to ''celebrate its victory'' --
apparently hoping for a show of strength to demonstrate to Milosevic the
public's refusal of a runoff.

Poll: Gore Has Edge in Michigan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is hanging onto a slim lead in the hotly contested
state of Michigan, a new poll suggests, aided by his appeal with union voters
and a public perception that he is running a more positive campaign than George
W. Bush. The poll in this battleground state with 18 electoral votes comes as
national tracking polls indicate the race has grown very close nationwide. The
Democratic vice president leads Bush, the Republican governor of Texas, 45
percent to 41 percent in Michigan in a new CBS-New York Times poll of likely
Michigan voters.

Court Delays Microsoft Resolution

whether Microsoft must be broken up could be years away. The Justice Department
had wanted the nation's highest court to hear arguments this winter and issue a
ruling in the spring, but the justices granted Microsoft's request to send the
case to the federal appeals court.

Jones captured gold in the 100 meters last weekend but since then has been

She won her first-round heat in the 200 in 22.75 seconds Wednesday (Tuesday
night EDT).

<HEADLINE> Ferry Boat Sinks in Aegean Sea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A Greek ferry carrying about 500
passengers sank after hitting a reef near the Aegean Sea island of
Paros, coast guard officials said. At least 13 people on board were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   A port official also suffered a heart attack and died after
hearing news of the sinking, the coast guard said.
</P>
<P>
   Coast guard Chief Andreas Sirigos said the ferry boat Samaina
sank after hitting a reef late Tuesday in rough seas about 2 miles
off the popular resort island. Dozens of fishing boats and other
vessels rushed to the scene and helped in the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen people from the boat were confirmed dead, Sirigos said.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, authorities on Paros counted at least 357
survivors at the main health center and were canvassing the island
to see how many others were staying at hotels and homes. The
whereabouts of the remaining passengers was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and emergency crews were being airlifted to Paros from
nearby islands to provide assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry makes regularly scheduled runs from the Athens port of
Piraeus to the island of Samos.

<HEADLINE> Welsh Nationalist R.S. Thomas Dies  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- R.S. Thomas, a priest and Welsh nationalist who
became one of Britain's most admired poets, has died. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas died Monday, his family said. No cause of death was
given.
</P>
<P>
   In his poems, Thomas gnawed relentlessly at his preoccupations:
the English speaker who learned Welsh and identified with the
nationalist cause, the naturalist resentful of technology, and the
priest haunted by the silence of God.
</P>
<P>
   His style was spare, his words plain, and he was sometimes
compared to Robert Frost.
</P>
<P>
   He was a difficult and prickly man -- perhaps deeply shy as well
-- who rarely offered help to biographers. As a Welsh nationalist he
advocated legislation barring English people from buying property
in Wales, and supported arsonists who attacked English property,
but his poetry was all written in English. He was nominated for the
Nobel Prize in literature in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Stuart Thomas was born March 29, 1913, in Cardiff, Wales,
but grew up speaking English. He was ordained a priest of the
Church in Wales, the Anglican church in the principality, in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas showed no enthusiasm for the Welsh language until about
1940, when as a curate in Talarn Green he began taking weekly
lessons. His interest deepened while he was rector of Manafon, from
1942-54, where the hardworking hill farmers became his poetic
subject.
</P>
<P>
   His development as a poet was spurred by his courtship of
Mildred Eldridge, later his wife, who had established a reputation
as a painter. ''This made me wish to become recognized as a poet,''
Thomas said in his article for the Contemporary Authors
Autobiography Series. She died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   His subject was personified in the poems by the recurring figure
of Iago Prytherch, a farm laborer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' treatment of the farmers was unsentimental: ''I now
found myself amongst tough, materialistic, hardworking people, who
measured one another by the acre and by the pound .... What was in
their minds, I wonder? The question remains unanswered to this
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The peasant isolated on his hillside links Thomas to his later
concentration on the priest facing a silent God, as in his poem
''Kneeling'':
</P>
<P>
   Moments of great calm,
</P>
<P>
   Kneeling before the altar
</P>
<P>
   Of wood in a stone church
</P>
<P>
   In summer, waiting for the God
</P>
<P>
   To speak; the air a staircase
</P>
<P>
   For silence; the sun's light
</P>
<P>
   Ringing me, as though I acted
</P>
<P>
   A great role. And the audiences
</P>
<P>
   Still; all that close throng
</P>
<P>
   Of spirits waiting, as I,
</P>
<P>
   For the message.
</P>
<P>
   Prompt me, God;
</P>
<P>
   But not yet. When I speak,
</P>
<P>
   Though it be you who speak
</P>
<P>
   Through me, something is lost.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning is in the waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The English language has lost one of the greatest poets of the
20th Century and one of the greatest religious poets of that
century,'' said Damian Walford Davies, lecturer in English at the
University of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is survived by his son Gwydion, from his first marriage,
and by his second wife, Elisabeth Vernon. Funeral details were not
immediately available.

<HEADLINE> House Weighs Palestinians Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House debated a measure Tuesday night to
cut off all except humanitarian aid to the Palestinians should
Yasser Arafat unilaterally declare a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was brought the floor ahead of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's scheduled testimony Wednesday before the House
International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told senators earlier Tuesday that senior Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators had arrived in Washington at the request of
President Clinton to try again to arrange a peace settlement. ''We
are giving it the full-court press,'' she said before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman had no immediate comment Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Clinton administration has questioned the
wisdom of singling out the Palestinians but not the Israelis for
actions that could hinder the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But in a fast-track maneuver designed to push the measure onto
the floor, the House International Relations Committee passed the
bill late Tuesday and then brought it to the floor for debate. A
vote was scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is significantly tougher than resolutions passed by
both the House and the Senate last year urging President Clinton to
renounce Arafat should he make a unilateral declaration of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the measure does not allow for U.S. recognition of a
Palestinian state in any way. Diplomatic recognition would be
withheld as well as all U.S. assistance to the Palestinians, except
for humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians' office in Washington would be downgraded and
other countries and international organizations would be encouraged
to join the United States in withholding diplomatic recognition for
a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The president would also be authorized to withhold payment and
U.S. contributions to any international organization that
recognizes a unilaterally declared Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal's sponsor, Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman
of the House International Relations Committee, called it a
''forceful response to a real possibility.'' He said Congress
needed to act before adjourning next week.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Urban League president resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A leader in a struggling neighborhood who
earlier this year left the faltering charter school he founded has
now resigned as president of the Urban League of Northeastern New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Dare said on Tuesday that he quit the community group that
had sponsored the New Covenant Charter School in Arbor Hill, a
neighborhood with a 39 percent poverty rate located near the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Dare first resigned from the charter school in June as the
chairman of the board of trustees and then left the board
altogether in the wake of a state report alleging he mishandled
school funds.
</P>
<P>
   Separate critical reports released by the Charter School
Institute and the state Education Department this summer cited the
school's poor performance and management problems, as well as its
failure to create a permanent facility.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Transit Talks Break Off  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HARRIGAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Talks between Los Angeles' regional
transit agency and the union representing striking bus and rail
operators broke off Tuesday with each side denouncing the other for
the 11-day strike's latest impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations ended despite a proposal offered by state fact
finders to get the two sides to sit down face to face.
</P>
<P>
   James Williams, chief negotiator for the United Transportation
Union, blamed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for
refusing to consider the fact finders' points of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am saddened by the latest turn of events,'' Williams said
during a news conference. ''I thought we had criteria set that
could be the focus of further negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   MTA officials, in a news conference immediately after the union
announcement, denied rejecting the fact finders' offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The union said they were not negotiating, and we can't
negotiate with ourselves,'' MTA chief executive officer Julian
Burke said. ''This shouldn't have happened. It's an impossible
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTA's 4,300 bus drivers and rail operators make an average
of $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   MTA officials also faulted union representatives for not
responding in writing to the agency's original contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have never received a counteroffer,'' said Don Knabe, a Los
Angeles County Supervisor and MTA board member. ''We're offering
$43 million in pay raises and want $30 million in work rule
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   That position was echoed by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan,
who said: ''Taxpayers and transit-dependent Angelenos should be
outraged by the union's refusal to negotiate and provide any
meaningful counterproposal to the MTA.''
</P>
<P>
   Union and transit agency officials were in separate rooms most
of the previous three days. Williams said the negotiators were
face-to-face for no longer than 30 minutes during that period -- as
state mediators shuttled between the two camps in the Pasadena
Hilton hotel, 10 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Williams wouldn't reveal details of the state proposal, but said
the union was willing to discuss it -- even though some aspects were
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fed up,'' he said. ''I've had all that I can take. It
looks like we'll have to walk the picket lines.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the drivers union planned to hold a rally at Los Angeles
City Hall on Friday urging the mayor and county supervisors to
pressure the MTA board.
</P>
<P>
   Bus drivers and rail operators walked off the job Sept. 16, with
MTA clerks and mechanics honoring their picket lines. The strike
has left some 450,000 commuters scrambling for alternate
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit by the strike have been the region's working poor,
with MTA surveys showing that Southern California bus and rail
commuters earn an average of $15,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA is looking for ways to close a projected $438 million
operating deficit over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It wants to hire more part-time operators and drivers at
entry-level wages and cut overtime costs 15 percent. The bus
drivers and train operators, who say they are fighting to preserve
middle-class jobs, want more money for pensions and for a health
care trust administered by the union.

<HEADLINE> Bush Sees 'Really Close Race'  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George W. Bush said Tuesday that recent
swings in the polls point to a ''really close race'' against rival
Al Gore and that he is eager to go ''toe to toe'' with him next
week in the first televised debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential nominee also predicted the FBI would
soon find out how a bootleg tape of his debate preparations ended
up with the Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we're going to get to the bottom of it and I look
forward to finding out who it was,'' Bush said in an interview on
CNN's ''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not one of my supporters,'' Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   His comments on the mysterious delivery of the tape came as his
campaign accused the FBI of not being aggressive enough in
questioning Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife Laura appeared on King's show while
campaigning through California.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that I'm this close to a sitting vice president with
the economy pretty good and the world at peace indicates I've got a
very good chance,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third popular talk show Bush has appeared on in a
week.
</P>
<P>
   King noted that Bush's poll ratings had climbed after he greeted
Oprah Winfrey with a kiss, and wore a lookalike dark-on-dark outfit
on Regis Philbin's show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine if I'd have worn suspenders,'' Bush joked with the
coatless, suspender-clad King.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who wore a business suit, sat next to his wife and
answered questions from King and telephone callers during the
hourlong session. He appeared relaxed and upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had written off any states at this point in the
campaign, with six remaining before Election Day on Nov. 7, Bush
paused a second and said, ''that's a tough question ...''
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' Laura Bush interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that, even though he trails Gore in the polls here,
''I'm going to win California.'' He asserted that he had strong
support among those in Silicon Valley and among Hispanic voters in
addition to traditional GOP areas of the state.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush courted West Coast voters, his spokeswoman, Karen
Hughes, suggested the FBI wasn't being aggressive enough in
investigating how a bootleg tape of Bush's debate preparations
ended up with Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She also told reporters the FBI should seize hard drives from
computers in Gore's campaign headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., as
part of its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said she and other top Bush aides ''would all be happy''
to take lie-detector tests, if necessary, to prove they did not
pass along the debate tape.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an employee of Bush's media consultant said she was
questioned by the FBI after mailing a parcel Sept. 11 containing
Gap pants from an Austin post office, an event captured by a
security videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ''They kept saying, 'Those weren't pants in that package,'''
Yvette Lozano said in an interview with The Dallas Morning News,
posted on its Web site Tuesday. She denied mailing any Bush debate
package, which mysteriously showed up at a Gore campaign office
Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano works for Mark McKinnon, an ad man for Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Carole Florman refused to comment
Tuesday on Lozano's account that she was interviewed by the FBI
last Thursday and Friday, when the woman said she also was
fingerprinted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've tried to be very careful and circumspect in this case,''
Florman said, refusing to identify whether the FBI had any
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush preparation tapes were mailed to former Rep. Tom
Downey, who was helping Gore with debate preparation.
</P>
<P>
   On King's show, Bush praised Downey for turning over the tape to
the FBI -- and withdrawing from further debate preparations with
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I ever run into the guy, I'm going to tell him I appreciate
his honesty,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the recent swing in the polls, in which Gore surged
after the Democratic convention and Bush closed some of the gap in
the past week, Bush said, ''I think this means it's going to be a
really close race.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the upcoming presidential debates, Bush said he wasn't
nervous -- and was looking forward to them.
</P>
<P>
   Should third-party candidates Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader be
included? ''I think the American people want to see Vice President
Gore and me go toe to toe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he hoped to overcome a ''gender gap'' that has
seen Gore with more support among women voters than he has.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'm going to eventually do well with women for a
couple reasons. One is because I've got a clear vision of how to
improve our public education.''
</P>
<P>
   The other, he said, was ''I've got a clear vision of how to
provide people with more time. And that is to give them some of
their own money back'' in terms of a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent a second day promoting his 10-year, $47 billion
education package and reiterating his claim that the nation was in
the grip of an ''education recession.'' He released a TV commercial
echoing the argument.

<HEADLINE> Hammer Thrower Fails Drug Test  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- World record-holder Mihaela Melinte of
Romania was escorted off the Olympic Stadium track infield
Wednesday (Tuesday EDT) just before she was to throw in the hammer
competition. She has been suspended for testing positive for
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that rarely, if ever, has occurred in an Olympic
competition, officials approached the 1999 world champion minutes
after she walked onto the infield and told her she would not be
allowed to compete. They then walked with her out of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Melinte was suspended just two days ago by the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, the governing body for track and
field, IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said.
</P>
<P>
   Melinte, 25, tested positive for metabolites of nandrolone at a
meet in Milan, Italy, on June 7, according to Arne Ljungqvist, IAAF
medical commission chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone is the same substance that American shot put world
champion C.J. Hunter tested positive for earlier this year,
according to international track officials. Nandrolone helps
athletes gain strength and muscle bulk by repairing the damage of
high-level training and competition.
</P>
<P>
   Reineri said the Romanian federation had not suspended Melinte,
so the IAAF took action.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federation was informed in a letter on Sept. 25,'' Reineri
said. ''If they don't take the action, we can only stop the
athlete. The athlete was not supposed to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The sample was analyzed at the International Olympic
Committee-accredited lab in Rome, but the IAAF wasn't notified by
the lab until Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF asked for further analysis, and the final confirmation
came only a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We delivered the necessary information to all those concerned
in due time,'' Ljungqvist said. ''It should not have happened this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Reineri said this is not the first time an athlete has been
pulled from an event shortly before the competition, but this might
have been the most dramatic, since it came moments before she was
to throw.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Melinte knew of the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad she won't be here,'' said Debbie Sosimenko of
Australia, who had the third-best throw in the qualifying. ''I
wanted to see a record throw, but it does push me up another place.
She came to the stadium with us and was sitting down when the
officials told her she could not compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Melinte set the world record of 249 feet, 6&AMP;frac12; inches on Aug. 29,
1999, in Rudlingen, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   She accompanied the other throwers into the stadium for the
second group of hammer qualifying Wednesday morning. At that time,
the IAAF notified Sydney Olympic organizers that she should not be
allowed to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were informed by the IAAF that we should escort her off the
field, which we did,'' said Jayne Pearce, a spokeswoman for Sydney
Olympic organizers. ''We would never do that on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the latest in a series of embarrassments and
controversies surrounding the Romanian Olympic team. Two Romanian
weightlifters were expelled for failing pre-game,
out-of-competition drug tests. The entire Romanian weightlifting
team was to be kicked out of the games, but paid a $50,000 fine to
allow those who had not tested positive to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Romanian gymnast Andreea Raducan was stripped of her gold from
the women's all-around Tuesday after she tested positive for
pseudoephedrine, a banned stimulant. She is the first gymnast ever
to be stripped of a medal because of a drug violation.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Bank Robbery Suspect Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) -- Police searching for a bank robber shot
and killed the suspect in a crowded department store cafe Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified man was shot to death in a back hallway of the
Nordstrom Grill, where he had been sitting after apparently
changing his clothes in a bathroom, Bellevue Police spokeswoman
Marcia Harnden said.
</P>
<P>
   No one else was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he sat down, he was very anxious looking, fidgeting,''
Patti Anderson, who was at the cafe, told KIRO-TV.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant is on the second floor of the upscale apparel
store at Bellevue Square, a mall in the center of this city east of
Seattle. Police were searching the mall after the robbery of a Bank
of America branch a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Harnden said the man, in his early 20s, was sitting in the cafe
when police arrived. He ran to the back hallway, where another
officer was waiting.
</P>
<P>
   He then allegedly pulled a gun. Two policemen fired four shots
at the suspected robber, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the cops yell, 'Get down!' and shots,'' said cook Levi
Stearns. ''It was that quick.''
</P>
<P>
   The dead man had an undisclosed amount of money in his backpack,
Harnden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nordstrom store was closed for the rest of the day. The mall
housing the department store remained open.

<HEADLINE> Jones Wins Olympic 200-Meter Heat  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Marion Jones, back in the sanctuary of
the track after a day spent defending her husband, resumed the
quest for five gold medals at the Sydney Games by winning her
qualifying heat of the women's 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Jones captured gold in the 100 meters last weekend but since
then has been engulfed in controversy surrounding husband C.J.
Hunter's positive drug tests. She won her first-round heat in the
200 in 22.75 seconds Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   There was other drug news at the track.
</P>
<P>
   World record-holder and world champion Mihaela Melinte of
Romania was escorted away by officials when she tried to compete in
the women's hammer throw, two days after Romanian officials were
informed she had failed a pre-games drug test. This is the first
Olympics for the women hammer throwers, and the first time anyone
could recall seeing an Olympic athlete removed from the field
because of a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Reineri, spokesman for the International Amateur
Athletic Federation, said Melinte tested positive for nandrolone --
the same drug found in Hunter's system. He said the Romanian team
was informed of her suspension on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   IAAF medical commission chairman Arne Ljungqvist said Melinte
tested positive at a meet in Milan, Italy, on June 7, and should
never have been at the track Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We delivered the necessary information to all those concerned
in due time,'' Ljungqvist said. ''It should not have happened this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones received loud applause when introduced before her heat,
and responded with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   The second round of the 200 was set for later in the day, as
were the qualifying rounds of the women's long jump -- another event
for Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've said it all along. Today was going to be the most
difficult because of two rounds of the 200 and having to jump,''
she said. ''I tried to conserve my energy in the first round. I
felt good. Now I want to get off my feet. I hope I can run an easy
200 tonight and I'm not scared of injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Also advancing to the second round were U.S. teammates Torri
Edwards and Nanceen Perry. Edwards was a late replacement for
reigning world champion Inger Miller, who withdrew with a severely
strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Joining them in the second round was 400-meter champion Cathy
Freeman, who qualified by placing third in her heat. The crowd
roared for Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really needed it,'' Freeman said of the race. ''I will feel
better as the rounds progress. If there was one I could afford to
relax in, it was that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Marla Runyan, the first U.S. paralympian to reach the Olympics,
passed her first test at the Sydney Games by advancing out of the
qualifying rounds of the women's 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan, who is legally blind, was joined in the semifinals by
compatriot Suzy Favor Hamilton. But Shayne Culpepper, a late
replacement for the ailing Regina Jacobs, was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Also ousted was defending champion Svetlana Masterkova of
Russia, who stopped running after about 50 meters. Masterkova, the
reigning world champion, also won the 800 meters at the 1996
Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan, who has an incurable retina condition called Stargardt's
Disease that has reduced the middle of her eyesight, qualified by
placing seventh in her heat in 4 minutes, 10.83 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Visually there were no excuses and no problems, except the
finish was very crowded,'' Runyan said. ''The track was fine. It
was great running in this stadium in front of this crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Favor Hamilton, who also had to overcome major obstacles to
reach Sydney, won her heat in 4:08.08. She had Achilles' tendon
surgery last year and also had to deal with the suicide of her
brother. To remember him, she has resumed using her maiden name --
Favor -- in competition.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan and Favor Hamilton still face a daunting task in the
1,500. No American woman has won an Olympic medal at that distance.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper was ninth in her heat in 4:12.52. She got a spot in
the event when Jacobs, among the favorites in the 1,500, withdrew
because of a respiratory ailment.
</P>
<P>
   American Chris Huffins led after three events of the decathlon.
He had 2,773 points for a 44-point lead over Erki Nool of Estonia.
World champion and 1996 Olympic bronze medalist Tomas Dvorak of the
Czech Republic was fourth.
</P>
<P>
   All three Americans won their heats in the first round of the
men's 200. Floyd Heard, John Capel and Coby Miller -- running with a
U.S. flag painted on his forehead -- easily qualified for the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   Ato Boldon, silver medalist in the 100 last weekend, won his
heat in 20.52 seconds. He is the pre-race favorite, since Michael
Johnson and Maurice Greene were injured in the 200-meter final at
the U.S. trials and failed to qualify in that event.
</P>
<P>
   Christie van Wyk of Namibia finished his 200-meter heat in 46.57
seconds, hobbling across the finish line clutching his right thigh
and then refusing an offer of a wheelchair and limping off the
track.
</P>
<P>
   Americans Connie Price-Smith, Jesseca Cross and Teri Tunks all
failed to advance out of the qualifying rounds in the shot put.
</P>
<P>
   Cross also failed to advance out of the qualifying rounds in the
hammer throw, but U.S. teammates Dawn Ellerbe and Amy Palmer both
reached the final. It was during the qualifying rounds that Melinte
was escorted off the track.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were informed by the IAAF that we should escort her off the
field, which we did,'' said Jayne Pearce, a spokeswoman for Sydney
Olympic organizers. ''We would never do that on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase, none of the three
Americans -- Mark Croghan, Anthony Cosey and Pascal Dobert --
advanced to Friday's final.
</P>
<P>
   Libbie Hickman reached the final of the women's 10,000 meters,
but U.S. teammates Jenn Rhines and Deena Drossin failed to advance
out of the qualifying heats.

<HEADLINE> Royals 7, Tigers 6  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BRISENDINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Luis Ordaz hit a game-winning single in
the ninth inning as the Kansas City Royals rallied from four runs
down to beat the Detroit Tigers 7-6 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon led off the ninth with a triple down the
right-field line off Willie Blair (10-6). Ordaz, inserted as a
defensive replacement in the eighth inning, then singled in the
winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Bottalico (9-6) pitched the last two outs of the Detroit
ninth for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Deivi Cruz, Bobby Higginson and Dean Palmer homered for the
Tigers, who led 5-1 in the fifth inning before being undone by poor
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals scored three unearned runs with help from three
Detroit errors to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Beltran hit a two-run single in the sixth to cut the
Tigers' lead to 5-3. One of those runs was also unearned, after
Billy McMillon misplayed Dye's single to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals tied it in the seventh. Detroit starter Brian Moehler
left after issuing back-to-back walks to open the inning. First
baseman Hal Morris threw Johnny Damon's sacrifice bunt away at
third, allowing one run to score. Dave McCarty then tied it with a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   After Cruz homered in the eighth to give the Tigers a 6-5 lead,
the Royals tied it in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Randa reached on Palmer's throwing error and moved to second
when Beltran walked. After a sacrifice bunt advanced the runners,
Gregg Zaun hit a sacrifice fly to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson's three-run homer with no outs gave the Tigers a 3-0
lead in the top of the first. Palmer added a two-run shot in the
fifth for a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those home runs came off Royals starter Mac Suzuki. He
gave up five runs on six hits in five innings, walking two and
striking out five.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki is 0-3 with two no-decision in September.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler gave up five runs -- three earned -- and eight hits in
six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Detroit right fielder Juan Gonzalez will miss the remainder
of the season with a herniated disk in his back. He had missed the
previous five games with back spasms. ... Higginson's homer was his
29th, extending his career high. Palmer also has 29 homers, tying
him with Higginson for the team lead. ... Royals shortstop Rey
Sanchez was a late scratch from the lineup. He has been undergoing
treatment for an ulcer and is listed as day-to-day. ... The Royals
have given up 231 homers, most in the majors. ... George Brett's
contract as a vice president for baseball operations of the Royals
has been extended three years. Brett, elected to the Hall of Fame
in 1999, began working in the Royals front office after he retired
following the 1993 season.

<HEADLINE> Demonstrators echo Prague protests  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Demonstrators ignored a steady rain and
marched through downtown Tuesday in one of over 50 U.S. rallies
held in sympathy with protests against the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank summit in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In many places the demonstrations included protests against
companies accused of ignoring worker rights. In Hartford - where
about 300 people braved the elements - the target was United
Technologies Corp., which the protesters condemned for allowing
subcontractors to pay low wages to janitorial employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone deserves dignity and a living wage,'' said marcher
Jeff Klein, a student at Wesleyan University.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 people attempted to block a city street and were
arrested outside the offices of UTC, a conglomerate whose
operations include Otis elevators, Carrier air conditioners and
Pratt &AMP; Whitney jet engines. The protests added to the rain's
effect on rush hour, as police blocked several downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not trying to ruin people's days,'' said organizer
Crystal Haviland. ''We're just trying to get the message out.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., police took just half an hour Tuesday
morning to clear demonstrators who had blocked a busy downtown
street. In all, 35 protesters were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were charged with failing to obey a police
officer and face a maximum penalty of $100.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people turned out for a demonstration at Skyline Park,
a favorite haunt of homeless, runaway and otherwise disaffected
teens in downtown Denver.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen were dressed all in black, with black hoods and
bandanas on their faces. They chanted an anti-IMF slogan, while
Jill Dreier of Denver banged a drum marked: ''Dare to Keep the CIA
off Drugs!''
</P>
<P>
   ''Even in these boom times I think people everywhere are
discontented,'' she said. ''Everybody has something that bothers
them, no matter how much money they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Passers-by paid little attention to approximately 20 people
gathered outside a Citigroup bank in Indianapolis to protest
Salomon Smith Barney's underwriting of World Bank bonds.
</P>
<P>
   A group of young men screamed, ''Say yes to democracy!'' and
laughed as they read from pamphlets handed out by protesters.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, around 100 protesters gathered Tuesday
afternoon down the street from Citi Group offices, chanting rhymes
and carrying signs and banners bearing messages like ''Citi Bank:
Rainforest Destroyer.''
</P>
<P>
   While the protest was primarily against the IMF, the crowd also
rallied against local issues, such as the increasing displacement
of the city's lower income renters by the hot housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-globalization rallies were also held in the Boston area at
the laboratories of pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Activists accused Pfizer of profiting on its AIDS drugs even as
infection rates rise in Africa and other developing countries. They
blame the World Bank and the IMF for economic strictures on those
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''My country is being destroyed by AIDS, my country is sinking
under the weight of debt,'' said Rev. Tsitsi Moyo of Zimbabwe. ''If
the debt is not canceled, if AIDS is not curtailed there is no hope
for my country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Prague, where the annual meetings of the 182 nations that
belong to the two agencies are being held, protesters threw
firebombs, sticks and rocks at police who responded with clubs,
tear gas and water cannons.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies' top officials insist that they are not the enemies
of the world's 2.8 billion poor but are major providers of economic
assistance and development loans.

<HEADLINE> Fox Lands Exclusive Baseball Rights  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox landed exclusive TV rights to major league
baseball's postseason and All-Star game from 2001-2006 with an
offer of about $2.5 billion, The Associated Press learned.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and ESPN declined to match Fox's offer for their postseason
packages by Tuesday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball planned to announce the deals Wednesday, a
baseball official said on the condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have notified major league baseball that we have passed on
their offer and we wish them well going forward,'' NBC Sports
president Ken Schanzer said Wednesday (Tuesday EDT) from Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN spokesman Mike Soltys would not comment on whether the
cable channel decided to keep its playoffs rights. ESPN is owned by
The Walt Disney Co., as is ABC.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball official, speaking on the condition he not be
identified, confirmed ESPN passed, saying the decision was partly
based on price and partly because ABC wasn't interested in the
network package.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN began an $800 million, six-year regular season contract
this season, with about $40 million attributed to this year.
</P>
<P>
   With the new Fox contract averaging about $417 million, and the
remainder of the ESPN contract averaging $152 million, the two
deals give baseball an average of about $570 million per season, or
$19 million for each of the 30 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball scheduled a telephone conference call of its executive
council for Wednesday to discuss the deals before they are
announced publicly at 1 p.m. EDT, an baseball official said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will lose baseball for the second time in 12 years. It
broadcast the sport from 1947 through 1989, often as baseball's
sole national network, then renewed the relationship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That $570 million figure represents an increase of 50 percent
from the $380 million per season baseball averaged the past five
years from its contracts with ESPN and its five-year deals with Fox
and NBC, which expire after the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball originally hoped to capitalize on the recent trend of
escalating rights fees by tripling its intake.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's $2.5 billion outlay, which would also cover an extension
of current deals for regular-season games on Fox and its cable
outlets, was confirmed by three TV industry and baseball sources
speaking on condition they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining the relative ratings boost from the league championship
series and World Series meant more to Fox than the other broadcast
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Fox had the biggest prime-time ratings decline of the four major
networks during the 1999-2000 season. Its average prime-time
audience of 8.97 million was down 17 percent from the year before,
according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   The last time one broadcast network owned the full baseball
package was 1990-93, when CBS lost hundreds of millions of dollars
in a $1.057 billion deal, partly because of a steep decline in
ratings and partly because of a national recession.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current deals, Fox and NBC split the league
championships and alternated televising the All-Star game and World
Series. Now Fox will have the TV rights to all of those events for
six seasons, in addition to its regular-season rights.
</P>
<P>
   The extra load of first-round playoff games could be eased by
shifting some to cable channel Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Fox rejected the baseball's demand that the network
increase its yearly payments from $120 million to $360 million,
while NBC declined to up its payments from $80 million to $240
million.
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions allowed baseball to try to sell its rights on
the open market. But CBS and ABC weren't interested in buying the
rights at the prices baseball was offering.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of rising rights fees started three years ago, when
the NBA agreed to four-year deals with NBC ($1.75 billion) and
Turner Broadcasting ($890 million) for $2.64 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, CBS, Fox and Disney agreed to contracts with the NFL
totaling $17.6 billion over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   In November, CBS held on to the NCAA basketball tournament with
an $11 billion, six-year contract that goes into effect in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Cuba 3, Russia 2  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A sensational comeback by the Cubans
was undone by one of the mental mistakes for which they have become
known.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Dennis, the most talented hitter on a team loaded with
fine athletes, sent his jump serve straight into the net, giving
Russia a dramatic 21-25, 25-23, 25-19, 19-25, 15-13 victory
Wednesday (Tuesday night EDT) and a spot in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will play the Brazil-Argentina winner in Friday's first
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   In the other quarterfinals, underdog Australia played tournament
favorite Italy, and defending Olympic champion the Netherlands took
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had an 8-3 lead in the fifth game, with the winner
needing to reach 15 points and win by two. Cuba came back to take
an 11-10 lead with strong blocking, and after Russia surged ahead
14-11, the Cubans rallied once more to get within 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   The drama ended quickly, however, as Dennis hit the ball off the
lower part of his palm and into the midsection of the net. He sank
to his knees, his head in his hands. Teammate Alan Roca helped him
up and took him toward the net for the congratulatory handshaking
with the Russians, but Dennis was inconsolable, keeping his hands
to his face.
</P>
<P>
   Burly, bearded Russian coach Genadi Chipolin, meanwhile, leaped
out of his chair and rolled around on the floor as his players
raised their arms in victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans, led by Dennis and brothers Osvaldo and Ihosvany
Hernandez, played the most breathtaking volleyball of the
tournament, but their errors -- whether it was hitting, serving or
blocking -- cost them. They were swept by the Netherlands and
Brazil, and only made the quarterfinals because Spain and Egypt
were so weak in their group.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's last Olympic medal was a bronze in 1976, and now the best
it can do is fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which won six straight medals, including three golds,
between 1964 and 1988, is trying to return to prominence after a
seventh-place finish in Barcelona and a fourth-place showing in
Atlanta.
