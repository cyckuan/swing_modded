<HEADLINE> Iraq Finishes Distribution Plan of Third Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh said today that Iraq has finished the distribution
plan for the third phase of the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Saleh told a news conference here that the plan would be
presented to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan within the next few
days for approval.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced earlier that it would not sell oil under the
third phase of the deal until the U.N. agrees to its new plan for
distribution of food, medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said that he expected Iraqi oil export to resume after
Annan approves the new plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that concerning food supplies, the new plan was
similar to the previous one in items and amounts, and the same
applied to medicine, with particular emphasis on hospital needs
of medical appliance.
</P>
<P>
Saleh noted that the oil-for-food deal which was signed last
year had actually succeeded in funding the United Nations and the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarmament in Iraq, but
failed in relieving the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq has demanded no increase in oil exports for the
third phase, well aware that any such expansion will not attend
to the wants of the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Saleh confirmed that Iraq had received none of the supplies or
equipment ordered for electricity, agriculture, water
purification, primary and higher education and municipality
sectors. He said that only 17 percent of the contracted medicine
had arrived in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> GCC Summit Agrees on Political Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing summit of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) today agreed on the political
issues which will be touched in its final communique, sources
close to the summit said.
</P>
<P>
The final communique of the summit may include political issues
such as ties between GCC member states with Iran, situations in
Iraq and the Middle East peace process, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
They said the leaders of the six GCC Arab states have formed a
joint stand on relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The final communique is expected to call on Iran to solve its
dispute with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the three islands
of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa in the Gulf by peaceful
means, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been making efforts to improve the relations with its
Arab neighbors. The Islamic summit held on December 9-11 in Iran
set a stage for it to push for the goal. Iran's President Mohammed
Khatami expressed readiness last week to visit the UAE to discuss
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political, economic and defense alliance,
opened its 18th summit here Saturday, which was attended by the
heads of state of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar
and Oman.
</P>
<P>
The final communique will urge Iraq to comply with the United
Nations Security Council resolutions to eliminate all its weapons
of mass destruction, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they said, GCC leaders have agreed it is necessary
to lift the crippling economic sanctions imposed by the U.N. on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait to alleviate the sufferings
of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process will be highlighted in the final
communique, according to the sources, who said that GCC leaders
will call on the international community to take a firm stance
toward Israel's intransigent policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen arrived in Tel Aviv today for a
three-day official visit to Israel at the invitation of his
Israeli counterpart David Levy.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued at the airport, Qian said, "since
the establishment of diplomatic ties five years ago, the friendly
relationship between China and Israel has been developed smoothly,
the mutual understanding has constantly been deepened and
cooperation scope has been expanded day by day."
</P>
<P>
He said "more exchange of visits by leaders of the two
countries under the current new international situation would be
conducive to the enhancement of friendship between our two
peoples and to the improvement of friendly cooperation between our
two countries."
</P>
<P>
Qian said, "both Chinese and the Jewish nationalities have
long histories and splendid cultures, which have made great
contributions to the civilization and progress of the mankind."
</P>
<P>
The further development of the relations between China and
Israel is not only in accordance with fundamental interests of the
two peoples, but also in the interest of peace and developments of
the region and the world at large, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, he would meet and have talks with
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister David
Levy. They would exchange views on bilateral relations, the
Middle East peace process and other issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Qian believed that his visit would further promote mutual
understanding and the already friendly ties between China and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
This is Qian's second visit to Israel. He last came in 1992
when the two countries established diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the third leg of Qian's current Middle East tour
which has already taken him to Lebanon and Syria. Qian will
continue his trip to the Palestinian self-rule areas and
Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Envoy: US Continues to Pursue Diplomatic Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. diplomat said
today that the United States, while having not ruled out military
action, continues to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the
standoff with Iraq over access for U.N. inspectors to suspected
weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we believe that through diplomacy, through Security
Council resolution, through a united allied response, that has
worked," U.S. envoy to the United Nations Bill Richardson said on
the NBC program "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
"That's what we're continuing to pursue but patience is
eventually going to run out," Richardson added.
</P>
<P>
He said there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and
"there has to be full access to all sites including the
presidential sites."
</P>
<P>
But Iraq has banned the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
dismantling the country's weapons of mass destruction from checking
presidential sites. On Saturday, Iraqi officials denied that any
weapons were hidden in the so-called presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy threatened that military force has not been
ruled out and such actions could be conducted under existing UN
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We have said we have not ruled any options out, including the
military option," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Student Leader Calls for National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean student leader
today urged the government has to take initiatives to forge real
national unity based on cordial race and tribal relations at
grassroot level.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Shumba, President of the Student Representative
Council of the University of Zimbabwe said, December 22 is Zimbabwe's
first National Unity Day. The government should institute
reconciliatory programs in primary schools to allow children to
respect other tribes and races.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow Zimbabweans will celebrate the signing of the Unity
Accord in 1987 between the former Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) led by President Robert Mugabe
and the Patriotic Front-Zimbabwe African People's Union (PF-ZAPU)
headed then by the now Vice-President Joshua Nkomo.
</P>
<P>
The accord brought to an end years of conflict between the
government forces and dissidents loyal to the former PF-ZAPU.
</P>
<P>
"We hail the unity accord signed between the two veteran
politicians but this kind of unity has to come also from the
grassroot level. It has only been unity for the top leaders when
in fact there is a lot of animosity among the ordinary citizens,"
said Shuma.
</P>
<P>
Children need to be taught that we are all equal so that when
they become national leaders they will not be biased towards
their own tribe or race, he said.
</P>
<P>
Evidence at most of the country's institutions of higher
learning showed that there was no real unity, especially between
the Shona and the Ndebele speakers.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative for the government to also look into the
issue of development in various provinces in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Of late we have noticed that some areas are better developed
than others and this does not go down well with some people who
think other provinces are being favored so development should be
at par to avoid further straining relations," he said.

<HEADLINE> IMF New Outlook Lowers Global Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- In considering the impact
brought by the economic and financial chaos in Southeast Asia, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) today lowered its projections
for the global growth in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
In its Interim Assessment of the World Economic Outlook
officially published here Sunday, the IMF revised almost all
previous October projections for the global economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest assessment, the global economic growth
is pegged at 4.1 percent, 0.1 percent lower from the October
projection. IMF also projects a 3.5 percent growth in 1998, a 0.8
percent chop from the previous projection.
</P>
<P>
For the world's most industrialized G-7 nations which include
the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United
Kingdom and Canada, the economic growth could pick up by 2.8
percent in 1997, no change from the October projection, but they
are expected to grow by a 2.3 percent in 1998, 0.2 percent lower
from the previous projection.

As for the developing countries as a whole, their growth in
1997 is projected at 5.9 percent as against 6.2 percent in the
October projection. They may grow by a 4.9 percent in 1998, 1.3
percent lower from the October projection. Of the Asian countries,
Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines, all members of the
ASEAN, are projected to have a 4.0 percent growth in 1997 and 1.7
percent in 1998, which represent 1.6 and 3.7 percent lower
respectively from the October projection.
</P>
<P>
The economic and financial crisis that rocked Southeast Asia in
July 1997 has continued to deepen and broaden since the IMF's
October 1997 World Economic Outlook was written, the IMF report
said. As investor sentiment toward the emerging market countries
has deteriorated, not only has the crisis spread to several other
economies in Asia, but spillover effects have felt throughout the
global financial system.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has brought downward pressure on the currencies of
countries perceived as vulnerable---typically those countries
whose competitive positions have deteriorated as a result of the
large currency depreciations in southeast Asia, those that exhibit
potentially unsustainable current account deficits, and
especially those that have relied excessively on short-term
borrowing, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Since last Summer, some Asian nations have undertaken a series
of rigid adjustment programs with assistance from the
international institutions and other countries. At present, it is
far from clear that market turbulence has ended, and more
uncertainty than usual applied to any assessment of the most
likely future course of developments. If everything goes well,
1999 will witness gradual pickup in some affected nations in the
wake of significant slowdown in growth in 1998, even though the
upturn may not be quite as rapid as the V-shaped recovery
experienced by Mexico and Argentina following their 1994-95
crisis. If policy and reform efforts are inadequate, the IMF
warned, the crisis of confidence may persist and continue to
spread to other emerging market countries. In that case, there
would be more serious implications for financial flows to these
countries for a more extended period.

<HEADLINE> Floods Force Prices Rise in Dar es Salaam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Prices of food and
other commodities in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam have
gone up because of transportation problems brought about by
floods.
</P>
<P>
Floods caused by above-average seasonal rains over the past
three weeks have wreaked havoc on bridges, roads and railways,
making it difficult to transport food.
</P>
<P>
Most staple food and vegetable prices in the Dar es Salaam
markets have increased by a large margin from two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
At Kinodoni Cemetery Market tomatoes and onions have run
short, with a kilogram of each variety go at around 1,000
shillings (about 1.6 US Dollars) compared to 500 shillings sold
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"The rains have made transportation of tomatoes and onions
from the producing areas difficult and expensive," Saidi Rajab, a
vegetable vendor, said at the market on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Price of rice at Kinodoni, Kisutu and Ilala markets currently
range from 450 to 700 shillings, against 350-600 shillings two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Price of Irish potatoes has risen from 150 to 300 shillings
per kilogram. Price hikes of other vegetables are: carrots, from
500 to 800 shillings, and green beans, from 800 to 1,500
shillings.
</P>
<P>
Prices of chicken have shot from 1,000 to 1,600 shillings per
kilogram and steak from 1,400 to 2,000 shillings.
</P>
<P>
"This Christmas is going to be the most difficult one as
everything seems to be too expensive," a customer, named Ana
John, lamented at the Ilala market.
</P>
<P>
Christmas tree which was sold between 1,000 and 7,000
shillings last year, is priced between 2,000 and 10,000 shillings
at present.
</P>
<P>
Extensive damage of roads, bridges and railways by floods have
also hindered transportation of cargo from the capital to
upcountry areas. Several regions in the country are likely to
face acute shortage of fuel, with 30 fuel tank wagons being
stranded in Dar es Salaam, said Rogart Kisanga, Tanzania Railways
Corporation Acting Director General.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leonean Army Officers Get Promotions from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Sierra Leone's
military junta Major Johnny Paul Koroma, who is also
commander-in-chief, has approved a number of promotions in the
military.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted military sources in
Freetown as saying that 13 lieutenant-colonels were promoted to
the rank of colonels, while at least seven majors were upgraded
to lieutenant-colonels.
</P>
<P>
Two brigadiers were also appointed on Saturday, increasing the
number to four, with dozens of privates and other ranks being
promoted, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The promotion came after the cabinet reshuffle in the military
government on Monday, when three ministers were dropped.
</P>
<P>
It also followed at the heels of Koroma's statement of delay
to hand over power to the civilian government led by President
Ahemd Tejan Kabbah who was ousted in the military coup on May 25
this year.
</P>
<P>
Koroma, who agreed to step down by April 22 next year, said
Friday that he was unlikely to honor the deadline for the
handover because of delay in the disarmament process and
distribution of relief goods by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Koroma's move to reconstitute the cabinet and promote military
officers is seen by observers here as a step to consolidate
internal solidarity for a longer stay.
</P>
<P>
They are expecting more actions from west African countries to
deal with the situation in Sierra Leone as leaders of the
countries have called on the junta to adhere to the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
They also appealed to the United Nations to deploy military
observer's mission in the troubled country to monitor the
disarmament of the country's combatants, including the national
army.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional peacekeeping force has also been mandated to
close the airstrip of an airport in Sierra Leone, which is said
to be used by the junta for importing arms and other supplies in
violation of the sub-regional and U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Meets Chinese Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad met here today with visiting Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to discuss the Mideast peace process
and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president welcomed Qian's visit to Syria, saying
that relations between the two countries are firm. Syria, he said,
adheres to the ties of friendship with China under all conditions,
expressing the hope that these relations will undergo further
development.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad reaffirmed Syria's adherence to the Mideast peace
process as a strategic option. He expressed Syria's desire to
reach a just and comprehensive regional settlement through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the international community sought peace in
the Middle East region, "the Israeli government ignores this
desire."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Qian said that "we appreciate Syria's pursuit of a
policy of independence and non-alignment and the safeguarding of
the just interests of Arab states and the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said that there could be no
settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict without Syria's
participation.
</P>
<P>
China supports Syria's call for the resumption of negotiations
along the Syrian-Israeli track from the point they have reached
before suspension, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Golan Heights, he added, are indivisible part of the Syrian
territories, and China supports all Syrian efforts to restore the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the land-for-peace is the basis for resolving the
Middle East problem. It conforms with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions, and should constitute the grounds for the
establishment of just and comprehensive peace in the region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Qian said the bonds of friendship and
cooperation between China and Syria have undergone satisfactory
development since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1956.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people highly esteem the existing
friendship between the two countries and wish to further develop
these cordial relations under the new situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian also met with Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud Zouebi today.
</P>
<P>
Qian arrived here Saturday for a two-day official visit to
Syria, the second leg of his Mideast tour which has taken him to
Lebanon and will also take him to Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rules out Dismantling Jewish Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated today that Israel will not evacuate
any Jewish settlement in the Palestinian territories in the final
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the cabinet on his meeting with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in Paris Thursday, Netanyahu said that
Israel's policy against dismantling settlements is very clear.
</P>
<P>
While the cabinet meeting was going on this morning, hundreds
of Jewish settlers gathered outside the prime minister's office
protesting against U.S. pressure on Israel to stop expanding
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The protesters later marched to the U.S. consulate in East
Jerusalem continuing their demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the cabinet that the U.S. government now has
greater understanding of Israel's security needs and its demands
for maintaining the peace process based on fulfilling the
commitments by both the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said he does not plan to hold a three-way meeting with
Albright and PNA President Yasser Arafat next month as proposed by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said he wants U.S. President Bill Clinton to meet
separately with him and Arafat in a bid to advance the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he agrees with Albright that U.S. special
envoy Dennis Ross visits the Middle East early next month to
continue U.S. peace mediation.
</P>
<P>
On the second redeployment in the West Bank, Netanyahu assured
the cabinet that his meeting with Albright has been conducted
according to the original plan.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to his promise that he will not talk with
Albright about the specific percentage of the pullback, which will
be set by the cabinet after more deliberations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet has held several sessions to formulate the
second redeployment and guidelines for the Israeli-Palestinian
final talks, but failed to produce an agreement due to division of
security arrangements in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Speaker Slams Israeli Proposed Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Council Speaker
Ahmed Qureia today blasted Israel's proposed troop pullback in the
West Bank as an attempt to kill the peace process before the final
status talks begin.
</P>
<P>
Qureia, also known as Abu Ala, said that signed agreements
demand Israel withdraw from 62 percent of the West Bank in three
successive phases in addition to 28 percent of the lands Israel
has handed over to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA),
Palestinian Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only the remaining 10 percent of the West
Bank will be reserved for the final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He added that the "logic of the agreements is clear that the
Israelis will redeploy from all of the Palestinian lands occupied
in 1967, including East Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Qureia was commenting on media reports that Israel's cabinet is
discussing several maps that outline the percentage of its
proposed withdrawal and guidelines for the final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly has
prepared to hand over to the Palestinians about 10 percent of the
West Bank in the second of the three-phase redeployments.
</P>
<P>
He has urged the PNA to accept his proposal that the last
redeployment be included in the final status talks, which have
been scheduled to settle the thorniest issues of Jerusalem, final
borders and Palestinian refugees according to signed accords.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans the Israeli cabinet is discussing, Israel will
agree to hand over altogether about 30-50 percent of the West Bank
to the PNA.

KUWAIT CITY, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) today welcome Iran's recent rapprochement attitude to their
territory disputes, but demanded Iran take actions, the Kuwaiti
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We share the Gulf's positive reaction to recent Iranian
statements... but the United Arab Emirates hopes that the
Iranian leadership translates its statements into actions," UAE
Minister of Information and Culture Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed
Al-Nahyan told the agency.
</P>
<P>
Iran recently repeated its readiness to improve relations with
the Gulf Arab countries. Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said
last week that he is willing to go to the UAE to discuss the issue
of the three islands of Greater Tunb, lesser Tunb and Abu Musa.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran claim sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and the other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) have called on Tehran to resolve the disputes through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Abdullah said his country wants Iran to "respond to
repeated calls to resolve the issue of Iran's occupation of the
three islands through peaceful means."

Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman started Saturday the

CAIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will launch into orbit its
first satellite, NILESAT, in April 1998 instead of February, the
Middle East News Agency reported today.

Information Minister Safwat Al Sherif attributed the delay to
reprogramming and refueling the French-made satellite to make it
operate for 15 years instead of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Political Club of the National Democratic Party,
the minister said the Egyptian satellite will have "specialized

</P>
<P>
According to press reports, NILESAT will combine 12 channels,
with each airing six programs simultaneously through digital
technology. Some channels will specialize in news coverage, women,
drama and music.

Ground facilities necessary for the operation of the NILESAT
have been completed at the October 6 City in southern Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Egypt FM Deplores Ill Turns in Ties With Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today deplored the current events between "sisterly
countries" Egypt and Qatar, warning that Arab solidarity should
not be affected therefor.
</P>
<P>
"What is taking place unfortunately is against the correct norm
of relations and against the ethics and courtesy of dealings," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation should be "dealt with adequately" without
affecting the global Arab relationship which should remain safe
and sound "regardless of intended or unintended misbehavior of
some."
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is dealing with this issue calmly to safeguard the
fundamental image of Arab relations," he said, adding that going
against this framework constitutes an exception in Arab ties and
should be dealt with accordingly.
</P>
<P>
In a latest show of grudge against Qatar, Egypt told the small
Gulf emirate Saturday that its nationals who want to go to Egypt
must apply for entry visas in advance starting from today.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Qataris could obtain entry visas after they
arrived in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the change indicated that the two countries
failed to improve their relations despite the mediation of Saudi
Arabia earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa al-Thani held talks in Riyadh, capital of Saudi
Arabia, early this month in a bid to end a war of words between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Relations between them deteriorated in October when Egypt was
ready to boycott the fourth Middle East and North African economic
conference in Doha last month.
</P>
<P>
Qatar responded with a ban on the entry of Egyptian nationals
alongside other nine countries as a security precaution for the
Doha conference, infuriating Cairo and other Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to their row, Qatar charged Egypt had plotted the
1996 coup attempt to topple the Qatari government. Cairo denied
the charges and demanded for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
After the talks of their heads of state, both Egypt and Qatar
claimed that their relations were back to normal.

KUWAIT CITY, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Information
Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah today defended foreign
military presence in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with editors and reporters of Egyptian media on
the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council summit, the minister
stressed that the existence of the western troops in the Gulf
region was a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we were against this presence before the invasion
but now it has its justifications."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait remains wary of its northern neighbor's ambitions in
the region after Iraqi troops occupied it for seven months until
February 1991 when they were expelled by U.S.-led coalition
forces in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The United States has stockpiled military hardware in a
camp 25 kilometers west of Kuwait City, which is used by a
rotating battalion of about 1,500 troops. It also has planes
stationed in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia that patrol the no-fly
zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the stand-off between Iraq and the U.S. last month, the
U.S. raised its military presence in the Gulf to include two
aircraft carriers with about 200 F-14 and F-16 fighters.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has conducted dozens of joint military exercises with
its western allies on its territories and waters since the end of
the Gulf War within the framework of defense agreements signed
between Kuwait and the U.S., Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saud said that the GCC should have a robust force
that would be able to defend itself from foreign attacks.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that joint aviation authorities and
defense systems would be established among the GCC states of
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Seeks More Pressure to End Iraq Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States Defense
Secretary William Cohen said today that his nation pursues
diplomatic channels to pressure Iraq to allow U.N. inspectors
access to suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to pursue this in diplomatic channels and see if we
can't exhaust all reasonable opportunities to do that," Cohen said
on the CBS program "Face the Nation".
</P>
<P>
Iraq has banned the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
dismantling the country's weapons of mass destruction from
checking presidential sites. It insists that no weapons are
hidden at those locations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that it would never allow any inspection to its
presidential sites, which it regards as vital to its national
security and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen said this was "simply an intolerable position" and
the United Nations Security Council would hopefully send a
resounding signal that "it is unacceptable and there is no
division among Security Council members."
</P>
<P>
Cohen and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, speaking on
ABC's "This Week" program, would not rule out that the United
States would resort to military options to force Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein to comply.
</P>
<P>
"I think the president has said he's ruled nothing in, ruled
nothing out," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Saddam Hussein backs away from this, if not, we
may have to go to further options and the President indicated that
no options are off the table," Berger added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. envoy to the United Nations Bill Richardson also
made a similar statement on this issue. He said the United States
was continuing to pursue diplomatic solutions on the access to
Iraq's weapons sites, but "We have said we have not ruled any
options out, including the military option."

ANKARA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces today
killed five rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in
southern area bordering Syria, the state-owned TRT television
station reported.
</P>
<P>
The militants were killed in a clash after being spotted by an
infrared camera while crossing a minefield at the border in
Turkey's Ceypanpinar district of Sanliurfa province, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the rebels were infiltrating into Turkey from

<P>
In San Francisco alone, more than 90,000 people, including
20,000 infants, children and adolescents, live at or below the
poverty line. That means one in 10 adults and one in five children
regularly go hungary, said a report by the local Food Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The market weight of the
China-related enterprises on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
(SEHK) will continue to grow despite the current slowdown of
initial public offers caused by the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Alec Tsui, chief executive of the SEHK, said at a press
conference here Monday that he expected sustainable growth of the
number of China-related companies to be listed on the Hong Kong
bourse.
</P>
<P>
"It is anticipated that the capital needs of China will
continue to grow in the latest round of restructuring of
state-owned enterprises announced at the 15th Party Congress," he
told the 1997 year-end press briefing.
</P>
<P>
During the year, 15 state-owned enterprises or H-shares were
listed in Hong Kong, raising a total capital of 28.625 billion HK
dollars (3.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Till now, 39 H-shares and more than 50 red chips
(China-affiliated and Hong Kong-registered companies) have gone
public on the SEHK. Their total market capitalization accounted
for about 18 percent of the total of the Hong Kong market as at
the end of November 1997, rising steadily from around ten percent
a year before.
</P>
<P>
Looking into 1998, Tsui said: "The China dimension will
continue to be one of our major focuses." The SEHK will add
resources to its China team to strengthen its services to issuers
in the inland areas, he added.

<HEADLINE> Italian Communists Call for End of NATO, Removal of US Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian Communist Refoundation
Secretary Fausto Bertinotti Monday morning called for an end to
NATO and the removal of American bases from the Italian territory.
</P>
<P>
Bertinotti's remarks followed an interview published in Monday's
edition of the Turin daily La Stampa in which party Chairman
Armando Cossutta said that there was no longer any need for NATO
or justification for American bases in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with Cossutta," Bertinotti said, "This position has
already been adopted by our party congress. We are for the
dissolving of NATO because there is no reason, if there was one,
for this military alliance to exist."
</P>
<P>
The removal of American bases, he added, would allow Italy to
"regain its national sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
Cossutta, in his interview, did not go so far as to say that
there never was a reason for NATO's existence but observed, "While
it may be true, but not necessarily, that there were once possible
dangers from the Eastern Bloc, today all that does not
exist. There is no justification for keeping American bases in
Italy, because they are bases of a foreign power which,
theoretically, could be used for purposes unknown to us and in
contrast to Italian foreign policy. We could find ourselves in
very uncomfortable situations."
</P>
<P>
Cossutta also called for a new role for the United Nations,
which can have a military structure once the Security Council has
been reformed.

<HEADLINE> China Working on Basic Social Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China will try to set up a
social security system for many of its cities and counties in
1998, according to Doji Cering, minister of civil affairs, who
spoke at a national conference of bureau directors of civil
affairs today.
</P>
<P>
This will be put at the top of the Ministry's agenda next year,
he said, and it is expected to be pushed in rural areas as well,
and should take the lowest income levels into account.
</P>
<P>
In 275 cities, or more than 40 percent of the country's total,
the system is in place, and local governments have spent 1.15
billion yuan (about 139 million US dollars) on maintaining a basic
standard of living for more than two million low-income urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
In 997 counties and cities at the county-level, the system is
at a preliminary stage in rural areas. All cities and counties in
Guangdong Province, and over 80 percent of the cities and counties
of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Zhejiang Provinces and the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region have the system in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Doji Cering urged civil affairs departments to encourage
farmers, especially those working in township enterprises, and
people in rich rural areas and who have regular incomes to buy
old-age pension plans next year.
</P>
<P>
These pension plans already exist in more than 2,000 counties,
cities and regions, covering 82 million farmers with 13 billion
yuan, and about 400,000 farmers have already started receiving
pensions.
</P>
<P>
Doji Cering said that another major task for next year is
improving democratic work at the grass-roots level, with focus on
urban neighborhood committees and rural village committees. The
system of self-management is already in place in about 60 percent
of the country's one million villages.

WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Okinawans on Sunday voted against construction of an
offshore American military base that Japan and the United States
had been planning for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
-- The chairman of Turkish Airlines sealed a deal in Washington
on Friday to buy up to 49 Boeing airlines. Under normal
circumstances, it would have taken several months for the Turkish
State Planning Office and the Cabinet to approve the choice, but
with Turkey's objection to the European Union's decision to defer
action on its application for membership, and Turkey's desire for
stronger ties with the United States, the Government expedited the
approvals.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq said Sunday that it has concluded talks with the United
Nations on new proposals to distribute aid to the Iraqi people
under a program that allows Iraq to export oil and use the
proceeds to pay humanitarian items such as food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton headed off to Bosnia on Sunday
to spread holiday cheer -- and carry the news that he wants U.S.
troops to remain indefinitely as the region recovers from its
devastating war.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton's budget may feature 25 billion dollars in new tax
incentives and credits. Administration officials also say the
president's fiscal 1999 plan will include higher spending on
secondary education and a tobacco-tax increase for cancer
research. Tax cuts probably will include incentives for school
construction and breaks to encourage pension programs by small
firms.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. officials continued to threaten unspecified punitive
measures in an effort to force Iraq to open all sites to U.N.
weapons inspectors, but France, Russia and China indicated they
won't back military action. Baghdad said it will give the U.N. a
food-distribution plan soon as part of the third round of oil
sales it seeks under eased sanctions.

HONG KONG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The
Chief-Executive-in-Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) has approved the granting of a license to a
company registered in Hong Kong for operating radiocommunications
equipment on board a communications satellite.
</P>
<P>
The license also allows Asia Satellite Telecommunications
Company Limited (AsiaSat) to establish a satellite station in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The company has contracted Hughes Space and Communications
International of the United States to manufacture the satellite
AsiaSat 3 and deliver it into obit, a spokesman of the HKSAR
Economic Services Bureau said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be the sixth launched and operated by a Hong
Kong company since the first one was launched in April 1990.
</P>
<P>
Hughes has arranged for AsiaSat 3 to be launched later this
month from Baikonur Cosmodrome, which has been leased to Russia by
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The new satellite will form part of the company's satellite
communications network in the Asia-Pacific region to provide
telecommunications and broadcasting transmission services to the
region.
</P>
<P>
The license granted under the Telecommunication Ordinance is to
enable the company to operate the equipment on board the
satellite and establish and maintain an earth station at Stanley
on Hong Kong Island to control and monitor the satellite, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> HK Monetary System Withstands Financial Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's monetary system
has passed the test of the Asia financial turmoil that has turned
the regional booming panorama upside down into a gloomy scenario.
</P>
<P>
At a year-end press conference here Monday, Joseph Yam, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), summed up
the major work done by the Authority in 1997: "The exchange rate
of Hong Kong remained stable in a year of political transition and
the regional financial turmoil."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong currency, pegged to the greenback in 1983 at 7.8
HK dollars to one U.S. dollar, has stood firm despite a wave of
speculative attacks, which toppled down many other linked exchange
rate systems in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since July 2 when the currency crisis broke out in Thailand,
Asian currencies ranging from the Indonesian rupiah to the
Japanese yen have tumbled by between 12 and 53 percent, according
to statistics provided by the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
"The benefit of the linked exchange rate is stability. The peg
has served Hong Kong quite well," said Yam, who has made it his
top priority in 1998 to maintain exchange rate stability.
</P>
<P>
At the press briefing, Yam also announced the latest figure of
Hong Kong's foreign reserves, which hit 96.5 billion U.S. dollars
at the end of November this year, up 5.6 percent from a month
before. Hong Kong remains the world's third largest foreign
reserves holder, after Japan and Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Yam said that the rise in foreign reserves showed that there
was inflow of money into Hong Kong, rather than outflow of capital
as some people said. Actually, money has been attracted to Hong
Kong partly because of the high interest rates, said the HKMA
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
To defend the Hong Kong dollar, interest rates were pushed up,
putting strain on economic activities, especially on stock and
property markets. But the Hong Kong stock market, falling by 24.1
percent from a year earlier, is the least affected by the
financial turbulence compared with other Asian economies, which
slumped by between 32 and 74 percent, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Remains Top Choice for Equity Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of the Asian
financial storm, Hong Kong will continue to be the No. 1 choice
for global investors who make long commitments to the Asian equity
market, a top official of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK)
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Alec Tsui, chief executive of the SEHK, told a year-end press
conference: "For those global investors who keep watching on the
Asian market, Hong Kong is still the best place."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong stock market is still the most open and transparent
in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The local stock market has experienced dramatic swings as the
regional financial storm spilled over to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The 33-member Hang Seng Index tumbled by 24 percent from a year
earlier, to close at 10,172 points Monday, but in August, it
surged to the peak of more than 16,000 points.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1997 registered all the ten highest turnover
records since 1970, ranging from 46 billion HK dollars (5.9
billion U.S. dollars) to 34 billion HK dollars (4.4 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Despite the market volatility, Tsui said that the trading
system at the SEHK, with a capacity of handling a daily turnover
of over 50 billion HK dollars (6.4 billion U.S. dollars), has
withstood the steep price fluctuation and heavy trading volume,
reflecting the state of maturity of the market.
</P>
<P>
As of December 19, 1997, Hong Kong market capitalization hit
3,148 billion HK dollars (404 billion U.S. dollars), down five
percent from a year before but still putting it well into the top
ten stock markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
The annual total turnover as of December 19, 1997 reached 3,761
billion HK dollars (482 billion U.S. dollars), surging
impressively by 174 percent from the previous year. The number of
listed companies rose by 13 percent to 656.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Calls For Cohesiveness of Party Leading Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, General Secretary
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, today
called for greater cohesiveness and better work efficiency of the
Party leading bodies at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national meeting on Party organization work today,
he said that in implementing the principle of democratic
centralism earnestly, "we must improve the system of combining the
collective leadership with the division of work with individual
responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the 21st century will be one full of
opportunities and challenges and to face the coming new century,
"thousands of senior leading officials and tens of thousands of
middle ranking leading officials should shoulder the important
historic tasks ahead."
</P>
<P>
During the century, the Party will lead the Chinese people to
achieve the all-round revitalization of the Chinese nation, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To do so, he said, they need to have the guidance of correct
theory and political line, the unity and hard work of the whole
nation, and the strong leadership by the Party organizations at
all levels.
</P>
<P>
Among these conditions, he stressed, the leading officials are
"an important and decisive factor."
</P>
<P>
Leading officials need to be bold and resolute and especially
need to have an overall view and democratic style, and need to
learn to respect other people and draw on collective wisdom and
absorb all useful ideas, he added.
</P>
<P>
"All important decisions must be made through collective
discussions," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The whole situation has been considered, all important Central
Committee decisions have been made, and plans have been drawn up
based on research and opinions gathered from all over, he said,
and now, Party organizations and all departments need to put these
into effect.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also asked Party organizations and government to show
concern for laid-off workers and people living in
disaster-stricken areas to make sure that they have a joyful Lunar
New Year next month.
</P>
<P>
Other leaders present at the meeting were Li Peng, Zhu Rongji,
Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Li Lanqing, and 600 Party organization
officials from across the country.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Parliament Reviews Financial Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's National Assembly
(parliament) began a seven-day special session Monday afternoon to
review the government-proposed 13 reform bills aimed at improving
the country's ailing finance.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers are expected to pass the 13 financial bills and eight
other economy-related bills, including two amendments to the
real-name financial transaction system and a revision to laws on
the Bank of Korea (central bank) designed to make it independent
from government.
</P>
<P>
The bills, including one on the creation of a wide-ranging
financial watchdog agency supervising banks, insurance companies
and securities firms, failed to pass the assembly a month ago due
to resistance from the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Congress for New Politics will become
the ruling party next February as its leader Kim Dae-jung won the
15th presidential election last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has signed a 57-billion-dollar agreement with the
International Monetary Fund to bail its finance out of crisis. As
a price, South Korea has to restructure its economy under the
harsh conditions specified in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, floor leaders from the three major political
parties -- the Grand National Party, the National Congress for New
Politics and the United Liberal Democrats -- agreed to pass the
reform package at the parliament next Monday in a bid to bring the
country's shaky financial market back on track.
</P>
<P>
South Korea plunged into a serious financial trouble in July
caused by the collapse of a number of conglomerates and large
amounts of bad loans of financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> China's Chemical Industry Up 8 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite losses in the first
half, China's chemical industry got out of the fix it was in and
is expected to have an annual growth of eight percent, according
to the Minister of Chemical Industry Gu Xiulian.
</P>
<P>
She told a national conference in Beijing that the industry
will have 278 billion yuan in output value and 18 billion yuan in
profits.
</P>
<P>
The chemical sectors of 27 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions have all had similar growth in spite of price
hikes in raw materials. The industry managed to turn around in
June and met all of its development goals, Gu said.
</P>
<P>
She said that 23 million tons of urea was produced, up 12
percent on an annual basis, increasing chemical fertilizer output
to 27.2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets is expected to hit 31.8 billion
yuan, and fifteen large and medium-sized chemical projects have
gone into operation.
</P>
<P>
Reforms of state-owned chemical enterprises continued this
year, Gu said, and 48 state-owned enterprises have been listed on
the stock market, raising 15 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The export of chemicals is expected to surpass 15 billion US
dollars, a year-on-year increase of 21 percent, and the import and
export of the chemicals will hit 34 billion US dollars, up 10.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the industry will raise output value to
300 billion yuan next year, while maintaining a growth rate of
eight percent, while exports will be worth 16 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bilingual Education A Controversy in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Schools in California,
known for its ethnic diversity, have to deal with students
who speak as many as 50 different languages.
</P>
<P>
Chinese is one of these languages. The Chinese communities,
with a tradition of attachment to education, run schools of the
Chinese language. Kids of Chinese origin go to these schools to
learn their native language and culture after English classes
every day or at weekends. The Japanese also run their own schools.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of limited-English students are those who
speak Spanish. Latinos moved past whites this year to become the
largest racial group in California's public schools -- about 2.2
million, or early 40 percent of the 5.6 million students in
kindergarten through high school. Half of the Latino students
speak little or no English.
</P>
<P>
But Latinos, who once pushed for bilingual education as a civil
right, are now deeply divided over the question of whether young
students who speak little or no English should be taught for years
in Spanish or be prodded to learn English quickly. So are
educators and schools.
</P>
<P>
In a typical school which is intended to replace bilingual
education with a one-year program, taught predominantly in
English, teachers use English most of the time, backed by pictures
and gestures. and once in a while use a few words in the students'
native language. The students are normally transferred to regular
mainstream class after a year.
</P>
<P>
In another typical school, students are taught in their native
language and gradually introduced to English. They often remain in
bilingual education four to seven years before all of their
classes are presented in English.
</P>
<P>
Debates on the merits of both methods have been going on for
years, with both sides citing academic research and anecdotes
about the success of individual students. Sometimes arguments
become emotional and political.
</P>
<P>
Dropout rates are often cited by critics of bilingual
education, which they say contributes to dropouts by leaving
students uncomfortable with English, and thus ill-prepared to do
advanced work in high school courses taught in English. The weekly
news magazine, U.S. News &AMP; World Report, reported last month that
Latino children have the lowest test scores of any ethnic group in
California and the highest dropout rate of 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of bilingual education say dropout rates are more
likely to be influenced by factors such as the income and
education level of the family, the amount of reading done at the
home, and how long the family have been in the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the 40 percent dropout rate has been proved to be an
overstatement, which at the same time ignores an even higher
dropout rate among blacks, who do not receive bilingual
education. The latest figures from the state's Department of the
Education shows a combined dropout rate of 3.9 percent for all
ethnic groups during the 1995-96 school year. The rate for Latinos
was 5.6 percent, and blacks, 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
A teacher said that bilingual education has failed a whole
generation of Hispanic children not only in California but in the
whole country.
</P>
<P>
But another teacher said that bilingual education works,
helping build students' confidence and pride of their heritage.
</P>
<P>
Much of the early opposition to bilingual education warned that
the United States would become another Canada, a divided society
speaking two different languages.

BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of
Machine-Building Industry Bao Xuding told a national conference
here today that major economic indicators show an upturn in spite
of difficulties and that the machine-building industry had stable
growth this year with 490 billion yuan in output value, a
year-on-year increase of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Bao, the industry expects to have 460 billion yuan
in sales this year, up 5 percent over last year, and 123 billion
yuan in industrial added value, a rise of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Electronics and machinery exports are expected to exceed 55
billion US dollars worth this year, and out of ten major sectors,
engineering machinery, automobiles, and instruments and meters had
big increases, but the machine tool sector still reported negative
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Machine-Building Industry focused on improving
product quality, a better organization structure, and building
research and development ability, Bao said. The Ministry will
increase its understanding of ownership structure, industrial
organization structure, and changes in the growth and management
mode, and will make every effort to hone its competitive edge on
the international market.
</P>
<P>
The China First Auto Works Group, Dongfeng Automotive Group,
and Shanghai Automotive Industry Group will take the lead in
reorganization, and large auto groups with annual sales of 40
billion yuan, fixed assets of 5 billion yuan, and good product
development and sales will be formed.
</P>
<P>
Large enterprise groups of petrochemical equipment, project
machinery, farm machinery, and machine tools are expected to be
set up after capital reorganization in the hope that they can help
change the unconcentrated and unsystematic state of the machinery
industry.
</P>
<P>
Total industrial output for 1998 is estimated at 540 billion
yuan, up 7 percent over 1997, and industrial added value, 130
billion yuan, up 5.7 percent.

SOFIA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A table tennis club was set up
in Bulgaria on Sunday by a 22-year-old budding paddler to promote
the sport in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kostadinov Lengerov, who plays in a German club, said the club

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Again Imports Rice This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- For the second time since
1994, Indonesia imported rice, a staple in the world's fourth most
populous country, following a long drought and declining stocks in
recent times, a government official confirmed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the National Logistic Agency (BULOG) Beddu Among said
most of the rice is being imported from Thailand and Vietnam with
the rest from Pakistan, China and India.
</P>
<P>
He refused to disclose the amount of rice imported, saying only
that 50,000 tons of the planned 100,000 tons of rice have arrived.
</P>
<P>
According to Among, the imports are aimed at adding to the
national stocks of rice, which decreased following the massive
market operation in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
By November, BULOG had 2.2 million tons of rice in stock and
now it has 1.6 million tons, a reduction of 150,000 tons per week,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, formerly the biggest rice importer in the world,
became self-sufficient in rice in 1984. The country first imported
rice in 1994 when rice stocks diminished due to failed harvests.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia imported more than four million tons of rice in 1994,
some of which was shipped early this year. This year's imports are
predicted not to exceed the 1994's as BULOG still had stocks of
1.6 million tons, Among added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Statistics Agency, Indonesia's
production of unhusked rice this year will reach some 49 million
tons, equivalent to 31.89 million tons of rice or a decrease of
3.99 percent compared with 1996.

<HEADLINE> Eurofighter Accord Signed in Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain
signed an accord here Monday formally confirming their
participation in the costly project to build a 21st-century
warplane for Europe.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord signed by German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and
his counterparts from Britain, George Robertson, Italy, Beniamino
Andreatta and Spain, Eduardo Serra, a total of 620 Eurofighter jets
will be built and delivered to the four nations between 2002 and 2014.
</P>
<P>
Britain is buying 232 Eurofighters, Germany 180, Italy 121 and
Spain 87. The total cost of the project is estimated at up to 65
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
All four defense ministers attached great importance to the
project, saying that it is not only necessary for their countries'
defense, but will also give a boost to the international
competitiveness of the European aerospace industry and will help
secure several thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with sophisticated electronics, the Eurofighter can
fly within a range of over 2,500 kilometers with a maximum speed
almost twice the sound speed. Critics however says that the
warplane is unlikely to attract customers outside Europe because
of its stunning prices.
</P>
<P>
The Eurofighter project have also been controversial in Germany
at a time when Bonn is struggling with strict financial austerity
to meet the fiscal requirements for qualifying for the planned
single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of 180 Eurofighters by Bonn would cost about 23
billion marks (13 billion U.S. dollars), the most expensive military
spending by Germany in the post-war era. Despite strong protests from
opposition parties, the German parliament finally approved the project
in November after months of delay.
</P>
<P>
Germany will use the Eurofighter to replace its 171 aging Phantom
jets, 40 Tornados and 23 MiG 29s inherited from former eastern
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Eurofighter is jointly developed by Germany's Daimler-Benz
Aerospace AG, British Aerospce, Spain's CASA and Italy's Alenia.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Human Rights Body Demands Explanation on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Human Rights
Commission (IHRC) has demanded the Iranian Judiciary explain the
reasons behind the arrest of Secretary General of Iran's Freedom
Movement Ebrahim Yazdi.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA reported that the IHRC
Sunday evening issued a statement saying it was investigating
Yazdi's arrest and other relevant developments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi was summoned by the Islamic Revolutionary Court on
December 14 for questioning and was put into Tehran's famous
prison of Evin in the afternoon of the same day, according to a
statement from his Freedom Movement.
</P>
<P>
However, no official charges have been announced against Yazdi
one week after his imprisonment. IRNA quoted an informed source in
the Judiciary as claiming that Yazdi was detained according to law.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Movement was founded in 1961 by Mehdi Bazargan,
late Iranian prime minister of the interim government formed in
the wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi, then foreign minister of the interim government, was
elected secretary-general of the movement in January 1985 after
Bazargan passed away.
</P>
<P>
However, the organization was not given formal permission to
carry out activities after the government asked political parties
and organizations to register in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The IHRC also said that it would investigate the recent
political disturbance in the religious city of Qom, some 100
kilometers south of the capital, caused by the controversial
remarks of an Islamic canonist on supreme leadership and some
other cases.
</P>
<P>
It said that the body would follow up the cases to prevent
unlawful acts and counter the perpetrators of any unlawful moves
in accordance with human and legal regulations.
</P>
<P>
On November 19, several hundred religious instructors and
students in Qom attacked the office and residence of Ayatollah
Hussein Ali Montazeri, former designate successor of late Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The disgraced clergyman criticized now supreme leader Ali
Khamenei for interfering in government affairs and advised him to
supervise rather than directly intervene.
</P>
<P>
The IHRC was formed in 1995 after Tehran was accused by Western
countries of violating human rights. During the past two years,
the body issued many statements condemning Western reports on
Iran's human rights status.

<HEADLINE> China Sets 1998's Economic Restructuring Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China will try to make
breakthroughs in restructuring its economy in 1998, State
Councillor Li Tieying, who is in charge of the State Commission
for Restructuring the Economy, told a national conference on
economic restructuring here today.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng sent a letter of congratulations to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Tieying, some major tasks for 1998
are: adhering to the reform orientation of the socialist market
economy; improving the ownership structure; speeding up work on
the introduction of a modern enterprise system; making a greater
effort at strategic transformation of the state-owned economy;
resettling redundant workers as part of the re-employment project;
stepping up the reform of the financial system; and improving
macro-economic controls.
</P>
<P>
An effort must also be made to reform the grain and cotton
distribution system and to industrialize agriculture, to work for
institutional restructuring, to improve the way government runs
the economy, to look for a better state asset management system,
and studying reforms of the social security and housing
distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
The State Council is formulating policies that will help bring
most of the large and medium-sized money-losing state enterprises
out of difficulties within the next three years, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In restructuring state enterprises, China will focus on
improving large state enterprises and giving smaller ones more
decision-making power, and incorporating large enterprises and
allowing them to issue stock, he said.
</P>
<P>
The practice of arbitrarily setting up parent companies and
subsidiaries must be stopped, and inter-regional and multinational
enterprises and groups must be encouraged through purchases,
mergers, acquisitions or co-operation.
</P>
<P>
China has more 300,000 state enterprises, some 14,500 of which
are large and medium-sized. Recently, the country has increased
its efforts to restructure state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the initiative-based household contract
responsibility system in rural areas will remain unchanged for a
long time, and that China is determined to establish a socialist
market economy by the end of the century.

<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has
called for increased supervision by auditors across China to check
embezzlement and other economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remark when meeting representatives to a
national conference on auditing here today.
</P>
<P>
China is in the process of establishing a socialist market

system to embezzle state assets or take bribery."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Party committees and governments at all levels

over the auditing work.
</P>
<P>
The premier expressed his appreciation for the work done by
auditors throughout the country, which has saved the state more
than 30 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
"More important, supervision by auditors has played a positive
role in maintaining the country's financial and economic order,
promoting the campaign for a cleaner government, and guaranteeing
a healthy development of the national economy," the premier
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged auditing departments to further carry out the Auditing
Law and the detailed rules to execute the law, and to improve the

<HEADLINE> Leading Travel Agencies Jointly Promoting Outbound FIT Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Nine Beijing-based Chinese
travel agencies are joining hands to promote the "Royal Orchid
Holiday" tour to Thailand when Chinese people are preparing for
traveling abroad at the New Year and Spring Festival holidays.
</P>
<P>
The first cooperation of the travel businesses in selling
outbound tours, the move is designed not only to provide a new
choice for travelers, but also to combat unauthorized outbound
tour operations which are becoming rampant, according to Li Lu'an,
President of China Travel Agency Association and General Manager
of the Head Office of China International Travel Service.
</P>
<P>
Chinese government has authorized 67 travel agencies across the
country to sell outbound tours, of which 11 are based in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
However, dozens of illegal operators have been seen in Beijing
offering outbound tours, many of which are characterized in
low-price and low-quality. According to China National Tourism
Administration, over 80 percent of the complaints resulted from
such tours.
</P>
<P>
"Royal Orchid Holiday", a 25-year-old world-famous tour jointly
run by Thai Airways and Thai travel agencies, is a low-priced,
high-quality FIT (foreign individual tourist) tour featuring
colorful sightseeing, five-star hotel accommodation, and
no-shopping arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Chinese participants of the tour, who should hold a five-year
passport for private affairs, can decide the departure time
themselves, and the travel agencies can arrange the tour for them
in about a week after their application is filed.
</P>
<P>
"The fall of group tours and the rise of FIT tours represent
a trend of the international travel industry. Though China's
outbound market still lacks mature FIT product, the demand on FIT
tours will gradually grow," said a travel agent.

<HEADLINE> Largest Securities Broker in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The largest securities broker
in northeast China was established as the result of a
restructuring move which separated the Liaoning Provincial
Securities Co. from the Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of
China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The new broker, a limited-liability company, involves a total
investment of 254 million yuan provided by 25 institutional
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The shareholders include nine local securities firms which were
previously attached to PBC's Liaoning branch. The new company,
which has 19 subsidiaries, is qualified to offer wide-ranging
securities transactions.
</P>
<P>
The PBC branch established the former company with an
investment of 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local economists note that the restructuring came in response
to the changing situation involving increasing enterprise mergers
and acquisitions, and will benefit the efforts of state-owned
enterprises to raise funds on the capital market.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Law Designed To Prevent Animal Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Deputy Mayor Feng
Guoqin has urged local government departments to be fully prepared
to implement the Animal Epidemic Prevention Law of the People's
Republic of China which will come into force on January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Feng said the new law will help guarantee the quality of meat
products for the over 13 million residents in China's largest city
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, a city with a vast market for meat products, will
apply the law to wide-ranging areas. The city produces some 4.6
million hogs, more than 140,000 tons of eggs and over 170 million
head of poultry each year, with the respective figures accounting
for 50 percent, 70 percent and 80 percent of the city's total
market demand for related products. In addition, the city is
self-sufficient in terms of milk production.
</P>
<P>
The existing network of animal prevention centers involving
relevant departments at the city, county, township and village
levels is staffed by over 2,000 veterinarians and animal
quarantine workers.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, contaminated clams sparked an outbreak of
Hepatitis A in Shanghai and neighboring areas. The city has since
strictly monitored quarantine activities regarding meat and
seafood since then.

<P>
BONN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Seven members of the
international environmental group Greenpeace early Monday blocked
a ferry at the northern German port of Bremerhaven, which was due
to ship plutonium to Scotland for reprocessing.
</P>
<P>
With soldering irons, they attached themselves to the exit ramp
of the ferry Arneb. Port police later came trying to remove the
demonstrators, who also employed three rubber dinghies in the
blockade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 60 other Greenpeace activists staged a protest on
a bridge at the port, which was heavily guarded by police.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace said the ship was scheduled to leave Bremerhaven
with 59 kilograms of plutonium during night for Dounreay, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that however, they would still load the ferry
with the radioactive cargo later in the day. The plutonium was
transported by lorry from Hanau, where it had been stored.
</P>
<P>
The plutonium came from a nuclear reactor in Karlsruhe and
would be converted into liquid plutonium nitrate in Scotland
before being enriched into reactor fuel at England's Sellafield
plant.

NEW DELHI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Noted non-resident Indian
industrialist Lord Swraj Paul Monday called for more effective
supervision of Indian financial markets, banking and investment
systems.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference of non-resident Indians (NRIs) here, he
said that there was an important message for this country in the
economic crisis that had engulfed several nations in Southeast
Asia. The more open an economy is, the more there is need for
tough regulatory measures. Effective supervision was essential if
successful inward investment flows were to be sustained.
</P>
<P>
Referring to India's economic reforms since 1991, he said that
the agenda of economic reforms had moved forward in the last seven
years.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned of a trap that often besets reformers -- the
risk of abandoning reforms along the way or pursuing them
half-heartedly. Tentative reform is a greater danger than no
reform.

The latest figure represented a 5.6-percent increase over that
of a month earlier, when Hong Kong's foreign reserves stood at
91.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA, said Monday that
the rise in foreign reserves showed that there were inflows of
money into Hong Kong despite the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"Some say that there was outflow of money from Hong Kong, and
this is absolutely not true," he told a year-end review press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Money has actually been attracted to Hong Kong partly because
of the higher interest rates, jacked up in late October to fend
off speculative attacks, said Yam.
</P>
<P>
At the end of November, the foreign reserves vested in the
Exchange Fund were 79.1 billion U.S. dollars, while those held in
the Land Fund were 17.4 billion U.S. dollars.

Hong Kong remains the world's third largest foreign reserves

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy to Grow Moderately in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy,
battered by the protracted region-wide currency crisis, is
expected to grow by a moderate 4.5 percent in 1998 as measured by
gross national product (GNP), Socio-economic Planning Secretary
Cielito Habito said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to grow
by 4 percent, the highest among Southeast Asian nations, Habito
said in a year-end report on the country's economic performance in
1997 and prospects for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's GNP grew by 6 percent during the first three
quarters this year, which Habito said was "respectable" compared
with its Southeast Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, while the Philippine economy has slowed down,
its performance remains respectable in comparison with our
neighbors," Habito said.
</P>
<P>
Habito attributed the still-steady economic growth to "strong
macroeconomic fundamentals and decisive policy responses made even
before the crisis unfolded."
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government scaled down its GNP growth target for
1997 from 7 percent to 5.5 percent due to the currency crisis
which struck Southeast Asia in July 1997 and then spread to other
parts of Asia. The country registered a 7.1 percent GNP growth
rate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso has lost more than 50 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar since July 11 when the Central Bank
decided to float the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
According to Habito, the Philippine economy will face seven
major challenges in 1998, including a depressed regional economy,
lower capital flows to Asia and expected slowdown in U.S. and
Japanese economies.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino weather phenomenon, which has brought a severe
drought to the country since last month, will also pose a
challenge to the economy by severely affecting the agriculture
sector.
</P>
<P>
Other challenges are uncertainty over the country's May 1998
presidential election, continuing high interest rates and minimum
wage adjustments as a result of the peso devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Habito said outlook remains bright for the
economy in 1998 as the implementation of programs reached
separately between the International Monetary Fund and Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea is expected to stabilize regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government had mapped out a contingency plan to
mitigate the adverse effects of El Nino, such as early importation
of rice to prevent a rice shortage next year.
</P>
<P>
The government will also continue to implement a six-point
action agenda to counter the currency crisis, including reducing
current account deficit, close monitoring of corporate and banking
sectors and continued implementation of economic reforms, Habito
said.

the living standards will be lower, the currency Rand depreciated
and unemployment increased, according to a latest public survey.
</P>

James Moiben of Kenya won the women's and men's races respectively
at Sunday's IAAF World Cross Challenge event.

Wami clocked 20 minutes 45 seconds in a 4-lap, 6,000-meter race
while Paula Radcliff of Britain finished three seconds behind at
second place, followed by Kutre Dulecha also from Ethiopia at
21:06.
</P>
<P>
Wami, third at the world cross-country championship race, led
in the second lap but was overtaken in the ensuing lap by Radcliff
who finished runner-up at the worlds.
</P>
<P>
World champion Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia did not participate in
Sunday's race due to an injury.
</P>
<P>
Wami said after the race that it was a very hard one though
there was not too much mud.

A continuous drizzle throughout the day muddied the course of
the cross-country race.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth race the Ethiopian woman entered this year.
She won another race earlier in Spain and finished second in the
two others.
</P>

The Kenyans proved their depth in the cross-country event as
Moiben, who led for more than half the 7-lap, 10,500-meter race,
set the pace for a Kenyan one-two-three finish.
</P>
<P>
Moiben's winning time was 33 minutes 7 seconds, followed by
Thomas Nyariki and Paul Kosgei both at 33:12.
</P>
<P>

in this opening leg of the 11-leg IAAF World Cross Challenge event
that ends at the world cross-country championship slated for next
March in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The top 20 finishers of the World Cross Challenge events are

MACAO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Macao's exports to the United
States in the first nine months of the year surged 26 percent
from the same period last year, the Macao Daily News reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The leading importer for Macao, the United States bought 5.576
billion patacas (about 697 million US dollars) worth of goods from
Macao during that period, up 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the exports to the U.S. like knitwear increased more
than 20 percent. Exports of leather shoes, office equipment and
computer products also increased. But exports of garments,
furniture and porcelain products dropped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Macao bought three percent less products from the
U.S. in the January-September period. The imports of raw
materials, semi-finished goods and fuel declined between 15
percent to 30 percent from the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Republicans, 60 Pct of Elected Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Forty-six of the 76 elected
delegates at next year's Constitutional Convention support a
republic, with the Australian Republican Movement (ARM) making up
the largest single bloc with 27 delegates, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven of the delegates support the monarchy, while three
delegates have not declared their position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The final count Monday by the Australian Electoral Commission
for the convention scheduled for next February showed monarchists
outnumbered republicans only on Tasmania island and drew in South
Australia state.
</P>
<P>
Republicans swept the board in the two regions of Canberra and
the Northern Territory, won eight of the 13 positions in
Queensland state, nine of the 16 in Victoria state, with one
non-aligned, and 13 of the 20 in New South Wales state, with one
non-aligned.
</P>
<P>
ARM Chairman Malcolm Turnbull said the election showed that a
republic was the people's choice.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good result," Turnbull told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we are very comforted by the fact that the
Australian Republic Movement will be overwhelmingly the largest
group at the convention, with 27 out of the 76 delegates," he
declared.
</P>
<P>
ARM was followed by No Republic - Australians for a
Constitutional Monarchy with 19 delegates.
</P>
<P>
There is a two-to-one dominance in the electorate for an
Australian as head of state.
</P>
<P>
The 76 delegates are expected to make a decision at next
February's convention on whether Australia will become a republic.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
higher Monday against its U.S. counterpart, as the crisis of
confidence in Asia continued.
</P>
<P>
It closed at 65.38 U.S. cents, up from 65.08 at the end of the
previous local session.
</P>
<P>
Traders said a U.S. buyer had been lodged at the 65.05 U.S.
cent region for most of the day, and this had helped put a floor
under the unit on the downside.
</P>
<P>
The bad news out of Asia continued Monday with Moody's
Investors Service announcing that it had downgraded the foreign
currency credit ratings of Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Moody said also that weakness in the Japanese economy and
banking system added a "further, negative backdrop to the
prospects for the region."
</P>

The Australian dollar was at 84.91 Japanese yen, from 83.04
previously, and at 1.1660 German marks, from 1.1521.

<HEADLINE> 45 Percent Australians Considered Overweight: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- About 45 percent of the
Australian men and 29 percent of the women are considered
overweight, as they eat more, drink more, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau released a national nutrition survey of nearly
14,000 people, providing a comprehensive snapshot of people's
eating habits and weight.
</P>
<P>
A further 18 percent of both men and women were classified as
obese.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of overweight or obese people increased with age
and peaked at 50-54 years for men and 60-64 years for women.
</P>
<P>
And after the age of 45, only around a quarter of men and 35
percent of women were within an acceptable weight range.
</P>
<P>
On average, Australian men consumed more food and beverages
than women in all age groups.
</P>
<P>
Men aged 19-24 ate the most, while women aged between 25 and 44
had the highest food intake.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that around 30 percent of adults believe they
should eat more fruit and vegetables, while around one quarter
thought they should eat less foods high in fat.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stock Market Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
closed lower Monday, overshadowed by Wall Street's negative
influences and falling Tokyo and Hong Kong markets.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones broker Philip Toop said poor overseas
trading over the past few days had impacted heavily on the local
bourse.
</P>
<P>
"It had a negative influence throughout the day," Toop said.
</P>
<P>
A buoyant gold sector helped to hold the all ordinaries, which
finished down 24.7 points at 2503.4, after Homestake Mining Co.
announced it would acquire Plutonic Resources in a deal it said
would create the third largest North American-based gold producer.
</P>
<P>
"The gold sector was stronger ... there could be some
speculation of more takeovers in that sector (firming up stocks),"
Toop said.
</P>
<P>
Gold shares defied the general weakness and the index was up
23.2 points at 945.8. Sydney trading in gold bullion closed at
289.80 U.S. dollars an ounce, up 1.55 U.S. dollars on Friday's
close of 288.25 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shares in Plutonic were 16 Australian cents stronger at 2.80
Australian dollars each before a trading halt was placed on its
securities ahead of Homestake takeover announcement Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Homestake will acquire Plutonic for 640 million U.S. dollars in
stock, with the U.S.-owned company expecting to issue about 64.3
million shares to acquire Plutonic, or 0.34 of a Homestake common
share for each Plutonic ordinary share.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished down 5.6 points at 1080.9
while the all industrial index dropped 47.9 points to 4287.6.
</P>
<P>
Amongst the resource companies, BHP ended up 7.9 cents at 13.74
Australian dollars, having recovered from an earlier low of 13.483
Australian dollars. Global miner Rio Tinto lost 20.6 cents to
16.80 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The banking index fell 43.9 points to 5263.4 with ANZ bank
slipping 25 cents to 9.50 Australian dollars, National Australia
Bank declining 13 cents to 20.22 Australian dollars and
Commonwealth down six cents to 17.27 Australian dollars.

<P>
Westpac edged down 0.1 cents to 9.399 Australian dollars, St.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined
sharply on the Singapore market on lingering negative regional
sentiment, as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index lost
30.96 points to close at 1541.65, down by two percent, Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that last Friday's crash of a Boeing plane of
SilkAir, a subsidiary of the national carrier Singapore Airlines
(SIA), injected some pessimism into the market.
</P>
<P>
However, they noted that Singapore stocks did not bear as much
losses as some of the other stock markets in the region.
</P>
<P>
The market could be trying to feel the bottom right now, one
broker said.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume stood at 133.11 million units, worth 307.82
million Singapore dollars (about 183.23 million U.S. dollars).
Declines overwhelmed advances by 278 to 53, while 274 other
counter remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Uraco was the most actively traded counter as it registered a
turnover of 15.57 million units. It was followed by the Singapore
Telecom which had 6.63 million shares traded. DBS (Development
Bank of Singapore) Land was next with 5.42 million shares changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
IPCO led the gainers of the day as it rose by 40 cents to
finish at 2.85 U.S. dollars. TLB Land increased by 35 cents to end
at 1.55 Singapore dollars, while JMH (Jardine Matheson Holdings)
400 picked up 22 cents to close at 4.62 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Foreign and
Sea View shared the top spot on the losers' list as each of them
declined by 70 cents to end at 21.9 and 6.5 Singapore dollars
respectively. City Development fell by 45 cents to close at 7.75
Singapore dollars, and the Singapore Airlines (SIA) lost 40 cents
to finish at 7.4 Singapore dollars.

At present Vietnam is taking measures to prevent smuggling and
trade fraudulence, including affixing tax stamps to three imported
goods: bicycles, electric fans, and foreign alcohol.

during the Iran-Iraq war (1980-88).
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA said that the bodies were

</P>
<P>
Head of Iran's armed forces committee in charge of searching
for those missing in action General Mirfaisal Baqerzadeh and his

<HEADLINE> More Food Distribution Sites Opened in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A local hunger relief
organization in California opened more food pantry distribution
sites to meet the needs of thousands of Californians who worry
about their next meal.
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco alone, more than 90,000 people, including
20,000 infants, children and adolescents, live at or below the
poverty line. That means one in 10 adults and one in five children
regularly go hungary, said a report by the local Food Bank.
</P>
<P>
While the federal government's poverty line for a family of
three is 13,500 U.S. dollars, a family of three with one wage
earner and two children needs an income of 36,000 dollars to live
a decent life in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
"Yet most households are making half of that or less," Paul
Ash, executive director of the San Francisco Food Bank, a local
hunger relief organization, told a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
After paying for housing, utilities and transportation, many
families have little money left for food, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Food Bank is expected to increase annual distribution by

<TEXT>
<P>
Coordination and support have also been provided to the HKSAR
government in receiving foreign heads of state and in arranging
overseas visits for HKSAR officials.
</P>
<P>
All the work the commissioner office has done is conducive to
maintaining Hong Kong's position as an international financial,
trade, shipping, tourism and information center, enhancing its
status in the world and developing its relations with foreign
countries, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past half year, he pointed out, under the specific
instructions of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and in close
coordination with Chinese embassies and consulates in foreign
countries, the office of the commissioner has worked closely with
the HKSAR government departments in handling seven major
emergencies which jeopardized Hong Kong residents' interests and
lives.
</P>
<P>
These emergencies included an air crash in Phnom Penh, the
capsizing of a Philippine cruise with Hong Kong residents aboard,
the detention of Hong Kong fishing boats by the Philippines and
Japan and protection of Hong Kong people caught in military
conflicts in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, his office has also handled more than 90
other consular protection cases.
</P>
<P>
In handling these cases, the commissioner's office timely
provided the HKSAR government with information about Hong Kong
people in distress overseas from Chinese embassies and consulates
in those countries and speedily forwarded the requests of their
relatives in Hong Kong to the Chinese embassies and consulates as
well as to those distressed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma stressed that it is an important component part of his work
to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Hong Kong people
residing abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Our practice is to cooperate closely with Chinese embassies
and consulates in foreign countries and with the HKSAR government
and do our work with a strong sense of responsibility, a positive
attitude and high efficiency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma said his office will further enhance its contacts and
relations with various sectors and improve both the efficiency and
quality of consular services and protection so as to better
safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong
people overseas.

<HEADLINE> China's Decision to Submit HK Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official has
described China's decision to provide relevant U.N. departments
with information about the implementation of two international
covenants on human rights in Hong Kong as a testimony to the
Chinese government's determination to fully implement the "one
country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
The decision is of great significance to Hong Kong's long-term
prosperity and stability, Ma Yuzhen, commissioner of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government announced on November 22 its decision to
provide to the United Nations information about the implementation
in the HKSAR of the relevant provisions of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that in accordance with related provisions of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong and
the Basic Law and in consideration of the fact that China is not
yet a party to the two covenants, the Chinese government will, on
the analogy of the relevant provisions of the two covenants, ask
China's Permanent Mission to the United Nations to hand to the
U.N. secretary-general a report on the implementation of the
relevant provisions of the two covenants in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
If the report is to be deliberated upon by covenant
institutions, he said, the Chinese government will notify the
HKSAR of this and ask it to send representatives to answer
questions regarding the report.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said the report on the implementation of the
relevant provisions of the two covenants will be written by the
HKSAR government and sent by the Office of the Commissioner of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry in the HKSAR to China's Permanent U.N.
Mission to pass it on to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that On December 4, Ambassador Qin Huasun, China's
permanent representative to the United Nations, formally presented
a note on the arrangement to the U.N. secretary-general and
requested the latter to put the note on record and at the same
time inform the covenant institutions and other parties to the
covenants.
</P>
<P>
"Such an arrangement fully shows the Chinese government's
resolve to implement the policy of 'one country, two systems' and
can help the international community understand better the human
rights situation in the HKSAR," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is of great significance to boosting the confidence of the
Hong Kong people and promoting the growth of economy and other
undertakings and maintaining long-term prosperity and stability in
the HKSAR, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo stock prices continued to
plunge Monday with the key Nikkei index ending below the 15,000
line for the first time since July 1995 for greater fear of credit
risks amid the sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First Section

<P>
HONG KONG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The commissioner of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) said his office has given full support to the
HKSAR in conducting on its own the external affairs authorized by
the Central People's Government.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six months, the office of the commissioner has

<P>
In accordance with Articles 13, 149 and 151 of the Basic Law,

</P>
<P>
Since its establishment, he said, the commissioner's office has

affairs within authorization. The handling of specific matters
rests entirely with the HKSAR government.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
encourage Chinese enterprises to invest in the Ukraine, according
to Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks at a forum attended by visiting Ukrainian
Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and some 80 representatives
from 18 Chinese and 13 Ukrainian companies.
</P>
<P>
The forum was held at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China has always attached great importance to
developing friendly cooperative relations with the Ukraine. She
noted that active trade and economic cooperation is an important
component of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Ukraine is an important country in Europe and
one of China's most important trade partners in the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS). She said the highly complementary
economies of the two nations provide a rare opportunity for
the expansion of bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that Pustovoitenko's visit and the forum
will enable entrepreneurs from the two countries to further
enhance mutual understanding, trust and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
She proposed that Ukrainian enterprises hold an investment
fair in China at an appropriate time in the future.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko said the Ukraine regards China as a "strategic
partner in foreign economic and trade cooperation." He noted that
the bilateral trade volume exceeded one billion US dollars in
1997, and stressed that the vast potential for economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries has not as yet been fully
tapped.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ukrainian government will continue to extend a
great effort to develop mutually beneficial economic and trade
cooperation with countries in the Asia-Pacific Region, especially
China.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko said the Ukraine plans to develop trade links
with the region into a new pillar of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the two countries will continue to
expand cooperation in the sectors such as power generation,
metallurgy, machine-building, chemicals, mining, military
technology, aviation and shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that two-way trade will grow to
between 2-3 billion US dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Wu and Pustovoitenko also answered questions from participating
entrepreneurs.

<HEADLINE> No More Fertilizer Loans for Zambian Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
said that it will not give out fertilizer loans to farmers for
the 1997-98 season as they have failed to pay back the loans
disbursed during the previous season.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted Agriculture, Food and Fisheries
Minister Edith Nawakwi as saying here Sunday that the farmers
should instead resort to crops that don't require fertilizer to
give positive yields.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said it doesn't make sense for the government to
continue handing out loans if farmers don't repay.
</P>
<P>
It is said that farmers have been unable to pay back loans
amounting to over 15 billion Kwacha (about 11 million U.S.
Dollars) during the previous season.
</P>
<P>
She said farmers should buy fertilizer from the private sector
and from the European Union which has stocks left over from last
season's consignment.
</P>
<P>
She told the farmers to plant other food crops that don't
require fertilizer such as soya beans, sunflower, beans, cassava
and groundnuts.
</P>
<P>
"In fact these crops enhance household food security, they
will help people who are now crying for food," she said.
</P>
<P>
She told people not to sell their maize because hunger was
likely in December.
</P>
<P>
The minister announced that farmers who want seeds of soya and
sunflower should approach the program against malnutrition where
the commodity could be provided.
</P>
<P>
The government has been given money by the World Bank to
purchase the seeds for farmers under the poverty alleviation
program.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank has given us money enough to buy seed for
drought resistant crops and we are offering that," Nawakwi said.

<HEADLINE> Troubled Tanzanian Printer Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's ailing
printing giant, Printpak Tanzania Limited, will be privatized by
sale to a Dar es Salaam bidder.
</P>
<P>
The privatization agency last week awarded the bid to Infotech
Investment Group, a company which sells computers. The other
bidders were Tanzania Printing Services and Printpak staff and
management.
</P>
<P>
Details of the sale agreement have not been concluded and the
fate of its 286 work force is yet to be determined, East African
said today.
</P>
<P>
The draft agreement says Infotech Investment Group will
acquire 75 percent of Printpak shares, and the rest will be held
in trust by the government for eventual floatation to the public
when the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange takes off.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1966, Printpak has a capacity of printing up to 75
million copies of book and 40 million copies of newspapers and
magazines annually.
</P>
<P>
It has an ink factory with the capacity to produce 120 tons of
oil-based printing inks and 100 tons of flexo ink.
</P>
<P>
However, it has been undergoing severe financial problems
linked to the fact that its main client, the state-owned
publishers of Daily News and Sunday News, has a debt of one
billion shillings (about 1.5 million U.S. Dollars) and
competition from at least 30 new licensed printers.

<HEADLINE> FM Commissioner Pledges to Abide by "One Country, Two Systems" Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The commissioner of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) has pledged to fully implement the "one country, two
systems" concept and said his office and the HKSAR government are
not subordinate to each other.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yuzhen stressed in a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua
that there exists a relationship of mutual respect, mutual trust,
mutual support and close cooperation between the office of the
commissioner and the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
"In its work, the office will strictly abide by the provisions
of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of
the People's Republic of China," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Summing up his office's work since its establishment after Hong
Kong's return to China on July 1, Ma noted that the best way to
implement the "one country, two systems" principle is to act
strictly in accordance with the Basic Law, which stipulates that
the Central People's Government shall be responsible for the
foreign affairs relating to the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the central government has authorized the
HKSAR to conduct relevant external affairs on its own in
accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chapter VII of the Basic Law stipulates in detail
how the HKSAR should deal with its external affairs, Ma said,
adding that this means that the office of the commissioner does
not handle all the external affairs affecting the HKSAR, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
"We should give the HKSAR government a free hand in dealing
with the affairs within the authorization of the Basic Law and we
should fully trust the HKSAR government and bring its initiative
into full play."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner stressed that to implement the policy of
"one country, two systems," his office must follow the practice
of seeking truth from facts and proceeding from actual conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law states that representatives of the HKSAR may, as
members of Chinese delegations, participate in international
organizations or conferences in appropriate fields limited to
states and affecting the region, or may attend in such other
capacity as may be permitted by the Central People's Government
and the international organization or conference concerned, and
may express their views, using the name "Hong Kong, China."
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to China, there are still civil
servants of foreign nationalities working in the HKSAR government
and some of them are in important positions, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the actual situation, we agreed to let them
participate in the World Conference on Intellectual Property
Rights, the International Conference on Civil Aviation and the
International Conference on Postal Service as members of the
Chinese government delegations and sit in the first rows together
with senior members of our government delegations."
</P>
<P>
Permitting foreign nationals to take part in international
conferences as members of a government delegation is something not
only unprecedented in the diplomatic history of New China but also
rare in the history of international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The foreign civil servants concerned were deeply moved and
greatly encouraged by such a practice, which has been highly
commended by the international community, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
"To implement the policy of 'one country, two systems'," he
said, "we must also abandon old ideas and develop new thinking and
 new methods to address the problems cropping up in the new
situation."
</P>
<P>
He cited as an example the Chinese government's decision to
provide the United Nations with information about the
implementation in the HKSAR of the relevant provisions of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
</P>
<P>
Ma pointed out that under the two covenants, only the parties
to the covenants have the obligation to report on the
implementation and China is not yet a party.
</P>
<P>
However, to reflect the principle of "one country, two systems"
and enhance the confidence of the Hong Kong people and by taking
the needs of the HKSAR into consideration, the central government
handled this issue in a flexible manner, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
"To implement the principle of 'one country, two systems', we
must establish good relations with the government of the HKSAR and
should respect, support and trust the HKSAR in our work," the
commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the HKSAR is a local administrative region of
the People's Republic of China, which enjoys a high degree of
autonomy and is directly under the jurisdiction of the Central
People's Government.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive of the HKSAR is accountable to the Central
People's Government and to the HKSAR while the office of the
commissioner is an office established by the Chinese Foreign
Ministry in the HKSAR to deal with foreign affairs and it is
answerable to the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the two are not subordinate to each other and their
relationship is one of mutual respect, mutual trust, mutual
support and close cooperation, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, it is entirely up to the HKSAR government to
decide on its senior officials' overseas visits, including where
and when to go, whom to meet and what to discuss.
</P>
<P>
When HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa visits foreign
countries, China's ambassadors to these countries greet and see
him off at airports and hold receptions in his honor, but they do
not participate in his talks with local hosts or other activities.
</P>
<P>
It is also up to the HKSAR government to decide whether and how
to receive foreign heads of state or government officials who wish
to visit Hong Kong. Officials of the commissioner's office do not
take part in the talks between HKSAR officials and visiting
foreign heads of state or government officials.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the HKSAR government said that thanks to the
support and trust of the Central People's Government, they enjoyed
high-level treatment in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ma, a career diplomat for decades, noted that the principle of
"one country, two systems" is new and there is no precedent for
his office to follow in its work.
</P>
<P>
"This requires us to be both prudent and open-minded and dare
to blaze a new trail," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the office of the commissioner will continue to
abide by the provisions of the Basic Law and make efforts to
implement in earnest the principle of "one country, two systems,"
Ma emphasized.

ZHENGZHOU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The winter wheat growing
area in central China's Henan Province has increased to 4.97
million hectares this year, 44,670 hectares more than last year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials attributed the farmers' enthusiasm
in grain production to the government's guarantee of purchases of
their products at a relatively high price.
</P>
<P>
Henan has bought 5.74 billion kg of wheat at a price of 1.38 yuan
per kg this year. It ranks first in all the Chinese provinces in

<HEADLINE> Poultry Disease Troubles S. African Ostrich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa, a major
supplier of ostrich meat to the European Union (EU), would have
to stop exporting the meat because of poultry disease, local
daily the Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Veterinary Committee of the European Commission
and a South African delegation have decided to give the latter's
ostrich industry another chance to clean up Newcastle disease and
meet the new European regulations and standards.
</P>
<P>
In July, the European Commission published a list of countries
outside the EU which would be allowed to export ostrich meat to
EU countries from next month, and left out South Africa and
countries within the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
South Africa vehemently objected to the EU and said six
abattoirs were already approved for export to the EU and their
names supplied to the European Commission last year, Gideon
Bruchkner, director of public veterinary health, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 80 percent of all ostrich meat exported
to the EU originated from South Africa, according to South
Africa's Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Bruckner said that the European Commission's decision was a
temporary reprieve for South Africa and that if major moves to
eradicate the disease in the next six months were unsuccessful,
the EU would stop importing South African ostrich meat.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of Newcastle disease in poultry and ostriches in
South Africa is still a major stumbling block in convincing the
European Commission that the export of poultry meat poses no risk
of transmitting disease to European countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle disease was a viral infection, affecting poultry
throughout South Africa, and had been in the country for many
years.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Guangdong branch of the
China Construction Bank (CCB) doubled its total purchases and
sales of foreign exchange to over four billion US dollars for the
first 11 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the branch's volume was the largest for all
of CCB's provincial branches.
</P>
<P>
A bank official noted that the branch's rapidly growing foreign
exchange business can mainly be attributed to the sustained growth
in local foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's total foreign trade volume for the first nine
months of the year hit 84 billion US dollars, up 20 percent from
the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong branch has primarily focused this year's
international business activities on international settlements,
and buying and selling foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> Commissioner's Office in HKSAR Runs Smoothly: Ma (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The commissioner of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) has expressed satisfaction with his office's work,
saying the office has been operating smoothly with its work on the
right track.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Ma Yuzhen said that over the
past half year, the commissioner's office has briefed the consular
corps in Hong Kong and the local media on its functions and duties
and established a working relationship with them.
</P>
<P>
It has also set up an effective mechanism of cooperation with
the HKSAR government, enjoyed pleasant cooperation with both Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa and the HKSAR government and won the
approval and support of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is appropriate to say that we have a fairly good
start in our work," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the commissioner's office is a body dealing with
the foreign affairs relating to the HKSAR, which is part of the
Central People's Government's responsibility, and it also serves
as a communication channel between the central government and the
HKSAR in the field of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ma added that other major tasks of his office are to assist the
HKSAR in handling on its own the external affairs within
authorization and discharge other duties entrusted by the Central
People's Government and the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He identified his office's specific areas of work as conducting
policy research, helping the HKSAR government deal with matters
relating to consular affairs, handling or assisting the HKSAR
government in solving any problems Hong Kong may have with
international organizations, international conferences and
international treaties and laws, and dealing with any other
matters related to foreign affairs.

according to the foreign policies of the central government, the
principle of "one country, two systems" and the provisions of the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The objective is to safeguard state sovereignty and national
interests, protect Hong Kong compatriots' legitimate rights and

</P>
<P>
"Our code of work is to do whatever is conducive to

and stability, maintaining Hong Kong's position as an
international shipping, financial, trade, tourism and information
center and its status as a free port and bolstering understanding,

Ma attributed the progress of his office's work to the earnest
implementation of the Basic Law and strict adherence to the
instructions of the Central People's Government and the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The progress is also inseparable from the active support and
cooperation of the HKSAR government and Hong Kong people from all

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Eleven lorries,
carrying 36 tons of relief food to Musoma in Tanzania's northern
region of Mara, have been stranded after heavy rains swept
several bridges.
</P>
<P>
The lorries carrying relief food supplies donated by the World
Food Program (WFP) have been stranded for the past three days at
Magu in Mwanza region which neighbors Mara, "The Guardian" said
today.
</P>
<P>
The continuing heavy rains have also damaged 300 houses in
Magu district, making more than 2,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The Magu District Commissioner, Reuben Ole Kunei, said Sunday
that the houses have been damaged in Kisamba, Kisesa, Magu, and
Lubuga wards.
</P>
<P>
He said that communication in the district had been disrupted
as a number of bridges have been washed away by floods making
roads impassable.
</P>
<P>
Ole Kunei also expressed fears that the four remaining bridges
might also be washed away if the rains continue.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has done everything possible to make sure
that all homeless people got medical assistance and basics.
</P>
<P>
Because of floods, prices of consumer items in Musoma town have
shot up by more than 60 percent.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has introduced 140
species of rare plants under state protection into the city from
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Shanghai Botanical Garden (SBG) is home to the
largest number of "foreign plants" in China.
</P>
<P>
Introducing a variety of plants is an important aspect of
protection. Shanghai lacks indigenous plant resources, especially
rare species. However, the city's warm moist climate is highly
conducive to plant growth, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The SBG has introduced more than 3,000 species of arbors and
bushes from other parts of the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
The Cathaya Argyrophylla, a rare and ancient tree regarded as
the "giant panda of plants", survived transplantation in Shanghai,
but has not grown well due to is heat resistance
characteristics. However, researchers are working diligently to
solve the problem.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi left here early this morning for Greece on his first
visit to the country since appointed foreign minister in August,
Tehran Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi will attend a tripartite meeting of Iran, Greece and
Armenia on a host of issues and will signed agreements with the
two countries during the meeting, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
No more details were announced about the visit. However, the
Iranian press said Kharrazi would address the Greek parliament
about Iran's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Kharrazi would repeat his country's stand
on readiness to resume dialogues with the European Union (EU)
aiming at improving relations and cooperation in the aftermath of
diplomatic standstill.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the EU and Iran cooled down in April after a
Berlin court ruling accused Iranian leaders of being behind the
murder of two dissidents and sponsoring state terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Several senior Iranian officials have called for dialogues
between Iran and the EU over their "differences" such as the issue
of British writer Salman Rushdie who was condemned to death by
Iran's late spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989 for
allegedly insulting Islam in his novel "The Satanic Verses."

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Research on Golden Monkeys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Seven golden monkeys have been
bred in the Lanzhou Zoo in northwest China's Gansu Province over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The success in breeding the animal is regarded as a remarkable
achievement of the zoologists' research.
</P>
<P>
The population of the golden monkeys in the world is no more
than several thousands. China has three types of golden monkey,
classified according to their geographic locations. They inhabit
in mountainous areas, from 1,500 to 3,800 m above sea level in
Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces in southwest China and in
Shaanxi and Gansu provinces in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The lovely monkeys with beautiful golden hair are under
first-class state protection. Experts in the Northwest China
Teacher's College and Gansu Agricultural University have carried
out special researches on the golden monkey's habits,
characteristics, and environment.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shiyuan, a zoologist at Northwest China Teacher's College,
said their research showed that golden monkeys have well-developed
respiratory system.
</P>
<P>
Golden monkeys that are nimble and can run fast have more
survival chances, added Yu.
</P>
<P>
However, golden monkeys have a low reproduction rate. They mate
in late fall, and have a gestation period of six months, usually
giving birth to one offspring. They are sexually mature at four to
six years of age and have a life expectancy of 16 to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Experts researches have greatly helped the breeding of golden
monkeys in the Lanzhou Zoo. Out of the 50 golden monkeys
artificially propagated in China, seven were born in the zoo.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province has just been granted 260 million US dollars in loans
from the World Bank for its infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
The latest loan will be used in such projects as urban and
rural water supply, environmental protection, afforestation in
poor areas, and animal husbandry, a provincial government official
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province's capital city of Shijiazhuang is
expected to use 100-million yuan of the World Bank loans in 1998,

</P>
<P>
Hebei began to make use of the World Bank loans in 1984. By now
it has received 400 million US dollars, involving 27 projects, 17
of which have been completed.
</P>
<P>
The province has established good reputation with the World
Bank by setting up a reserve funds system to repay the loans in
time. As a result, the Bank has increased its funding to Hebei.
</P>
<P>
With improved investment environment, the province has become

<HEADLINE> Imported Medicine Challenges China's Pharmaceutical Industry (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts pointed out that reorienting new drug research from
simply imitation to invention is the key to extricating the
Chinese pharmaceutical industry from its current difficult
position.
</P>
<P>
The SPAC's Administrative Center for New Drug Research and
Development has allocated 50 million yuan (six million US dollars)
to support 382 research projects in the pharmaceutical
industry. Related efforts have already yielded the development of
over a dozen new drugs.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the country's pharmaceutical industry is to regain
some of its former market share by expanding the production scale
of new drugs, said Zheng.
</P>
<P>
The Zhonghui Pharmaceutical Co., a subsidiary of the China
Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the largest company of
its kind in China, has completed a new plant with an annual
capacity to produce traditional Chinese medicine valued at five
billion yuan. The plant is located in Chengdu, capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine will help
face the challenge from imported medicines by encouraging the
company's development of new products, including "Tangmaikang" for
treating diabetes and "Tongfengding" for gout.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that few new domestic drugs have reached an
appropriate production scale, and less than 3,000 professionals
are currently involved in new drug research.
</P>
<P>
As part of its efforts to ease the shortage of funds and
talented professionals in the new drug research sector, the
country welcomes foreign investors to establish joint ventures
engaged in processing, technical transfers, joint research and new
product development, according to a SPAC spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China's pharmaceutical
industry should expand its production scale of new products in
order to compete with foreign counterparts, an official with the
State Pharmaceutical Administration of China (SPAC) stressed here
today.
</P>
<P>
Imported medicines and products manufactured by foreign-funded
enterprises currently occupy nearly 60 percent of the market in
some large Chinese cities due to the lack of an adequate
production scale for new domestic medicines, according to SPAC
Director Zheng Xiaoyu.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's second largest pharmaceutical producer, has
an annual capacity to produce 1,350 varieties of raw chemical
medicines and 4,000 kinds of Chinese herbal medicines, said Zheng.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of herbal medicines, more than 97 percent of
chemical drugs are imitations of foreign products. Up to now, no
Chinese chemical drug has been patented in a foreign country,
according to Zheng.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that herbal medicines manufactured in the Republic
of Korea and Japan also pose a major threat to Chinese herbal
medicines.
</P>
<P>
International sales of herbal medicines currently stand at 15
billion US dollars annually, with Chinese traditional medicines
accounting for a mere four percent of the total.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully developed 11 trans-gene anti-pests cotton varieties
and three anti-pests crossbred varieties.
</P>
<P>
Field tests have indicated the trans-gene cotton varieties can
kill more than 80 percent of the cotton bollworms, pink bollworms
and leaf rollers. They can also inherit the anti-pests gene to
their later generations.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said the new cotton varieties are up to the world
level.
</P>
<P>
Being one of the major state science and technology projects,
the trans-gene cotton project was jointly launched by 18 research
units headed by Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Science.
</P>
<P>
After years of experiments, Chinese scientists have
successfully introduce anti-pests gene into cotton varieties in
cotton-growing areas along the Yellow River and Yangtze River
basin areas.
</P>
<P>
Molecular tests showed that the anti-pests gene are expressed
and integrated in the new cotton varieties.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, Chinese scientists made trial planting
of the trans-gene cotton varieties in 1,670 hectares of land in
East China's Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, and central China's
Henan province. The cotton yield witnessed an increase of at least
8 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the usage of pesticide can be reduced by 50
percent, scientists said.

<HEADLINE> India Urged to Temper CAC Move Due to Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- India should not rush in to
adopt capital account convertibility (CAC) of the rupee in view of
the currency and stock market crisis rocking the South-East Asian
countries, the paper Business Standard Monday quoted a noted
economist as saying.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the financial services pact under the aegis of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) would go a long way in building
up the Indian financial sector and would also have a ripple effect
on the other sectors, Jagdish Bhagwati said here.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the pact, however, does not mean that India
should go for convertibility of the rupee as the country's foreign
trade is not large enough to absorb the aftershocks of the
currency turmoil prevailing in other parts of the world, Bhagwati
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Indian government to do its homework to clearly
define and substantiate its stand on issues like labor and
environmental standards, anti-trust and competition policies.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the government should spell out as to
what kind of labor and environmental standards it wants instead of
merely opposing the stand of western countries on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ministry to Launch Drive for Export Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Commerce Ministry
will launch nearly 390 activities at home and abroad next year to
promote exports of Thai goods in a bid to reduce the current
account deficit, the Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-five of these activities, including trade fairs,
exhibitions and trade missions, will be held in Asia, which is
seen as the most important market for Thai exports.
</P>
<P>
Main promotion targets in Asia are the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, China (including Taiwan) and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Sixty promotion activities have been planned for Europe, 56 for
the Americas, 18 for the Middle East, 16 for Australia and New
Zealand and three for Africa.
</P>
<P>
About 140 promotion events will be arranged within Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The weakening baht has made Thai exports cheaper and Thailand's
exports in the last three months (September to November) this year
were on the rise, following a drastic slowdown last year and the
first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Among Thailand's main exports are computers and parts,
garments, rubber, rice and frozen and canned seafood.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural and marine products, which do not need much

<HEADLINE> Capital Expenditure Ratio Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The ratio of capital
expenditure to gross domestic product (GDP) has steadily declined
in India since 1991 to reach its lowest 3.6 percent in 1996-97,
Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI)
sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
One of the major reasons for the current slowdown of the
economy is the cumulative impact of the declining trend of capital
expenditure and capital formation, FICCI said in an analysis on
"Capital Expenditure and Gross Capital Formation Since
Liberalization."
</P>
<P>
It described the declining ratio of capital expenditure to GDP
over the years as a matter of great concern after analyzing the
data on capital expenditure and gross capital formation during the
1990-91 to 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
According to FICCI, in 1990-91, the capital expenditure was 5.9
percent of the GDP and the corresponding gross capital formation
was 6.5 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
In the year 1992-93, the capital expenditure ratio fell to 4.2
percent, pushing down the gross capital formation to 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the year 1993-94, capital expenditure remained at 4.2
percent whereas the gross capital formation showed a slight
increase to 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1994-95, capital expenditure fell to 4.1 percent whereas the
gross capital formation marginally went up to 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
A drastic fall in capital expenditure took place in 1995-96
when it went down to 3.6 percent pulling down in its course the
rate of capital formation to 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the year 1996-97, capital expenditure fell further to 3.4
percent and gross capital formation to 4.9 percent.

<P>
BUCHAREST, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government
announced Sunday that a law on privatization has been passed to
speed up its reform pace.
</P>
<P>
The law, issued in the form of emergency decree, is aimed to
restructure businesses by closing, selling or equitizing those in
the red.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Privatization, set up in November, will work
out policies and strategies to coordinate and control the whole
process of privatization.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also list state-run enterprises to be
privatized, set a deadline for completion of the privatization
process and classify the businesses.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution, an emergency decree takes
effect once it is announced. But the parliament can veto it if it
is considered inappropriate.

Kyunhla, the country's Sagaing Division, the official newspaper
The New Light of Myanmar reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is 14.4 kilometers upstream the Kindat Dam,
will block the Mu River for irrigation and power generation.

<P>
The dam will also help irrigate more than 202,500 hectares of
land and regulate the water inflow at the Kindat and the Kaboe
dams which are located downstream, the report added.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, 12 dams were built in Myanmar
in the 1996-97 fiscal year, providing irrigation to more than
81,000 hectares of land and some 23 more projects are under
construction.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Residents Oppose Offshore Heliport Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The majority of local residents
in Japan's northern Okinawan city of Nago have voted against the
proposed construction of a sea-based U.S. military heliport, local
press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a referendum held Sunday, a total of 16,639 Nago residents
voted against the proposed 1,500-meter-long offshore heliport,
topping the 14,267 residents who supported the plan.
</P>
<P>
The offshore facility was aimed at relocating the heliport
operations of the U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station in
Ginowan, also in Okinawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Although the outcome of the referendum is not legally binding,
Nago Mayor Tetsuya Higa said he would take the results into
consideration when deciding on whether to allow the heliport to be
built.
</P>
<P>
"I respect the feelings behind both the approval and
disapproval votes and will examine the results closely," Higa said.
</P>
<P>
Higa is expected to consult Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota this
month on the prefectural government's judgment on the heliport
construction issue before making his own decision.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said earlier that the
government would not go ahead with the project without local
consent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the outcome of the referendum, Asahi Shimbun, a
leading Japanese newspaper, said in an editorial that the central
government needs to abide by the voices of the majority.
</P>
<P>
Asahi's view was echoed by Mainichi Shimbun, another
mass-circulated newspaper, which said that both the mayor of Nago
and the Okinawa governor should cherish the voting results.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Parties to Contest Polls Separately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Five major Tamil parties in
Sri Lanka have decided to contest the Northern local elections
individually after their efforts to consider a joint boycott or to
contest on a joint list ended in failure Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after leaders of the Tamil United Liberation
Front (TULF), the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP), the
People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), the Tamil
Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) and the Eelam People's
Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) failed to reach a consensus
at Sunday's joint meeting, the official newspaper Daily News said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the party leaders are to complete their
nomination lists and file the papers Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nomination of candidates, which began on December 16, ends on
December 23. The date of the elections is not available yet.
</P>
<P>
All the five parties are contesting the Jaffna Municipal
Council.
</P>
<P>
The TULF has announced that Sarojini Yogeswaran, widow of the
slain Jaffna MP V. Yogeswaran, will be its candidate for the
Jaffna mayoralty. The PLOTE nominated its deputy president, N.
Manikkathasan, as its mayoral candidate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling People's Alliance (PA) has decided not to
contest the polls in order to avoid any accusation of favoritism
by the army.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party, the United National Party, also
decided not to run.
</P>
<P>
Many Tamil parties had hoped the government would postpone the
polls in the north until the situation there turns conducive to
elections.
</P>
<P>
They had argued that the current situation in the region cannot
ensure a free and fair election. Displaced persons, particularly
the Muslims, have not been able to resettle in their hometowns
while people within the Jaffna district cannot move freely due to
various restrictions, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka held its local government elections in all but
Northern Province and parts of Eastern Province in March this
year. The local elections had been scheduled for 1995 but were
postponed twice for security reasons.

BANGKOK, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai will curtail his overseas trips to help save the
government's budget and concentrate on fighting the country's
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Chuan has decided to cancel all his overseas trips, except to
attend those international meetings requiring the presence of
heads of government, a Thai Government House source was quoted as
saying by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Traditional familiarization trips to fellow members of the

according to the source.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister will attend those
international-level conferences which require the presence of
government leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chuan's decision came as the country's revenue collection is
likely to fall short of target despite the three cuts having been
made in the government's 1997-1998 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: NATO in Between 1997 and 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The spring and summer of 1997
will be remembered as a formative period for NATO.
</P>
<P>
But the world's largest military alliance needs to justify its
attempt to grow larger in the post Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
Between May and July 1997, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) was crammed with a hectic calendar rife with
brow-lifting events including the signing of the NATO-Russia
Founding Act, the founding of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council and the invitation of three former Warsaw Pact members to
join their former foes.
</P>
<P>
For NATO, all seemed to be faring in accordance with its will,
except for one thing: a reasonable justification for its desire to
enlarge when Cold War hostility has become something of memory and
when most allied countries are concentrating on their coffers,
since they are strapped by economic austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
What is desperately needed is a persuasive explanation for the
reason why the self-defense oriented NATO is expanding in spite of
the fact that there is no visible nemesis to fend off.
</P>
<P>
Without justification, further enlargement will have to remain
in question even though the legislators of allied nations have
ratified the inclusion of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
into the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Now that NATO has disclosed that its planned expansion will
cost no more than 1.3 billion U.S. dollars over 10 years for the
present 16 member states and the three new ones, the ratification,
slated for early next year, seemed in a position to turn out
easier parliamentary formalities.
</P>
<P>
The three east European countries will be expected to spend up
to 3.5 billion dollars of their own funds over the first two years
after accession to upgrade their armed forces and equipment to
NATO standards.
</P>
<P>
Previously, however, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office and
the U.S. Department of Defense offered two enlargement cost
estimates, ranging from 27 billion to as much as 125 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Their astronomical figures enraged their European allies that
argued back that the end of the tense nuclear standoff of the Cold
War meant the end of the need for a mighty allied military force
drawn up across Europe and facing eastward.
</P>
<P>
Washington was accused by some European governments of pushing
the enlargement agenda to benefit such U.S. defense industry
giants as Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed-Martin Marietta.
</P>
<P>
In November 1991, NATO adopted a new strategic concept and
worked out guidelines for restructuring internally and externally.
</P>
<P>
Smaller, more multinational and more mobile formations were to
be substituted for the large national army corps. In June last
year, NATO set up a Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF), which is a
multinational and multi-service (including all four services of
land, sea, air and support) task force, capable of rapid
deployment to even beyond-NATO areas in the event of crises caused
by nationalism, religion, ethnics, environment and socio-economy.
</P>
<P>
In late November this year, the CJTF tested the command
capability of its headquarters as the final fine-tuning of its
year-long formation.
</P>
<P>
The CJTF command trial was a fictitious United Nations-mandated
peace-keeping operation in a made-up peninsula protruding off the
southeastern corner of Africa into the Indian Ocean. The
computerized African expedition was different in nature from the
peace-keeping missions in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 strategic concept has weakened the common
commitment by member states and national interests have taken
over, NATO has to reconsider a shift of strategic emphasis once
more.
</P>
<P>
Warren Christopher and William Perry, two veterans of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's first-term cabinet and both instrumental
in designing the enlargement, stressed that it is a strategic
imperative that NATO shift emphasis from defense of members'
territory to defense of common interests.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Assembly, a consensus-building vanguard of
the Western military alliance as NATO chief Javier Solana put it,
reached an agreement at its 43rd annual session in October that
NATO has to revise its strategic concept to justify its existence
and development.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians from NATO nations agreed in Bucharest that the
alliance has to redefine the events that could lead up in future
to NATO actions, especially actions responsive to non-Article V
events.
</P>
<P>
Such a revision of strategic concept means an entirely new NATO
Charter. In Article V, the existing charter pledges that joint
action can be taken only when any one of the member states is
attacked. Such an attack should be taken as an attack on all
member states.
</P>
<P>
Only after it revises the self-defining charter will NATO have
sensible and suitable military reason to develop as well as
exist. A revision can best be expected around April 1999, when
NATO celebrates its 50th anniversary and winds up the formative
period set off by the hectic activities in this past spring and
summer.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Acts to Prevent Kids From Lead Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in the Chinese capital
Beijing are conducting blood tests on children in the kindergartens
to find out whether they have too much lead in their blood.
</P>
<P>
The massive health check was triggered off by a recent survey
in Beijing which shows that 69.6 percent of the children randomly
selected for the blood testing have more lead in their body than
medically permitted.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that children are most vulnerable to lead
poisoning. Auto emission, paints, some writing materials such as
pencils and crayons, even some snacks such as pop corns can be the
culprits.
</P>
<P>
Children with minor lead-poisoning can have behavior and
learning problems. They tend to be restless, aggressive and
short-tempered and more prone to illness including cold and
anemia.
</P>
<P>
Doctors plan to use non-medicine method to treat the
lead-affected children and are calling for reinforced prevention
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Currently some 170 nurses in the kindergartens from the city's 18
suburban counties and townships are receiving special training in
this regard.

Kostov has described the year of 1997 as a dramatic and successful
one for his government in which Bulgaria restored its dignity.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency Sunday,
Kostov said under the government's policies, a series of tough
problems have been resolved, and the country has started to pull
through the first stage of its economic crisis.

On the tasks of his government next year, Kostov cited the
fight against organized crime and the reform in economic structure
as the two biggest challenges facing his country.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of joining the EU, the prime minister said that
the most difficult thing is to reach the economic criteria of the
organization.
</P>

Kostov was elected prime minister in May this year. His party,
the Union of the Democratic Forces (UDF), defeated the ruling
socialists in an election ahead of time.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The shipbuilding industry in Fu'an became bleak in 1995,

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Projects End Drinking Water Shortages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Water supply projects now
enable 4.5 million farmers and herdsmen in Inner Mongolia to drink
as much water as they want.
</P>
<P>
The projects have also ended the long-standing water shortage
affecting over 13.44 million head of livestock in the region.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate drinking water supply facilities and a nomadic way
of life have long forced people living in the vast grasslands in
Inner Mongolia to rely on inadequate rainfall and melting
snow. The water shortage is even more severe during droughts.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the drive to build water supply facilities
had removed drinking water shortages for more than three million
people and 10 million head of livestock.
</P>
<P>
A plan adopted in 1996 will solve drinking water shortages for
the remaining 3.8 million people and over 12 million head of
livestock by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The central, regional and local governments have invested 150
million yuan (18.07 million US dollars) to construct 11,828 water
supply projects which now supply drinking water to one million
people and 2.23 million head of livestocks.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Borrow for Higher Foreign Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines is planning to borrow 500 million U.S. dollars to
boost its dwindling foreign reserves in order to defend the local
currency from speculation.
</P>
<P>
The gross international reserves (GIR) was reduced to 9.7
billion dollars last week from 10.2 billion dollars in October due
to its massive intervention in the local currency market during
the period, local press reports Monday quoted Central Bank
Governor Gabriel Singson as saying.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has received offers from many global
investment bankers to underwrite medium- or long-term bond
issuances to boost its GIR, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
"I think we must start building our war chest, just in case,"
Singson said of the need to reinforce the country's present
holdings of foreign exchange, mostly U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the most obvious source of foreign funds right now
is the International Monetary Fund from which the central bank may
get 345 million dollars, the last tranche of the Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) the IMF promised to the country.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is also entitled to receive a parallel
financing facility from Japan Export and Import Bank (Jexim)
amounting to some 300 million dollars if the country meets all the
requirements tied to the EFF program.
</P>
<P>
Singson said he is optimistic the IMF and Jexim will release
the funds after the country graduates from the IMF's EFF program
in January next year.
</P>
<P>
The GIR consists of the central bank's total assets in foreign
exchange. A higher GIR level reflects a government's greater
ability to finance the country's imports and meet foreign
obligations.

China National Theatre is on the construction list, and it is
to be built to the west of the Great Hall of the People. Upon
completion, the theatre will be the largest of its kind in the

Construction will start in the first half of next year and the
main part of the building is due to be completed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sources said early in 1958, designs were made for the theatre
but its construction was deferred, mainly due to shortages of
funds.

<HEADLINE> Aging Stars Put Europe Back in Contention (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Speed and agility may have
diminished with the years. But the technique remains and hunger
is still growing in both Jan-Ove Waldner and Zoran Primorac,
winners of the most conveted table tennis honors in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The two veterans well past their primes ruined an otherwise
perfect year for China, putting Europe back into fray with the
table tennis powerhouse which had swept all major titles in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Swede, whose last men's world singles title
came in 1989, denied China a once-again seven-title sweep by
edging Chinese out of the top two and demoralizing upstart
Vladimir Samsonov in the final which turned from a predictedly
even game to a one-man show.
</P>
<P>
Primorac, 28, the backbone of Yugoslavia's 1991 world
runners-up squad and now a role model in Croatia, added the World
Cup to his China Open title despite the conflict in war-torn
Yugoslavia had for quite long time made his training sporadic.
</P>
<P>
China showed its matchless depth by bagging six gold medals in
the Manchester world championships in May, where diminutive Deng
Yaping lifted her ninth title to become the most-crowned in the
table tennis history.
</P>
<P>
Six, a lucky number for the Chinese, didn't make their players
happy. It was the men's singles championship that China wanted to
get most.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Samsonov put Belarus into the world map of
table tennis by beating China's 1995 world champion and World Cup
winner Kong Linghui for the first time in their four encounters.
Waldner snatched the other final spot with an easy win over
another Chinese Yan Sen.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, the only male player to have won a Grand Slam of the
Olympic, world championship and World Cup singles honors, crushed
Samsonov in a ruthless demonstration of who was the best in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The immensely experienced Swede revenged his 6-21, 7-21 team
match loss to Samsonov, beating his rival in straight sets to
take the most coveted singles championship after a hiatus of
eight years.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a title bout of the world best heavyweights," said
Swedish head coach Ulf Carlsson. "Jan-Ove knocked out Vladimir."
</P>
<P>
Waldner after the match tipped Samsonov as next in line to the
throne.
</P>
<P>
But Samsonov's run to the top was delayed by hand injuries and
a series of listless outings.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian, who beat four Chinese in a row to enter the
world championship final, has been struggling a little since. He
lost in the Japan Open to Wang Liqin, in the China Open to Ma Lin
and to Kong Linghui in the World Cup semi-finals in October, the
three Chinese he had defeated in Manchester.

<TEXT>
<P>
Primorac, the World Cup winner in 1993 and 1997, was holding
the European standard in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
In October's World Cup, world number six Primorac beat Kong
Linghui to take the 36,000-dollar winner check without losing a
set in six matches.
</P>
<P>
Primorac believed it was mental strength that carried him
through to the World Cup title. "I felt once the match got close
I could still win -- I had a lot of confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was a continuation of regained form which saw him win the
China Open in September and reach the finals of the European
Masters Cup and Brazilian Open.
</P>
<P>
Kong, who had fame thrust on him at an early age, was not
disgraced by finishing second. Had Kong won, it would have been
China's 11th World Cup out of 18 dating back to 1980.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Chinese won the doubles event with Olympic
singles-doubles champion Liu Guoliang after pacing China to its
12th team championship in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
After the World Cup, China once again sounded the alarm.
</P>
<P>
"In the men's table tennis, Chinese have no advantage over
Europeans," warned Xu Yinsheng, the head of the Chinese Table
Tennis Association who is also the president of ITTF, the world
ruling body for the sport.
</P>
<P>
"There is the writing on the wall," he said, "Chinese have to
improve on their skills and toughen their mentality."
</P>
<P>
Primorac agreed with Xu in part. "We can compete with Chinese
individually but none of the European nations is a match for
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the World Cup holder called for a Ryder Cup style
format in table tennis to make men's team events more competitive
against China.
</P>
<P>
"In team events it's very hard to beat China and I think they
will dominate for the next 10 years. But I think if we had a
European team, we could beat them," Primorac said.
</P>
<P>
Like in golf's Ryder Cup, where Europe beat the United States
14.5 to 13.5 in September, the event became more competitive once
the British and Irish joined force with mainland Europe.
</P>
<P>
Primorac noted there was some hope for European players
because they in general had better backhands.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the Chinese penhold players have weak backhands which
is a major disadvantage," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's desperate save of the traditional penhold style paid
off in 1996 as it finally produced a double Olympic champion in
Liu Guoliang, who sticks rubber onto both sides of the bat and
plays topspins with backhand.
</P>
<P>
Feng Zhe and Ma Lin, who both play like Liu, upset Waldner and
Samsonov respectively in the China Open, winning the praise that
China had succeeded in evolution of the style which had once been
regarded as a dying art.
</P>
<P>
"The two youngsters's victories were significant to the
Chinese traditional style," Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua
said. "We have improved a lot on penholders' backhand offensive
and power."
</P>
<P>
Whereas the Chinese men had been struggling in barrages by
Europeans, their women players still ruled the roost in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's team, led by four-time Olympic champion
Deng Yaping, clean-swept the women's titles in the Manchester
Worlds.
</P>
<P>
Wang Nan, world championship runner-up to Deng, snatched the
World Cup in September in absence of her awesome teammate.
</P>
<P>
The year-end world rankings may as well serve as a testimony
of the Chinese women's strength. Seven of the top ten are
Chinese, with the others former Chinese nationals now playing for
their adopted countries or regions.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Supports Indo-Pak talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga said here Sunday that her country supports
the process of dialogue between Pakistan and India to address
their contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the talks will move forward even if they don't
progress as fast as we like," she said.
</P>
<P>
The president, who arrived here Saturday for a three-day
official visit, noted that Pakistan has always expressed the
desire to resolve the issues with India through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
She denied that members of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) are trying to form blocks within the
organization.
</P>
<P>
"No, we don't need to form blocks within SAARC, there is
nothing we can't resolve within ourselves through dialogue," she
said in response to a question after delivering a speech titled
"South Asia: Into Next Century" at the Institute of Regional
Studies.
</P>
<P>
Chandrika said earlier in her speech that the political
dialogue initiated between New Delhi and Islamabad was greeted by
the other member States of SAARC, "with relief and undisguised
optimism."
</P>
<P>
The current political confidence among South Asian States, she
said, has developed to a remarkable degree if contrasted with the
situation which prevailed in the early days of SAARC, which groups
Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and the
Maldives.
</P>
<P>
"Cold War postures have melted or appear less threatening," she
said, adding that "issues that once divided us can now be seen
with greater clarity and addressed more directly"
</P>
<P>
She hoped that SAARC may in time even be able to deal
collectively with the remaining political issues that stand in the
way of progress.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that economic activity in SAARC needs to be
widened to include joint ventures, intra-regional investment,
technological exchanges, tourism promotion and joint services.
</P>
<P>
While each state in South Asia has to come to terms
individually with the globalization process, taking into account
its own needs and capacities, it would be better equipped to face
the harsh realities of the market place if these realities could
be approached collectively. "Here I see an important role for
SAARC."

NEW YORK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- New York center Patrick Ewing
will be sidelined for the rest of the National Basketball

The Jamaican-born star, who led the United States to Olympic
gold in 1984 and 1992, suffered torn ligaments and a dislocation

<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's striking duo Ronaldo
and Romario scored a hat-trick apiece as Brazil crushed 10-man
Australia 6-0 to win the Confederations' Cup here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The game was degenerated into a one-sided exhibition in the
24th minute when Australian striker Mark Viduka was sent off for a
wild challenge on Brazil wingback Cafu.
</P>
<P>
By then Brazil were already overwhelming after an explosive
start that saw Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich make four good
saves in the opening 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The inevitable breakthrough came in the 15th minute when
Denilson waltzed to the byline and cut back the ball for the
unmarked Ronaldo to hit into the top of the net.
</P>
<P>
The Inter Milan star striked for the second in the 28th minute
as he stole between two defenders and tapped the ball past Bosnich
into the net to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Seven minutes before the half time, the 1994 World Cup winner
Romario made it three as he rushed down the right flank and hit
home.
</P>
<P>
After 75 minutes it was 6-0 as Ronaldo completed his hat-trick
in the 59th minute and Romario's two second-half goals in the 53rd
and a penalty spot shot in the 75th minutes.
</P>
<P>
The six-goal triumph came just a week after Australia had held
the Brazilians to a goalless draw in a group match at the same
venue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday the Czech Republic beat Uruguay 1-0 in the
third place play-off match.

NANNING December 22 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan has invested 1.2 billion
U.S. dollars to establish 706 enterprises in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region and become the second largest investor in
the region after Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of these investments are in light industry; 25
percent in real estate, tourism and catering; and the remainder in
such industries as machinery, agriculture and forestry, breeding,
building materials, chemical industry, medicine and
high-technology, said Lu Chi, the local official in charge of
Taiwan affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lu said 49 percent of the Taiwan-funded enterprises are joint
ventures, 15 percent are co-operatives and 36 percent are wholly
Taiwan-funded.
</P>
<P>
The region has attracted 71 Taiwan-funded enterprises in
agricultural production involving a total contractual investment
of 70 million U.S. dollars, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has also invested in poor areas of the region as well as
in the cities of Nanning, Liuzhou, Guizhou and Beihai.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Christian Mayer of Austria
claimed the victory in the World Cup giant slalom in Alta Badia,
Italy on Sunday after Italian legend Alberto Tomba crashed out of
the second try.
</P>
<P>
Mayer, the 1994 Olympic bronze medallist at Lillehammer and who
was leading after the first run, clocked a combined time of two
minutes 20.97 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's Michael Von Gruenigen, who had been hoping for
his third victory in four races, had to settle for second place in
2:21.40, while Austria's overall World Cup leader Hermann Maier
was third in 2:21.63.
</P>
<P>
It was another devastating victory for the Austrian ski
machine, which after filling the top five places in the second
downhill at Beaver Creek, filled seven of the top eight places
here.
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser of the day was Tomba, who had won in Alta
Badia four times before and had been promising his fans a
Christmas present, either at Alta Badia or at Madonna di Campiglio
in Monday's slalom.
</P>
<P>
Organisers spent more than five minutes working on the piste
before Tomba went down, after he had moved up to sixth place in
the first run, having started with bib number 19.
</P>
<P>
But the triple Olympic champion, who had complained about the
state of the piste after the first run, lost his balance
completely after half a minute of the second. He just about
managed to stay upright but promptly straddled a gate with his
legs wide apart.

<HEADLINE> Central China Using Satellites To Reduce Flood Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan
Province will try to use satellites to reduce the effect of
flooding in the Dongting Lake area, according to experts at a
recent Sino-French seminar here.
</P>
<P>
A satellite system is expected to be operating by May, 1998 for
the lake area, which has 700,000 ha of farmland and 10 million
people. It is a key grain area that generates a third of the
province's agricultural output value, also an important industrial
center on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The lake has had flood disasters in 37 years since the country
was founded in 1949, and China began to use meteorology satellites
to forecast floods in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
One professor who has studied the phenomenon all that time,
says that it is now the time to establish a better satellite
system. The new system will forecast floods, and also provide
information on how to resume production after the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Province Making Progress In Animal Husbandry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
high expectations for its animal husbandry, according to an
agriculture official, who explains that an expansion program that
began early last year increased meat output by 2.35 million tons
and egg output by 675,000 tons by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the industry contributed 56.2 yuan to each farmer on
average, accounting for a fifth of the per-capita net income
increase last year.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to increase 4.5 to five million tons in
animal husbandry output by the end of this century, the official
says. It is expected to generate 23 billion yuan in annual output
value by that time, and it will contribute over 1,000 yuan to the
annual income of each farmer.
</P>
<P>
The province's meat output in the first ten months of this year
was 2.21 million tons, and 703,000 tons for eggs, up 18.7 percent
and 16 percent respectively from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the sector has obtained 13 million yuan
(1.5 million U.S. dollars) in government funding for 16 new
breeding bases, so that it can generate 72 percent of the
province's animal husbandry production.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
today launched a 195 million U.S. dollars campaign to reinforce
the prevention of youths from abusing illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
The program will be carried out in 12 cities for four months.
Anti-drug ads will run everywhere children aged 9 to 17 are likely
to be watching, from television to the Internet, General Barry
McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
said.
</P>
<P>
The ads are to be tested from January through April in Atlanta,
Baltimore, Boise, Denver, Hartford, Houston, Milwaukee, Portland,
San Diego, Sioux City, Tucson and Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Today's announcement marks the January initiation of a
multifaceted national campaign that will harness the energies of
parents, mass media, corporate America and the anti-drug
coalitions to halt and reverse the disturbing rise in drug use
among young people," McCaffrey said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton in a radio address Saturday called on parents
to make efforts to prevent children from abusing drugs.
</P>
<P>
A survey released Saturday shows that Marijuana use is still on
the rise among 10th and 12th graders in the nation. The
12th-graders who use illicit drugs, including marijuana, cocaine,
heroin and hallucinogens, increased from 27.1 percent in 1992 to
40.2 percent in 1996 and further to 42.2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Among the eight-graders, a 1991 survey showed that 6.2 percent
reported smoking marijuana in the prior year. But by 1996, the
percentage rose to 18.3. However, this year's study found that the
percentage dropped to 17.7.

WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
left here for Bosnia today for a holiday visit to greet the 8,500
U.S. troops there and highlight the need for an indefinite
American presence in the Balcan region.
</P>
<P>
The president left the White House by helicopter and flew to
Andrews Air Force Base for the all-night journey to Sarajevo. He
was joined by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter
Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
Besides his family, Clinton took along a top-level delegation
that includes former GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole; his wife
Elizabeth, president of the American Red Cross; and a number of
congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton planned to meet with Bosnia's joint presidency and
deliver a speech in Sarajevo before flying to Tuzla to share a
holiday meal with American soldiers posted in the city.
</P>
<P>
The White House hoped the visit would lend an appropriate
personal touch to Clinton's decision to maintain an American
presence in the war-torn Balkans beyond the June 1998 deadline.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, Clinton announced that it was a "mistake" to
set a specific timetable for withdrawal of U.S. forces from Bosnia
and that he and his NATO partners are drafting plans for a
long-term stay.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen also said earlier today on
CBS's "Face the Nation" that "the president came to the
conclusion, and one that I share, that we should stay until the
seeds of peace have taken much deeper root and can become
self-sustaining."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Suspends Death Sentence for Jordanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has informed Jordan it has
suspended a death sentence for a Jordanian prisoner, a move aimed
at easing the tension caused by its execution of five Jordanians
this month, Jordan's official news agency, Petra, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the death sentence for the prisoner Ammar
Ghaleb Shebabeddine charged with smuggling car spare parts is a
result of continuous contacts between the two countries, Jordanian
Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh told Petra.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh said that Jordan has tried its best to ensure fair
trial for every Jordanian prisoner by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates have put the number of Jordanian prisoners
in Iraq at more than 100. But according to unofficial sources,
Iraq holds more than 600 Jordanian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of death sentence for Shebabeddine came amid
reports that Jordan and Iraq would take steps to strengthen
economic cooperation in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Petra today quoted an anonymous Jordanian official as saying
that an Iraqi delegation will arrive in Amman to sign a commercial
agreement aimed to expand bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has intended to increase its imports of badly needed food
and medicine through Jordan's port of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
It also wants to increase imports of Jordanian goods from 255
million U.S. dollars in 1997 to 300 million dollars in 1998, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan has asked Iraq to export more oil to it, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq executed five Jordanians on charge of smuggling car spare
parts and murder earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
And Jordan expelled seven Iraqi diplomats in retaliation and
expressed perplexity with Iraq's actions.
</P>
<P>
Jordan sided with Iraq during the 1990 Gulf crisis caused by
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. After the Gulf War in 1991 that drove
the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait, the bilateral ties suffered a
setback as Jordan distanced itself from Iraq to end international
alienation.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the ties have been picking up as Iraq begins
to provide the kingdom with more and more oil at discount prices
and keeps increasing imports from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq exported to Jordan 625 million dollars worth of oil this
year, a 7 percent increase over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> 2 Greek Diplomats Ordered to Leave Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey had ordered two Greek
diplomats to leave the country under the accusation of being
involved in espionage, a local private television station reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Greek Military Attache Efstratios Haralambous and an
administrative official at the Greek consulate in Turkey's largest
city of Istanbul were accused of spying for Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), the report said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 against the government for
autonomy in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Turkish National Intelligence
Organization had been shadowing the Greek military attache and
discovered he was spying for the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry had summoned Greek Ambassador in
Ankara Dimitris Nezeritis and told him that Haralambous was
involved in "acts outside his official duty" and asked him to
leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Greece today denied Turkey's accusation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Greece of supporting the PKK and allowing it
to establish mobile training camps on its soil. But Greece has
rejected the charge.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, have long been at odds
over several issues including the limits of air space and the
Aegean Sea, rights to sea-bed minerals and the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Luxor Police Chiefs Stand Trial for Neglect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Four police officers in charge
of the security in Luxor today stood trial for dereliction of duty
in the terrorist attack in the southern Egyptian city last month.
</P>
<P>
On trial at the Primary Disciplinary Council are Colonel Amr
Ahmed Agour, First Lieutenants Ibrahim Mohamed Al Saady and Sherif
Afifi, officers at the General Directorate of Luxor Police, and Lt.
Colonel Sherif Gamal Thabet, Chief of the Antiquities Section.
</P>
<P>
They were charged of "gross negligence and laxity" and failure
to lay down plans for securing historical sites in Egypt's largest
archeological city from terrorist attacks, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The charges leveled against them were based on the fact
that they neglected their duties, despite their awareness through
intelligence reports that terrorists were targeting such sites
and their visitors, said the MENA.
</P>
<P>
All of the four defendants pleaded not guilty. They face
penalties of notice, dismissal, warning, suspension, cut in
salaries or acquittal. They have the right to appeal before the
Higher Police Council and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist threats culminated in the November 17 attack when
six Islamic militants went on a shooting spree in front the
4,500-year-old Hatshepsut Temple, killing over 60 foreign tourists
and Egyptians. The area around the temple was guarded by only two
patrols and the police were slow to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 10-minute trial, the Council adjourned
hearings of the case until January 4. It also decided that the
next trial be a secret one.
</P>
<P>
The trial took place following investigations by the Inspection
and Control Sector of the Interior Ministry. After the incident,
Egypt has replaced its top security chief, kicked out a number of
senior police officers and revamped its security plans.
