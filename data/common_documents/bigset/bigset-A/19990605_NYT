JOHN J. MCKEITHEN, 81, FORMER LOUISIANA GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John J. McKeithen, Louisiana's first governor to serve two
consecutive terms, who practiced moderation at a time of intense
racial conflict in the Deep South and gave New Orleans the
Superdome, died Friday at a hospital in Columbia, La. He was 81 and
lived in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He had been in declining health since undergoing heart surgery
two years ago, said his friend Dave Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   McKeithen was governor from 1964 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch Democrat and protege of Earl Long, who was a
multi-term governor, McKeithen was so popular in his first
administration that the Legislature passed a law allowing a
governor to succeed himself. A ban on serving two consecutive terms
as governor was instituted at the turn of the century but was
lifted for McKeithen, who was known for his oratory.
</P>
<P>
   But in his second term, McKeithen was drawn into controversy
over accusations of Mafia influence in his administration, although
the scandal was never linked to him personally.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Renwick, director of the Loyola University Institute of
Politics who followed McKeithen's career, credited him with four
major accomplishments: the beginning of the end of segregation in
Louisiana, the decision to build the Superdome, leadership in the
passage of a state constitutional amendment that permits state
governors to run for two four-year terms, and the emergence of
consensus politics.
</P>
<P>
   John Martzell, a New Orleans lawyer who was executive secretary
of the State Human Relations Commission from 1966 to 1972, said
Friday that McKeithen's efforts to promote racial harmony are
little known even today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing he did came in a speech he delivered
to the AFL-CIO convention in Baton Rouge in the summer of 1966,''
Martzell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pointed to some blacks in the audience and said, `I know
I'm not leaving this state, and I don't think you're leaving
either. So we've got to solve our problem.' It was giving the
imprimatur of the state governor to solving racial differences.
Previous governors had always proclaimed massive resistance to
integration. He had a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   He also appointed black Louisianans to state offices in a time
of racial unrest in his state.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Louisiana Superdome, which has 75,000 seats,
came from his friend Dixon, a successful plywood manufacturer who
now runs an art and antiques gallery in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited him in 1965 and suggested the stadium would have a
great economic impact on the state,'' Dixon recalled Friday. ``The
governor listened very carefully to what I had to say and then
jumped up, pounded his fist on the table and said `That could be
the greatest building in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Superdome's cost, estimated at $22 million, wound up being
$130 million and the stadium was not completed until 1975 after he
had been out of office for three years.
</P>
<P>
   John Julian McKeithen was born in rural Grayson on May 28, 1918,
the son of a farmer. His parents wanted him to become a Methodist
minister, but he went on to obtain a law degree at Louisiana State
University and set up a practice in Columbia, a small town in the
Red Hills of northern Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   He was an unknown country lawyer when Long picked him in 1948 as
a floor leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me not to worry _ I'd get on all right, and I guess I
did,'' McKeithen later recalled.
</P>
<P>
   McKeithen is survived by his wife, Marjorie, of Columbia; a son,
Walter Fox McKeithen, who is Louisiana's secretary of state and
lives in Baton Rouge; four daughters, Rebecca M. Hamilton, who
lives in China; Melissa M. Cummings of Columbia; Pamela M. Plummer
of Ruston, La.; and Jenny M. Borders of St. Francisville, La., and
15 grandchildren. His oldest son, Jesse Jay McKeithen, died last
year.

PROSECUTOR, SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES ACQUITTED OF WRONGFULLY ACCUSING
MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)  
 By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO, June 4 _ A former prosecutor and four sheriff's
deputies were acquitted Friday of conspiring to put an innocent man
on death row in the murder of a 10-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   The case had drawn national attention because it is rare for
law-enforcement officials to face such charges and because the man
accused of the murder, Rolando Cruz, is one of 12 death-row inmates
in Illinois found to have been wrongly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   A former DuPage state's attorney, Thomas Knight, now in private
practice, and three DuPage County sheriff's officers, James
Montesano, Thomas Vosburgh and Dennis Kurzawa, were acquitted by a
jury after 12 hours of deliberations, and 28 days of testimony, on
charges of obstruction of justice, perjury and conspiracy. A fourth
sheriff's officer, Robert Winkler, was acquitted by the presiding
judge in the case, William Kelly. In May, Kelly dismissed charges
against two other former prosecutors in the case, Robert Kilander,
now a Du Page County judge, and Patrick King, now an assistant U.S.
attorney in Chicago. Kelly said there was insufficient evidence
against them.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom erupted in loud cheers and applause as the
verdicts were announced. Among those in the courtroom were Tom and
Patricia Nicarico, the parents of the slain girl, who have defended
the actions of the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a moment that should have happened a long time ago,''
Mrs. Nicarico said as she left the courtroom in tears. ``These are
good men who didn't deserve this. It's a true celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Vosburgh said after the verdict: ``This day speaks a lot for law
enforcement. I think it shows we were doing our job and we were
doing it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz was charged with the murder and sexual assault of Jeanine
Nicarico, who was abducted by someone who kicked in the door of her
house in the affluent town of Naperville, outside Chicago, in 1983.
Her body was found two days later in woods about six miles away.
</P>
<P>
   After a highly publicized investigation, DuPage County sheriff's
deputies charged Cruz. He was convicted in two separate trials and
spent 10 years on death row, but was acquitted in a third trial in
1995 after one of the sheriff's officers recanted his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Hernandez was also convicted in the killing and
sentenced to death. His death sentence was later commuted and he,
too, was exonerated in 1995. But a judge ruled that the conspiracy
trial should focus only on accusations in the Cruz case.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the accusations involved the strategy used to convict
Cruz and Hernandez: testimony by Vosburgh and Kurzawa that Cruz
told them he had dreamed about the girl's killing and disclosed
details the deputies said only the killer could know.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz and his lawyers have repeatedly said the deputies
fabricated the dream, and there was no written investigator's
report about it. In 1995, in Cruz's third trial (his two previous
convictions had been overturned on appeal), Lieutenant Montesano
said he had testified falsely in the first two trials that the
deputies had told him about Cruz' s dream. As a result, the judge
acquitted Cruz. Hernandez was released shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the grand jurors who originally indicted Cruz testified
at the conspiracy trial that Cruz babbled to them that he had had a
dream about the killing, although there is no written record that
he gave such testimony.
</P>
<P>
   As the star witness in the trial, Cruz testified that he made no
dream statement. But he had made contradicting statements to
investigators in the past and before reading his verdict tonight,
Judge Kelly said he simply did not believe Cruz. At one point
during the trial, Cruz admitted that he is receiving counseling for
a lying problem.
</P>
<P>
   The jury would not comment on the verdict other than a short
statement they released in which they said they felt the state
failed to prove its case.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler was accused of falsely testifying that Cruz told him
about acquiring and disposing of a car used in the killing. King
and Knight were accused of presenting the testimony, knowing it was
false. Judge Kilander was accused of failing to inform defense
lawyers that a lawyer for Brian Dugan, a convicted child rapist and
murderer, had told him that Dugan admitted to killing Jeanine.
</P>
<P>
   Dugan, serving a life sentence for two rapes and murders, was
linked to the Nicarico slaying by DNA testing in 1989, but has not
been charged. He has said he will talk with the authorities only if
they promise not to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Kilander's lawyer, Ronald Menaker, has suggested that his client
fulfilled his obligation because he had told defense lawyers about
an interview he had had with Dugan shortly after he talked with
Dugan's lawyer.

BELCHER SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pitcher Tim Belcher might not know the guys
wearing the Dodgers uniforms, but he still feels right at home in
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who will start for the Anaheim Angels tonight, made his
major-league debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium
in 1987 and pitched there before he was traded to the Cincinnati
Reds after the 1991 season.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he pitched at Dodger Stadium was as a member of
the Reds on June 7, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher has fond memories of the stadium, and with good reason.
His lifetime record there is 33-16 with a 2.49 ERA, which includes
a loss in his only start as an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about the games back then after so many years, I
think about the stadium,'' Belcher said. ``I think about Gibby's
home run (Kirk Gibson in the 1988 World Series), Dennis Martinez's
(of the Expos) perfect game, Orel (Hershiser's
consecutive-scoreless-inning) streak, Ramon (Martinez) striking out
18 Braves in one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with that organization, there's not a whole lot left from
when I was there, so it's not like it's a reunion-type thing. But
it's always nice to go back to one of my favorite stadiums.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien on DL: The Angels placed catcher Charlie O'Brien on the
15-day disabled list with a ligament tear in his right foot. It's
the same injury that forced Tim Salmon to the DH spot last season.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien suffered the injury Wednesday night at Edison Field
while running out a fly ball. Utility player Steve Decker, already
with the team, will serve as the team's third catcher behind Matt
Walbeck and Todd Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing O'Brien on the roster is outfielder Reggie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back: Third baseman Troy Glaus continued his return
from a month-long slump in May with his third home run in the past
six games Friday off the Dodgers' Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why I really tip my hat to him is because he kept working at
it,'' manager Terry Collins said of Glaus' battle to end his slump.
``He looked at film, worked with (hitting coach) Rod (Carew),
changed some things and got out of it. If he ever had another
(slump), which he will, I think he'll get out of it faster.''

ECHINACEA, A MEDICINAL HERB, IS MAJOR TOPIC AT SCIENTIFIC
CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At an Eckerd drug
store here, all they have to do is put echinacea on the shelves and
the cash registers start ringing. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``During cold season it blows out of here,'' store manager
George Honaker said. ``The last two winters everybody has been
swearing by it. They say it's wiping out colds in two days.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Echinacea, a medicinal herb made from a purple coneflower that
grows wild in the Great Plains, has become the fastest selling
herbal product in the nation, some experts say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 7 percent of Americans have tried echinacea in hopes that
it will protect them from colds and flu, according to one survey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But do the pills, cough drops, teas and extracts that people are
paying $300 million for each year really work? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, is the most some experts gathered this week in Kansas
City at a scientific conference on echinacea could say. The
conference, which ends Saturday at the Ritz-Carlton, Kansas City
hotel, was sponsored by the American Herbal Products Association,
an industry group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is mounting that taking echinacea ahead of time won't
keep you from getting a cold, researchers at the conference said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at least four studies suggest that popping some echinacea
capsules or sipping on echinacea tea at the first signs of a
scratchy throat or runny nose may shorten a cold by several days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether echinacea can prevent a cold is not well-determined by
the science. But there is evidence it can reduce symptoms,'' said
Mark Blumenthal, who teaches at the University of Texas School of
Pharmacy and directs the American Botanical Council. The council is
a nonprofit group that promotes research on medicinal herbs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, according to Blumenthal: ``We need more
studies.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the research showing echinacea reduces cold symptoms
ranges in quality from ``pretty good'' to ``not particularly
convincing,'' said Bruce Barrett, a University of Wisconsin Medical
School researcher who is conducting his own study on whether
echinacea helps cold sufferers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a clear picture yet,'' Barrett said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Health claims for echinacea and other medicinal herbs are often
based on slender evidence, Blumenthal said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Studies are done with small numbers of people, so their
conclusions lack the statistical certainty of large-scale studies.
Or the research is conducted in test tubes or on laboratory animals
in ways that don't clearly apply to people. &QL; 
Scant oversight &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the problem with inadequate research has to do with the
way these products are regulated in the United States, Blumenthal
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act, which gave manufacturers greater freedom to market
dietary supplements such as vitamins and herbs and to make claims
about their benefits on product labels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One brand of echinacea tea, for example, includes the claim:
``Supports the immune system.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These claims have to be backed by scientific evidence. But the
rules aren't as strict as for prescription drugs, which must
undergo rigorous testing for safety and effectiveness before the
Food and Drug Administration approves them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claims about a supplement don't have to be submitted to the Food
and Drug Administration for approval before the product goes on the
market. And although the manufacturer must be able to substantiate
its claim, it doesn't have to make the information publicly
available. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any evaluation procedure in this country (for
herbal products),'' Blumenthal said. ``What we would like is a
rational, intelligent botanical expert advisory panel.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another area where regulation falls short is in standardizing
the ingredients in herbal products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consumers buying echinacea, for example, are faced with a
bewildering array of products. Three different species of the plant
are used commercially. Manufacturers use the plant's roots, the
parts above the ground, or both. And the plants are squeezed into
juice, dried to make capsules, or concentrated into alcohol
tinctures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no way of knowing that one brand of echinacea contains
all the same active ingredients as another brand. And no guarantee
that one batch of a single brand is the same as the next one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A higher priced product may be of higher quality, said botanist
and echinacea expert Steven Foster of Fayetteville, Ark. But
there's really little way to tell which products are best. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a congressional committee in March, Food and
Drug Administration Commissioner Jane Henney said that the agency
``still has a long way to go'' in implementing regulations for
herbs and other supplements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the FDA's ``A'' list for completion this year, she said, are
new manufacturing regulations to assure the consistency of
supplements and more specific rules on health claims. &QL; 
Questions remain &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors remain highly skeptical about the value of
echinacea and other herbal remedies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many claims made for herbs and extracts and
supplements, and many of them are untrue,'' said Wallace Sampson, a
clinical professor of medicine at Stanford University and editor of
the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Herbs often may appear effective, Sampson said, because ``the
last thing you take before you get better seems to work.
Psychologically, these kinds of associations are very powerful.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Blumenthal, who teaches physicians how to integrate
medicinal herbs into their practices, has seen a dramatic shift in
their attitudes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, they used to ask, `Do these really work?' Now
they ask which brands to recommend,'' Blumenthal said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Echinacea's history as a medicinal herb goes back to American
Indians, who used it for coughs, colds, sore throats and
toothaches. It was adopted by some doctors in the 19th century, but
other doctors called it a quack remedy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The herb has been popular in Germany and other western European
countries since the 1930s. Much of the research into its use is
being done there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one European study presented at the conference, 120 people in
the early stages of colds received either echinacea or a placebo.
About 40 percent of those getting echinacea progressed to
full-blown colds, compared to 60 percent of those receiving the
placebo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those who received echinacea had cold symptoms for an average of
four days, compared to eight days for the placebo subjects. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Ukraine, echinacea is even being used to treat radiation
exposure from the nuclear power plant disaster at Chernobyl,
researchers at the conference said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chernobyl rescue workers who were given daily doses of echinacea
for three weeks had fewer respiratory tract infections and were
less fatigued, Ukraine researcher Victoriya Pochernyayeva said
through an interpreter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Echinacea is being marketed in Ukraine in fruit juices, in a
sweet liqueur and even in a brownish-tinged vodka. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The echinacea-laced vodka increased sexual drive and minimized
hangovers, Pochernyayeva claimed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a very simple (drug) delivery system to me,''
Blumenthal quipped. &QL;

PANELISTS DELIVER MESSAGE: JOURNALISTS ALSO MUST RESPECT RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Maybe it was the
time: 6:30 on a Friday night. Maybe it was the topic: Media
Self-Flagellation: When investigative journalism deserves it, and
when it doesn't. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who wants to be lambasted at their own convention? Besides, the
barbecue was calling. So it was a sparsely attended ``Showcase
Panel'' at the 1999 Investigative Reporters and Editors conference
at the Kansas City Marriott Downtown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The session combined a dose of group therapy, some Journalism
101 tips and a lecture in corporate rights from James Basile, a
lawyer who has represented Chiquita Brands International Inc. and
General Motors Co. in litigation against investigative
journalists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Basile reminded the journalists that they too had limits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment is not an absolute license to do anything
to someone you're covering,'' Basile said. ``It doesn't give you
the right to violate their rights.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a pleasant message for journalists who have been stung
by some high-profile debacles in recent years: CNN and Time
retracting reports that the United States had used nerve gas on its
own defectors during the Vietnam War; The Cincinnati Enquirer
apologizing to Chiquita for stories based in part on stolen
voice-mail messages and paying the company $10 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Session moderator Rosemary Armao of The Baltimore Sun
congratulated the assembled for the investigative work they are
doing, ``because you're sure not hearing about it in the media.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Journalists still can do good work by doing their work well,
noted panelist Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project on
Excellence in Journalism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't make the case as an expose, don't try to,'' he
said. ``Don't try to prove something you can't prove.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstiel added that reporters must make sure stories are
important and worth telling. The public trust in journalism has
eroded in part, he said, because reporters spend too much time
exposing the private lives of public figures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Panelist Bruce Selcraig, a freelance journalist, provided comic
catharsis for attendees when he donned a pair of Mickey Mouse ears
to rail against the evils of corporate ownership. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat to our democracy today is the unchecked
power of corporations, and corporate greed, and corporate influence
in our everyday lives,'' Selcraig said. ``We simply don't pursue
that enough.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Basile added a note of caution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you act in an unfair, biased way toward your subject, we're
going to have an easier time'' winning lawsuits, he said. &QL;

PLAYERS SAY THERE'S NO MUTINY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mo Vaughn had to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   All this business about the inmates running the asylum just
doesn't add up, the Anaheim Angels first baseman said. But that's
exactly the idea that's been presented in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   A group of players sought out Angels general manager Bill Bavasi
to discuss concerns about manager Terry Collins, who is negotiating
a contract extension. More meetings ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi reportedly summoned a group of veteran players to find
out just how serious the problem is. Vaughn, believed to be one of
those called in, says there's no problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't the mutiny I've been hearing,'' Vaughn said. ``How
it got to this point, I'm not going to let you know, but there is
no mutiny. We're not going to fall apart, it's not that type of
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, I don't care who likes who. It doesn't
matter to me. We, as professionals, have to do our job every day.
Everybody's got a right to their opinion. But it's not as drastic
and crazy a situation as it's been made out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn wasn't one of the players who initiated a meeting with
Bavasi. But he would not give Collins his endorsement, either, for
whatever that's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is it's the general manager's decision,''
Vaughn said. ``Whatever happens is his decision, not ours. One
thing about Billy that's good is he talks to people. He knows where
we stand and we know where he stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins says he isn't bothered by the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you heard about guys with similar personalities?''
Collins asked. ``They clash. If they're laid back and the manager's
intense, they say `Oh, he's intense. Big deal.' But when they're as
intense as you are.... That's why I accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been blown way out of proportion,'' said Angels left
fielder Darin Erstad, one of the most intense players on the team.
``What happened was some reporter ran with it. But everybody's
making a bigger deal of it than it is. Whether I agree with him or
I don't agree with him, who cares? I play baseball, that's why I'm
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins' managerial style was an issue in Houston, where he
managed from 1994-96, and it has followed him to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough job,'' right fielder Tim Salmon said. ``You have
to manage 25 guys, 25 egos. You're not going to have 25 guys like
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Terry is he's aggressive and intense and he
wants to get down and dirty. Play hard. If it rubs you the wrong
way, what does it matter? Just do your job.... Does he always say
the right things? Probably not. But it's easy to throw darts at the
guy in front.''

YANKEES SHOW METS HOW TO WIN IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As in the Super Bowl, there can be more hype than
substance in the Subway Series, more newsprint and bluster than
worthiness. But Friday night, in the first of this weekend's three
games between the Yankees and Mets, there were four lead changes
and two ties, there was Derek Jeter hitting a titanic home run,
each side maneuvering for the slightest advantage and fans of both
teams shouting each other down.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees clawed for a run in the seventh inning when Scott
Brosius doubled home Tony Tarasco, and then clung to a 4-3 victory
at Yankee Stadium, with their closer, Mariano Rivera, taking over
in the eighth and getting the last four outs for the save.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have won 5 of 7 games against the Mets in three
years of interleague play, are 31-21, and the Mets continue to
plummet. They have lost seven straight games, their longest such
streak since August 1996, when they dropped eight straight, and are
27-27.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the seventh inning, Tarasco pulled a grounder to
the right side. The Mets' infield was positioned perfectly, and
second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo was ready, moving a couple of steps
to his left and preparing to make the play.
</P>
<P>
   But Mets first baseman John Olerud cut in front of Alfonzo and
lunged for a ball that Alfonzo would have fielded easily. The ball
glanced off Olerud's glove and Tarasco was safe with an infield
hit. Brosius then mashed a line drive to left, over the head of
Rickey Henderson. When Henderson rushed toward the wall, the carom
skipped off the fence high and toward the infield, over Henderson's
head once again, giving Tarasco enough time to score the
tie-breaking run.
</P>
<P>
   In its third year, this series includes a familiar cast of
characters, around whom the maelstrom swirls: There is the mayor of
the two-team city who makes no secret of his love for the Yankees,
sitting next to their dugout. There is the principal owner of the
Yankees, George Steinbrenner, who postures as if this series is
meaningless and then sends two of his best scouts to watch the Mets
for nearly two weeks. There is the manager who is often criticized
for being too conspicuous, the Mets' Bobby Valentine, who remained
attached to his bench until the fourth inning, when his innate
curiosity finally drove him to the steps of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' losing streak places the brunt of the pressure on
their shoulders in this series. They must try to fight out of their
slump in the hostile atmosphere of Yankee Stadium, against a team
that has succeeded more than any other over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   That tension grew before the game as veterans Bobby Bonilla and
Brian McRae learned that the Mets had placed them on irrevocable
waivers in recent days, confirmation that the team is ready to dump
both. Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips both fended off
questions about their intentions regarding Bonilla and McRae for
hours before Friday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   But once the game began and the Yankees' David Cone searched for
his control, the inherent burden of this series was shared. Cone
had trouble establishing his fastball, missing badly with it in the
first two innings, walking the leadoff hitter Henderson on four
pitches. The adrenaline of the Subway Series was probably pumping
through Cone with the alacrity of an express subway, and through
the crowd. When Cone struck out Mike Piazza with two runners on to
stunt a first-inning rally, most of the 56,178 fans roared.
</P>
<P>
   Cone constantly fell behind in the count, throwing a ball to
seven of the first 11 batters he faced, and tried to dig himself
out of trouble with his off-speed and breaking pitches _ his
split-fingered fastball, his curveball and slider. There were
moments when it seemed the Mets' hitters anticipated this.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, McRae fouled off a couple of pitches with
two strikes, and with the count 2 and 2, Cone threw a
split-fingered fastball, shin high _ not a bad pitch, all things
considered. But McRae swung, dropping the thick part of his bat on
the ball and launching it into the stands in right-center field.
When McRae returned to the dugout, he imitated Cone's motion with
the splitter and Bonilla and other teammates nodded: Yeah, I swung
at the same pitch, Bonilla appeared to say.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada slammed a high change-up from Rick Reed for a home
run that tied the score, 1-1, in the bottom of the second, but the
Mets controlled the tempo. Cone threw 46 pitches in the second
inning, and in the third inning, Henderson singled, stole second,
took third when Posada's throw bounced into center field and
eventually scored. Cone needed 22 pitches to get through that mess.
After three innings, he had thrown 68 pitches, Reed just 39.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter turned the momentum and a high fastball from Reed with one
swing in the fifth, with a runner at second and two out. Jeter's
contact was so pure that even if you didn't actually see him swing,
you knew from the sound that the ball was going to go a long, long
way. Reed turned away and grimaced as Jeter's 10th home run of the
year landed in the Yankees' bullpen, 418 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   But this game continued to swing, the Mets countering Jeter's
home run with a two-out rally in the sixth. After a walk and a hit,
the light-hitting Rey Ordonez stretched to poke a Cone slider down
the right-field line. It was a fair ball, one run scored and the
Mets' dugout looked like a playground at recess. Cone was relieved,
having thrown 115 pitches, with the Mets and Yankees tied at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The left field situation continues to be an unsolved mystery for
the Yankees. JOE TORRE indicated that the left-handed-hitting TONY
TARASCO, 28, would be given a chance to establish himself in left
field, probably as a part of a platoon. Tarasco, in the starting
lineup Friday night, is the fourth player to be given a chance to
win a spot in left field, following RICKY LEDEE, CHAD CURTIS, and
SHANE SPENCER, who is fully recovered from food poisoning and
apparently will get more playing time in the days ahead against
left-handed pitchers. The Mets will start AL LEITER Sunday.

MAN'S THIRD MURDER TRIAL IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF MISSING EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENITA Y. WILLIAMS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Prosecutors have
twice tried to convict Clarence Dexter of murdering his wife. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dexter's first trial ended in a mistrial. A murder verdict in
his second trial was overturned by the Missouri Supreme Court
because lawyers talked in court about how Dexter was silent when
arrested. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the third trial, set to begin Monday in Clay County, is in
trouble because prosecutors cannot find a police 911 tape, samples
of a T-shirt Dexter allegedly wore the night of his wife's murder,
bullet fragments from the autopsy and a newspaper with a bloody
footprint. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are nervous and the victim's family is angry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dexter is accused of shooting his 50-year-old wife, Carol
Dexter, four times at their Kansas City, North, home on Nov. 18,
1990. He then allegedly went to a supermarket. When he returned,
Dexter allegedly saw that his wife was not dead and then beat her
with a hammer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dexter, 57, has contended that he discovered his wife's body
after returning from the supermarket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers discovered the evidence was missing earlier this
spring when they wanted to have their own scientists compare the
bloody footprint to Dexter's shoe. When the lawyers opened an
evidence bag, they found several pieces of newspaper, but the
bloodied newspaper was gone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That prompted an inventory of the case's evidence, and it was
then that several critical items were discovered missing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Special prosecutors Tim Finnical and Victoria Thomas have
searched for the evidence in the Kansas City Police Department
property room, the Clay County prosecutor's property room and the
Missouri attorney general's office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole family is upset. We want justice served,'' said the
victim's brother, Olan Thrasher. ``Evidently their filing system is
not too good.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thrasher, however, said he has confidence in the prosecutors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have a lot of evidence,'' Thrasher said. ``I just
hope these (missing) two or three pieces don't jeopardize the whole
case.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a pretrial hearing last month, Kansas City Regional Crime Lab
criminologist John Wilson said the evidence might have gotten
scrambled during one of Dexter's earlier trials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Dexter's first trial in July 1991, the jury deliberated more
than eight hours without reaching a verdict. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A jury in his second trial in October 1991 convicted him. A Clay
County judge sentenced Dexter to execution after the jury could not
decide between death and life without parole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was overturned in 1997 by the Missouri Supreme
Court. The high court ruled unanimously that Dexter's 14th
Amendment right of due process was violated because lawyers talked
in court about how Dexter was silent after he was arrested and read
his rights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The missing evidence will make next week's trial much different
than Dexter's earlier trials, said Cyndy Short, a public defender
on Dexter's defense team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Short said Dexter's link to the crime is weakened without the
evidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the 911 tape contains Dexter's call to the
police after his wife's death. The shirt samples contain blood
stains that could show whether Dexter was present during the murder
or whether he bloodied his clothes when he discovered his wife's
body, prosecutors said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the pretrial hearing, defense forensic consultant Gene
Gietzen said a picture of the bloody footprint did not appear to
match Dexter's shoes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have done better analysis if the newspaper had been
preserved,'' Gietzen said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How the clothing samples and the bullet fragments were handled
in the Dexter case also was discussed at the hearing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson the criminologist said in 1991 Clay County prosecutors
often had lab technicians bring lab samples to a trial. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said other area prosecutors only asked for the lab reports
and the actual evidence. Lab samples, such as the clothing samples
and the bullet fragments, remain at the lab. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Remnants stay in the lab frozen so you can test them later,''
Wilson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clay County prosecutor's office spokesman Jim Roberts said that
at the time of Dexter's earlier trials, the office usually kept
evidence until the police asked for it. Murder case evidence was
returned to the police immediately after trial, Roberts said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new practice is that the agency that brings the evidence
is the one to bring it to trial and to take it back,'' Roberts
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said what might have happened is that the lab samples
might have been mixed with other evidence and mistakenly returned
to the Kansas City Police Department. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson testified that lab records showed that additional bullet
fragments collected at the Dexter crime scene were checked out from
the lab by a former assistant prosecutor, but the record did not
show that the fragments were ever returned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, those fragments recently were found mixed with other
evidence in the case in the police property room, said Tom
Jacquinot, a public defender on Dexter's defense team. &QL;

WALL INCIDENT WILL COST GRUDZIELANEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The fire that has been missing from most of the
Los Angeles Dodgers this season will cost Mark Grudzielanek at
least two weeks on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek was diagnosed Friday with a fracture in his right
hand after punching a wall outside the Dodgers dugout during
Tuesday's loss at Pittsburgh. His hand was placed in a cast, but he
will remain with the team and expects to be ready when he is
eligible to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor wanted the hand in a cast for three weeks and I
talked him into two,'' Grudzielanek said. ``I played four innings
after I did it and I feel I could play tomorrow, but the swelling
is pretty bad. I will be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek said he was not trying to set an example for his
teammates, who appeared particularly lethargic during the sweep by
the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play their way, I play my way,'' Grudzielanek said. ``But
I am not going to stand up and talk about what other guys do. It
isn't my business. I mean it is, but I've always felt it is better
to lead by example.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek actually was embarrassed by his emotional outburst,
which came after grounding into his ninth double play this season.
He said he thought the wall had some give, but quickly learned he
was wrong and apologized to manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really messed up,'' Grudzielanek said. ``Davey should be
upset. I play with a lot of emotion, but these things just can't
happen. You have to learn how to draw the line. You are hurting the
team when you do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek will be replaced at shortstop by Jose Vizcaino, who
returned from the disabled list Friday after missing 14 games with
a strained left hamstring. Outfielder Todd Hollandsworth, sidelined
since May 27 with a torn muscle on his right side, finally was
placed on the DL and Triple-A infielder Chance Sanford was called
up from Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford started at second base in place of Eric Young and led
off. He struck out in his first major-league at-bat against the
Angels' Omar Olivares, but then singled home two runs in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league debut: Sanford was told by manager Mike Scioscia
after Thursday's game in Albuquerque that he was heading to Los
Angeles. When he arrived, Sanford was met by Johnson, who told him
he was in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream,'' said Sanford, signed as a minor-league free
agent after six years in Pittsburgh. ``Down in Albuquerque we don't
talk much about the big club because there really isn't any room up
here. I was shocked when I got the call.''
</P>
<P>
   First pick signs: Jason Repko, the Dodgers' top selection in
Wednesday's amateur draft, worked out at Dodger Stadium on Friday
after signing with the club. Repko, a high school shortstop from
West Richland, Wash., is headed to the Dodgers' extended
spring-training camp in Vero Beach, Fla., and will play at Great
Falls, Mont., of the Pioneer (Rookie) League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few days have been incredible,'' said Repko, the 37th
pick overall. ``Getting that call on Wednesday was so exciting. I
just wanted to get this thing started.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Left-hander Carlos Perez (2-6, 5.73), who beat
Atlanta in his last start, will pitch Sunday in place of
right-hander Ismael Valdes. Friday was Perez's day to pitch, but
the Dodgers wanted to keep Kevin Brown and Chan Ho Park on their
five-day schedule. Park will pitch today.... Although the crowd was
less than capacity, the Dodgers passed the one million mark in
attendance in 25 games, the quickest they've done it since 1995.

NYC HOTELS' OCCUPANCY RATE FALLS DESPITE TOURISM BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `a' code) 
 (bl)  
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite the tourist boom, the occupancy rate for New
York City hotels has dropped for the first four months of this year
compared with the same period last year, in part because the
average cost of a night's stay has climbed above $200 and because
more hotels have opened.
</P>
<P>
   But industry experts say the hotel business in New York remains
robust, with the highest occupancy rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city, hotel room occupancy for January through
April stood at 76.5 percent, compared with 78.8 percent for the
same period last year, according to figures compiled by PKF
Consulting, a company that monitors the hotel industry. But prices
have increased. The average daily room rate was $205.51 for the
first four months of the year, compared with $195.93 during the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ader, a lodging analyst for Bear, Stearns, said New York's
hotel prices, which are the highest in the country, were depressing
the occupancy rate. ``As a hotel customer you say, `These prices
are exorbitant,''' he said. Whether consumers can expect to see
lower room rates will depend on whether the occupancy rate
continues to go down, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other reasons were cited for the decline in occupancy,
including the recent opening of several new hotels, including the
Benjamin on East 50th Street and and W on East 49th Street, and a
decline in visitors from countries with unfavorable currency
exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   But it is too early for the industry to panic, several analysts
said. ``As long as the economy stays strong,'' said Chuck Ross, a
vice president of Smith Travel Research Inc., a Hendersonville,
Tenn., company that tracks industry trends, ``I think that people
will travel, and New York is high on the list of destinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trend has caused some consternation among hotel
executives, who have become accustomed to occupancy rates that have
risen almost every year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dunphy, the director of marketing for the Mark, a hotel on
Madison Avenue whose rates run as high as $475 a night, said:
``What everyone is complaining about is we had such a great year
last year that everyone budgeted relatively aggressively for this
year. You're disappointed when you're not bettering your numbers
every year.'' In May, the Mark had an occupancy rate of 84 percent,
compared with 88 percent for May 1998, Dunphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in occupancy rates has not been accompanied by a
decline in visitors to the city, said Fran Reiter, president of the
New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. She said that about 35
million people are expected to visit the city this year, up from an
estimated 34.1 million last year. (A visitor is defined as anyone
who comes to New York from more than 50 miles away, even just for
the day, who is not commuting to work.)
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Reiter said that fewer visitors were coming from some of
what she described as ``key feeder markets'' such as Germany,
Brazil, Japan and Canada. The loss of tourists from those countries
is being more than offset by the domestic market, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really do not view this small drop-off as being anything
terribly serious,'' Ms. Reiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Giesbert, a vice president of New York and Connecticut
Marriott Lodging, which operates or manages 10 hotels in New York,
said the expanding supply of rooms accounted for what he described
as ``minute decline'' in business. Marriott alone added 1,000 rooms
in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   And more hotel rooms are coming. Even so, no one expects the
hotel market to become oversaturated. John Fox, a senior vice
president of PKF, the firm that tracks the hotel industry, said
that about two dozen new hotels are expected to open by 2002, but
the city might be able to support even more, depending on where
they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still under-hoteled,'' Ms. Reiter said. ``There are
times of the year when the occupancy rates go through the roof.''
In particular, the city needs more moderately priced rooms, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hotel market has softened, Dexter Wood Jr., a
senior manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm,
predicted that the industry would do very well during the final
quarter of the year _ historically its strongest period _
especially because of the excitement over the Year 2000. In fact,
he said, the market may already be bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get a hotel room in New York last week,'' he
said, ``and I couldn't get one.''

WASHINGTON STATE TO CRACK DOWN ON `GRAY MARKET' OF CIGARETTES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OLYMPIA _ The calls started coming a few months ago: wholesalers
offering name-brand cigarettes at deep discounts. What's the catch,
asked Matt Yorkston, whose Bellingham-based company owns six
convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   The catch was this: The smokes were made for sale only in
foreign countries, but somehow found their way back into the U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
   Yorkston was getting a glimpse of the ``gray market,'' a
netherworld of trade and commerce that has skirted legality.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next month, state liquor control agents will seize and
destroy ``export-only'' cigarettes as Washington joins nine other
states trying to shut down the gray market in tobacco. A new law,
signed by Gov. Gary Locke last month, makes it illegal to sell
these cigarettes for domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
   A similar federal law goes into effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials say they have targeted export-only
cigarettes to protect both consumers and public coffers.
</P>
<P>
   The recent settlement of lawsuits brought by several states
against tobacco makers allocates payments among cigarette
manufacturers based on their share of the domestic market. Payments
would be cut if the companies involved lose market share, and
export cigarettes are not covered by the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, meanwhile, may be buying cigarettes that look like
their favorite brands, but have higher levels of tar, nicotine and
additives, state officials said. Cigarettes made for foreign
markets are not subject to the same regulations as those sold in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a major concern,'' said John Hough, a senior assistant
Washington Attorney General.``(Consumers) think they're getting a
better price, but they're getting cigarettes that are much more
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the gray market is unknown, but customs and state
officials and tobacco company representaives say it has exploded
since the national tobacco settlement dramatically increased
domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for Philip Morris, the maker of
Marlboro and other leading brands, said complaints about export
cigarettes in the United States have grown from a handful to
several thousand in recent months. State liquor control officials,
who regulate tobacco products, say they have received an increasing
number of calls asking, ``Are they legal?''
</P>
<P>
   The gray market is driven by simple economics: Export cigarettes
are sold at significantly lower prices than are domestic products.
At the wholesale level, dealers can buy them for as much as $10
less per carton, according to one Washington-based gray market
wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesaler, who asked not to be named out of fear legal
action by tobacco companies, detailed how the gray market works.
Customs officials confirmed this account:
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies sell export cigarettes for about $4.60 per
carton. The cigarettes are shipped tax-free to other countries,
held in duty-free warehouses, then re-imported into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Even after state and federal duties and taxes are paid, the
``imported'' smokes wholesale for about $18 per carton, compared
with about $27.25 per carton for legitimate domestic cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The gray market wholesaler can then undercut the domestic price
by a few dollars per carton, and still make a small fortune. One
California dealer reportedly made a $4 million profit on gray
market cigarettes in December alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw the containers (of export cigarettes) coming
into the country,'' recalled the wholesaler, ``I said to myself,
`There's money to be made.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies sell export cigarettes cheaper in part to
compete in foreign markets, where standards of living are often
lower. They're also cheaper because they're not subject to U.S.
regulations or the tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   To pay the $200 billion settlement, tobacco companies raised
prices significantly. Philip Morris, for example, boosted prices
$4.50 per carton.
</P>
<P>
   Most gray market cigarettes sold in Washington come through Los
Angeles, where wholesalers buy them and truck them north, said
Robin Landis, a senior special agent with the U.S. Customs Service
in Seattle. Containers carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of export cigarettes land in Los Angeles daily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big business,'' he said. ``Real big business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers say that business has gotten too big. Philip
Morris has filed suit in federal court against several Indiana and
Kentucky businesses selling export cigarettes; has refused to sell
directly to wholesalers who deal in the gray market and have
dropped from incentive programs retailers who sell export
cigarettes in the Unites States.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick said Philip Morris is most concerned with protecting
its products' quality and trademarks. Export cigarettes are often
damaged by improper storage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Washington wholesaler said the issue has little to do
with quality control or consumer protection. He maintains cigarette
companies are trying to protect domestic profits while states guard
their share of the tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, liquor control officials say the gray market has
been small, but growing. Small convenience and neighborhood stores
around the state occasionally dealt in the export brands, said Gary
Gilbert, the liquor board's enforcement director.
</P>
<P>
   Many Washington businesses say banning gray market cigarettes
will mean fairer competition. Mike Lawrence, of Harbor Wholesale
Grocery in Tumwater, Wash., said the law will probably boost
cigarette sales for companies like his, which won't sell the export
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there was a loophole in the law, it wasn't the
right thing to do,''' Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   Yorkston, the Bellingham store owner, also declines to buy
export cigarettes. As president of the Washington Association of
Neighborhood Stores, which supports the new state law, he was well
aware of issues of quality and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the gray market on one side, and Indian tribes (with
tax exemptions) on the other, and you're trying to compete,''
Yorkston said. ``This will help put most of us retailers on the
same playing field.''

NYC HOTELS' OCCUPANCY RATE FALLS DESPITE TOURISM BOOM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite the tourist boom, the occupancy rate for New
York City hotels has dropped for the first four months of this year
compared with the same period last year, in part because the
average cost of a night's stay has climbed above $200 and because
more hotels have opened.
</P>
<P>
   But industry experts say the hotel business in New York remains
robust, with the highest occupancy rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city, hotel room occupancy for January through
April stood at 76.5 percent, compared with 78.8 percent for the
same period last year, according to figures compiled by PKF
Consulting, a company that monitors the hotel industry. But prices
have increased. The average daily room rate was $205.51 for the
first four months of the year, compared with $195.93 during the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ader, a lodging analyst for Bear, Stearns, said New York's
hotel prices, which are the highest in the country, were depressing
the occupancy rate. ``As a hotel customer you say, `These prices
are exorbitant,''' he said. Whether consumers can expect to see
lower room rates will depend on whether the occupancy rate
continues to go down, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other reasons were cited for the decline in occupancy,
including the recent opening of several new hotels, including the
Benjamin on East 50th Street and and W on East 49th Street, and a
decline in visitors from countries with unfavorable currency
exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   But it is too early for the industry to panic, several analysts
said. ``As long as the economy stays strong,'' said Chuck Ross, a
vice president of Smith Travel Research Inc., a Hendersonville,
Tenn., company that tracks industry trends, ``I think that people
will travel, and New York is high on the list of destinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trend has caused some consternation among hotel
executives, who have become accustomed to occupancy rates that have
risen almost every year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dunphy, the director of marketing for the Mark, a hotel on
Madison Avenue whose rates run as high as $475 a night, said:
``What everyone is complaining about is we had such a great year
last year that everyone budgeted relatively aggressively for this
year. You're disappointed when you're not bettering your numbers
every year.'' In May, the Mark had an occupancy rate of 84 percent,
compared with 88 percent for May 1998, Dunphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in occupancy rates has not been accompanied by a
decline in visitors to the city, said Fran Reiter, president of the
New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. She said that about 35
million people are expected to visit the city this year, up from an
estimated 34.1 million last year. (A visitor is defined as anyone
who comes to New York from more than 50 miles away, even just for
the day, who is not commuting to work.)
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Reiter said that fewer visitors were coming from some of
what she described as ``key feeder markets'' such as Germany,
Brazil, Japan and Canada. The loss of tourists from those countries
is being more than offset by the domestic market, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really do not view this small drop-off as being anything
terribly serious,'' Ms. Reiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Giesbert, a vice president of New York and Connecticut
Marriott Lodging, which operates or manages 10 hotels in New York,
said the expanding supply of rooms accounted for what he described
as ``minute decline'' in business. Marriott alone added 1,000 rooms
in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   And more hotel rooms are coming. Even so, no one expects the
hotel market to become oversaturated. John Fox, a senior vice
president of PKF, the firm that tracks the hotel industry, said
that about two dozen new hotels are expected to open by 2002, but
the city might be able to support even more, depending on where
they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still under-hoteled,'' Ms. Reiter said. ``There are
times of the year when the occupancy rates go through the roof.''
In particular, the city needs more moderately priced rooms, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hotel market has softened, Dexter Wood Jr., a
senior manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm,
predicted that the industry would do very well during the final
quarter of the year _ historically its strongest period _
especially because of the excitement over the Year 2000. In fact,
he said, the market may already be bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get a hotel room in New York last week,'' he
said, ``and I couldn't get one.''

STUDENTS FILE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SUITS AGAINST ACADEMY, AREA
SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Three Missouri
students filed federal lawsuits in Kansas City on Friday alleging
that fellow students sexually harassed and humiliated them and that
their school administrators did little or nothing to stop it. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lawsuits against the Wentworth Military Academy and the
Pleasant Hill and Richmond school districts were filed less than
two weeks after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling opened the door to
similar lawsuits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, courts are likely to see many more, said Elinor
Schroeder, who teaches discrimination law at the University of
Kansas School of Law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have the Supreme Court clarifying or defining an
area and holding that plaintiffs can recover money damages, there's
going to be a lot of interest at first,'' Schroeder said. ``The
mere publicity of the suits will generate more suits.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City lawyer Katherine Argent, who is representing the
students, said the high court's ruling and the lawsuits will send a
message to educators. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly tells the school they can't turn their backs
anymore and talk about budget constraints,'' Argent said. ``A lot
of the juvenile violence we've seen these days is because
discipline has been low.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richmond Superintendent Lindell Harrison said he had not seen
the lawsuit and could not comment on it. However, he said teachers
and administrators in Richmond are required to intervene in
student-on-student sexual harassment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If a student feels she's being harassed, she's got to tell
someone,'' Harrison said. ``We try to resolve these issues at the
(school) building level. If it's not resolved at that level, we
move it up the chain.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Col. Mike Lierman, vice president for operations at the
Lexington, Mo., military academy, declined to comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Mitch Hanna of the Pleasant Hill School District
could not be reached for comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits, filed separately, allege that: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Wentworth officials failed to notify police or the mother of a
14-year-old girl that she had been sexually assaulted by five
classmates in a school stairwell. The school suspended all five but
eventually allowed two of the cadets to return. One of those cadets
continued to harass the girl, who eventually attempted suicide. She
remains in psychological counseling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Pleasant Hill school officials did nothing effective to stop
the harassment of a 14-year-old boy who other students believed was
gay. Over four years, the boy was called names in the school
cafeteria and corridors, beaten and nearly run over by a car driven
by two classmates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While a school official spoke with some of the students who were
harassing the boy, ``the harassment of plaintiff only
intensified,'' the lawsuit said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The boy sought psychological counseling for depression and
eventually quit public schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Richmond administrators waited a week to discipline a student
for sexually humiliating a high school girl in front of students,
teachers and administrators. A boy pulled down the girl's pants and
underwear in a gymnasium. The boy then grabbed his crotch and made
a crude suggestion to the girl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit does not specify what disciplinary measures school
officials eventually took against the boy but said it was not
expulsion. Other students began to harass the girl after the
incident and she sought psychological counseling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, her parents moved from the district. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year Argent represented a 16-year-old Ruskin Heights girl
who complained that school administrators did nothing to stop
months of sexual harassment by a classmate. That case eventually
was settled out of court for $10,000, with the Hickman Mills School
District denying any liability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits filed Friday seek between $10.3 million and $18.7
million in damages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If schools can feel it in their pocketbooks we can expect to
see these kinds of problem behaviors really clamped down on,''
Argent said. &QL;

ECHINACEA, A MEDICINAL HERB, IS MAJOR TOPIC AT SCIENTIFIC
CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At an Eckerd drug
store here, all they have to do is put echinacea on the shelves and
the cash registers start ringing. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``During cold season it blows out of here,'' store manager
George Honaker said. ``The last two winters everybody has been
swearing by it. They say it's wiping out colds in two days.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Echinacea, a medicinal herb made from a purple coneflower that
grows wild in the Great Plains, has become the fastest selling
herbal product in the nation, some experts say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 7 percent of Americans have tried echinacea in hopes that
it will protect them from colds and flu, according to one survey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But do the pills, cough drops, teas and extracts that people are
paying $300 million for each year really work? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, is the most some experts gathered this week in Kansas
City at a scientific conference on echinacea could say. The
conference, which ends Saturday at the Ritz-Carlton, Kansas City
hotel, was sponsored by the American Herbal Products Association,
an industry group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is mounting that taking echinacea ahead of time won't
keep you from getting a cold, researchers at the conference said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at least four studies suggest that popping some echinacea
capsules or sipping on echinacea tea at the first signs of a
scratchy throat or runny nose may shorten a cold by several days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether echinacea can prevent a cold is not well-determined by
the science. But there is evidence it can reduce symptoms,'' said
Mark Blumenthal, who teaches at the University of Texas School of
Pharmacy and directs the American Botanical Council. The council is
a nonprofit group that promotes research on medicinal herbs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, according to Blumenthal: ``We need more
studies.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the research showing echinacea reduces cold symptoms
ranges in quality from ``pretty good'' to ``not particularly
convincing,'' said Bruce Barrett, a University of Wisconsin Medical
School researcher who is conducting his own study on whether
echinacea helps cold sufferers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a clear picture yet,'' Barrett said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Health claims for echinacea and other medicinal herbs are often
based on slender evidence, Blumenthal said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Studies are done with small numbers of people, so their
conclusions lack the statistical certainty of large-scale studies.
Or the research is conducted in test tubes or on laboratory animals
in ways that don't clearly apply to people. &QL; 
Scant oversight &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the problem with inadequate research has to do with the
way these products are regulated in the United States, Blumenthal
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act, which gave manufacturers greater freedom to market
dietary supplements such as vitamins and herbs and to make claims
about their benefits on product labels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One brand of echinacea tea, for example, includes the claim:
``Supports the immune system.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These claims have to be backed by scientific evidence. But the
rules aren't as strict as for prescription drugs, which must
undergo rigorous testing for safety and effectiveness before the
Food and Drug Administration approves them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claims about a supplement don't have to be submitted to the Food
and Drug Administration for approval before the product goes on the
market. And although the manufacturer must be able to substantiate
its claim, it doesn't have to make the information publicly
available. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any evaluation procedure in this country (for
herbal products),'' Blumenthal said. ``What we would like is a
rational, intelligent botanical expert advisory panel.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another area where regulation falls short is in standardizing
the ingredients in herbal products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consumers buying echinacea, for example, are faced with a
bewildering array of products. Three different species of the plant
are used commercially. Manufacturers use the plant's roots, the
parts above the ground, or both. And the plants are squeezed into
juice, dried to make capsules, or concentrated into alcohol
tinctures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no way of knowing that one brand of echinacea contains
all the same active ingredients as another brand. And no guarantee
that one batch of a single brand is the same as the next one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A higher priced product may be of higher quality, said botanist
and echinacea expert Steven Foster of Fayetteville, Ark. But
there's really little way to tell which products are best. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a congressional committee in March, Food and
Drug Administration Commissioner Jane Henney said that the agency
``still has a long way to go'' in implementing regulations for
herbs and other supplements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the FDA's ``A'' list for completion this year, she said, are
new manufacturing regulations to assure the consistency of
supplements and more specific rules on health claims. &QL; 
Questions remain &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors remain highly skeptical about the value of
echinacea and other herbal remedies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many claims made for herbs and extracts and
supplements, and many of them are untrue,'' said Wallace Sampson, a
clinical professor of medicine at Stanford University and editor of
the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Herbs often may appear effective, Sampson said, because ``the
last thing you take before you get better seems to work.
Psychologically, these kinds of associations are very powerful.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Blumenthal, who teaches physicians how to integrate
medicinal herbs into their practices, has seen a dramatic shift in
their attitudes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, they used to ask, `Do these really work?' Now
they ask which brands to recommend,'' Blumenthal said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Echinacea's history as a medicinal herb goes back to American
Indians, who used it for coughs, colds, sore throats and
toothaches. It was adopted by some doctors in the 19th century, but
other doctors called it a quack remedy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The herb has been popular in Germany and other western European
countries since the 1930s. Much of the research into its use is
being done there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one European study presented at the conference, 120 people in
the early stages of colds received either echinacea or a placebo.
About 40 percent of those getting echinacea progressed to
full-blown colds, compared to 60 percent of those receiving the
placebo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those who received echinacea had cold symptoms for an average of
four days, compared to eight days for the placebo subjects. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Ukraine, echinacea is even being used to treat radiation
exposure from the nuclear power plant disaster at Chernobyl,
researchers at the conference said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chernobyl rescue workers who were given daily doses of echinacea
for three weeks had fewer respiratory tract infections and were
less fatigued, Ukraine researcher Victoriya Pochernyayeva said
through an interpreter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Echinacea is being marketed in Ukraine in fruit juices, in a
sweet liqueur and even in a brownish-tinged vodka. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The echinacea-laced vodka increased sexual drive and minimized
hangovers, Pochernyayeva claimed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a very simple (drug) delivery system to me,''
Blumenthal quipped. &QL;

PANELISTS DELIVER MESSAGE: JOURNALISTS ALSO MUST RESPECT RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Maybe it was the
time: 6:30 on a Friday night. Maybe it was the topic: Media
Self-Flagellation: When investigative journalism deserves it, and
when it doesn't. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who wants to be lambasted at their own convention? Besides, the
barbecue was calling. So it was a sparsely attended ``Showcase
Panel'' at the 1999 Investigative Reporters and Editors conference
at the Kansas City Marriott Downtown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The session combined a dose of group therapy, some Journalism
101 tips and a lecture in corporate rights from James Basile, a
lawyer who has represented Chiquita Brands International Inc. and
General Motors Co. in litigation against investigative
journalists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Basile reminded the journalists that they too had limits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment is not an absolute license to do anything
to someone you're covering,'' Basile said. ``It doesn't give you
the right to violate their rights.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a pleasant message for journalists who have been stung
by some high-profile debacles in recent years: CNN and Time
retracting reports that the United States had used nerve gas on its
own defectors during the Vietnam War; The Cincinnati Enquirer
apologizing to Chiquita for stories based in part on stolen
voice-mail messages and paying the company $10 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Session moderator Rosemary Armao of The Baltimore Sun
congratulated the assembled for the investigative work they are
doing, ``because you're sure not hearing about it in the media.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Journalists still can do good work by doing their work well,
noted panelist Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project on
Excellence in Journalism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't make the case as an expose, don't try to,'' he
said. ``Don't try to prove something you can't prove.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstiel added that reporters must make sure stories are
important and worth telling. The public trust in journalism has
eroded in part, he said, because reporters spend too much time
exposing the private lives of public figures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Panelist Bruce Selcraig, a freelance journalist, provided comic
catharsis for attendees when he donned a pair of Mickey Mouse ears
to rail against the evils of corporate ownership. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat to our democracy today is the unchecked
power of corporations, and corporate greed, and corporate influence
in our everyday lives,'' Selcraig said. ``We simply don't pursue
that enough.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Basile added a note of caution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you act in an unfair, biased way toward your subject, we're
going to have an easier time'' winning lawsuits, he said. &QL;

STUDENTS FILE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SUITS AGAINST ACADEMY, AREA
SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Three Missouri
students filed federal lawsuits in Kansas City on Friday alleging
that fellow students sexually harassed and humiliated them and that
their school administrators did little or nothing to stop it. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lawsuits against the Wentworth Military Academy and the
Pleasant Hill and Richmond school districts were filed less than
two weeks after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling opened the door to
similar lawsuits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, courts are likely to see many more, said Elinor
Schroeder, who teaches discrimination law at the University of
Kansas School of Law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have the Supreme Court clarifying or defining an
area and holding that plaintiffs can recover money damages, there's
going to be a lot of interest at first,'' Schroeder said. ``The
mere publicity of the suits will generate more suits.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City lawyer Katherine Argent, who is representing the
students, said the high court's ruling and the lawsuits will send a
message to educators. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly tells the school they can't turn their backs
anymore and talk about budget constraints,'' Argent said. ``A lot
of the juvenile violence we've seen these days is because
discipline has been low.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richmond Superintendent Lindell Harrison said he had not seen
the lawsuit and could not comment on it. However, he said teachers
and administrators in Richmond are required to intervene in
student-on-student sexual harassment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If a student feels she's being harassed, she's got to tell
someone,'' Harrison said. ``We try to resolve these issues at the
(school) building level. If it's not resolved at that level, we
move it up the chain.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Col. Mike Lierman, vice president for operations at the
Lexington, Mo., military academy, declined to comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Mitch Hanna of the Pleasant Hill School District
could not be reached for comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits, filed separately, allege that: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Wentworth officials failed to notify police or the mother of a
14-year-old girl that she had been sexually assaulted by five
classmates in a school stairwell. The school suspended all five but
eventually allowed two of the cadets to return. One of those cadets
continued to harass the girl, who eventually attempted suicide. She
remains in psychological counseling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Pleasant Hill school officials did nothing effective to stop
the harassment of a 14-year-old boy who other students believed was
gay. Over four years, the boy was called names in the school
cafeteria and corridors, beaten and nearly run over by a car driven
by two classmates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While a school official spoke with some of the students who were
harassing the boy, ``the harassment of plaintiff only
intensified,'' the lawsuit said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The boy sought psychological counseling for depression and
eventually quit public schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Richmond administrators waited a week to discipline a student
for sexually humiliating a high school girl in front of students,
teachers and administrators. A boy pulled down the girl's pants and
underwear in a gymnasium. The boy then grabbed his crotch and made
a crude suggestion to the girl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit does not specify what disciplinary measures school
officials eventually took against the boy but said it was not
expulsion. Other students began to harass the girl after the
incident and she sought psychological counseling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, her parents moved from the district. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year Argent represented a 16-year-old Ruskin Heights girl
who complained that school administrators did nothing to stop
months of sexual harassment by a classmate. That case eventually
was settled out of court for $10,000, with the Hickman Mills School
District denying any liability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits filed Friday seek between $10.3 million and $18.7
million in damages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If schools can feel it in their pocketbooks we can expect to
see these kinds of problem behaviors really clamped down on,''
Argent said. &QL;

MAN'S THIRD MURDER TRIAL IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF MISSING EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENITA Y. WILLIAMS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Prosecutors have
twice tried to convict Clarence Dexter of murdering his wife. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dexter's first trial ended in a mistrial. A murder verdict in
his second trial was overturned by the Missouri Supreme Court
because lawyers talked in court about how Dexter was silent when
arrested. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the third trial, set to begin Monday in Clay County, is in
trouble because prosecutors cannot find a police 911 tape, samples
of a T-shirt Dexter allegedly wore the night of his wife's murder,
bullet fragments from the autopsy and a newspaper with a bloody
footprint. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are nervous and the victim's family is angry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dexter is accused of shooting his 50-year-old wife, Carol
Dexter, four times at their Kansas City, North, home on Nov. 18,
1990. He then allegedly went to a supermarket. When he returned,
Dexter allegedly saw that his wife was not dead and then beat her
with a hammer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dexter, 57, has contended that he discovered his wife's body
after returning from the supermarket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers discovered the evidence was missing earlier this
spring when they wanted to have their own scientists compare the
bloody footprint to Dexter's shoe. When the lawyers opened an
evidence bag, they found several pieces of newspaper, but the
bloodied newspaper was gone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That prompted an inventory of the case's evidence, and it was
then that several critical items were discovered missing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Special prosecutors Tim Finnical and Victoria Thomas have
searched for the evidence in the Kansas City Police Department
property room, the Clay County prosecutor's property room and the
Missouri attorney general's office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole family is upset. We want justice served,'' said the
victim's brother, Olan Thrasher. ``Evidently their filing system is
not too good.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thrasher, however, said he has confidence in the prosecutors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have a lot of evidence,'' Thrasher said. ``I just
hope these (missing) two or three pieces don't jeopardize the whole
case.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a pretrial hearing last month, Kansas City Regional Crime Lab
criminologist John Wilson said the evidence might have gotten
scrambled during one of Dexter's earlier trials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Dexter's first trial in July 1991, the jury deliberated more
than eight hours without reaching a verdict. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A jury in his second trial in October 1991 convicted him. A Clay
County judge sentenced Dexter to execution after the jury could not
decide between death and life without parole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was overturned in 1997 by the Missouri Supreme
Court. The high court ruled unanimously that Dexter's 14th
Amendment right of due process was violated because lawyers talked
in court about how Dexter was silent after he was arrested and read
his rights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The missing evidence will make next week's trial much different
than Dexter's earlier trials, said Cyndy Short, a public defender
on Dexter's defense team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Short said Dexter's link to the crime is weakened without the
evidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the 911 tape contains Dexter's call to the
police after his wife's death. The shirt samples contain blood
stains that could show whether Dexter was present during the murder
or whether he bloodied his clothes when he discovered his wife's
body, prosecutors said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the pretrial hearing, defense forensic consultant Gene
Gietzen said a picture of the bloody footprint did not appear to
match Dexter's shoes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have done better analysis if the newspaper had been
preserved,'' Gietzen said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How the clothing samples and the bullet fragments were handled
in the Dexter case also was discussed at the hearing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson the criminologist said in 1991 Clay County prosecutors
often had lab technicians bring lab samples to a trial. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said other area prosecutors only asked for the lab reports
and the actual evidence. Lab samples, such as the clothing samples
and the bullet fragments, remain at the lab. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Remnants stay in the lab frozen so you can test them later,''
Wilson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clay County prosecutor's office spokesman Jim Roberts said that
at the time of Dexter's earlier trials, the office usually kept
evidence until the police asked for it. Murder case evidence was
returned to the police immediately after trial, Roberts said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new practice is that the agency that brings the evidence
is the one to bring it to trial and to take it back,'' Roberts
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said what might have happened is that the lab samples
might have been mixed with other evidence and mistakenly returned
to the Kansas City Police Department. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson testified that lab records showed that additional bullet
fragments collected at the Dexter crime scene were checked out from
the lab by a former assistant prosecutor, but the record did not
show that the fragments were ever returned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, those fragments recently were found mixed with other
evidence in the case in the police property room, said Tom
Jacquinot, a public defender on Dexter's defense team. &QL;

QUAYLE LOSES 2 KEY FUND-RAISING AIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES AND CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Two top fund-raisers have left the campaign of GOP presidential
hopeful Dan Quayle, one of several signals that he's having money
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The finance staff members resigned last week, apparently after
the former vice president became unhappy with the level of large
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Departing were Jennifer Hodges, Quayle's aide in charge of
seeking out large donors, and a deputy to Hodges, Liesl Hickey.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges and Hickey, who handled Quayle's Midwestern fund-raising
operation, confirmed that they quit but would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle aides would not discuss the departures, but did say that
Quayle has had to tinker with his money-raising strategy to survive
in a packed field.
</P>
<P>
   One consultant has estimated that a candidate will need $20
million to compete in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The ante has been upped by two Republican candidates _ Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, who has raised huge sums, and billionaire
Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how much money Quayle has raised. In the first
quarter, he garnered $2.1 million, but reported that he wound up in
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several months ago, almost all campaigns took assessment of
the fund-raising environment and made changes,'' Quayle spokesman
Jonathan Baron said. ``We made adjustments, given the realities of
the fund-raising environment.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander said this week that he
was dumping legal and press staffers wholesale and drastically
cutting his travel budget. He said he did so to allow his campaign
to make it through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Baron said Quayle has also ``deferred'' some campaign plans and
made other staff alterations in an effort to accommodate the new
realities of fund-raising _ that candidates need to spend more
money and spend it earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's difficulties are all the more striking because he spent
nearly four years building up what appeared to be a formidable
fundraising network, according to one campaign finance expert.
</P>
<P>
   As director of Campaign America from 1995 to 1998, Quayle
traveled the country nurturing potential donors, said Paul Hendrie,
communications director of the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason that Quayle and Alexander are hurt is that
their whole approach was built on being successful fund-raisers,``
Hendrie said. ``They had really worked for years creating the
infrastructure to raise money and the fact that Bush has been able
to come in and suck away the money has really hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle was to meet Friday with his media consultant, Fred Davis,
to map out new strategies for mining contributions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Davis, the candidate must find an entirely new set
of donors in order to overcome the Bush handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush tied the early large donors up long before anyone knew he
was going to do anything, and that was very clever,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis declined to say just how Quayle would outfox his
opponents, but promised that he would be good at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just have to work harder, think harder and think
out of the box,'' he said. ``And the good thing about Quayle is
that he's a good out-of-the-box thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also has been trying to tap large donors who have already
given to Bush, said Quayle's pollster, Kellyanne Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Quayle campaign is doing is going back to some of the
major donors and saying, `You gave to George W. Bush and that's
great. But you know what, you are restricted to the dollar amount
but not in the number of candidates you can give to,' ''
Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, who live in Paradise Valley, have
also been working the phones to gain donors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Quayle acknowledged the difficulty of
raising money against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely the big sucking machine down there,'' Quayle
said. ``But we will have enough money to get our message out.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Quayle hasn't sparked much excitement in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   In national polls, he has single-digit support. He also lagged
in a recent Rocky Mountain Poll of Maricopa County Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That poll showed Bush leading with 30 percent, followed by Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., with 26 percent, and former Red Cross head
Elizabeth Dole with 12 percent, just ahead of Quayle, with 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The turnover in Quayle's finance department comes despite his
second-place showing in the fund-raising race during the first
quarter of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle raised $2.1 million, second only to Bush's $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, Quayle had greater debts than cash, according to
Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   The big outlay is mostly due to Quayle's decision to focus on
potential donors using direct mail. That strategy calls for hefty
early spending to build a mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   The Quayle consultant in charge of direct mail said the
candidate's list of 35,000 names will begin paying off in the
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct mail is very costly upfront with a big payoff in the
end,'' said Richard Norman, a Virginia-based consultant. ``The file
is growing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about the whole fund-raising phenomenon,
everyone thinks of New Hampshire as the first primary,'' Hendrie
said. ``But really, the first primary is this fund-raising
sweepstakes. That determines whether you even get to the
primaries.'' &QL;

IS TRADE WITH CHINA GOOD U.S. POLICY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   The most controversial economic
issue of the Clinton administration's final chapter isn't likely to
be tax reform or Social Security, but the future of America's
commercial relationship with China. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If all goes as expected, President Clinton is expected to push
both for an extension of China's most favored nation trade status
and its membership in the World Trade Organization. WTO entry would
lead to a congressional vote on permanent most favored nation
status for Beijing to comply with WTO rules. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most favored status is an anachronistic misnomer, because all it
means is that normal trade relations will be maintained with the
nation granted such recognition. It confers no particularly special
privileges. Nevertheless, the debate over whether to continue
normal economic relations with China will be acrimonious, because
many conservatives will advocate withdrawal from Clinton's policy
of constructive engagement with Beijing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in The Weekly Standard, for instance, called
it a failed policy of appeasement, under a headline exhorting the
administration to ``Call Off the Engagement.'' The arguments
offered are convincing. Since the last vote to maintain normal
relations, China has been caught stealing U.S. nuclear secrets, has
encouraged its citizens to burn American flags and stone the U.S.
Embassy, has imprisoned more of its political enemies, and has
continued its saber-rattling against Taiwan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The editorial took note of how Ronald Reagan challenged the
premises of U.S.-Soviet relations in a way that eventually led, in
the interim, to better relations and, ultimately, to the demise of
what Reagan called ``the evil empire.'' While conservatives of like
minds no doubt see a similar opportunity, the situation isn't quite
the same. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While China is no doubt committed to an adversarial relationship
with America when it suits its aims, its leadership hasn't
formalized a policy designed to ``bury'' the United States.
Meanwhile, it has shown serious signs of recognizing the benefits
of market economics, which the Soviets never seriously
acknowledged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the political reality is that even relatively
conservative Republicans aren't likely to muster the gumption to
abandon the status quo. They may slam Clinton for playing footsie
with Beijing, but when push comes to shove, most Capitol Hill
GOPsters will go along with the bid to keep China in the commercial
fold. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, this isn't an entirely negative
outcome, no matter the odiousness of China's regime. Sure, it's a
nasty, brutish bunch with no particular love for America, but
what's the alternative? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My favorite quote concerning trade is that as long as goods are
allowed to cross borders, armies won't. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some abhor continued efforts to build a business relationship
with China as the work of running dogs of American capitalism.
Pushing comity with China is the work of Big Business in its
unprincipled quest for profit, some might argue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True or not, though, it's also irrelevant. The world is in many
ways a more dangerous place today than it was at the height of the
Cold War. Any policy moves fashioned to promote geopolitical
tranquillity will prove the best moves. &QL;

HOSPITAL SHIP HEADED FOR NORTH KOREA KNOWS NO BORDERS OR POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Capt. John Fadely and his 160-member crew weigh
anchor at Seattle's Bell Street Pier on Sunday, their course to
North Korea will be charted with the aid of two compasses: One
guided by magnetism, the other by mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Fadely, a veteran merchant mariner, is skipper of the Caribbean
Mercy, a former Norwegian ferry that is now one of the ``Mercy
Ships,'' floating hospitals operated by a Christian humanitarian
organization.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, the Caribbean Mercy has been on the Seattle
waterfront, its volunteer crew hoisting aboard more than 100 tons
of donated medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, 50 tons of rice,
and things such as underwear, infant formula and toys for a North
Korean orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away in the pile are bears hand-made by a Victoria, B.C.,
senior citizens' group.
</P>
<P>
   The visit, the first in decades for a Western hospital ship,
happens to coincide with the highest level U.S. diplomatic
delegation to visit North Korea in a half-century. The mission is
led by former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and South Korean officials say as many as 3 million North
Koreans have died in four years of famine. Officials in both Koreas
say international humanitarian aid, which is not forbidden by trade
embargoes, contributes to peace and stability on the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean Mercy flies a Panamanian flag and its largely
evangelical Christian crew has 20 different passports, but borders
and politics mean little to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We serve the poorest of the poor,'' said the ship's executive
officer, Brett Curtis, a New Zealander who, with a wife and four
children, left a job exporting kiwi fruit 15 years ago to join the
Mercy Ship missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivation with us is to give away compassion because it's
the right thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said Mercy Ships was asked by the North Korean government
to drop off relief supplies while en route to South Korea. The
visit will be short _ two weeks _ but the ship's doctors expect to
perform 50 eye surgeries and 20 orthopedic surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   For crewman Ilchul Cho, a South Korean, the stop has special
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a miracle to a South Korean to be able to go
there to North Korea,'' said Cho, 24, who joined the crew in
February. North Korea and its people have existed only in his
imagination, across a war-scarred, no-man's land border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we are just delivering rice and medicine and doing
eye surgeries, it's still exciting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercy Ships ministry was founded in 1978 by Don and Deyon
Stephens, of Ft. Worth, Texas, as a way to spread messages of peace
and hope. In the past 17 years, doctors from the three-ship fleet
have provided medical care for nearly 100,000 people and performed
thousands of operations on impoverished people who never dreamed
they would have access to modern medicine. Surgeries range from
correcting cleft palates, crossed eyes or cataracts to full facial
reconstructions.
</P>
<P>
   The ships have delivered more than 14 million pounds of goods
ranging from medical supplies and seeds to a fire engine. Crew
members have helped build hospitals, homes, schools, churches,
community centers and other projects, while teaching health classes
and training local doctors and nurses.

<P>
   ``People always ask `Why are you doing this for free?' I always
answer `Because the Lord loves you,''' said Second Officer Kathy
Shankle, a California Maritime Academy graduate.

<P>
   Before it was born again, the 47-year-old, 262-foot Caribbean
Mercy was the Norwegian ferry Polar Lys (Lights).
</P>
<P>
   From captain to ordinary seamen, all crew members are
volunteers, many supported by individual churches. The ship
operates on about $1.3 million a year, largely offset by donations
and goodwill. The Port of Seattle, for example, donated moorage for
the ship's stay here. International Longshore and Warehouse Union
Local 19 members donated labor, while Shurgard Storage discounted
storage space, said port spokesman Imbert Matthee.
</P>
<P>
   For Marco Estrada, 24, a Costa Rican, the volunteer work is an
opportunity to give back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about doing this, and for going to North Korea,
particularly because I lived through poverty, starvation, in my
life and I know how the people we help are feeling,'' said Estrada,
a two-year veteran deckhand and translator. ``I enjoy helping and
sharing what God has given me.''

A DIVISION FLAG IS BACK AT ARMY'S FORT RILEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   After losing the 1st Infantry
Division four years ago, Fort Riley near Junction City, Kan., will
become the official headquarters today of the Army's mechanized
24th Infantry Division. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A ceremony activating the division, which is made up of 12,000
active duty and National Guard soldiers, is at 10 a.m. at the
post's Cavalry Parade Field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attending the event will be Army dignitaries and politicians,
including Gen. Thomas Schwartz, the U.S. Army Forces Command
commanding general; retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, former division
commander during Desert Storm and currently director of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy; U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas;
and U.S. Rep. Jim Ryun of Kansas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, along with other members of the Kansas delegation, had
been working to bring a new division to the post and better
integrate the active Army and National Guard and reserve units. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go over to Bosnia or Kosovo or the Mideast, you'll see
a lot of deployed National Guard and active reserves,'' Roberts
said. ``In 90 days, this unit can go anywhere in the world. It's
more mobile. This is a pretty exciting time for Fort Riley, because
it's on the crest of the wave on this (integration).'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deb Skidmore, an Army spokeswoman, said Junction City would
become home for the division's headquarters staff of more than 100.
They will command National Guard infantry brigades in North
Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The division is one of two that integrate Army National Guard
units. The other unit, the 7th Infantry Division, is based at Fort
Carson in Colorado. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1st Infantry Division, known as the Big Red One, left
Fort Riley, the post has seen its manpower shrink from 15,000 to
10,500. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the 24th Infantry Division will add only 140 command staff
personnel at most, Skidmore said, its National Guard units will add
to those numbers when they send soldiers to the fort for training
stints. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 24th Division, nicknamed the Victory Division, was formed in
1941 in Hawaii just before Pearl Harbor was bombed. It saw action
in World War II, Korea and the Persian Gulf. It's motto is ``First
to Fight.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The unit was deactivated in 1996 as part of the Army's effort to
reduce the number of divisions to 10. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will be led by Maj. Gen. Freddy McFarren, who is also Fort
Riley's commander. &QL;

EXPERT WITNESS OFFERS TESTIMONY IN SLEEPWALKING TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle of the sleep experts began Friday in Scott Falater's
murder trial as a specialist in sleep disorders said the former
Motorola engineer was sleepwalking when he stabbed his wife to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Janet Tatman said that after evaluating four nights
of sleep studies performed on Falater, ``My opinion became that the
best explanation for what happened was that Mr. Falater was
sleepwalking at the time that his wife was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatman's testimony, sprinkled with references to REM sleep,
slow-wave sleep, polysomnograms and parasomnia, wrapped up the
trial's second week of testimony. It provided the jury with the
first of what will be several seminars on the mechanics of human
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Tatman testified that sleep researchers have documented many
cases of violent attacks by sleepwalkers.
</P>
<P>
   She described several such cases, including one involving a man
who rammed his car into two women who had sought his assistance as
he slept in his car by the side of a road.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsing the defense theory that Falater was probably fixing a
backyard pool pump in his sleep when his wife came upon him, Tatman
said sleepwalkers often lash out when they are interrupted in the
middle of a task.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible to trigger a violent reaction by interfering
with them,'' Tatman said.
</P>
<P>
   Persons injured by sleepwalkers, she said, often ``just happen
to have been at the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatman said that at the time Falater admittedly killed his wife,
he was struggling with severe job-related stress and sleep
deprivation _ characteristics she said are common among
sleepwalkers.
</P>
<P>
   She said that her study of Falater's background showed a
personal history of sleepwalking and that her evaluation of sleep
tests administered to Falater at St. Luke's Behavioral Health
Services showed his sleep patterns were consistent with
sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   Tatman's testimony will resume Monday, when she faces
cross-examination from prosecutor Juan Martinez. Then the defense
will present more experts before the prosecution counters with its
own scientific team.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony about sleep, though, appeared to make some jurors
sleepy. One panelist told another during the afternoon break that
she was having a hard time staying awake.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the trial took a unusual turn as normally
circumspect Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Ronald Reinstein
ridiculed a witness who last week testified for the defense but
later offered new information to the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Randy Keadle in the absence of the jury,
Reinstein said Keadle was offering insubstantial hearsay about
alleged flaws in the defense case, which is presenting Falater as
an unflappable engineer and devout Mormon who had no reason to kill
his high school sweetheart and wife of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Keadle's courtroom appearance Friday came eight days after he
had testified as a character witness for Falater, a former
colleague at Motorola. After being flown from his current home in
France at the defense's expense, Keadle vouched for Falater as ``a
very peaceful man'' whose attack on his wife contradicted
everything his friends knew about him.
</P>
<P>
   With the jury out of the courtroom so that Reinstein could
evaluate the significance of the new information, Keadle said he
had heard that Falater had once dragged his daughter by the hair
and _ shortly before killing his wife _ had talked with co-workers
about a Canadian man whose sleepwalking defense won him acquittal
after he stabbed his mother-in-law to death.
</P>
<P>
   Under aggressive questioning from defense attorney Mike Kimerer,
Keadle acknowledged that he had no personal knowledge of either
event. He said he heard of the alleged abuse from his wife, who had
apparently heard of it from the mother of a friend of 17-year-old
Megan Falater.
</P>
<P>
   The third- or fourth-hand testimony exasperated Reinstein, who
said it was nothing more than ``hearsay on hearsay on hearsay _ and
maybe on hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this before,'' Reinstein said.
``I almost feel like I'm in the ``National Inquirer'' or the
``Star'' or the ``Globe'' or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Martinez, who said Keadle ``wanted to do the right
thing,'' is expected to call other witnesses with direct knowledge
of the events Keadle discussed. Those witnesses would likely
testify in two weeks as Martinez presents his rebuttal witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The trial likely will wrap up before the end of June. &QL;

COURT FINDS IN FAVOR OF THREE LAWYERS IN MEDICARE KICKBACK CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN T. DAUNER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   A federal judge said in a ruling
released Friday that he found no evidence that three lawyers named
as unindicted co-conspirators in a Medicare kickback case tried in
Kansas City, Kan., had been involved in criminal activity. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the ruling, U.S. District Judge John W. Lungstrum also
repeated statements he made during the trial that the evidence
indicated that the lawyers had appropriately advised their clients
to engage in legal transactions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, the judge declined to take the further legal step of
making factual findings related to the innocence of Gina Kaiser, a
Health Midwest lawyer, and David Queen and Craig Holden, Baltimore
lawyers specializing in health-care matters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their names first became public as unindicted co-conspirators in
a pretrial motion filed by the government in a Medicare kickback
case against two Johnson County, Kan., physicians, three former
Baptist Medical Center executives and two other Kansas City, Mo.,
health-care lawyers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The physicians and two of the three hospital executives were
found guilty by a jury in April. The other hospital executive was
acquitted. The two other lawyers were acquitted by Lungstrum after
the close of the government's case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Kaiser, Queen and Holden were named as unindicted
co-conspirators came out again during the nine-week trial. Kaiser
testified in the trial, and documents involving Queen and Holden
were introduced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a sealed motion, the three asked that their names be cleared
and expunged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an order sealed since it was filed May 7, Lungstrum said the
government violated the due process rights of the three lawyers by
revealing their names in its pretrial motion. The motion should
have been filed under seal, the judge said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the government had a right and ``a substantial interest'' in
identifying the three lawyers as unindicted co-conspirators at
trial, he ruled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lungstrum ordered the three lawyers' names stricken from the
government's pretrial motion, but he denied a request that they be
expunged from the trial record. &QL;

MAN'S THIRD MURDER TRIAL IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF MISSING EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENITA Y. WILLIAMS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Prosecutors have twice tried to convict
Clarence Dexter of murdering his wife. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dexter's first trial ended in a mistrial. A murder verdict in
his second trial was overturned by the Missouri Supreme Court
because lawyers talked in court about how Dexter was silent when
arrested. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the third trial, set to begin Monday in Clay County, is in
trouble because prosecutors cannot find a police 911 tape, samples
of a T-shirt Dexter allegedly wore the night of his wife's murder,
bullet fragments from the autopsy and a newspaper with a bloody
footprint. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are nervous and the victim's family is angry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dexter is accused of shooting his 50-year-old wife, Carol
Dexter, four times at their Kansas City, North, home on Nov. 18,
1990. He then allegedly went to a supermarket. When he returned,
Dexter allegedly saw that his wife was not dead and then beat her
with a hammer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dexter, 57, has contended that he discovered his wife's body
after returning from the supermarket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers discovered the evidence was missing earlier this
spring when they wanted to have their own scientists compare the
bloody footprint to Dexter's shoe. When the lawyers opened an
evidence bag, they found several pieces of newspaper, but the
bloodied newspaper was gone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That prompted an inventory of the case's evidence, and it was
then that several critical items were discovered missing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Special prosecutors Tim Finnical and Victoria Thomas have
searched for the evidence in the Kansas City Police Department
property room, the Clay County prosecutor's property room and the
Missouri attorney general's office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole family is upset. We want justice served,'' said the
victim's brother, Olan Thrasher. ``Evidently their filing system is
not too good.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thrasher, however, said he has confidence in the prosecutors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have a lot of evidence,'' Thrasher said. ``I just
hope these (missing) two or three pieces don't jeopardize the whole
case.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a pretrial hearing last month, Kansas City Regional Crime Lab
criminologist John Wilson said the evidence might have gotten
scrambled during one of Dexter's earlier trials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Dexter's first trial in July 1991, the jury deliberated more
than eight hours without reaching a verdict. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A jury in his second trial in October 1991 convicted him. A Clay
County judge sentenced Dexter to execution after the jury could not
decide between death and life without parole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was overturned in 1997 by the Missouri Supreme
Court. The high court ruled unanimously that Dexter's 14th
Amendment right of due process was violated because lawyers talked
in court about how Dexter was silent after he was arrested and read
his rights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The missing evidence will make next week's trial much different
than Dexter's earlier trials, said Cyndy Short, a public defender
on Dexter's defense team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Short said Dexter's link to the crime is weakened without the
evidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the 911 tape contains Dexter's call to the
police after his wife's death. The shirt samples contain blood
stains that could show whether Dexter was present during the murder
or whether he bloodied his clothes when he discovered his wife's
body, prosecutors said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the pretrial hearing, defense forensic consultant Gene
Gietzen said a picture of the bloody footprint did not appear to
match Dexter's shoes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have done better analysis if the newspaper had been
preserved,'' Gietzen said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How the clothing samples and the bullet fragments were handled
in the Dexter case also was discussed at the hearing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson the criminologist said in 1991 Clay County prosecutors
often had lab technicians bring lab samples to a trial. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said other area prosecutors only asked for the lab reports
and the actual evidence. Lab samples, such as the clothing samples
and the bullet fragments, remain at the lab. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Remnants stay in the lab frozen so you can test them later,''
Wilson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clay County prosecutor's office spokesman Jim Roberts said that
at the time of Dexter's earlier trials, the office usually kept
evidence until the police asked for it. Murder case evidence was
returned to the police immediately after trial, Roberts said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new practice is that the agency that brings the evidence
is the one to bring it to trial and to take it back,'' Roberts
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said what might have happened is that the lab samples
might have been mixed with other evidence and mistakenly returned
to the Kansas City Police Department. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson testified that lab records showed that additional bullet
fragments collected at the Dexter crime scene were checked out from
the lab by a former assistant prosecutor, but the record did not
show that the fragments were ever returned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, those fragments recently were found mixed with other
evidence in the case in the police property room, said Tom
Jacquinot, a public defender on Dexter's defense team. &QL;

GUITAR CENTER HITS SLIDE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in musical instruments retailer Guitar
Center Inc. plummeted Friday after the company said slowing sales
and a recent merger will hurt near-term earnings more than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Guitar Center stock dropped $4.125, or 27.4 percent, to close at
$10.9375. More than 4.5 million shares in the company traded hands,
about 12 times the issue's 30-day average trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   In its unexpected announcement, Guitar Center warned that a
recent merger with Musician's Friend, the nation's top musical
instrument catalog retailer, and slowed sales of key product lines
will cut the firm's second-quarter earnings by about 8 cents per
share. The company had been expected to earn 19 cents per share by
a consensus of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the revenue shortfall will have a drain on the stock of
about 10 cents per share for the remaining three quarters of 1999
collectively, Guitar Center said. Guitar Center had been expected
to make 80 cents per share in those quarters combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty disappointing,'' said Bank Boston analyst Sara
Gragg in San Francisco. Gragg noted that Guitar Center had earlier
warned of some dilution to earnings but nothing so dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Guitar Center announced it would purchase Musician's
Friend for $48.3million in an effort to establish a strong catalog
and online commerce presence. The Oregon mail-order company also
operates one of the Internet's most successful retail musical
instrument sites, generating about $9million in online sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gragg, whose firm has a ``long-term attractive'' rating on
Guitar Center stock, said management of the music retailer will now
have to prove it can master the new catalog and online business
models before regaining investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of moving pieces here,'' Gragg said. ``By no
means do I think this is a bad company, but there are a lot of
uncertainties.''

<P>
   American League, National League, interleague, it doesn't make
any difference to Pedro Martinez, who elevated the bar on his own
magnificence last night by striking out a career-best 16 in a
three-hit, 5-1 win over the Atlanta Braves in a Fenway Park
teetering on pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   How about a league of his own?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was Nintendo tonight,'' said Red Sox second baseman Jeff
Frye after Martinez raised his record to 11-1 with his ninth
straight victory. He is the majors' only pitcher with double-digit
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing he can throw that hard and have that good a
control. He made a lot of good hitters look bad tonight. You know a
guy has very good stuff when that happens, because they've got a
good lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the best-pitched games I've ever been involved
in.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as it was, remarkably, it wasn't the most whiffs by a
Braves team against a member of the Martinez family. It was,
however, their most strikeouts since Ramon Martinez of the Dodgers
struck out 18 Braves June 4, 1990, exactly nine years ago Friday,
in a 6-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   Billerica's Tom Glavine, who took the loss Friday night in his
second start in his backyard, was the loser against Ramon, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time I saw Pedro,'' said Atlanta manager
Bobby Cox. ``He was pitching for the Dodgers in relief, and I said,
`My God, he looks like he's throwing 130 miles an hour and weighs
about 140 pounds.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his arm was going to fly off. But he's gotten bigger
and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smooth. He doesn't stress his delivery. (Pitching coach
Joe) Kerrigan has done a super job. He's had him forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who lowered his earned run average to 1.91, best in
the majors, gave up a leadoff single to Javy Lopez in the second, a
leadoff double to Andruw Jones in the fifth, and lost his shutout
when Ryan Klesko curled his seventh home run around the Pesky Pole
with one out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out at least one batter in every inning, and ended
seven of his nine innings with a K, which guaranteed him a frenzied
reaction from the sellout crowd of 33,411 each time he slowly made
his way back to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, which included Cardinal Bernard Law, was never
happier than in the ninth, when Martinez, who had thrown 104
pitches through eight, headed back to the mound to put the
finishing touches on his second complete game. He struck out
Chipper Jones for his 15th whiff, matching the career best he'd
achieved twice this season. Brian Jordan was caught looking for No.
16. Javy Lopez then had two strikes on him before grounding out to
third baseman John Valentin to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a professional hitter,'' said Chipper Jones, the All-Star
third baseman who played for the Florida state championship in
Little League against Sox catcher Jason Varitek and lost that one,
too. ``I feel like no matter who is out there, how good they are,
I'm going to get them every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I realize there are some days that no matter how good you
are, somebody out there will be better than you. And tonight, I
think Pedro was better than anybody in our dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who retired the last eight Braves, struck out every
batter in the Atlanta lineup at least once. He struck out cleanup
hitter Jordan four times. He struck out Gerald Williams, the No. 9
hitter, three times. When he had a runner on third and no outs in
the fifth after Jones's double and a wild pitch, he struck out
Randall Simon and Williams and put away Walt Weiss on a pop to
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best pitcher in the game, man,'' said Jordan, shaking
his head. ``It's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm wasn't confined to the seats. Up in the Sox
broadcast booth, Hall of Famer-to-be Dennis Eckersley, filling in
for Jerry Remy, was doing enough fist-pumping for both pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the most dominating games I've ever seen,'' said
Eckersley, who was in Oakland in 1990 when Bob Welch won 27 games,
the high-water mark for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was styling for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who were swept in three games when the Braves first
returned to the city of their roots two years ago, gave Martinez
all the cushion he would need in the first, the inning in which
Glavine historically is most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin walked on four pitches and Nomar Garciaparra
followed with a Wall double. When Glavine fell behind Mike Stanley,
2-and-0, he elected to walk the Sox cleanup hitter intentionally,
but Troy O'Leary crossed up that strategy by reaching out and
slapping an 0-and-2 pitch through the left side, scoring Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Buford followed with another single, the first of three
hits for the center fielder. He later doubled and scored on Frye's
two-out single in the third, and homered off reliever Justin Speier
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we could have won that game is 1-0,'' said
Glavine, who has won more games than any lefty this decade, claimed
his second Cy Young Award last season when he led the National
League with 20 wins, but already this season has lost more games
(7) than he did in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most nights you hold a team to four runs or less, you win,''
said Glavine, who departed after seven innings with a yield of
eight hits, two walks, and four runs. ``But not tonight. Not
against Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, now 33-20, went 13 games over .500 for the first time
this season by winning for the 21st time in the last 27 games.
Martinez, of course, is 10 over the break-even point all by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams was talking about Martinez's changeup when
he said it, but he could have been talking about the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like magic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Yawkey Way, on the loveliest of June nights, only a fool _ or
a Brave _ would call it anything else.

PRACTICE PANIC PLANNED IN DOUGLAS COUNTY AS Y2K GETS CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   It's New Year's. News broadcasts
stream in from across the globe as the Y2K bug marches through time
zones toward Lawrence, Kan. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computerized train switches have stalled an Amtrak train at the
depot for two hours. More than 150 fidgety passengers are growing
restless as security officers fear for the safety of a high-profile
dignitary on board. Across town, a nursing home has been without
power for six hours and the water has dried up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gas is selling for $12 a gallon. Chlorine smells are being
reported in a nearby community, and six bodies have been found at a
campsite, victims of a Y2K suicide pact. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a bomb threat at the water plant, and a woman is about
to give birth in a second-floor tavern surrounded by 10,000 New
Year's revelers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to ``Millennium Madness,'' a June 22 Y2K disaster
exercise being planned by the Lawrence-Douglas County Y2K Community
Information Task Force. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is a test. This is only a test. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And with seven months to go before Jan. 1, it's one of the more
creative Y2K disaster drills being planned across the country.
Police officers, firefighters and utility workers will get a chance
to test their ability to react to a cascade of hypothetical,
worst-case Y2K problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the drill, ``A lot of people will be excited, a lot of
people will be panicking and a lot of people will be trying to do
whatever they can to take advantage of a lot of vulnerable
people,'' said Paula Phillips, director of the Douglas County
emergency management office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to prepare for what kind of mischief we think the
public will be up to that night and how might they make life
difficult for emergency responders.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The June 22 drill, which simulates the time frame from 11 p.m.
Dec. 31 to 2 a.m. Jan. 1, begins with fictitious East Coast
newscasts streaming into a unified command center. There, 45
service-sector representatives from the Lawrence area will react to
whatever surprises Phillips throws at them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fictitious weather reports call for an unseasonably warm 55
degrees in January ``that's going to bring people out of the
woodwork,'' she said. And because Kansas has allowed the sale of
fireworks from Dec. 28 to Jan. 1, the drill calls for the rocket's
red glare of year 2000 pyrotechnics bursting in air. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drill will end with a live media briefing to interject a
sense of realism from on-deadline reporters clamoring for the
story. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Douglas County task force, which has caught the attention of
the White House and is featured in a federal guide to Y2K community
preparation, will follow the drill with a countywide summit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similar drills are being planned in Johnson County, Kan., on
Oct. 13 and Shawnee County, Kan., on July 22. Both drills will be
based on the assumption that Y2K will cause a three-day disruption
in key services. &QL; 
Money in the bank &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest ``your money is safe with us'' report is coming from
Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For months now, banks and federal regulators have been trying to
calm fears that bank computer failures and automated teller machine
shutdowns will keep Americans from their money on Jan. 1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not going to happen, Parry said Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 98 percent of the Federal Reserve's ``critical'' computer
systems are Y2K-ready, Parry said. And 97 percent of U.S. banks are
``making satisfactory progress'' toward meeting Y2K deadlines, he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the probabilities are very high that on Jan. 1, 2000,
nothing very unusual is going to happen,'' Parry said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. this week said only 200 of
the nation's 10,379 federally insured banks and thrifts were behind
in Y2K preparation. Only 19 banks are rated as making
``unsatisfactory'' progress, the FDIC said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number of banks rated as ``needing to improve'' has dropped
by about 50 percent since late March, when the FDIC issued its last
report. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, during a speech in San Francisco, Parry said Y2K could
cause some economic problems in 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parry said spending by U.S. companies getting ready for the year
2000 problem might increase in the last six months of 1999 but drop
during the year 2000 as a result. He said the nation's gross
domestic product might go up by less than a percentage point this
year but drop by the same amount next year. &QL; 
Green light for Yellow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Freight System is the first major local company to report
that it is Y2K-ready. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to report that our computer systems are ready
for the new millennium well ahead of time,'' said Yellow Freight
President Bill Zollars. ``Our focus has been both on our own
systems and equipment as well as those of key suppliers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zollars said Y2K work had been completed on the company's
critical mainframe and its client/server computer systems. Computer
code fixes and testing were completed March 31, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the rest of the year, Yellow Freight will complete
contingency plans, retest systems for Y2K compliance and do further
Y2K reviews of key suppliers, Zollars said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Freight began its Y2K program in 1995. &QL; 
Cramming for Y2K &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, a group of Kansas City, Mo., and national
agencies is sponsoring Y2K ``how to'' workshops for businesses in
Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Based on the idea that the year 2000 problem could affect
everything from company phone systems to farm machinery, the
workshops will tell business owners how to assess their risk,
develop contingency plans and troubleshoot computer systems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City area workshops are scheduled for June 15, 24,
and 29. Titled ``How to Meet the Y2K Challenge,'' the workshops are
being sponsored by the U.S. Small Business Administration,
Mid-America Manufacturing Technology Center, University Outreach
and Extension, and other agencies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuition is $59. The workshops run from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. &QL;

MARTINEZ KING OF HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of the few times all night anyone caught up to him.
Pedro Martinez was walking through the Red Sox clubhouse Friday
night when Dennis Eckersley stopped him. The former pitcher hugged
the current one, let him go, then hugged him again. And that was
the restrained Eck.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he stood a few feet away from Martinez, pointing and
mentioning the great Sandy Koufax. No one flinched at the
reference. Martinez is that good. And since he is only 27, he may
not be as good as we think _ he's probably better.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out 16 Braves and held them to three hits in a
5-1 win at Fenway Park. The strikeouts are a career high, one more
than he had in consecutive starts last month against the Mariners
and Angels. Please, take a pause here for perspective. The Mariners
have Ken Griffey Jr. and Edgar Martinez. The Angels have Mo Vaughn
and Tim Salmon. The Braves have Chipper and Andruw Jones, Brian
Jordan, and Javy Lopez. You don't strike those guys out like they
are a group of Double A kids learning the art of hitting. Not
unless you are Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no (expletive) idea where he was throwing,'' said the
giddy Eck. ``No idea. It was one of the most dominant performances
I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   If you had recited the following numbers before the season and
said Martinez would have them on June 5, someone would have told
you to go in a corner and deal with yourself until you stopped
talking silly: 11-1, 1.91 earned run average, eight
10-or-more-strikeout games (his total from all of last season), and
18 walks.
</P>
<P>
   I do not claim to have an eighth of Joe Torre's baseball
knowledge. But I would hope there is at least a Post-It on the
Yankee manager's refrigerator, a reminder to pencil in Martinez to
start the All-Star Game here next month. I obviously do not work in
the American League office, but I hope the person in charge of the
engraving for the Cy Young Award is keeping up with all of
Martinez's information. Friday night's win was his ninth in a row.
He has done this while bothered by a sore hip and sore knee. He was
jokingly asked if the hip bothered him Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe it,'' he said, ``but it does.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does a completely healthy Martinez do, throw and catch
his own pitches? You want to know what his only mistake was Friday
night? Giving up a 310-foot home run to Ryan Klesko. If you hit a
home run like that in a game, you wouldn't tell anybody. It was a
tiny pop down the right-field line. Afterward, Klesko disputed the
official distance, arguing that it had to be longer than 310. It
wasn't. Even more frightening is that Martinez knew what he was
doing with the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only place he could have hit it,'' he said. ``I
jammed him and he hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the few times the crowd of 33,411 fell silent.
For most of the night, fans were chanting ``Pedro'' and pinning up
the ``K'' signs for strikeouts. One group in the bleachers put up
their Ks in a small area. After the 10th strikeout, the Ks started
to look like they were part of a Tic-Tac-Toe game; there wasn't
much room for all of them, so they had to be boxed.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have speculated that all this Martinez winning is
boring. Please. The beauty of Martinez is that you never know
what's coming. Of course you know about the strikeouts, the
dominance, and the praise (and frustration) from the other team.
But then there is the mystical element to the man.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's date was June 4. Nine years ago, on the same
date, Ramon Martinez struck out 18 Braves when he played for the
Dodgers. And while Martinez was striking out 16 Friday night in
Boston, Sox farmhand Michael Coleman was going 7 for 7 in
Pawtucket, R.I. After the game, Sox manager Jimy Williams sounded
like a mystic, talking about the power ``the little white ball''
creates when it is not hit. Then he said of Martinez, ``It's like
magic.'' Williams was asked when he knew Martinez was going to have
a special season like this. ``Oh,'' he said with a dramatic pause,
``about February.''
</P>
<P>
   On the mound for the Braves Friday night was Tom Glavine. He got
off to a rough start, giving up two runs in the first and another
in the third. He lost his seventh game of the season, but didn't
pitch poorly. Afterward, Martinez acknowledged that he studied
Glavine at the 1996 All-Star Game in Cleveland. He said he was
inspired by Glavine's focus and ``how nothing mattered to him but
the game.'' Martinez said he tries to learn something from everyone
he faces. ``I was just a young kid at the time,'' he said of '96.
</P>
<P>
   Now the young kid has grown into a professor of pitching. If he
wins 30 games this year, I won't be surprised. If he strikes out
300 and walks 45, I won't be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is on pace to strike out over 300 and walk something like
40,'' Eckersley said. ``That is unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he is done, he will be the subject of sonnets and
symphonies. You won't read about him only in English and Spanish;
they'll have holograms of him in newspapers soon. In some areas,
you'll be able to tap a page and hear his adoring crowds in
surround sound.
</P>
<P>
   What can he do next?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said catcher Jason Varitek, ``you'll have to come out
when he pitches again.''

DODGERS WIN ON KIDS' NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the matchup everyone came to see: Mo Vaughn
vs. Kevin Brown, the Fortune 500 of the Freeway Series. In rocky
season for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Anaheim Angels, there was
finally a little drama.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Vaughn was coming up with two outs and the game on
the line in the seventh inning Friday night, Brown was walking off.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who ran out of gas in his last two starts, gave way to
left-hander Pedro Borbon, who retired Vaughn on a weak fly ball to
center to end the inning and the Dodgers were headed to a 5-4
victory. The crowd of 49,213 at Dodger Stadium didn't leave, but
they may have in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   They did get to cheer for a few unfamiliar faces, the kind of
guys who used to play in the old preseason Freeway Series before
heading off to the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Chance Sanford, a Triple-A second baseman called up before the
game to replace injured Todd Hollandsworth on the roster, singled
home two runs in the Dodgers five-run fourth inning against Angels
starter Omar Olivares (6-4).
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the inning, Dodgers catcher Angel Pena drove in his
first major-league run. And veteran shortstop Jose Vizcaino came
off the DL before the game and capped the scoring with a two-run
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon's contribution should not be overlooked. After retiring
Vaughn, who had a single in three at-bats against Brown, Borbon
came out for the eighth and struck out left-handed hitting Garret
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon, who allowed a run Wednesday to Pittsburgh after eight
consecutive scoreless appearances, has been a bright spot in the
Dodgers bullpen. Friday night, the reliever did what the Dodgers
have been hoping for all season.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mills replaced Borbon and got the final two outs of the
eight before turning the game over to closer Jeff Shaw, who allowed
the tying run to reach third in the ninth but struck Darin Erstad
to end the game and earn his 13th save.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, the victory snapped a three-game losing streak
and put them a game over .500 (27-26).
</P>
<P>
   For the Angels, last in the American League West with a 26-28
record, the game was more than a loss in the standings. Olivares,
who leads the club in victories, left in the sixth inning after
straining his left hamstring running out a ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't expect to be fooled by the crafty Olivares,
but they also didn't expect to be trailing 3-1 in the fourth with
Brown on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was finished after 97 pitches, allowing nine hits and four
runs (three earned). He struck out four and did not walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom of the fourth was a farm director's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros opened with a single to center and took second on a
single by Devon White. After a fielder's choice by Adrian Beltre,
Pena singled up the middle to score Karros with the Dodgers first
run.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, who added a double in the eighth inning off the Angels
third pitcher Shigetoshi Hasegawa, entered the game batting just
.133. But with Todd Hundley sidelined for the series and probably
longer with a sprained left wrist, Pena will get plenty of playing
time in the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, was the Dodgers' organizational Player of the Year in
1998, but had grown bored playing this season at Triple-A
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   His teammate Sanford did not have Pena's pedigree, but was
called up when Mark Grudzielanek went on the DL Friday with a
fractured right wrist. He started at second base in place of Eric
Young and led off.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford, a six-year free agent out of the Pittsburgh
organization, struck out in his first major league at-bat. But that
was only the beginning. In a game that featured Brown and Vaughn,
he did more than both.
</P>
<P>
   Brown never was really sharp and struggled at the outset,
allowing three hits and a run in the first and two more runs in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson opened the fourth with a single to center and Troy
Glaus drove a 1-2 pitch into the left-field stands for his eighth
home run.
</P>
<P>
   Brown never was dominant, allowing a single to Vaughn in the
fifth and another run in the sixth. That one wasn't really his
fault. Glaus opened the inning by reaching on an infield single to
third and took second on a throwing error by third baseman Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus scored on two infield outs to cut the Dodgers lead to 5-4.

STARS FEVER BECOMES A REAL AREA EPIDEMIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Hockey madness engulfed Reunion Arena on Friday night
as the Stars' quest for Lord Stanley's hardware went speeding past
yet another mile marker.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, coming up next, that fabled road paved with silver. Four
more wins _ the toughest four wins in professional sports _ and the
desired piece of silver will be relocated to the chicken-fried
kingdom. How's that for Canada's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   But while saving their finest performance for last in these
Western Conference finals, the Stars didn't simply win a showdown
Game 7. This went beyond one team moving on, and one team moving
out for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   This was the next best thing to winning the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   This was a Cup clinic. Hello, Buffalo. Were you guys taking
notes?
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Avalanche had one period _ the first _ to get
something going. They did, but while dominating the 20 minutes, the
only puck that reached the net came off the smokin' stick of Jamie
Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   And except for the ticking clock, and the clicking Stars, this
Game 7 was over by midway in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a textbook Dallas Stars hockey team,'' coach Ken
Hitchcock said after the 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``textbook,'' but the class was for advanced students only.
This hockey clinic was all about slicing, dicing, frustrating and
flustering a very strong and game opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Only the best could make such Game 7 patsies of a high-octane
Avalanche outfit. And a gracious Colorado coach Bob Hartley
admitted as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the best hockey club in the NHL, on top of being the
toughest team to play against when they have the lead,'' Hartley
said in his postgame concession speech.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the hockey world, the Stars' style is called
``ugly.'' Friday night it was a thing of beauty to the 17,001
voices who howled constant approval in a show of vocal force
matching the Mavericks' old Reunion Rowdies of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   You want ``ugly,'' see Claude Lemieux. You want to win the
Stanley Cup, take lessons from Friday night's clinic. And then tune
in to Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Show on Tuesday night at Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Never in North Texas history has a local Big Four club other
than the Cowboys reached a league finals. Now the Stars have, and
the Reunion joy was immense, plus that joy spread quickly to all
local precincts.
</P>
<P>
   While remembering that the last time the Stars were on home ice
_ five days ago _ they were tattooed for seven goals, please
consider the second period Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado kept trying, but Colorado kept failing to get off a
shot. Yes, a shot. Eddie Belfour, very instrumental in halting the
Avalanche's first-period surge, watched from a rocking chair as the
Stars defense cut the rink in half. Most of the second period was
played on Patrick Roy's end of the ice, or in the neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   The curtain was about to fall on the Avalanche, and with so much
of Game 7 still to play, how could they have known?
</P>
<P>
   But with just over 11 minutes gone in the period, Pat Verbeek
charged Roy from the right side and took a shot that never reached
the crease. The puck appeared to deflect off Guy Carbonneau's stick
and then took a perfect and lucky bounce out to Mike Keane in the
slot. Bingo ... Keane banged it past Roy, and with a 2-0 lead, the
game changed dramatically for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``What surprised me was how well we played when we went up
2-0,'' said Hitchcock. ``From then on, it was like we were
executing out of the textbook. That goal turned our nervousness
into energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Keane would strike again as the desperate Avalanche became
loosey-goosey on defense. On an odd man rush with Verbeek, Keane
kept the puck as Roy got no help from defenseman Adam Foote.
Suddenly, Keane was parked on Roy's doorstep, and when Patrick
over-committed, the puck went sliding by him.
</P>
<P>
   At 3-0, the smell of Colorado blood was in the Reunion air. And
the packed house cut loose with a roar that was heard in upstate
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Avalanche got its first shot after 14 minutes of
the second period. And it only had three for the entire 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For those who came Friday night expecting three periods, at
least, of extreme sweat, the Game 7 celebration got a very early
start. The only suspense left involved Lemieux. Would he
sucker-punch Belfour in the hand-shake line?
</P>
<P>
   And just to keep the record straight, apologies will be accepted
beginning today by general manager Bob Gainey. All of us who barked
14 months ago when Gainey traded the popular Todd Harvey for
old-timers Keane and Brian Skrudland, well ...
</P>
<P>
   The pieces are all in place. The silver-paved road awaits.
Hello, Buffalo. Hello, Lord Stanley.

TROJANS COME UP EMPTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ Zito almost meant zero _ as in hits allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, nothing is what the USC baseball team got from one of
its best pitching performances of the season. Nothing is what the
Trojans got out of what for a moment looked like a game-tying home
run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing means more to the Trojans than a win today in their
best two-of-three NCAA playoff super regional series against
Stanford. If they lose, their season is over.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal, which didn't get a hit against Barry Zito, USC's
All-American left-hander and first-round draft choice, until the
sixth inning, went on to beat the Trojans 1-0 Friday night in front
of 3,708 at Sunken Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   USC was shut out for the first time since last year, and that
was also to Stanford by the same score, only after Brad Ticehurst
hit a long fly ball down the right-field line with two outs in the
top of the ninth that was called foul by first-base umpire Randy
Bruns.
</P>
<P>
   USC head coach Mike Gillespie didn't argue. Stanford
right-hander Jason Young, who threw a complete game and struck out
10, said for split-second he thought the game would be tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's breaks like that which make for a championship season,''
Young said. ``It was an amazing moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito, pitching while the Oakland A's, the team that drafted him
No. 9 overall in this week's major-league draft, were playing about
20 minutes up the road against the Giants, was outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Zito didn't allow a baserunner until the fifth, when he walked
two. He didn't allow a hit until the sixth, when Ticehurst lost
Eric Bruntlett's fly ball in the lights in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Bruntlett had a gift double, and suddenly, Stanford (47-13) had
a runner in scoring position. The Cardinal seized the opportunity _
Jeff Rizzo's one-out double brought home Bruntlett with the game's
only run.
</P>
<P>
   Zito (12-3) gave up two hits, matching his season low, and
struck out eight in eight innings. He lost for the first time since
Feb. 19 and had an 11-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't think about a no-hitter,'' Zito said after the game,
``you just think about holding (the other team) down.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending national champion USC (36-25) put itself on the brink
of elimination with poor hitting in clutch situations against
Young, who set the school record for strikeouts in a season midway
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Young (11-3) continually pitched out of jams in the middle
innings _ including the fourth, when he struck out Ticehurst with
the bases loaded with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   USC also didn't execute in two hit-and-run situations with Eric
Munson on first (Munson was thrown out both times) and Jason Lane
was thrown out trying to steal third in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Lane sent a buzz through the crowd in the eighth when he sent a
fly ball to the warning track in right field. It was caught by Joe
Borchard (Camarillo High) a few feet from the fence.

SPURS CRUSH COLD-SHOOTING BLAZERS, CLOSE IN ON SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND _ It appeared as though Rasheed Wallace conjured up
what would be an auspicious day for the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   On the game's first play, Wallace found himself with the ball, a
dying shot clock and a prayer of a shot. Somehow, though, his
off-balanced, 20-foot heave from the top of the key swished through
the net to a thunderous roar.
</P>
<P>
   However, by the time the San Antonio Spurs finished off the
Blazers 85-63 Friday night at the Rose Garden, Wallace's opening
basket boiled down to this: Two points. Bad omen.
</P>
<P>
   Portland's offense remained stagnant for the rest of Friday's
Game 3 loss in the Western Conference finals. Whenever the Blazers
attempted anything with the basketball, it was ugly, off-balanced
and mostly off.
</P>
<P>
   Their final point total tied an NBA playoff-low this season.
</P>
<P>
   The worst of the Blazers' ineptitude came in the third quarter,
when they missed nine straight shots and turned the ball over three
times during the final 6:44 off the period. That allowed Spurs to
score 16 straight points en route to an 18-point lead and a 3-0
advantage in this best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the much deeper and younger Blazers are fading fast,
needing a minor miracle to move on to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not kid ourselves,'' Blazer guard Greg Anthony said.
``We've got a lot of wounds to lick, a lot of pride to gain.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Blazers do not find a way to climb into this series, they
face being swept in Game 5 Sunday at Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, who have never advanced to the NBA Finals, swept the
Los Angeles Lakers in their conference semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a good job of finishing teams off,'' Spurs guard
Mario Elie said, well aware that San Antonio is 5-0 on the road in
the playoffs. ``We know we're ahead and in good position, so we
might as well go for the knockout.''
</P>
<P>
   For all practical matters, the collective face of the Blazers
might already be five inches from the mat. At least their psyche
has taken a hard hit. Portland bargained for a much stronger
showing at home after dropping two close games in San Antonio, but
responded with a horrendous 24-percent shooting performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missing shots wears on you,'' Blazers guard Jim Jackson said
in a somber tone. ``This was just a disappointing game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing their fans boo as the Blazers floundered through an
eight-point quarter must have hurt, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had every right to boo,'' Portland's Damon Stoudamire
said. ``I would too if I was a fan and paid good money. The Spurs
beat out butts.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland trailed 48-46 midway through the third, but fell behind
64-46 heading into the fourth. The Blazers' third-quarter output
was nearly as bad as their five-point fourth quarter in Game 1 of
the conference semifinals against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done that before,'' San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich
said. ``Every team has a night like that. You just hope it doesn't
come in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Wallace had more than three field goals for the Blazers. He
finished with 22 points but was in constant foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire went 1-for-12. Isaiah Rider missed 8 of his 11 shots
and Brian Grant misfired on all five of his shot attempts. The more
the Blazers missed, the more anxious they became.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain about some of the shots we got,'' Jackson
said. ``But there were times when our time management wasn't there
and we just needed to get easy baskets. But San Antonio is a great
defensive team. They talk, they rotate. You have to be able to
space the floor, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland's desperation fed San Antonio's already aggressive
defense. The Spurs made getting to the basket difficult largely due
to David Robinson's seven blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had good rotation,'' Robinson said. ``We really took them
out of their offense. They were isolating more than we've seen, and
I think it was because they were frustrated about not being able to
get into their offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson dominated the third quarter. He seemed to grow larger
after Tim Duncan picked up his fourth foul only 40 seconds into the
period.
</P>
<P>
   All of the damage had been done by the time Duncan returned. If
the Blazers did anything right, it was taking away the Spurs' best
low-post threat. Portland crowded the post to the point where
Duncan tied a career-low with five points.
</P>
<P>
   However, San Antonio's shooters made the Blazers pay with every
double team. Starting point guard Avery Johnson and reserves Jaren
Jackson and Steve Kerr each made their open shots count.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made six 3-pointers, which erased the Blazers' early
23-15 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season has been about stepping up,'' said Duncan, who
averaged 22 points and 11.5 rebounds in the first two games. ``You
can go through every playoff series and find a guy who stepped up
at some point for us. It's a nice feeling because we have a team.''
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night, Portland did not look like much of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a matter of quitting,'' Anthony said. ``I
think the spirit was killed at times. ... You live to fight another
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers have at least one more game to give it their best
shot.

FASSERO'S SHARP START WASTED AGAINST PADRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Jeff Fassero and Jose Paniagua reversed roles Friday
night. Fassero, who has struggled most of the season, was sharp.
Paniagua, normally the sharp one, struggled.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 3-2 Mariners loss to the San Diego Padres on
the opening day of interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero came into the game with a 7.34 earned run average, but
had one of his best outings this year, working seven innings,
allowing two runs on six hits and three walks, striking out six.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff pitched as well as he has at any time this year,''
pitching coach Stan Williams said. ``He was relaxed out on the hill
and threw the ball extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero left the game after seven innings, and Paniagua entered
with the score tied 2-2. The right-hander had walked only one in
his last eight appearances, but he loaded the bases in the eighth
on two walks and a hit batter.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, pinch-hitter John Vander Wal tapped a slow
grounder to second, and the Mariners nearly escaped trouble. But
Alex Rodriguez's relay throw bounced in front of first baseman
Butch Huskey, and by the time Huskey had scooped it, Vander Wal was
safe, rookie David Newhan had scored, and the Padres had their
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close enough to where I thought he could've been called
out or he could have been called safe,'' Huskey said. ``It was one
of those toss-up plays, and (umpire Jerry Layne) made the decision
to call him safe. We've got to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was not concerned about Paniagua's wildness, citing a
good at-bat by Jim Leyritz to draw the leadoff walk and the fact
that Paniagua was around the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be giving the hitters too much credit,'' Williams said.
``He's got too good stuff to try to be fine like that. You get
ahead, and then try to be fine afterwards. I'll talk to him about
it tomorrow. He's got the kind of stuff that gets the hitter in
trouble as soon as he gets out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had opportunities, especially in the fifth inning.
Brian Hunter singled and stole second with one out. Trying to
advance on a ball in the dirt, Hunter was thrown out at third.
David Bell and Ken Griffey Jr. walked, bringing up Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Hitchcock again threw in the dirt, and as the ball got
away from catcher Phil Nevin, Bell broke for third. But Nevin
recovered, threw out Bell, too, and the inning was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard somebody say `Go!' so I went,'' Bell said. ``From the
angle I had, I couldn't tell how far away from the catcher it was.
That's why I didn't break right away. If I had, I would have made
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he didn't. Rodriguez opened the next inning with a
437-foot bomb into the second deck at Qualcomm Stadium, the first
this year and just the 23rd ball hit there in 31 years. It was
Rodriguez's ninth homer of the year, and sent fans from neighboring
sections scrambling over, hunting for the ball for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero kept the score tied, getting a 1-2-3 sixth. That was in
the midst of a stretch of 10 consecutive outs, the longest such run
for Fassero this year. He was touched only for a solo home run by
Ruben Rivera leading off the second and a steal of home in the
fourth by Gary Matthews Jr., who like Newwhan was making his major
league debut.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at first and third and one out, Ed Giavanola broke
for second, drawing a throw from catcher Dan Wilson that bounced in
front of Rodriguez. As Rodriguez ran back Giavanola to first,
finally tossing to Huskey, Matthews broke for home, scoring in
front of Huskey's throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wilson's) throw was in the dirt, and it threw off the timing
of the play,'' M's manager Lou Piniella said. ``Alex bobbled it,
and the ball short-hopped him. He started running him back to
first, and the runner got too far off third.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the last run Fassero allowed, and the left-hander was
pleased with his performance. He pitched well enough to win,
changing speeds more often than he has in past starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of my last four starts have been good, and I'm happy
with them,'' said Fassero, whose record remains 3-6. ``You do what
you can. It's always nice to get the win, but at the same time it'd
be nice for the team to win.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory would have been doubly nice Friday because the Texas
Rangers lost to snap their nine-game winning streak. The Rangers
still lead the third-place Mariners by five games in the American
League West.

PORTLAND PAINTS PERFECT PICTURE OF SELF-DESTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND _ An error has been reported in the results of the
Western Conference semifinal playoff series between the Portland
Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, both teams lost.
</P>
<P>
   It was known earlier that the Jazz were defeated, 4-2. But after
Friday night's game in the Rose Garden against the San Antonio
Spurs, it appears the Blazers were wiped out, too.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the Fail Blazers have nothing to bring to the Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the series 0-2, the Blazers were supposed to be revived
by the series' return to Portland. Instead, they blew right past
the Doze City and went straight to the edge of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Where
</P>
<P>
   they
</P>
<P>
   went
</P>
<P>
   this
</P>
<P>
   way.
</P>
<P>
   All of Paul Allen's horses and all of his billions won't be able
to put this mess together again. Hey, the Blazer owner doesn't have
enough money to get the stink out of the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Jeez, 85-63? On 25 percent shooting? When Spurs star Tim Duncan
was nearly worthless? And the Spurs overall were ordinary?
</P>
<P>
   This one went beyond bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst displays I've ever seen from a basketball
team,'' said Blazer guard Greg Anthony, the ex-Sonic. ``We were so
indecisive, in such disarray, that we never gave ourselves a chance
to get in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not quite true. Disarrayed and indecisive, yes, but
they were actually in the game for awhile. The Spurs early on were
near collapse themselves, giving 17 free throws to the Blazers in
the first quarter while Duncan and David Robinson fell into foul
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But they ``righted'' themselves with a 24-8 third quarter that
was breathtaking only compared to Portland's ineptitude. They did
not score a point in the quarter's final seven minutes. Even the
loyal Blazer partisans were moved to heckle their heroes, some
catcallers intimating the Blazers quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was a matter of quitting,'' said Anthony, one
of the few Blazers with the professionalism to talk afterwards.
``Maybe it was more like the spirit was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, it was another example of how rotten the NBA
has been this season, and it came without the standard excuse of
fatigue. These teams had three days between games. One more day of
rest, and mass graves would have been ordered by the health
department.
</P>
<P>
   In the little picture, the Blazers not only displayed all the
flaws long associated with this team, they screamed them to the
world. Even though Rasheed Wallace led the Blazers with 22 points,
he offered a good example of the Blazers' pointless petulance and
knotheadedness they have worked hard to repress.
</P>
<P>
   During a dead-ball moment in the second quarter, Spurs reserve
forward Jerome Kersey slammed the ball off the front of the
scorer's table, dismayed that he was being pulled from the game.
Referee Ronnie Nunn knew Kersey's gesture was directed at no one,
but Wallace immediately castigated the official for not calling a
technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   After play began, Wallace stupidly kept up his tirade, finally
drawing a technical himself. Blazer coach Mike Dunleavy came onto
the floor and lit into Wallace himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazer who really did himself poorly was Damon Stoudamire.
He couldn't have picked a worse moment to miss 11 of 12 shots and
produce only three assists from his point guard position, and not
just because this was desperation time for the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the off-days preceding the game was Stoudamire's
pout that he wasn't getting enough playing time in the fourth
quarter. Playing time has always been an issue for the talent-rich
Blazers, and Dunleavy was named coach of the year mainly for his
deft handling of the potential trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But Stoudamire threw a rock through Dunleavy's trophy case with
his ill-timed whine, because it re-focused attention on the
Blazers' tender psyches. It also put pressure on him to produce big
time in order to deflect further consequences of his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Stoudamire, who had two tepid games in San Antonio, was
horrid, scoring only a lay-in as the first half closed and getting
thoroughly outplayed by his oft-maligned Spurs counterpart, Avery
Johnson (14 points, 8 assists).
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of what I said ... I probably would take it back,''
said Stoudamire. ``That made it look as if it was one of the
reasons why the team was not as focused tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But overall, the Spurs just came out and beat our butts.''
</P>
<P>
   As this team has been assembled over the past two or three
seasons, the Blazers have wished for more than a few take-backs,
for misdeeds off the court as well as on the court. Stoudamire's
gaffe was more of a misdemeanor than the usual Blazer felony, but
it took on heft with Friday's magnum decay.
</P>
<P>
   Since the sports world is well-versed in the notion that no NBA
team has recovered from an 0-3 deficit, and Friday represented the
Spurs' sixth straight win over Portland, the Blazers are fresh out
of room for more take-backs.
</P>
<P>
   They get to live with this odor for months.

DODGERS BEAT ANGELS ON KIDS' DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the matchup everyone came to see: Mo Vaughn
vs. Kevin Brown, the Fortune 500 free agents of the Freeway Series.
In a rocky season for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Anaheim Angels,
there was finally a little drama.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Vaughn was coming up with two outs and the game on
the line in the seventh inning Friday night, Brown was walking off.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who labored in his last two starts, gave way to
left-hander Pedro Borbon, who retired Vaughn on a weak fly ball to
center to end the inning and the Dodgers were headed to a 5-4
victory. The crowd of 49,213 at Dodger Stadium didn't leave, but
they may have in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprised? Yeah, he was throwing the ball well,'' Vaughn said
of Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor,'' Brown
said. ``That's (manager) Davey's (Johnson) job and I respect that.
If you ask me, I'm going to stay in there. But this is about
getting a win for the team. The win is bigger than any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The win also provided cheers for a few unfamiliar faces, the
kind of guys who used to play in the old preseason Freeway Series
before heading off to the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Chance Sanford, a Triple-A second baseman called up before the
game to replace injured Todd Hollandsworth on the roster, singled
home two runs in the Dodgers' five-run fourth inning against Angels
starter Omar Olivares (6-4).
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the inning, Dodgers catcher Angel Pena drove in his
first major-league run. And veteran shortstop Jose Vizcaino came
off the DL before the game and capped the scoring with a two-run
homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting to see Chance Sanford get that hit and then
see (Vizcaino) come back and hit that homer,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon's contribution should not be overlooked. After retiring
Vaughn, who had a single in three at-bats against Brown, Borbon
came out for the eighth and struck out left-handed hitting Garret
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon, who allowed a run Wednesday to Pittsburgh after eight
consecutive scoreless appearances, has been a bright spot in the
Dodgers bullpen. Friday night, the reliever did what the Dodgers
have been hoping for all season.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mills replaced Borbon and got the final two outs of the
eighth before turning the game over to closer Jeff Shaw, who
allowed the tying run to reach third in the ninth, but struck out
Darin Erstad to end the game and earn his 13th save.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, the victory snapped a three-game losing streak
and put them a game over .500 (27-26).
</P>
<P>
   For the Angels, last in the American League West with a 26-28
record, the game was more than a loss in the standings. Olivares,
who leads the club in victories, left in the sixth inning after
straining his left hamstring running out a ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't expect to be fooled by the crafty Olivares,
but they also didn't expect to be trailing 3-1 in the fourth with
Brown on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (6-3) was finished after 97 pitches, allowing nine hits
and four runs (three earned). He struck out four and did not walk a
batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In games where he struggles you have to keep an eye on him,''
new pitching coach Claude Osteen said. ``If you leave it to him,
he'll stay in, but that is not always the best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros opened the fourth with a single to center and took
second on a single by Devon White. After a fielder's choice by
Adrian Beltre, Pena singled up the middle to score Karros with the
Dodgers' first run.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, who added a double in the eighth inning off the Angels
third pitcher Shigetoshi Hasegawa, entered the game batting just
.133. But with Todd Hundley sidelined for the series and probably
longer with a sprained left wrist, Pena will get plenty of playing
time in the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Pena was the Dodgers organizational player of the year in 1998,
but had grown bored playing this season at Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   His minor-league teammate, Sanford, did not have Pena's
pedigree, but he was called up when Mark Grudzielanek went on the
DL Friday with a fractured right wrist. He started at second base
in place of Eric Young and led off.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford, signed last winter after his release by Pittsburgh,
struck out in his first at-bat as a Dodger. That's not what he'll
remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to first my head was racing,'' said Sanford, icing
a right shoulder that was repaired last summer by surgery. ``I just
stuck out my bat and made contact. I know I won't sleep tonight.''

FOR VETERAN STAR, IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When he faked the goaltender, his bon ami, to his knees
and then whisked the puck past Patrick Roy for his second goal, the
building erupted in a mighty roar.
</P>
<P>
   History sang last night. Mike Keane already knew the words.
</P>
<P>
   On the biggest night in franchise history, the 5-foot-10 Keane
rose to snatch the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   When a team trades for a 31-year-old veteran just before the
deadline, as the Stars did last season, there must be a higher
motive. In Keane's case, the clue was only ankle high.
</P>
<P>
   Tattooed on his left ankle are images of the 1993 and 1996
Stanley Cups that Keane helped win while he played in Montreal and
Colorado, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Keane has been there, in other words, and done that. On the
grand recipe to bring a Stanley Cup finalist to Texas, he was
deemed an essential ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a seventh game,'' Keane said after his two goals
helped bury the Avalanche, 4-1. ``You can't be nervous. It's a fun
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have the experience. They have the depth. They have
the tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we were nervous in the first period,'' Keane
corrected. ``I just think we spent a lot of time in our end. In
between periods, I think we just took a couple of deep breaths and
realized what we had to do to get back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not a goal scorer, Keane will tell you. In his 11 NHL
seasons, his high is 16. Keane found it amusing that before the
Western Conference final series, the media grilled him on the best
way to outfox his former two-time teammate and bon ami, Patrick
Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Keane scored only six goals during the regular season, and Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock had publicly wondered when the veteran was
going to air it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there were some times that we were very frustrated with
him during the regular season,'' Hitchcock admitted last night.
``But he's a lot smarter than any coach we've got on our team _
I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Keane, Hitchcock said, ``just lives for this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   If Keane's first goal, prompted by Pat Verbeek's hustle in the
corner, ignited the 17,001 at Reunion Arena, his second goal _ a
deft display of black magic on his old friend Roy _ sent the crowd
over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a goal scorer,'' Keane repeated. ``I just hope to be
in the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of big goals in these playoffs _ from people like
Jamie Langenbrunner and Dave Reid. I've always said that you need
three or four lines to produce, and we've had that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It had seemed a low-watt deal at the time. On March 24, 1998,
the Stars sent Todd Harvey, Bob Errey and a fourth-round draft pick
to the New York Rangers for battled-scarred veterans Keane and
Brian Skrudland.
</P>
<P>
   Keane promptly scored four goals and had eight points in last
year's playoffs. His encore came last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew the challenges and how difficult it was, so he was
able to pace himself during the regular season, knowing how much he
would have to blow it out,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   They are not the youngest team in the league, Keane explained
later. They are not the fastest or the sleekest. But the Stars brim
with depth and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Their time is nigh, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like comparing teams or wins,'' Keane said. ``We have
our own identity. But I think everyone realizes how important a
year this is for the Dallas Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   On a night when nobody at Reunion seemed to want to go home,
Keane said solemnly that the party will have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there are a lot of happy faces,'' Keane said, ``but we
didn't reach our goal tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made great strides. We beat a great hockey club. But the
party only comes after we reach our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The tattoo party, he means. There's still room on Mike Keane's
for one more Stanley Cup.

AT JOURNEY'S END, WORDS WEREN'T NEEDED FOR HULL, MODANO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ With a minute left in the game that would make this the
most glorious season in the Stars' brief six years in Texas, Brett
Hull and Mike Modano skated to the bench in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   They were far too excited to sit.
</P>
<P>
   As they stood there at the bench side by side, watching the
final seconds tick away in a 4-1 Game 7 victory over the Colorado
Avalanche in the Western Conference finals, Hull draped an arm
around Modano's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Their smiles, visible even from the press box in the rafters far
across the ice, captured the moment perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't say anything,'' Modano would say later, the smile
still pasted across his face in the Stars' locker room. ``We didn't
have to. We knew we had it at that point. We just kind of smiled.
We were glad it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I have been through a lot together. We played against
each other for a long time. Our paths have crossed many times, we
had a super year together this year, and it was great to be
together for this.''
</P>
<P>
   To put it in historical, perspective, ``this'' was the Cowboys
vs. the 49ers, any year you name.
</P>
<P>
   Times seven.
</P>
<P>
   With their overwhelming victory last night _ they stunned even
themselves with their dominance of an excellent team _ the Stars
climbed to heights previously only reached by the ``other'' team at
Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   We've reached the big time, sports fans. We're four Stanley Cup
Finals victories away from being home to two world championship
teams.
</P>
<P>
   If you were there, among the 17,001 screaming, delirious fans at
Reunion Arena, you'll never forget that moment last night when you
absolutely knew the Stars were going to win.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling began to build when Mike Keane, breaking down the
middle, drilled home a shot after a centering pass from Pat Verbeek
deflected off an Avs' defenseman. That gave the Stars a 2-0 lead
with 8:47 left in the second period, and the Stars' incredible
defense threw a sleeper-hold on the Avalanche offense.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you felt it when Keane danced in on Patrick Roy for his
second goal, the dynamic conclusion to a 2-on-1 Stars' rush. And
you knew it, without a doubt, when Jere Lehtinen caught Roy out of
position trying to defend against a Modano breakaway and slapped in
an empty-netter for a 4-0 Stars lead.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody cue the band and light up the cigars, this one's over,
baby.
</P>
<P>
   This was a night of unbridled emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, what was great was to see the emotion of people who
have never been here before,'' said coach Ken Hitchcock, who just
happens to be one of those people. ``Hull, particularly, was just
raw. His emotions were incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're usually so guarded, but he really let it rip. He just
put it all out there, he was so excited.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the 34-year-old Hull wanted to spend those final 60
seconds, standing alongside Modano, the man he has skated with and
learned to admire this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the pressure that a guy like Mike is under and I know
how hard Jere works and you just want to give 'em a hug,'' Hull
said. ``They feel like family to me, those two guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an incredible moment and an unbelievable feeling.
You begin to wonder if maybe it's never meant to be or something.''
</P>
<P>
   His thoughts, Hull said, were about Modano and Lehtinen and what
they've meant to him since he came to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing together all year, and Mike and Jere helped
me adapt to the system here and made me look, at times, a lot
better than I've been,'' he said. ``To come in, change my game and
fit in here, I couldn't have done it without them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Modano, it has been a 10-year journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into this decade in the Finals \Ras the Minnesota
North Stars\S and we're going out in the Finals,'' he said. ``It's
been a long time coming, a roller-coaster ride, and when you get it
to this point, you just ride it as long as you can take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty young and dumb at 19. I didn't really know what
it took to get there, but as you get older and wiser you realize
that this is the hardest championship to win in all of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the score, they said. It never felt easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of responsibility put on our line to play
against Forsberg and those guys,'' Modano said. ``We knew we had to
keep them off the board to give ourselves a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   With a minute to play, the two stood shoulder to shoulder,
watching the seconds tick away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't wind down fast enough,'' Hull said. ``It's Game 7,
you're playing such a fantastic hockey team. I read the papers and
listen to the people on ESPN and what not, and no one even thought
we could win 6 or 7. So it was a great feeling to kind of shove it
up there a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clarence Campbell Bowl, a huge piece of hardware that goes
to the Western Conference champions, sat by itself in the middle of
the room, largely ignored, as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have taken us to the brink of another, far more sacred
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Stanley's Cup is now theirs for the taking.

<P>
   KOSOVO-ACCORD (Blace, Macedonia) _ In a stunning admission of
defeat, five senior Yugoslav military officers came here Saturday
to review and sign the terms for their capitulation to NATO armed
forces, going over the details for their full withdrawal from
Kosovo with top NATO officers. By Elizabeth Becker.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RECONSTRUCT (Undated) _ Special Report: If the peace deal
holds up, the curious war comes out this way: The richest,
best-armed military alliance in history won, but at a savage cost
to the people who were supposed to be protected. A wily Balkan
dictator lost, but he stays on in his shrinking Yugoslavia. And
just possibly a new lesson in war has been learned: Thanks to the
wonders of high-tech weaponry, an overwhelmingly powerful alliance
can crush a small nation's aggressive will without having to risk
its own soldiers, if it is willing to spend enough money and if it
can tolerate mistakes that kill innocent civilians. By Blaine
Harden.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ Two conflicting senses _ relief that
the war appears near its end mingled with remorse over the U.S.'
supposed desire to impose its will on the weak _ were threads than
ran through a conversation about Kosovo on Saturday with several
well-educated Muscovites. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ Developments. By Steven Lee
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA (Undated) _ The Kosovo Liberation Army, the Albanian
separatist movement that remains heavily armed and deeply divided,
is likely to become the new power broker in the southern Serbian
province under any deal worked out between NATO and Belgrade. By
Chris Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ With the sudden and
apparent end of NATO's bombing war against Yugoslavia, Serbs are
relieved, angry, proud, disgusted and resigned, probably in that
order, suggested Slobodanka Bogic, as she stood in her still
windowless house, helping workers repair the damage. But soon
enough, she said, ``everyone will start to become more afraid,
because the winter is coming and there will not be enough heat,
power or food.'' By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CANDIDATES (Washington) _ If a possible peace settlement
in Kosovo has any effect on presidential politics in 2000, it
highlights an advantage of being the sitting vice president and the
disadvantage of a fractious mass of opposition candidates vying for
attention. By Katharine Q. Seelye.

   ARMENIA-DOCTORS (Los Angeles) _ Doctors from Armenia are
visiting Glendale Memorial Hospital for six weeks to learn how to
improve the health care management in their country. It's so
lacking in Armenia that their government-run hospitals do not have
admitting policies and no emergency rooms. The CEO of Memorial has
also visited Armenia to help them and to help Memorial be more
Armenian-friendly. The hospital now offers Armenian patients
Armenina food and the Armenian cable channel. By Donna Huffaker.

ARMENIAN DOCTORS GET TASTE OF U.S. HEALTH CARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DONNA HUFFAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As six visiting Armenian doctors toured Glendale
Memorial Hospital and Health Care Center on Friday, Dr. Levon
Movsessyan looked up from his video camera in surprise when a
father walked out of a maternity room.
</P>
<P>
   In Armenia, he said, it is not encouraged for men to be at their
wife's side during delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just tradition,'' he said through an interpreter.
Movsessyan is a pediatrician and neurosurgeon and runs a children's
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   For the Armenian doctors, the six-week visit to Glendale has
been an eye-opening experience _ medically and culturally _ as it
has been for the local doctors, nurses and medical staff who have
been their tour guides, instructors and hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The Armenians are here to look for ideas for restructuring their
country's crumbling health-care system. Friday was the third day
the medical team made rounds at Glendale Memorial and took note of
how American health care management works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors, patients in Armenia are very tired,'' said Sergey
Khachatryan, a urologist who works for the Armenian Ministry of
Health. ``Things must change.''
</P>
<P>
   Armenia has no health insurance and hospitals are run by the
government, he said. Aside from treating patients, doctors in his
native country also work as hospital directors and handle the
management aspect of health care _ something that overburdens the
physicians and ultimately takes them away from the patients, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Fellows, senior vice president and chief operating
officer of Glendale Memorial, witnessed this firsthand when he
visited Armenia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows observed no admitting departments. When he tried to find
a patient in one of the hospitals, he discovered he could not look
up patients according to their names or diseases. Patients were
admitted by date, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Soviet government-run system of health care is not
going to work in the new international market Armenia finds itself
having to compete in,'' Fellows said.
</P>
<P>
   So, after meetings between various dignitaries and health-care
professionals in Armenia, it was decided to arrange for a team of
doctors to learn as much as they could from other countries'
health-care systems, Fellows said.
</P>
<P>
   The six-week program in America includes course work two days a
week taught by University of Southern California faculty from the
university's master's program in health administration.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the doctors will meet with former Gov. George
Deukmejian and Armen Melkonian, the Consul General of the Republic
of Armenia. They will talk about Armenia's ailing health care and
discuss ways to rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   The program is funded in part by the Lincy Foundation, which
supports Armenian and humanitarian causes. It donated $100,000 to
help underwrite costs of air fare, accommodations, course
materials, interpreters and meals.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows, who plans to return to Armenia this summer, said
Glendale's large population of Armenian-Americans prompted him to
learn more about the culture. And to embrace the ethnic community,
the hospital has added Armenian meals to its menu and an Armenian
cable channel to its programming.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the doctors visited a variety of departments,
including the maternity ward and the newborn intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Another cultural difference the Armenians told their hosts about
_ one that surprised Glendale Memorial staff _ is that all women
are expected to breast-feed their children in Armenia, unless there
is some medical reason why they cannot use their own breast milk.
Then they use donor breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Jackson, administrative director of women's health
services, said it would be highly unusual for an American woman to
use another's milk. Formula is the substitute when a mother's
breast milk is not used, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is as interesting for us as it is for them,'' she
said of the cultural differences.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive site the doctors saw Friday was the
hospital's newborn intensive care unit. The unit, which uses the
latest in medical technology, opened last summer. While hospitals
in Armenia offer special rooms for babies with emergencies, he said
the equipment is usually 15 to 17 years old or older. Typically,
doctors monitor the infants more than the machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous. Things need to change,'' Khachatryan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our goals. We see what we want. We just need to learn
how to make it happen,'' he added.
</P>

   HAITI-CORNELL-AIDS _ Special Report: Nearly 20 years after
Cornell Medical College opened a clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,
it provides the best AIDS treatment available in a country on the

districts to provide computers for parochial school classrooms
under a program declared unconstitutional by a federal appeals
court. The case has received little notice so far, but that will

<P>
   CHINA-SPY-CASE (Washington) _ New evidence in the case of a
nuclear scientist suspected as a spy for Beijing suggests that a
rigid bureaucracy at the Justice Department thwarted an aggressive

   BIKING-DECLINE (Hannibal, Mo.) _ These are exquisite days to
ride a bike in this all-American, middle-American boyhood home of
Mark Twain. Kids can ride to school, to the Tom Sawyer Cave three
miles south, to fish on the banks of the Mississippi, to play pitch
and catch in a park. They can and they did, but they don't anymore.
Hannibal's parks, river banks and schools are all but barren of
bikes. And as Hannibal goes, so goes the nation. In the shadow of a
long, slow decline in cycling generally, the bicycle as a
century-old symbol of childhood freedom and transportation is
nearly extinct. By Peter Kilborn.

   KOSOVO-RECONSTRUCT (Undated) _ Special Report: If the peace deal
holds up, the curious war comes out this way: The richest,
best-armed military alliance in history won, but at a savage cost
to the people who were supposed to be protected. A wily Balkan
dictator lost, but he stays on in his shrinking Yugoslavia. And
just possibly a new lesson in war has been learned: Thanks to the
wonders of high-tech weaponry, an overwhelmingly powerful alliance
can crush a small nation's aggressive will without having to risk
its own soldiers, if it is willing to spend enough money and if it
can tolerate mistakes that kill innocent civilians. By Blaine
Harden.

<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA (Undated) _ The Kosovo Liberation Army, the Albanian
separatist movement that remains heavily armed and deeply divided,
is likely to become the new power broker in the southern Serbian
province under any deal worked out between NATO and Belgrade. By
Chris Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ With the sudden and
apparent end of NATO's bombing war against Yugoslavia, Serbs are
relieved, angry, proud, disgusted and resigned, probably in that
order, suggested Slobodanka Bogic, as she stood in her still
windowless house, helping workers repair the damage. But soon
enough, she said, ``everyone will start to become more afraid,
because the winter is coming and there will not be enough heat,
power or food.'' By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CANDIDATES (Washington) _ If a possible peace settlement
in Kosovo has any effect on presidential politics in 2000, it

Cornell Medical College opened a clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,
it provides the best AIDS treatment available in a country on the
front lines of the epidemic. But that is a lower standard of care
than patients receive routinely at American institutions, and
patients who participate in AIDS research do not receive the drugs
or the counseling that would be standard in the United States. By
Nina Bernstein. Eds: Will also moved in `a' category.

   NEPAL-ELECTION (Katmandu) _ In a two-stage election last month,
voters had the opportunity to create some order out of this social
entropy, and if local analysts are correct they demonstrated
admirable wisdom. By Barry Bearak.

   POPE-POLAND (Gdansk, Poland) _ Pope John Paul II arrived
Saturday in the birthplace of the Solidarity movement that he
sparked with his first papal visit 20 years ago, offering Poles
``the greeting of a fellow Pole who comes among you to fulfill the
needs of his own heart.'' By Alessandra Stanley.

<P>
   CHINA-TIANANMEN (Beijing) _ Since last year, Bao Tong, a former

under a program declared unconstitutional by a federal appeals
court. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-SPY-CASE (Washington) _ New evidence in the case of a
nuclear scientist suspected as a spy for Beijing suggests that a
rigid bureaucracy at the Justice Department thwarted an aggressive
investigation by the FBI. The result: We may never know the truth
about Wen Ho Lee, the suspected scientist at the center of a furor
over what is potentially the costliest counterespionage blunder of
the post-Cold War era. By David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-CITIES (Washington) _ Welfare rolls are shrinking more
slowly in big cities than in the surrounding states, and as a
result welfare recipients are increasingly concentrated in urban
areas. By Robert Pear.

<P>
   BLACKLEY-PROSECUTION (Washington) _ Ronald H. Blackley, once a
top aide to former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, faces two years

   COLO-SCHOOL-FAITH (Littleton, Colo.) _ For all the talk of the
jocks, preps and trench coat mafia, it was faith that bound Cassie

   WASHINGTON _ If the goal of the allied bombing of Yugoslavia was
to force Slobodan Milosevic to pull his troops out of Kosovo and
cede control of that unhappy province to NATO, it appears to have
been a success, and more _ a refutation of the common wisdom that
air power alone could never make a despot back down.
</P>
<P>
   But if the purpose was also to warn evildoers in other lands
that the United States and its allies now stand ready to enforce
peace with bombs, it is a message that has brought more concern
than comfort.
</P>
<P>
   From India to Israel to Indonesia, countries with their own
unresolved ethnic conflicts _ and they are of epidemic proportions
in the postcommunist universe _ have scrutinized the Balkan
conflict for some indication of how this might affect their own
fates.
</P>
<P>
   India, whose contested control of Kashmir has led in recent days
to new clashes with Pakistan and fierce clampdowns on the Muslim
population of the province, has been fiercely critical of
Washington and Brussels for presuming the right to interfere with
force in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which prefers to see itself as a victim of Arab
aggression rather than an occupying power in lands along its
borders, has welcomed NATO's new assertiveness. One high Israeli
official happily reported that Israeli intelligence had noticed
that U.S. willingness to bomb Yugoslavia into submission had
stirred considerable discomfort among some despotic Arab leaders of
neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it remains far from clear whether the capitulation of the
Serbs _ if, indeed, it is a capitulation and not another maneuver
by the wily Milosevic to gain time and consolidate his gains _
heralds the acceptance of a new global police mission by the West,
however bold the pronouncements and self-congratulation last week.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the United States and its NATO allies have
couched the bombardment of Yugoslavia in high moral terms, as a
crusade to restore the rights of a maligned population and to
prevent the spread of chaos beyond the borders of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But all along, many experts and foreign leaders have questioned
whether the allies would have acted had Kosovo been in Central
Asia, and how much the operation really had a tightly focused
purpose _ to define the reach, the role and the credibility of NATO
and the United States in postcommunist Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Now new questions can be added to the mix: Does the apparent
success of the air war change the logic? Will a newly confident
West be tempted to expand its horizons? Should tyrants in far-flung
parts of the globe think a second time before unleashing mayhem?
</P>
<P>
   Graham Allison, head of the Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs at Harvard, is among those who see the
bombing of Kosovo as a strictly European phenomenon. ``I think that
this was an accident, a combination of circumstances which
partially have to do with Europe, partly with NATO, partly with
guilt about the earlier Bosnia story, partly to do with the notion
that more things are doable in the European setting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not likely to initiate a new messianic crusade,'' he
added, even though some people will inevitably ask why the West
doesn't take action ``when the next horror arises in Rwanda or
Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges of selectivity have already been leveled, raising
the questions of where NATO was during the genocide in Rwanda, and
why it is complicit with Turkey's repression of the Kurds or
Indonesia's repression of separatists in East Timor, and why it has
kept silent about Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of NATO planes bombing Israel to get its troops out
of the West Bank, or Canada to free Quebec, or England to get it
out of Northern Ireland, has become the stuff of comedy routines
based on the inconsistencies of NATO's Kosovo rationale.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact is that separatist movements along ethnic and
religious lines and conflicts like the ones in the crumbling
Yugoslavia are likely to be the dominant problem of the near
future, and the temptation for interference by the West or other
powers will always be there.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that well-meaning nations can and should try to
jointly resolve conflicts has been a leitmotif of this century. The
creation of the League of Nations and the U.N. Security Council was
followed by various regional or individual efforts at peacekeeping,
including Syria's takeover of Lebanon with the consent of the Arab
League, Nigeria's efforts at stanching civil wars in West Africa,
and U.S. operations in Haiti, Somalia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One outgrowth of the Kosovo operation was the announcement last
week that the 15 members of the European Union intend to form their
own military force for such missions, freeing the United States of
at least part of the burden of playing global cop.
</P>
<P>
   But the peacemaking efforts have always been selective, and only
rarely successful. The Security Council has been wary of using its
powers to employ military force under the U.N. Charter. Most U.N.
peacekeeping missions have been created largely to formalize
agreements, and have lasted only so long as the warring parties
needed them.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO action on Kosovo marked a new approach. First, the
allies claimed the right to use force against a sovereign state
only because it refused to sign a proffered agreement. Second,
instead of sending in troops, NATO chose a campaign of
progressively more destructive bombing, thus sharply lowering the
chance of casualties among allied soldiers, and the resistance back
home that body bags provoke.
</P>
<P>
   However effective the approach in the immediate term, it has
also been the source of considerable irritation abroad, and
considerable uncertainty about the future. One accusation rarely
noted in the U.S. press, but extensively accepted as truth abroad,
was that the bombing of Yugoslavia was a flagrant violation of
sovereignty and international law. In the Third World, where
boundaries are often in dispute and governments weak, these
principles are held to be virtually sacred.
</P>
<P>
   Among other nations, most notably Russia, the entire campaign
has been perceived exclusively as a power play by NATO, with the
Kosovar Albanians only providing a pretext. Coupled with the
expansion of NATO, the campaign has seriously lowered the standing
of the United States in Russian eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So the diplomatic costs of repeating the exercise too often
would be high, even if the prospects of military success were good.

   In addition, there is a sense among U.S. and foreign analysts
that even if the Kosovo operation did achieve its aims, it did so
at an exorbitant cost in armaments and destruction. A million

   ``We just overwhelmed them with destruction,'' said Earl Tilford
Jr., a former Air Force officer who now teaches at the Army War
College. ``It was technically excellent, but strategically

many times the West will have the stomach to repeat the destruction
and the resources to repair the mess afterward.

   There was also the fact that having entered Bosnia and now
Kosovo, the United States is likely to remain mired in the south
Balkans for a generation. It is not the kind of garrison duty

   And there are also doubts about the effectiveness of the Kosovo
operation as a deterrent. ``Does this mean that the next bad man,

said Allison. ``It wouldn't significantly affect the calculus,

<P>
   What may happen, argued Susan Woodward, an expert on the Balkans
at the Brookings Institution, is that dictators or even troubled
countries, fearing that their internal conflicts make them ripe
targets for a NATO onslaught and unable to resist it with
conventional arms, will be tempted to turn to nuclear or chemical
arms.

things,''' Ms. Woodward said. ``Rather they will think, `I better
prepare better defensively against external interventions of that
kind.'''

   ``I'm not comfortable with the argument that if we compromised
we would lose our credibility,'' said Dmitri Simes, head of the
Nixon Center in Washington. ``That's not the kind of credibility we

NATO, is a global force. We have to understand how different our
actions look elsewhere.''

   Here's another story about the United States' out-of-control
courts: Southern Pacific Railroad was so besieged by frivolous
lawsuits in one Texas county that it ripped up 28 miles of track
and shut down operations in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Like similar anecdotes in almost every state, the tale of the
disgusted railroad has been repeated for years in Texas. It even
made its way into a conservative research center's report as proof
of what most people believe anyway: Havoc is being wreaked and jobs
lost by an irrational legal system.
</P>
<P>
   But, like many legal horror stories, it may not have been 100
percent true. ``It was kind of a coincidence of timing,'' said Mark
Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific, which merged with Southern
Pacific in 1996. ``Southern Pacific was studying that line to be
abandoned anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, across the country, accounts of bizarre jury verdicts
and huge damage awards (like the $2.9 million collected by the
McDonald's customer who spilled coffee on herself) have been used
to prove that the courts are wacky or worse. But increasingly, some
political scientists, legal scholars and consumer advocates are
suggesting that outlandish examples have created a distorted
picture of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Huge punitive damage awards, for example, have become everyday
events, right? Actually, a study of courts in the nation's 75
largest counties conducted by the National Center for State Courts
found that only 364 of 762,000 cases ended in punitive damages, or
0.047 percent.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but isn't it true that more and more liability claims are
filed every year? Actually, a study of 16 states by the same center
showed that the number of liability suits has declined by 9 percent
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Well, didn't that McDonald's coffee drinker laugh all the way to
the bank? Maybe, but she was 81 years old, the coffee was scalding
and she needed skin grafts for third-degree burns. And she settled
for about $600,000 after a judge reduced the jury award.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Galanter, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin,
described these popular stories about the courts as ``legal
legends,'' in the Arizona Law Review last year. The label is
sticking and some scholars and consumer advocates are starting to
systematically challenge their accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   They say legends like the one about the Texas railroad have been
used to maximum effect by a national business-supported movement to
make it harder for plaintiffs to win lawsuits under tort law, which
governs civil injury claims.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the Alabama Legislature passed sweeping tort law
changes, including a bill that would put a cap on punitive damages
awarded by juries. Virtually every state has considered similar
measures since the mid-1980s, and most have passed some measures to
limit lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of tort reform across the country is that it is one
of the most carefully developed and exquisitely executed political
campaigns ever,'' said Andrew Popper, a law professor at American
University in Washington who is an expert on personal injury law
and identifies himself as a supporter of consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
   One advocate's distortion, of course, is another's innocent
spin. David Shaffer, president of the Public Policy Institute, a
New York business group pushing for lawsuit limits in New York,
said examples of ostensible outrages are used by consumer advocates
as well as business groups. ``It's done on both sides,'' he said.
``The trial lawyers drag in pictures portraying some person who has
been a victim of a terrible accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if there are occasional exaggerations, some business
lobbyists say, there are enough large verdicts to intimidate
corporations into large settlements and to inhibit innovation by
making companies fearful of bringing out new products that might
attract lawsuits. The possibility of huge jury awards and the
expense of battling suits, they say, combine to keep useful
products off consumers' shelves.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers and academics argue that consistently
far-fetched accounts of court rulings have warped the debate about
the legal system. And shrewd public relations by business and other
groups pushing to limit lawsuits may be only part of the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual or big verdicts make news, said Michael McCann, a
political science professor at the University of Washington. McCann
and William Haltom of the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma,
Wash., found in a study that the large McDonald's verdict got
extensive front-page coverage in 1994. But only about half the
newspapers carried articles when the judge later reduced the
punitive damages to $480,000.
</P>
<P>
   In similar research, Oscar Chase, a law professor at New York
University, found in a survey of cases in the New York area that
the average verdict reported by The New York Times in 1989 was
$20.5 million. But including the much larger number of cases that
did not attract media attention, the average verdict was really
$1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy-makers,'' Chase said in an interview, ``can't reliably
use their impressions from reading the press about issues like
whether the court system is out of control.''

</P>
<P>
   The problem, some legal experts say, is that policy-makers do
rely on such impressions. In his law review article, Galanter
traced the long afterlife of an infamous 1986 case involving a
Philadelphia psychic who won a $1 million verdict. She had claimed
she had an allergic reaction to medical treatment and lost her
psychic powers.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the psychic's verdict was widely circulated.
Eventually, Galanter learned, it found its way into a 1991 report
of the President's Council on Competitiveness, which referred to
such bizarre cases as ``almost commonplace'' but did not disclose
that the psychic's verdict had been reversed and that she had
collected nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups say they are at a disadvantage in a public
relations war that often spotlights alarming accounts of supposedly
risky products, dangerous drugs and cancer-causing chemicals.
``Emotions are stirred more when people are frightened for their
own safety than they are by large damage awards that are not going
to be paid out of their own money,'' said Victor Schwartz, a
Washington lawyer who lobbies for businesses on tort issues.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups say accounts of ostensible outrages in the
courts seem more methodically misleading than reports about product
dangers. A recent report by Citizens for Corporate Accountability
and Individual Rights, a New York consumer group, said the Public
Policy Institute had ``misreported and misused'' every case it
described in its efforts to show that the New York courts were out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually don't mention that the defendant did anything
wrong,'' said the consumer group's executive director, Joanne
Doroshow, a former associate of Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   One supposedly outrageous case the Institute cited in a report
last year involved an award of $650,000 given by New York City to
the family of a drunk driver who was killed in an accident while
driving the wrong way on a parkway. The Institute did not disclose
that the court said the city's signs ``virtually invited wrong-way
entry,'' the consumer group said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the report was misleading, Shaffer of the Public
Policy Institute said anecdotes were less important than the
harmful impact of the overall legal system on corporate innovation.
``It is impossible,'' he added, ``to include complete information
about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   True or false, legal legends do make effective debating points.
In a series of interviews recently in Texas, several leaders of a
movement to end ``lawsuit abuse'' mentioned the case of the
railroad that abandoned Matagorda County in Texas because of
excessive lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Weekley, a Houston businessman who is a leader of Texans
for Lawsuit Reform, said in a recent interview that he had used the
railroad story for years in speeches as an example of legal
craziness. Audiences are horrified, he said. ``People sit there and
say, `Why is a railroad tearing up 28 miles of track?''' Weekley
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to an inquiry from a reporter, Davis, the railroad
spokesman, said ``Litigation was last on the totem pole'' among
reasons for ceasing operations in Matagorda County. ``Traffic was
down to one freight car a year.''

   Here's another story about the United States' out-of-control
courts: Southern Pacific Railroad was so besieged by frivolous
lawsuits in one Texas county that it ripped up 28 miles of track
and shut down operations in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Like similar anecdotes in almost every state, the tale of the
disgusted railroad has been repeated for years in Texas. It even
made its way into a conservative research center's report as proof
of what most people believe anyway: Havoc is being wreaked and jobs
lost by an irrational legal system.
</P>
<P>
   But, like many legal horror stories, it may not have been 100
percent true. ``It was kind of a coincidence of timing,'' said Mark
Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific, which merged with Southern
Pacific in 1996. ``Southern Pacific was studying that line to be
abandoned anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, across the country, accounts of bizarre jury verdicts
and huge damage awards (like the $2.9 million collected by the
McDonald's customer who spilled coffee on herself) have been used
to prove that the courts are wacky or worse. But increasingly, some

<P>
   Shouldn't people with mental illnesses, which can destroy lives
and families, be entitled to the same amount of insurance coverage
as those with physical illnesses? On the face of it, that sounds
like a fairly simple question.
</P>
<P>
   But as in all things having to do with health care, and
especially the often vaguely defined area of mental illness, the
issue can be maddeningly complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, the wife of the vice president, will open a White
House conference on Monday to draft new health-care policies that
would require employers and insurers to provide coverage for
outpatient and inpatient mental health comparable to that for other
kinds of medical care _ ``parity for all,'' in the words of Mrs.
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Along with similar proposals pending in Congress, the White
House initiative would face head-on what Mrs. Gore, who has a
master's degree in psychology, calls the destructive myth that
those seeking greater mental health coverage are ``out to rip off
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a significant slice of the total U.S. health-care
budget. About $80 billion _ nearly 10 percent of total annual
health-care spending _ now goes into mental-health treatment,
according to the Center for Mental Health Services, a federal
research agency.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of that amount, mostly from Medicaid, Medicare and
other government sources, pays for clinical treatment of the
severely mentally ill, whose illnesses often render them poor and
unemployed and who often ``end up in the public system,'' according
to Mary Rappaport, a spokeswoman for the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill, an advocacy group for the severely mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   In any year, according to the group, about 5 million Americans
suffer from severe and persistent mental disorders, including
schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and major depression.
</P>
<P>
   Few seriously question the need for clinical treatment for those
with the worst mental illnesses, about 250,000 of whom are
homeless. So the debate over the potential cost of providing
comparable insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses is
focused on those whose treatment consumes the remaining two-thirds
of the $80 billion total, most of which is paid by
employer-provided health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This segment includes the ``worried well,'' as they are called
by those who question the employment of psychiatric therapy to
address many less severe emotional distresses and addiction
problems. For the past 25 years, most of the increases in
mental-health spending have gone to this group of patients, who are
the easiest and most profitable to treat.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed federal laws to establish comparable insurance coverage
for mental illness seek to give priority to the severely ill. But
some employers and policy analysts worry that once mandates for
expanded mental-health coverage are in place, costs could rise
sharply above the modest levels projected by the drafters of the
parity bills. The concern is that the legislation would provide
profit incentives to tailor diagnoses and to recruit new pools of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of comparable insurance coverage cite studies showing
that the additional cost would be minimal, while providing a major
public-health benefit. The National Institute of Mental Health
predicts that mandating parity through managed-care plans would add
less than 1 percent to the total annual national health-care bill.
</P>
<P>
   But such studies could be flawed by ``very low assumptions on
induced demand,'' said Paul Fronstin, a senior researcher at the
Employee Benefit Research Institute, whose clients include
employers, labor unions and pension plans. ``Induced demand''
refers to marketing by the mental-health industry, usually among
patients with health insurance who can be successfully treated for
a wide array of mental disorders defined in the American
Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.
</P>
<P>
   For employers and others worried about potential cost increases
in mental-health therapy, induced demand raises a red flag. In the
late 1980s, when expanded psychiatric and substance-abuse therapy
was heavily promoted and advertised among the general population,
annual costs for such treatments rose 20 percent to 30 percent
faster than costs in other areas of health care, employers found.
</P>
<P>
   Fraud also became a problem. In the early 1990s, for-profit
psychiatric hospitals and addiction centers paid over $500 million
in federal fines to settle charges of profiteering and diagnostic
fraud in recruiting patients with generous mental-health insurance.
Many health-maintenance organizations responded by tightening
benefits for inpatient hospitalization and other mental-health
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, advocates for comparable insurance coverage cite
evidence that they say shows that more money is needed for
additional mental-health treatment:
</P>
<P>
   _ In any year 30 million Americans suffer from clinical mental
disorders, but only about 20 percent currently seek treatment,
according to studies cited by the National Institute of Mental
Health.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, 11.3
percent of Americans will at some point require psychiatric
treatment for various addictions. In an April report, the group
called for more spending on addiction therapy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The National Institute of Mental Health recently launched a
national television and radio advertising campaign to encourage
more people to seek treatment for anxiety disorders, which the
agency describes as ``frightening mental illnesses'' affecting 19
million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill cites studies
asserting that of the nation's 63 million youths under 18, about
7.5 million have diagnosable mental disorders _ but only about a
fifth now receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Post-traumatic stress disorder, which is prompted by memories
of traumatic events, is now widely diagnosed among victims and
witnesses of crimes, natural disasters and even marital problems.
The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 4 percent of
the population suffers from it. But that number could grow. The
Justice Department recently stated that some people who are
swindled by telemarketing fraud and other white-collar crimes
develop post-traumatic stress disorder and require psychiatric
intervention.

public-health benefit. The National Institute of Mental Health
predicts that mandating parity through managed-care plans would add
less than 1 percent to the total annual national health-care bill.
</P>
<P>
   But such studies could be flawed by ``very low assumptions on
induced demand,'' said Paul Fronstin, a senior researcher at the
Employee Benefit Research Institute, whose clients include
employers, labor unions and pension plans. ``Induced demand''
refers to marketing by the mental-health industry, usually among
patients with health insurance who can be successfully treated for
a wide array of mental disorders defined in the American
Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.
</P>
<P>
   For employers and others worried about potential cost increases
in mental-health therapy, induced demand raises a red flag. In the
late 1980s, when expanded psychiatric and substance-abuse therapy
was heavily promoted and advertised among the general population,
annual costs for such treatments rose 20 percent to 30 percent
faster than costs in other areas of health care, employers found.
</P>
<P>
   Fraud also became a problem. In the early 1990s, for-profit
psychiatric hospitals and addiction centers paid over $500 million
in federal fines to settle charges of profiteering and diagnostic
fraud in recruiting patients with generous mental-health insurance.
Many health-maintenance organizations responded by tightening
benefits for inpatient hospitalization and other mental-health
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, advocates for comparable insurance coverage cite
evidence that they say shows that more money is needed for
additional mental-health treatment:
</P>
<P>
   _ In any year 30 million Americans suffer from clinical mental
disorders, but only about 20 percent currently seek treatment,
according to studies cited by the National Institute of Mental
Health.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, 11.3
percent of Americans will at some point require psychiatric
treatment for various addictions. In an April report, the group
called for more spending on addiction therapy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The National Institute of Mental Health recently launched a
national television and radio advertising campaign to encourage
more people to seek treatment for anxiety disorders, which the
agency describes as ``frightening mental illnesses'' affecting 19
million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill cites studies
asserting that of the nation's 63 million youths under 18, about
7.5 million have diagnosable mental disorders _ but only about a
fifth now receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Post-traumatic stress disorder, which is prompted by memories
of traumatic events, is now widely diagnosed among victims and
witnesses of crimes, natural disasters and even marital problems.
The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 4 percent of
the population suffers from it. But that number could grow. The
Justice Department recently stated that some people who are
swindled by telemarketing fraud and other white-collar crimes
develop post-traumatic stress disorder and require psychiatric
intervention.

   Police departments across the country refer officers with
troubling memories to therapists who specialize in treating
post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Robert Volpe, the father of Justin Volpe, the New
York City police officer who pleaded guilty to savagely assaulting
a suspect in a precinct bathroom, employed the sort of therapeutic
language found on Internet sites devoted to police post-traumatic
stress disorder to defend his son. He likened police work to combat
and suggested that his son suffered memories of traumatic
experiences on the job.
</P>
<P>
   As a diagnosis, post-traumatic stress disorder ``just started
taking off in 1985 and it keeps growing,'' said Allan Young,
chairman of the department of Social Studies of Medicine,
Anthropology and Psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   If the pool of patients grows and parity laws require insurers
to pay for all demands for treatment, something will have to give,
experts say. A 1997 study by the Employee Benefit Research
Institute warned that as mental-health parity causes employer costs
to rise, workers can expect to see erosion in other benefits, and
that some employers could react by dropping health-insurance
coverage altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The correct approach, said Ms. Rappaport of the National
Alliance for the Mentally Ill, is ``redirecting money already in
the system for those who have the most severe disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   The priority is simple, she said: ``You save the neediest
first.''

   As he struts along the basketball sidelines, screaming out plays
while wearing a Giorgio Armani suit, P.J. Carlesimo feels blessed.
But sometimes he also feels foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of nights when you're sweating through a $2,000
suit that you kind of wonder why you're wearing a shirt and tie,''
said Carlesimo, coach of the Golden State Warriors. ``I think the
baseball managers and football coaches are smarter than basketball
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans watching the National Basketball Association playoffs this
weekend will no doubt note the visual disconnect between the baggy
jerseys of perspiring players engaged in grueling competition and
the sleek suits of coaches equally focused on the game. Carlesimo,
whose team failed to make the playoffs and whose wardrobe is
strictly Saks Fifth Avenue, makes it look good.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NBA coaches are widely considered to be the best
dressed in the world, as these things go. While their counterparts
in the National Football League and major-league baseball wear
warm-up jackets, baseball caps and, in the case of baseball
managers, team uniforms, the coaches in the media-savvy NBA wear
suits by some of the most trend-setting designers on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley of the Miami Heat has his Armani suits and sports
coats shipped directly from Italy. Chuck Daly, who recently retired
from the Orlando Magic, sat on the bench in the finely finished
fabrics of Hugo Boss and Ermenegildo Zegna, and the relatively
diminutive Mike Fratello, a veteran of 13 NBA seasons, is one of
the league's most exciting sideline personalities, mostly because
of his antics and his fashion flair. Fratello, who was dismissed
last week by the Cleveland Cavaliers, favored Boss.
</P>
<P>
   When Carlesimo left Seton Hall and entered the league five years
ago, he had no choice but to trade up in his clothing. Upon signing
to coach the Portland Trail Blazers, he was notified that one of
the team's sponsors, a local clothing store, wanted to outfit him
in Donna Karan (whose line President Clinton has been known to
wear).
</P>
<P>
   Now at Golden State, he has an agreement with Saks Fifth Avenue
that calls for him to dress in Armani or Zegna throughout the
season. While Carlesimo appreciates his good fortune, he says that
dressing to the nines is not necessarily practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer to coach in what we wear at practice, which would
be closer to what NFL coaches wear in good weather _ a coaching
shirt and slacks,'' Carlesimo said. ``But I think that it has
become an image thing in the NBA and that it's going to be
difficult to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Because their game is played indoors, NBA coaches have always
worn suits. But it was not until the mid-1980s that many of them
started paying attention to the label inside their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Don Casey, an NBA assistant coach for 18 years, said the shift
began when David Stern became the league's commissioner and
embarked on what has become the greatest mass-marketing campaign in
the history of professional sports. As the league gained fame and
an international following, the top players and coaches became
celebrities. The media began to take note of what the coaches were
wearing as they glowered or exploded or sat catatonic on the
sidelines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They didn't dress like that in the '60s and '70s,'' said
Casey, who during his brief stint as the head coach of the Los
Angeles Clippers was viewed as one of the league's worst-dressed
coaches in his lackluster suits and ties. ``The coaches were just
people coaching the game, but when national TV came in, the coaches
started becoming entities and looking professional and like _
you're on Wall Street _ came the look.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, who wore Armani while leading the Los Angeles Lakers to
four championships during the 1980s, and Daly, who became a dapper
dresser while coaching in Detroit, are considered to be the
pioneers of the current trend. While other coaches were wearing
cotton-blend shirts and polyester ties, Riley and Daly were walking
the court in shoes handmade by Bally and suits worth thousands of
dollars. Now, many of the league's coaches, armed with lucrative
clothing deals of their own, can match the Riley look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that now there's that pressure to keep up with the
Joneses,'' Casey said. ``Still, sometimes I don't feel like wearing
a tie.''

   NEW YORK _ Summer is blockbuster season, from the multiplex to
the august halls of culture. That's one way to explain a big van
Gogh show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Or ``Impressionists in
Winter,'' the first exhibition to assemble the snowscapes of Monet,
Renoir, Gauguin and others, served up by the Brooklyn Museum of Art
in the city's hottest months.
</P>
<P>
   Museums may shun comparisons with Hollywood but they, too,
strive for that explosion of interest (named for a super-powerful
World War II bomb) that spells ``blockbuster,'' filling the
coffers, swelling the membership rolls and exciting envy at fellow
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums have discovered advertising,'' said David Ross,
director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and former
director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. ``You can advertise
garbage and make millions. Imagine if you advertise something with
real value.''
</P>
<P>
   With Americans flocking to art museums in record numbers, such
hits _ shows that seize you by the lapels and bellow, ``What! You
haven't lined up for `The Treasury of Saint Francis of Assisi'
yet?'' _ lend a gloss and urgency to art, science and history,
while posing questions about commercialism and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows in the museum world arched last December when Ben
Hartley, director of communications and sponsorship for the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, said, ``We are in the
entertainment business and competing against other forms of
entertainment out there.'' The Guggenheim reached blockbuster
nirvana with its show on motorcycles, which drew half a million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But blockbusters have their defenders. ``These great moments of
acute interest create exceptional teaching opportunities,'' said
Ellen Futter, director of the Museum of Natural History, whose show
``Epidemic!'' on infectious diseases, has drawn more than 150,000
visitors since Feb. 27. ``They create a gateway to learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum calendars are replete with big exhibitions of plainly
blockbuster ambitions _ shows on Ingres' portraiture, the age of
the Pyramids, new archaeological finds from China and the
ever-popular impressionists, truly the museum world's most reliable
moneymakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Met weighed in last month with ``Cezanne to van Gogh,''
featuring the renowned collection of van Gogh's physician, Dr.
Paul-Ferdinand Gachet. ``I don't sit around thinking what will
bring in crowds,'' said Philippe de Montebello, who after two
decades as director was recently elevated to chief executive
officer as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum of Art days later opened its
``Impressionists in Winter,'' lauded by the museum's director,
Arnold Lehman, as ``literally the coolest show.''
</P>
<P>
   A show last year at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, ``Monet
in the 20th Century,'' became the most popular in the country in
1998, drawing nearly 566,000 visitors. The recent Jackson Pollock
show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York also proved a bonanza,
drawing nearly 330,000 visitors, a striking number, if still short
of the 940,000 _ more than 8,000 a day _ who swamped the museum's
Matisse show of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The John Singer Sargent show, which closed last week at the
National Gallery in Washington, drew about 425,000 visitors, or
nearly 4,500 a day, catapulting it into the realm of the smash 1995
Vermeer show, said Dodge Thompson, the chief of exhibitions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The modern age of blockbusters arrived with a sensational show
in 1948. With the museums of war-shattered Germany in ruins and
many of their treasures recovered by the Allies from salt mines and
other caches, the U.S. authorities shipped 202 masterpieces to the
National Gallery for exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Called simply ``Paintings From the Berlin Museums,'' the show,
with its Rembrandts, Vermeers, Titians, Duerers, van Eycks,
Botticellis, Breughels and a Bosch, drew near-riotous crowds. The
intense interest and short run of just 40 days, made for the
unprecedented arithmetic of an average 24,124 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   When the Louvre's Mona Lisa went on view at the National Gallery
in 1963, it drew an average daily attendance of more than 19,200,
for a total of 518,525.
</P>
<P>
   In overall numbers, the Met may hold the modern record, with
more than 1.2 million visitors to its ``Treasures of Tutankhamun''
of 1978 to '79.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bigger blockbusters on the horizon may not really be
blockbusters at all, but permanent installations. The new Gottesman
Hall of Planet Earth opens at the Museum of Natural History on June
12, the first stage of the spherical Rose Center for Earth and
Space to be unveiled early next year, replacing the old
planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Met opened its new Greek Galleries in a soaring
barrel-vaulted space hemmed in since World War II, drawing throngs
of visitors tabulated at more than 10,000 a day, until guards gave
up counting.

officer as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum of Art days later opened its
``Impressionists in Winter,'' lauded by the museum's director,
Arnold Lehman, as ``literally the coolest show.''
</P>
<P>
   A show last year at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, ``Monet
in the 20th Century,'' became the most popular in the country in
1998, drawing nearly 566,000 visitors. The recent Jackson Pollock
show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York also proved a bonanza,
drawing nearly 330,000 visitors, a striking number, if still short
of the 940,000 _ more than 8,000 a day _ who swamped the museum's
Matisse show of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The John Singer Sargent show, which closed last week at the
National Gallery in Washington, drew about 425,000 visitors, or
nearly 4,500 a day, catapulting it into the realm of the smash 1995
Vermeer show, said Dodge Thompson, the chief of exhibitions.

<P>
   The modern age of blockbusters arrived with a sensational show
in 1948. With the museums of war-shattered Germany in ruins and
many of their treasures recovered by the Allies from salt mines and
other caches, the U.S. authorities shipped 202 masterpieces to the
National Gallery for exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Called simply ``Paintings From the Berlin Museums,'' the show,
with its Rembrandts, Vermeers, Titians, Duerers, van Eycks,
Botticellis, Breughels and a Bosch, drew near-riotous crowds. The
intense interest and short run of just 40 days, made for the
unprecedented arithmetic of an average 24,124 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   When the Louvre's Mona Lisa went on view at the National Gallery
in 1963, it drew an average daily attendance of more than 19,200,
for a total of 518,525.
</P>
<P>
   In overall numbers, the Met may hold the modern record, with
more than 1.2 million visitors to its ``Treasures of Tutankhamun''
of 1978 to '79.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bigger blockbusters on the horizon may not really be
blockbusters at all, but permanent installations. The new Gottesman
Hall of Planet Earth opens at the Museum of Natural History on June
12, the first stage of the spherical Rose Center for Earth and
Space to be unveiled early next year, replacing the old
planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Met opened its new Greek Galleries in a soaring
barrel-vaulted space hemmed in since World War II, drawing throngs
of visitors tabulated at more than 10,000 a day, until guards gave
up counting.

   Throughout the century, scientists have had to rely on
maddeningly oblique methods, laden with assumptions, for measuring
the size of the universe. They've had to guess, from purely
theoretical considerations, how bright a star or galaxy really is.
Then from its apparent brightness, dimmed by the journey of the
light through space, they judge its distance.
</P>
<P>
   These interpretations have been so open to debate that the
universe seems to expand and contract like an accordion. With
uncertainty long considered the norm, it was remarkable when
astronomers boldly announced on Tuesday that they had gauged the
distance of a galaxy a full 23.5 million light-years away using a
stunningly direct approach that relied on little more than simple
trigonometry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This measurement is the golden meter stick in the glass
case,'' Morris Aizenman, executive officer of the National Science
Foundation's Division of Astronomical Sciences proclaimed in a news
release. The results came from Dr. James Herrnstein of the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M., and a team of
scientists from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and
other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are already confident that they can measure how fast
galaxies are receding from the primordial big-bang explosion. If
they can more precisely know the distances, they can finally close
in on the long-disputed number called the Hubble constant, the key
to how rapidly the universe is expanding and to calculating its age
and size.
</P>
<P>
   It was a week for dramatic _ and conflicting _ announcements.
The previous Tuesday, astronomers from the Carnegie Observatories
in Pasadena, Calif., made headlines by announcing that using the
orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, they had narrowed the age of the
universe to 12 billion to perhaps 14 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates from competing astronomers, which used to be off a
full 100 percent, were said to have been pared down to a mere 10
percent. In a widely quoted line, one astronomer said that it was
as if scientists, accustomed to arguing over whether the universe
had one foot or two, were now quibbling about a single toe.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the measurement by the Herrnstein team, using the Very
Long Baseline Array, a network of dish antennas that capture
stellar radio waves instead of visible light. If their results hold
up, the Carnegie estimate could be 15 percent (a toe and a half)
too high.
</P>
<P>
   There is still plenty of wiggle room in the calculations.
Determining the universe's age also depends on how much gravity
slows the expansion and how much something called the cosmological
constant speeds it up. But with this splash of cold water, the
earlier euphoria suddenly seemed premature.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1920s, when the astronomer Edwin Hubble began
observing the expansion from the big bang, there has been nothing
very constant about his constant.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hubble's law, the farther a celestial object is
from Earth, the faster it will appear to be receding. Pick an
object in the sky and measure its velocity and distance. Dividing
one by the other gives the Hubble constant _ and with that you have
a grip on the rate at which the galaxies are flying apart. From
there you can work backward, estimating how long ago everything was
compacted into the primordial bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers feel certain that they can directly determine one of
these numbers, the velocity of an object's recession, by its red
shift: The faster something is moving away, the more its light
waves should be stretched toward the red end of the spectrum _ a
phenomenon based on the well-known Doppler effect. It is the other
number, the distance of an object, that causes most of the
consternation.
</P>
<P>
   Since ancient times, astronomers have measured the distance of
nearby planets and stars by using trigonometry. Gauge how much
their positions in the sky seem to shift as one moves from one part
of the Earth to another, or as the Earth moves around the sun. From
this ``parallax'' one can calculate how far away something is.
</P>
<P>
   But estimating distances beyond the range of parallax _ recently
set at a mere few hundred light-years _ has required more
imagination. The Carnegie observations rely on stars called Cepheid
variables, which blink at a rate believed to vary with their
brightness. If two of these beacons are pulsating at the same pace
and one appears dimmer, then it is assumed to be farther away.
</P>
<P>
   But the system is fraught with uncertainty. To confidently
measure absolute as opposed to relative distance, you have to
calibrate the yardstick by directly measuring how far away the
nearest Cepheids are. Astronomers have tried to do this using
parallactic observations by the European Space Agency satellite
Hipparcos. But the measurements are tricky and the data unsure.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other problems. A Cepheid's rhythm may be thrown
off by its metallic content. More guesswork comes in when
astronomers try to judge how much of the dimming of a Cepheid's
light comes not from distance but intervening cosmic dust.
</P>
<P>
   The results from the Very Long Baseline Array cut through these
assumptions, measuring the distance of a galaxy (NGC 4258 in the
constellation Ursa Major) with old-fashioned parallax. By using
computers to coordinate the data from 10 radio telescopes, ranging
from Hawaii across North America to the Virgin Islands, the
astronomers essentially simulated a dish antenna thousands of miles
wide. This let them measure the galaxy's radio wave emissions with
a resolution so fine that it puts even the Hubble telescope to
shame.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers focused on a rotating disc of gas at the
galaxy's core. First they calculated how fast it was spinning by
measuring how much the Doppler effect stretched and squeezed its
radio waves. Then they compared this intrinsic velocity with how
fast the disc appears to spin from Earth. The farther something is,
the more slowly it seems to move _ parallax again. Think of how a
jet plane seems to inch across the sky. Trigonometry then yields
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Though this new method greatly expands the power of parallax, it
still has its limits. The galaxy was measured at 23.5 million
light-years away; the universe is billions of light-years wide.
Reaching farther will still require Cepheids and other indirect
methods. But now there may be a better way to ensure the accuracy
of these yardsticks, putting a more solid foundation under
astronomers' feet.

   ABUJA, Nigeria _ As Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo waited to be
inaugurated as Nigeria's new president a week ago, a man he used to
visit in prison sat a few seats to his right: President Nelson
Mandela of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Africa's two most powerful nations, possibly the
two most respected politicians on the continent, embraced warmly.
Maybe it occurred to them that the pupil seemed to have overtaken
the teacher. It is a thought that has occurred to many in recent
days as Nigeria installed its first elected president in a
generation and South Africa successfully held its second democratic
election.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, after all, once stood as the uncontested leader in
Africa. It was the staunchest backer of liberation movements in
South Africa and other white-ruled countries, and Obasanjo stood as
one of the most vocal critics of apartheid. And yet South Africa
preceded Nigeria into democratic government, holding its first
all-race elections in 1994 even as Nigeria slipped into a ruthless
military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Now here was Mandela traveling to Nigeria just four days before
South Africa's elections on Wednesday, evidently confident of the
stability he leaves behind in his retirement. Contrast that to the
situation of Obasanjo, who recently came out of retirement to lead
his disoriented nation into the shakiest of democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that although Nigeria assisted South Africa
to get rid of apartheid, South Africa breathed the air of democracy
before we did,'' said Larry Agboh, an official in Obasanjo's
People's Democratic Party. ``We were expecting Nigeria, as the most
populous nation in Africa, to lead Africa toward full democracy.
That would have guaranteed Nigeria's position as the true leader on
the continent.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 election in South Africa was a bittersweet moment,
Agboh added, ``sweet in the sense that I was happy that apartheid
was over, and bitter in the sense that here was the junior brother
leading Nigeria, the senior brother, into democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Agboh was inspecting the new National Assembly building here as
Nigeria's newly elected senators and representatives met for the
first time on Thursday. With fixtures still unattached and the
smell of fresh paint in the air, the building suggested a democracy
in the making. The point did not escape visitors who wandered into
a third-floor gallery, pressing their noses against windows that
looked down on the assembly hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were still a military administration, I will not be
allowed beyond the gate,'' said Mohammed Gawuna, 35. ``From this
window, I can peep and see my representatives at work.'' Another
onlooker, Morgan West, 31, added, ``This building is a symbol of
the beginning of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, creating an enduring democracy here will be an
enormous task. The constitution is a month old, handed down by
decree by the outgoing military government. There is no
institutional check on corruption, though Obasanjo took a first
step last week by setting up a panel to investigate contracts
awarded since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing close to a middle class, as the gulf has
widened between an extremely rich minority and an impoverished
majority. A generation of corrupt military rule has eroded popular
trust, as the government of the world's seventh-largest
oil-producer has failed to deliver basics like electricity and
potable water to its 110 million people.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, since Mandela's African National Congress was
elected in 1994, South Africa has adopted one of the most liberal
constitutions in the world, and its legal system has been entirely
reformed. Millions more have clean water now, and even residents of
squatter camps have access to electricity and telephones. And if
last week's election of Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's only candidate to
replace Mandela, is any indication, Mandela's legacy includes a
self-sustaining democracy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the 1970s, it looked as though Nigeria would be the giant
leading postcolonial Africa into democracy. Its coffers flush with
oil money, Nigeria became the leading African opponent of
white-ruled governments in South Africa, Namibia and the former
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria opened its checkbook, leaders of several African
liberation movements operated out of Lagos. Nigeria even had a
civilian government in 1979 until a coup ended it in 1983.
Obasanjo, the military ruler in the late 1970s, pursued efforts to
end apartheid after his retirement. As a member of a Commonwealth
mediation effort, he visited Mandela three times in Pollsmoor
prison outside Cape Town, South Africa, in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Often the only African nation with embassies in Western
capitals, Nigeria came to regard itself as the world's black
superpower. ``Some of us dream of Nigeria being to blacks in the
diaspora what Jerusalem is to Jews in the diaspora,'' Nigeria's
foreign minister, Bolaji Akinyemi, said in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But the country's northern military rulers tightened their grip
in the 1990s. They annulled the results of the presidential
elections on June 12, 1993, which would have given victory to a
southern Yoruba businessman, Moshood K.O. Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   ``June 12 has done us a lot of damage,'' said Anthony Adefuye, a
senator from 1991 to 1993, when the military government briefly
permitted civilians at the state and local levels. ``If June 12 had
been real, we would have democratized before South Africa. In
politics, one slip will take you a hundred steps to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after South Africa's post-apartheid era began, Nigeria fell
under the repressive regime of Gen. Sani Abacha. As investors left
Nigeria, they gravitated to South Africa. In 1995, after the writer
Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged for protesting the use of oil resources,
Nigeria became an international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, leading the nation that many regarded as Africa's new
leader, repeatedly called for an oil boycott of Nigeria. Abacha
retaliated by withdrawing Nigeria's soccer team from the African
Nations Cup, which was held in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But Abacha died suddenly a year ago, and Obasanjo has returned
as Nigeria's leader. ``It is our firm resolve to restore Nigeria
fully to her previous prestigious position in the comity of
nations,'' he said during his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   So Nigeria finds itself under enormous pressure to fulfill the
moment's promise. It is Nigeria's last chance, many here say. But
in the same breath, Nigerians, famous for their fighting spirit,
declare they will soon catch up to and surpass their southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk of African-ness,'' Agboh said, ``Nigeria is 100
percent African, much more than South Africa, which is mixed. The
greatness of Nigeria will be a pride to the whole black race.''

People's Democratic Party. ``We were expecting Nigeria, as the most
populous nation in Africa, to lead Africa toward full democracy.
That would have guaranteed Nigeria's position as the true leader on
the continent.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 election in South Africa was a bittersweet moment,
Agboh added, ``sweet in the sense that I was happy that apartheid
was over, and bitter in the sense that here was the junior brother
leading Nigeria, the senior brother, into democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Agboh was inspecting the new National Assembly building here as
Nigeria's newly elected senators and representatives met for the
first time on Thursday. With fixtures still unattached and the
smell of fresh paint in the air, the building suggested a democracy
in the making. The point did not escape visitors who wandered into
a third-floor gallery, pressing their noses against windows that
looked down on the assembly hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were still a military administration, I will not be
allowed beyond the gate,'' said Mohammed Gawuna, 35. ``From this
window, I can peep and see my representatives at work.'' Another
onlooker, Morgan West, 31, added, ``This building is a symbol of
the beginning of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, creating an enduring democracy here will be an
enormous task. The constitution is a month old, handed down by
decree by the outgoing military government. There is no
institutional check on corruption, though Obasanjo took a first
step last week by setting up a panel to investigate contracts
awarded since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing close to a middle class, as the gulf has
widened between an extremely rich minority and an impoverished
majority. A generation of corrupt military rule has eroded popular
trust, as the government of the world's seventh-largest
oil-producer has failed to deliver basics like electricity and
potable water to its 110 million people.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, since Mandela's African National Congress was
elected in 1994, South Africa has adopted one of the most liberal
constitutions in the world, and its legal system has been entirely
reformed. Millions more have clean water now, and even residents of
squatter camps have access to electricity and telephones. And if
last week's election of Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's only candidate to
replace Mandela, is any indication, Mandela's legacy includes a
self-sustaining democracy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the 1970s, it looked as though Nigeria would be the giant
leading postcolonial Africa into democracy. Its coffers flush with
oil money, Nigeria became the leading African opponent of
white-ruled governments in South Africa, Namibia and the former
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria opened its checkbook, leaders of several African
liberation movements operated out of Lagos. Nigeria even had a
civilian government in 1979 until a coup ended it in 1983.
Obasanjo, the military ruler in the late 1970s, pursued efforts to
end apartheid after his retirement. As a member of a Commonwealth
mediation effort, he visited Mandela three times in Pollsmoor
prison outside Cape Town, South Africa, in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Often the only African nation with embassies in Western
capitals, Nigeria came to regard itself as the world's black
superpower. ``Some of us dream of Nigeria being to blacks in the
diaspora what Jerusalem is to Jews in the diaspora,'' Nigeria's
foreign minister, Bolaji Akinyemi, said in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But the country's northern military rulers tightened their grip
in the 1990s. They annulled the results of the presidential
elections on June 12, 1993, which would have given victory to a
southern Yoruba businessman, Moshood K.O. Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   ``June 12 has done us a lot of damage,'' said Anthony Adefuye, a
senator from 1991 to 1993, when the military government briefly
permitted civilians at the state and local levels. ``If June 12 had
been real, we would have democratized before South Africa. In
politics, one slip will take you a hundred steps to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after South Africa's post-apartheid era began, Nigeria fell
under the repressive regime of Gen. Sani Abacha. As investors left
Nigeria, they gravitated to South Africa. In 1995, after the writer
Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged for protesting the use of oil resources,
Nigeria became an international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, leading the nation that many regarded as Africa's new
leader, repeatedly called for an oil boycott of Nigeria. Abacha
retaliated by withdrawing Nigeria's soccer team from the African
Nations Cup, which was held in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But Abacha died suddenly a year ago, and Obasanjo has returned
as Nigeria's leader. ``It is our firm resolve to restore Nigeria
fully to her previous prestigious position in the comity of
nations,'' he said during his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   So Nigeria finds itself under enormous pressure to fulfill the
moment's promise. It is Nigeria's last chance, many here say. But
in the same breath, Nigerians, famous for their fighting spirit,
declare they will soon catch up to and surpass their southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk of African-ness,'' Agboh said, ``Nigeria is 100
percent African, much more than South Africa, which is mixed. The
greatness of Nigeria will be a pride to the whole black race.''

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ With drums, whistles and war whoops, with
dancers, tumblers and female impersonators, Indonesians have
grasped the first great truth about free elections: They can be
lots of fun.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another truth as well. One election does not make a
country a democracy. Institutions, traditions and social cohesion
do. So the big question on the eve of Indonesia's first free
election in 44 years is whether it will set the world's
fourth-most-populous nation on the path toward democratic stability
or toward new turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   One foreign election expert wishes, in fact, that the
parliamentary election scheduled for tomorrow could be a trial run.
People are learning about democracy here by trial and error, the
expert said, and the stakes are far too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year ago, Indonesians were political naifs,'' said the
expert, a foreign diplomat. ``Now that picture is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Suharto was forced to resign the presidency in May 1998,
Indonesia has been learning fast, moving from street demonstrations
to party organizing, from utopian philosophizing to the beginnings
of coalition building. Still, nobody knows what patterns the voting
will take or how this nation of more than 200 million jostling and
often feuding people will manage the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the people will vote freely, or perhaps they will
continue to answer to the village headman, as they have for
generations. Maybe the losers will accept the outcome or maybe the
results will trigger a new wave of demonstrations, followed by
riots and the use of military force.
</P>
<P>
   How effectively will a new government begin the building of
democratic institutions? Will it respond to the public demand for
an end to what is known as KKN _ the Indonesian initials for
corruption, collusion and nepotism?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a transition to democracy as inevitable, despite
the holding of elections,'' said David Timberman, an American
electoral expert. ``There is nothing inexorable about this process.
Its outcomes depend a lot on the leadership and behavior of the new
political parties in Parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard work still lies ahead, said Jusuf Wanandi, the head of
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, an independent
policy institute. ``I am much more optimistic about the election
than about what comes after,'' he said. ``I am dreading the
difficulties we will have in creating a real coalition government _
animosities, jealousies, prima donnas.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, worst-case scenarios have so far not been realized,
beginning with the largely peaceful and raucously enthusiastic
three-week election campaign that is now ending.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts warn that the campaign revelers may be setting
themselves up for harsh disappointments when the results come in.
But Indonesia has shown a great deal more political maturity in the
past year than many people _ notably Suharto _ gave them credit
for.
</P>
<P>
   Just to get as far as this has been an extraordinary
achievement. Indonesia had no revolution. It did not overturn its
government, only the man at the top. It did not change its
constitution or its basic laws, reform its institutions or bring
any but a few low-ranking soldiers to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic reform in Indonesia, so far, floats on air. Yet it is
undeniably a force in play, a clear expression of popular will. The
force appears to have begun building even when Suharto was in
power, and to have burst forth since he departed.
</P>
<P>
   A newly free press has emerged, even as the politically
intrusive military has been humbled and the government has shown a
new responsiveness to public opinion. The elections themselves,
created by Suharto's holdover Parliament, are the results of this
reformist pressure, which the Suharto men who still run Indonesia
have been unable to ignore, political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The country has avoided calamity over the past year, remaining
far more stable than many had expected. A surge of pre-election
violence was widely predicted, but it did not materialize except
for clashes in some already unstable areas. There has been no wave
of religious warfare. Student demonstrators have withdrawn from the
streets to participate in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Though the economy has not recovered yet from a battering during
East Asia's financial crisis a year ago, the harvest has been good
and there have been no food riots; the currency has stabilized at
double its lowest rate 18 months ago and there is a glimmer of hope
for better times.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia still lacks the solid middle class that would form
the foundation of a thoroughgoing democracy, said Juwono Sudarsono,
the minister of education and a leading political analyst. Politics
remains a battleground between haves and have-nots and between
factions and ethnic groups, rather than a true discourse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go,'' Juwono said, noting that
Indonesia's middle class is far more shallow than those of the
emerging democracies of Thailand, South Korea or the Philippines.
``It could be 25 years before we can achieve their level of 30
percent of the population being middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   The first free election in a newly independent Indonesia was
also its last, in 1955. Shortly afterward, the country's founding
president, Sukarno, decreed that parliamentary democracy was not
working and instituted in its place an authoritarian model he
called ``guided democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was responding to the political realities of the day but also
to the popular mood, which demanded firm leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that there is a cyclical aspect to this whole
thing, that authoritarianism and democracy are popular at different
times and that we are now in a very anti-authoritarian point in the
cycle,'' said Herbert Feith, an Australian political scientist who
was here during the 1955 election.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, new democratic institutions are not yet in place.
But he said the mood of the nation _ the public discourse _ can be
a powerful force in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Suharto crowd lost control of the public discourse, and
the discourse has a life of its own,'' Feith said. Whatever
happens, he suggested, the tide of democratic reform in Indonesia
is not likely to be easily reversed.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Summer is blockbuster season, from the multiplex to
the august halls of culture. That's one way to explain a big van
Gogh show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Or ``Impressionists in
Winter,'' the first exhibition to assemble the snowscapes of Monet,
Renoir, Gauguin and others, served up by the Brooklyn Museum of Art
in the city's hottest months.
</P>
<P>
   Museums may shun comparisons with Hollywood but they, too,
strive for that explosion of interest (named for a super-powerful
World War II bomb) that spells ``blockbuster,'' filling the
coffers, swelling the membership rolls and exciting envy at fellow
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums have discovered advertising,'' said David Ross,
director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and former
director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. ``You can advertise
garbage and make millions. Imagine if you advertise something with
real value.''
</P>
<P>
   With Americans flocking to art museums in record numbers, such
hits _ shows that seize you by the lapels and bellow, ``What! You
haven't lined up for `The Treasury of Saint Francis of Assisi'
yet?'' _ lend a gloss and urgency to art, science and history,
while posing questions about commercialism and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows in the museum world arched last December when Ben
Hartley, director of communications and sponsorship for the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, said, ``We are in the
entertainment business and competing against other forms of
entertainment out there.'' The Guggenheim reached blockbuster
nirvana with its show on motorcycles, which drew half a million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But blockbusters have their defenders. ``These great moments of
acute interest create exceptional teaching opportunities,'' said
Ellen Futter, director of the Museum of Natural History, whose show
``Epidemic!'' on infectious diseases, has drawn more than 150,000
visitors since Feb. 27. ``They create a gateway to learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum calendars are replete with big exhibitions of plainly
blockbuster ambitions _ shows on Ingres' portraiture, the age of
the Pyramids, new archaeological finds from China and the
ever-popular impressionists, truly the museum world's most reliable
moneymakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Met weighed in last month with ``Cezanne to van Gogh,''
featuring the renowned collection of van Gogh's physician, Dr.
Paul-Ferdinand Gachet. ``I don't sit around thinking what will
bring in crowds,'' said Philippe de Montebello, who after two
decades as director was recently elevated to chief executive
officer as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum of Art days later opened its
``Impressionists in Winter,'' lauded by the museum's director,
Arnold Lehman, as ``literally the coolest show.''
</P>
<P>
   A show last year at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, ``Monet
in the 20th Century,'' became the most popular in the country in
1998, drawing nearly 566,000 visitors. The recent Jackson Pollock
show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York also proved a bonanza,
drawing nearly 330,000 visitors, a striking number, if still short
of the 940,000 _ more than 8,000 a day _ who swamped the museum's
Matisse show of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The John Singer Sargent show, which closed last week at the
National Gallery in Washington, drew about 425,000 visitors, or
nearly 4,500 a day, catapulting it into the realm of the smash 1995
Vermeer show, said Dodge Thompson, the chief of exhibitions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The modern age of blockbusters arrived with a sensational show
in 1948. With the museums of war-shattered Germany in ruins and
many of their treasures recovered by the Allies from salt mines and
other caches, the U.S. authorities shipped 202 masterpieces to the
National Gallery for exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Called simply ``Paintings From the Berlin Museums,'' the show,
with its Rembrandts, Vermeers, Titians, Duerers, van Eycks,
Botticellis, Breughels and a Bosch, drew near-riotous crowds. The
intense interest and short run of just 40 days, made for the
unprecedented arithmetic of an average 24,124 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   When the Louvre's Mona Lisa went on view at the National Gallery
in 1963, it drew an average daily attendance of more than 19,200,
for a total of 518,525.
</P>
<P>
   In overall numbers, the Met may hold the modern record, with
more than 1.2 million visitors to its ``Treasures of Tutankhamun''
of 1978 to '79.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bigger blockbusters on the horizon may not really be
blockbusters at all, but permanent installations. The new Gottesman
Hall of Planet Earth opens at the Museum of Natural History on June
12, the first stage of the spherical Rose Center for Earth and
Space to be unveiled early next year, replacing the old
planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Met opened its new Greek Galleries in a soaring
barrel-vaulted space hemmed in since World War II, drawing throngs
of visitors tabulated at more than 10,000 a day, until guards gave
up counting.

   NEW YORK _ Summer is blockbuster season, from the multiplex to
the august halls of culture. That's one way to explain a big van
Gogh show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Or ``Impressionists in
Winter,'' the first exhibition to assemble the snowscapes of Monet,
Renoir, Gauguin and others, served up by the Brooklyn Museum of Art
in the city's hottest months.
</P>
<P>
   Museums may shun comparisons with Hollywood but they, too,
strive for that explosion of interest (named for a super-powerful
World War II bomb) that spells ``blockbuster,'' filling the
coffers, swelling the membership rolls and exciting envy at fellow
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums have discovered advertising,'' said David Ross,
director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and former
director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. ``You can advertise
garbage and make millions. Imagine if you advertise something with
real value.''
</P>
<P>
   With Americans flocking to art museums in record numbers, such
hits _ shows that seize you by the lapels and bellow, ``What! You
haven't lined up for `The Treasury of Saint Francis of Assisi'
yet?'' _ lend a gloss and urgency to art, science and history,
while posing questions about commercialism and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows in the museum world arched last December when Ben
Hartley, director of communications and sponsorship for the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, said, ``We are in the
entertainment business and competing against other forms of
entertainment out there.'' The Guggenheim reached blockbuster
nirvana with its show on motorcycles, which drew half a million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But blockbusters have their defenders. ``These great moments of
acute interest create exceptional teaching opportunities,'' said
Ellen Futter, director of the Museum of Natural History, whose show
``Epidemic!'' on infectious diseases, has drawn more than 150,000
visitors since Feb. 27. ``They create a gateway to learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum calendars are replete with big exhibitions of plainly
blockbuster ambitions _ shows on Ingres' portraiture, the age of
the Pyramids, new archaeological finds from China and the
ever-popular impressionists, truly the museum world's most reliable
moneymakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Met weighed in last month with ``Cezanne to van Gogh,''
featuring the renowned collection of van Gogh's physician, Dr.
Paul-Ferdinand Gachet. ``I don't sit around thinking what will
bring in crowds,'' said Philippe de Montebello, who after two
decades as director was recently elevated to chief executive
officer as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum of Art days later opened its
``Impressionists in Winter,'' lauded by the museum's director,
Arnold Lehman, as ``literally the coolest show.''
</P>
<P>
   A show last year at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, ``Monet
in the 20th Century,'' became the most popular in the country in
1998, drawing nearly 566,000 visitors. The recent Jackson Pollock
show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York also proved a bonanza,
drawing nearly 330,000 visitors, a striking number, if still short
of the 940,000 _ more than 8,000 a day _ who swamped the museum's
Matisse show of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The John Singer Sargent show, which closed last week at the
National Gallery in Washington, drew about 425,000 visitors, or
nearly 4,500 a day, catapulting it into the realm of the smash 1995
Vermeer show, said Dodge Thompson, the chief of exhibitions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The modern age of blockbusters arrived with a sensational show
in 1948. With the museums of war-shattered Germany in ruins and
many of their treasures recovered by the Allies from salt mines and
other caches, the U.S. authorities shipped 202 masterpieces to the
National Gallery for exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Called simply ``Paintings From the Berlin Museums,'' the show,
with its Rembrandts, Vermeers, Titians, Duerers, van Eycks,
Botticellis, Breughels and a Bosch, drew near-riotous crowds. The
intense interest and short run of just 40 days, made for the
unprecedented arithmetic of an average 24,124 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   When the Louvre's Mona Lisa went on view at the National Gallery
in 1963, it drew an average daily attendance of more than 19,200,
for a total of 518,525.
</P>
<P>
   In overall numbers, the Met may hold the modern record, with
more than 1.2 million visitors to its ``Treasures of Tutankhamun''
of 1978 to '79.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bigger blockbusters on the horizon may not really be
blockbusters at all, but permanent installations. The new Gottesman
Hall of Planet Earth opens at the Museum of Natural History on June
12, the first stage of the spherical Rose Center for Earth and
Space to be unveiled early next year, replacing the old
planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Met opened its new Greek Galleries in a soaring
barrel-vaulted space hemmed in since World War II, drawing throngs
of visitors tabulated at more than 10,000 a day, until guards gave
up counting.

   KOSOVO-RECONSTRUCT (Undated) _ Special Report: Waging War on the
Serbs: Old Problem, New Lesson: If the peace deal holds up, the
curious war comes out this way: The richest, best-armed military
alliance in history won, but at a savage cost to the people who
were supposed to be protected. A wily Balkan dictator lost, but he
stays on in his shrinking Yugoslavia. And just possibly a new
lesson in war has been learned: Thanks to the wonders of high-tech
weaponry, an overwhelmingly powerful alliance can crush a small
nation's aggressive will without having to risk its own soldiers,
if it is willing to spend enough money and if it can tolerate
mistakes that kill innocent civilians. By Blaine Harden.

Medical College opened a clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, it
provides the best AIDS treatment available in a country on the
front lines of the epidemic. But that is a lower standard of care

order, suggested Slobodanka Bogic, as she stood in her still

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Before the Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah
Ocalan went on trial last Monday, Turkish officials decided to
ensure that the official press would choose its words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, who is known as Apo, is charged with treason in
connection with his role in organizing and waging the long-running
war between Kurds who inhabit the southeastern part of Turkey and
the Turkish government. Moreover, the Kurdish issue is among the
most sensitive in the country.
</P>
<P>
   So the Interior Ministry issued a directive listing terms that
must not be used when discussing Ocalan, his movement or Kurds in
general. It is binding on reporters and commentators for the
Anatolia news agency, the state-run TRT radio and television
network, and public affairs officers at all government agencies,
though not on reporters for privately owned press outlets or on
foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   In the government's view, violence in Kurdish provinces is
simply terror sponsored from abroad, mainly by Iraq, Syria and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Officials reject the idea that it is a war, that the insurgent
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has any popular base, or that
there is any political aspect to the fighting. They often insist
there is no ``Kurdish problem'' in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Kurdistan Workers Party, however, say that
what has been under way in southeastern Turkey since 1984 is a war
to free Kurds from oppression. The Kurds have been blocked from all
forms of legal protest, they assert, and have taken up arms as a
last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreigners agree, in whole or in part. Turkey's treatment
of its more than 10 million Kurds has been widely criticized
abroad, and has come under new scrutiny during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry directive said that the government needs
to adopt a ``unity of terminology'' in presenting its case to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking recent developments into consideration,'' it said, ``we
do not want to leave room for future discussions or ill-intentioned
debates stemming from terms that have been used.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the unacceptable terms, followed by what the
government says are correct ones that should be used in their

   CAIRO, Egypt _ Tehran, Iran, is abuzz again, divided now over
whether the United States really is still the Great Satan. And as
usual, the ferocity of Iran's internal power struggles makes it
hard to know what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the confusion seems to run two ways. This
Iranian row seems to have been prompted by American mixed signals _
tantalizing but ambiguous all the same _ about whether the United
States is ready to go easier on Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are in the Middle East, you may have missed all this;
just about everywhere else, the crisis in Kosovo has exhausted
people's attention. So here's a quick primer on the latest in
U.S.-Iranian relations _ the winks, nods and backhanded slaps that
may amount to a lot or to absolutely nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   First, on April 12, President Clinton told a White House
audience that Iran had been subjected to ``quite a lot of abuse''
over the years; it was important to tell people, he said, ``Look,
you have a right to be angry.'' In Iran, ears perked up,
particularly among political moderates. Was this a first step
toward a long-sought U.S. apology?
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, a State Department official showed a colder
hand. Certainly, said Martin Indyk, an assistant secretary of
state, the United States wants dialogue with Iran, but first on the
agenda would be those old subjects that make Iranians cringe:
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Aha, Iranian
conservatives said. A good-guy-bad-guy routine, nothing more than
American mischief!
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April came a flurry of paper from the U.S.
government. One rule eased the way for Iranian scholars to travel
to the United States, another softened sanctions half a notch by
allowing food and medicine to be sold to Iran. Then came a State
Department report that again identified Iran as a sponsor of
terrorism _ but not, as in the past, as the world's leader in that
field.
</P>
<P>
   It all amounted to nothing more than a ``diplomatic smile,''
complained Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharazzi. A better
summation might have been that it simply left just about everyone
more confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Americans are crooks,'' Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, the
head of Iran's judiciary, warned in one Friday sermon as he sounded
the conservative line. ``Why are some people so naive as to believe
in them?''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the moderate Iran Daily said it saw the beginning
of ``a new chapter'' and declared: ``It is high time to ensure
practical steps for normal ties.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that Iran's president, Mohammed Khatami, is open
to warmer ties with the United States. But he remains hemmed in by
Iran's conservatives, led by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei. As recently as mid-May, a delegation of senior clerics
appointed by Khamenei presented Khatami with a petition saying that
the time was not right for Iranian-U.S. relations to be restored.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since those ties were broken off after the Iranian
revolution of 1979, conservatives have tried to squelch talk of a
detente. They have reminded just about anyone who would listen that
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic,
once likened Iranian-U.S. relations to those between sheep and
wolf.
</P>
<P>
   But for a year and a half now, Khatami's moderate government and
the Clinton administration have been cautiously swapping hints of a
willingness to explore moving toward warmer ties. And some
Iranians, eager for improved trade, have begun to read into the
U.S. overtures a reason for rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States may still be a wolf, but Iran has turned
into a lion,'' Mehdi Karrubi, a longtime anti-Western firebrand who
has become a Khatami ally, declared last month, neatly suggesting
that Khomeini's warnings belonged to a distant era.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Iran's government has ruled out direct talks until
Washington redresses past wrongs, presumably by lifting economic
sanctions and unfreezing millions of dollars of Iranian assets held
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, for its part, has said that it is ready to talk _
but that there can be no revival of economic ties until Iran takes
the concrete steps that Indyk outlined in his April 22 speech:
halting support for terrorism, abandoning opposition to Middle East
peace and giving up efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, that leaves the two countries at
loggerheads, despite the feelers each has sent since January 1998,
when Khatami, in a CNN interview, called for a ``dialogue of
civilizations'' and in effect apologized for the November 1979
takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every subtle signal is carefully digested, and Clinton's
remarks in April were hailed by moderate Iranian newspapers and
some politicians as at least a first step toward an American
apology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president's statement, which surprised even his foreign
policy advisers, included this sentence: ``I think sometimes it's
quite important to tell people, `Look, you have a right to be angry
at something my country, or my culture, or others that are
generally allied with us today, did to you 50 or 60 or 100 or 150
years ago.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, provincial governors welcomed the words as Clinton's
``acceptance that the demands of the Iranian people are just.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's government, on the other hand, has had to be more
circumspect; its continuing war with the powerful conservative bloc
has left Khatami wary of being portrayed as bowing to the United
States. In its official statements, Iran has gone so far as to say
only that the United States might be showing ``greater realism.''
</P>
<P>
   And certainly the hesitation also runs both ways. No matter how
the Iranians or analysts of the Iranian-U.S. relationship have
tried to interpret this murky dialogue, administration spokesmen
keep insisting that U.S. policy has not changed.

 &HT;    Remembering the horrors, heroism of D-Day
 &HT;    By Joanne Huist Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Steak and eggs for breakfast were not a good sign
to Franklin Twp. resident Virgil Akers, a member of the 276-member
crew of the USS Gherardi on June 6, 1944, D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   Anchored in the English Channel with World War II booming around
them, the crew of the Navy destroyer recognized the meal as
standard fare issued by their skipper, Commander Neal R. Curtin,
before a call to battle stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think I was smart enough to realize the danger
to the fullest,'' Akers, now 74, said, recalling what he was doing
55 years ago today.
</P>
<P>
   Torpedoman Akers, then just 19, rolled out of his cot below
decks to an unseasonably cold morning. The seaman dressed quickly
in Navy dungarees, a blue denim shirt and pants.
</P>
<P>
   At 5'8'' and 130 pounds, Akers' slight frame shivered in the
pre-dawn chill. From a locker the size of a stereo speaker he
pulled out foul-weather gear, a one-piece jumpsuit that zipped up
the front.
</P>
<P>
   The young sailor knew he'd need the heavy suit on deck for
warmth. He also knew the weighted material would soak up the
freezing waters of the Atlantic if his ship took a hit and he
landed in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To Allied servicemen who faced German artillery and aircraft at
that early summer morning, it was the long-anticipated H-Hour, a
first step toward the liberation of France and overthrowing
Hitler's Germany.
</P>
<P>
   American casualties during the 15-day period that began with
D-Day tallied more than 24,000 with at least 3,082 killed, 13,121
wounded, and 7,959 missing, according to The D-Day Encyclopedia,
edited by David G. Chandler, of the Royal Military Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, about 6.3 million World War II
veterans like Akers still live to share their memories of the
horror and heroism of D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another 10 years, many of the veterans who fought on D-Day
will be gone, dead,'' Akers said. ``Then people will have to learn
about the war from history books.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers survived the invasion to fight other battles, but the
drone of the airplanes and the pounding of the D-Day guns at
Normandy still echo through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of the impending invasion of France started to circulate
around the fleet in April 1944, Akers said, while the USS Gherardi
was anchored at Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned early on, even from boot camp, that Americans were
fighting for one reason. That reason was to end the war,'' Akers
said. ``Hitler, to me, was like a bug that needed to be stepped on.
Our troops ran him out of Africa, out of Sicily. I'm thinking, `Why
doesn't this guy just give up.'''
</P>
<P>
   That spring, the USS Gherardi sailed for Great Britain to mass
with an armada that grew to nearly 5,000 vessels in two months.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of June 6, all soldiers, sailors and airmen in
the Allied Expeditionary Force received word from the Allied
Supreme Commander, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, that there would be
no more waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your task will not be an easy one,'' Eisenhower said in a
letter to the troops. ``Your enemy is well trained, well equipped
and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.''
</P>
<P>
   The USS Gherardi, with a gun range of about nine miles, took up
station that day about a 1,000 yards off the beachhead at a site
known by the code name ``Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was bad, the sea was rough. I feared for the
people on the beach. I thought to myself, `I'm sitting high and dry
here, but a lot of those solders are going to die,''' Akers said.
</P>
<P>
   Akers was given a pair of binoculars and sent to a landing above
the main deck to act as a lookout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw soldiers with heavy packs jump into deep water and never
come up. They never made it to land. I saw bodies float by in the
water,'' Akers said. ``Men would run side by side up the beach,
then suddenly one would just drop, fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Each shot from the four-gun destroyer, ``rattled your teeth,''
Akers said. With each shot, a 50-foot plume of smoke and fire
jumped from the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first heard the sound of guns around 6:30 a.m. We fired
every shell we had by 2 p.m.,'' Akers said. ``We had nothing left
to fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The USS Gherardi returned back to England for more munitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked all night restocking and headed right back,'' Akers
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the return trip, a dogfight between a German Focke Wulf F190,
a single-seater fighter, and a British Spitfire erupted over the
English Channel. The outcome of the fight didn't bode well for the
Allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 30 miles ahead of us the two planes were duking it
out,'' Akers said. ``The Spitfire burst into flames and the pilot
baled out. We were able to pick him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting was heavy for three days along the 50-mile stretch of
Normandy. During that period, the USS Gherardi protected a
half-mile of beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the German guns got close and we had shell bursts in the
water near us, our skipper would go forward, then reverse to throw
their gunners off,'' Akers said.
</P>
<P>
   Every six hours came a warm respite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every six hours the ship's cook would bring around a pot of
vegetable soup, then coffee,'' Akers said. ``Before the call to
battle stations, the skipper had opened up the ship's stores and
had all the candy bars and gum distributed to the crew. I guess he
figured if we got dumped in the ocean, at least we'd have our candy
bars.''
</P>
<P>
   After 72 hours, the crew of the USS Gherardi stood down from
battle stations without a causality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joined the Navy at 17 because I figured I'd have a better
chance to survive if I got on a ship,'' Akers said. ``After D-Day,
I knew I had made the right decision. If not for that decision to
enter the service young, I might have had to claw my way up that
beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Akers said steak and eggs will always remind him of his
times on the destroyer, the retired seaman still enjoys the
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Let's have at 'em and not wonder about what lies
ahead.'''

 &HT;    Georgia school chief bans informal contact with newspaper
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia Department of Education may be doing great
things to help schools, but the experts there are no longer allowed
to talk about it with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution under a new
policy.
</P>
<P>
   State School Superintendent Linda Schrenko, angered by an
editorial, has banned all but formal, written contact between her
department and the newspaper, according to her executive assistant,
Ed Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   That's unfortunate for taxpayers, especially now that a state
commission is beginning to look at Georgia education from top to
bottom, said Tim Callahan, a spokesman for the teacher group
Professional Association of Georgia Educators and a former
spokesman for Florida's commissioner of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me that it's a real bad time for the Department of
Education to unilaterally single out one specific newspaper, the
largest newspaper in the state, and decide they're not going to do
business,'' said Callahan. ``It isn't the way a public agency does
business in the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Joselyn Butler, spokeswoman for Gov. Roy Barnes, said Friday,
``In this office, we go out of our way to cooperate and not require
reporters to jump through unnecessary hoops to get information. We
feel that other agencies and elected officials should make it
easier and not harder.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Floyd, department employees are to have no further
contact with any person representing the Journal-Constitution or
any function sponsored by the newspaper. ``Any contact with the
department initiated by the AJC must be submitted to the state
superintendent of school's office by means of a written Open
Records Request,'' he said in a telephone message.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Floyd said that a May 5 Atlanta Constitution
editorial, calling some of Schrenko's proposals for school safety
``goofy,'' was the last straw, but that her mistrust of the
newspaper goes back many years, involves several reporters and
includes more than one failed effort to work out an understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Floyd's repeated insistence that the new policy came
from Schrenko, the superintendent has twice denied she had such a
policy, first in a May 24 letter to the newspaper's managing
editor, John Walter, and then in a conversation with Atlanta
Journal editorial page editor Jim Wooten.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a letter if she could explain the discrepancy between
the no-contact policy that Floyd announced four weeks ago and her
own denials of having such a policy, Schrenko wrote: ``My (May 24)
letter still stands. Therefore, no, I can't (explain the
discrepancy).''
</P>
<P>
   The department, in response to two Open Records requests, showed
no written documentation of the policy or of discussion leading up
to it. Since Floyd announced the policy, at least three AJC
reporters, seeking routine information, were not allowed to talk to
the department employee they sought, but told to submit Open
Records requests. Another reporter asking how many schools in the
state use the state's reading program, Reading First, had no
trouble getting a quick answer and was able to get a comment from
the spokesman about the department's position on an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has been further complicated by the fact that
three press officers have been fired, quit or transferred this
year. The position is now empty. Floyd, who was Schrenko's pastor
at Kiokee Baptist Church in Columbia County, and since January has
worked for Schrenko at $80,189, said all contact with the newspaper
should go through him, until a spokesperson is found by July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the unwritten policy spread unevenly, but legal counsel
Melanie Stockwell said she had told some employees about it.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd reiterated several times that Schrenko initiated the
policy of ending all but formal, written contacts between the
department and the Journal-Constitution, although exceptions have
been made for Atlanta Journal editorial writers the DOE considers
sympathetic to Schrenko.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Shumake, Schrenko's deputy during her first six months
in office in 1995, said gagging the department's voice is the
opposite of the advice that he gives to local superintendents and
school leaders. ``We know that we will get across a better message,
a clearer message and a more accurate message if we convey
information to the public and the press,'' said Shumake, who has
worked for the department off and on since 1965 and says he
continues to work well with Schrenko.
</P>
<P>
   Shumake recently wrote in his newsletter on state education,
``Comments On Education,'' that Schrenko is better than her image
in the press; that she understands education, teaching and
learning. ``She is either getting very poor advice, or she is
ignoring very good advice from her staff and P.R. advisors.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the new policy terrible public relations, it also
raises serious constitutional questions, said David Hudson, lawyer
for the Georgia Press Association. First, he said, it would be
illegal for Schrenko to discipline anyone in her department for
violating such a policy, because to do so would violate their free
speech rights. Second, Hudson said, if the department allows its
employees to talk to other media outlets, then it is violating the
equal-protection rights of the Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're spending taxpayers' dollars, you have a threshold
obligation to talk to the press,'' said Callahan, of PAGE. ``You
are seeking public support for your policies. How better to reach
the public than through the state's largest newspaper?''

 &HT;    Thousands answer Graham's call to accept Christ
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ ``Jesus is knocking at your heart's door. This is
God's moment. Let's don't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Graham made a 45-minute argument for salvation, and on the
first night of his crusade here, more than 2,700 people took him up
on the offer.
</P>
<P>
   It's an invitation the 81-year-old evangelist will offer for a
final time here tonight, in a well-orchestrated worship service
that has drawn crowds of up to 50,000 people each night.
</P>
<P>
   The climax of each evening has been the ``altar call,'' when the
faithful are invited to accept Christ or rededicate themselves to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Each night, as a 4,000-voice choir softly sings ``Just As I
Am,'' they move toward the light that shines on the field level of
the RCA Dome. Some people cry softly. Others clutch hands and close
their eyes in prayer. It's a filled-to-capacity football stadium,
but as calm and quiet as a cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Graham speaks to them as if they are in the intimacy of a
confessional. Together, they pray ``The Sinner's Prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   He asks them to do four things: read the Bible every day; pray
``all the time;'' witness for Christ, and ``bring people here
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham leaves the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Then with an efficiency that is a hallmark of a Graham crusade,
the salvation process begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inquirers'' are matched up with one of 6,000 trained
counselors who lead them through a step-by-step process. Men are
matched with men, women with women; child counselors work with
their peers. Counselor-interpreters in languages from Spanish to
Mandarin hold up signs so that non-English-speaking people can be
accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   Introductions are made, there are hugs and handshakes, and the
counselors read over ``decision cards'' with their inquirers.
``Have you come forward to personally accept Jesus Christ as your
Lord and Savior?'' they ask.
</P>
<P>
   All over the floor of the Dome, people are chanting these words,
huddled head-to-head, sitting cross-legged on the floor, or in
wheechairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pray with me,'' they say. ``Proclaim Christ as your savior.''
</P>
<P>
   Inquirers fill out information cards, listing name, address,
phone number and church affiliation, if any. Then, they date the
cards. ``You know what date this is?'' Scott Davis, a counselor
from Dayton, asks a white-haired man, shaking his hand. ``This is
your birthday!''
</P>
<P>
   Inquirers also receive a book: ``Living in Christ: Beginning
Your Walk,'' and a cassette tape that is the beginning of a Bible
study course.
</P>
<P>
   Davis will work as a counselor three out of four nights of this
crusade. With each inquirer, the process ``takes as long as it
takes,'' he says _ but usually about a half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Each night, the information cards are sent to another corps of
volunteers, who, before the night is over, will have matched up
inquirers who have no church affiliation with a church in their
hometown. If they request a Baptist church, that's what they get.
But the volunteers have assembled a list of more than 600 churches,
of all denominations, in central Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a denominational thing. It's a God thing,'' Davis
says.
</P>
<P>
   In the days to follow, counselors will check in by phone with
their inquirers.
</P>
<P>
   How many will keep their newfound commitment to Christ? ``A lot
of people don't make it,''Graham admits. ``If 25 percent remain
active for Christ five years from now, I would be very happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real follow-up agent is the Holy Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   After the crusade, as the crowd files out into the balmy night,
heat lightning lights up the sky. A bearded young man passes out a
paper that urges readers to ``Ban the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, the bells of St. John's Catholic Church chime
sweetly.

 &HT;    Dayton delegation heads to Bosnia to reaffirm peace talks
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As NATO bombs started falling over Yugoslavia in
March, a group of Dayton-area politicians, artists and business
officials took a second look at a goodwill trip planned for
neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Was it worthwhile to visit a country still rebuilding after its
own war and facing an uncertain summer as its heavily militarized
neighbor, Yugoslavia, is pounded in an escalating war with NATO
forces?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, from Sarajevans and from state department officials,
was yes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bosnians of several ethnic stripes, their country
is trying to get on with the business of peace, even amid the
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after a brutal ethnic war divided the nation and
killed thousands, Bosnia-Herzegovina and its formerly besieged
capital, Sarajevo, are where people are seeking refuge from the
fighting in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And since Dayton's name is attached to the 1995 peace accord
that ended the warfare in Bosnia, some of the Dayton delegation
still saw symbolic value in a peace mission.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Mayor Mike Turner said Bosnian peace negotiator Richard
Holbrooke called him to urge the group to go when the Dayton group
was considering canceling the trip.
</P>
<P>
   So on Friday, a 13-member Dayton group left for an 11-day trip
to Augsburg, Germany, Bosnia and Croatia. They will sign a Sister
City pact between Dayton and Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention is to formalize the relationship between Dayton,
Bosnia and Sarajevo,'' said Turner, who is representing the Dayton
in the delegation. ``We wanted to make certain Dayton was not just
a geographical spot where the talks occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Cementing a natural connection
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the trip began last November, when the ethnic conflict
in Kosovo was still mainly an internal Yugoslavian affair.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the Dayton delegation included several city
commissioners, spouses and a wide range of area leaders. The group
pared down over concerns about the NATO offensive, which has bombed
sites in Yugoslavia 60 miles from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia also is not without tension. The U.S. State Department
has a standing travel advisory for Bosnia that warns of ``risks
from occasional localized political violence, land mines,
unexploded ordnance and carjacking.''
</P>
<P>
   David Neer, an assistant to the president of the Dayton
Foundation and a delegation member, said the group does not want to
look like ``a bunch of Americans walking around with USA on their
foreheads.''
</P>
<P>
   But the risk of actual day-to-day danger is considered slight.
United Nations troops are still stationed in Bosnia and many
foreign countries operate relief efforts throughout the country
without problems.
</P>
<P>
   Given the history between the two cities, local officials said
there is no more natural link than between Dayton and Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are two cities brought together by war and a search for
international peace,'' said Bruce Hitchner, director of the
University of Dayton's center for international programs. ``I can't
imagine two other cities that are better suited for a sister city
relationship. These two cities probably are the most symbolic two
cities associated with the entire Bosnian conflict. This draws
attention to how two cities brought together by the conflict can
work toward peace, hopefully not on a local level but on
international level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton-Sarajevo link began when U.S. negotiators talked all
the sides of the Bosnian conflict into coming to Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base in November 1995 to work out an end to three years
of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The location's primary contribution to the talks was that it
offered few distractions, with the base nestled away in the midst
of flat, brown Midwestern prairie, removed from the intense media
scrutiny of the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The European delegations, including Yugoslavian President
Slobodan Milosevic, toured and ate in the Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely peace they brokered at Wright-Patterson, however,
ended some of the most vicious fighting Europe had seen since the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1990s, conflicts arose between ethnic Muslims,
Croats and Serbs who lived within Bosnia-Herzegovina, a former part
of Yugoslavia that became an independent nation in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The unofficial start to the war began later that year when
gunmen opened fire from the upper floors of the Sarajevo Holiday
Inn into a peace rally on the streets below. The Dayton delegation
this week will be staying in that rebuilt hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a Bosnian-Serb military offensive began, backed by the
Serb-dominated army from neighboring Yugoslavia. Troops besieged
Sarajevo and purged non-Serbs from parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina
where Serbs held a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Sarajevo siege lasted three years, with almost-daily sniper
and mortar attacks that nearly leveled the city.
</P>
<P>
   While hostility still simmers among Bosnia's ethnic groups, the
large-scale fighting has not returned. U.N. peacekeeping forces
patrol the nation, and the country's three major ethnic groups
largely live separately. Serbs have set up their own mini-state,
called the Republika Srpska, on the east and northern parts of
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Sarajevo, once an ethnically diverse city that
hosted the 1984 Winter Olympic Games, is now almost entirely
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Trip targets educational, cultural, business links
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton delegation will find the rebuilding in Sarajevo has
gone slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The city's mayor, Hasan Gachanovic, told former Bosnian
journalist Azra Kourin that promised international aid often did
not materialize. The city is nevertheless ready to seek its past
glory and bid to host the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, Gachanovic
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton delegation is scheduled to meet with Gachanovic and
other national and city officials in Sarajevo. The delegation will
host a reception at the U.S. Embassy, and next Friday, will travel
to Tuzla, north of Sarajevo, to meet with U.S. troops working with
the United Nations peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials are trying to establish more relationships
between the two cities than just signed parchment.
</P>
<P>
   While in Sarajevo, Hitchner will finalize an agreement between
the University of Dayton and the University of Sarajevo that will
make it easier for students, faculty and research to be exchanged.
Officials will also cement an agreement to bring the Sarajevo
Symphony to Dayton later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton contingent includes local musicians Michael Bashaw
and Sandy Kreitzer, Dayton City Manager Valerie Lemmie, and Harold
Kaplan of the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Bashaw and Kreitzer, Dayton musicians from the band Puzzle of
Light, collaborated with a Sarajevan music company in 1996 in a
performance in Bashaw's studio to recognize the one-year
anniversary of the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Bashaw and Kreitzer hope to play guitar, flute and harmonica
while in Sarajevo, possibly during a performance at a U.S. Embassy
reception Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the obvious cliche of music being the universal
language, but it is true,'' Bashaw said. ``It pulls people
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Early next week, Turner, Kaplan, Lemmie and city Public Affairs
Director Tom Biedenharn will go on to Zagreb, Croatia, where they
will continue efforts to build business contacts between Dayton and
the former Yugoslavia. Croatia was damaged far less by its war with
Serbs in Yugoslavia and has a larger economy than
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   But five years of effort have yielded little so far.
</P>
<P>
   Transwave, a Dayton firm, secured one contract to help in the
rebuilding of Sarajevo's sewer system. But there has been little
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ask a Dayton business to go to Sarajevo if there is
no money to pay for those services,'' said Neer of the Dayton
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's job with the Chamber of Commerce is to foster
international trade. Despite two close calls, he said, he has yet
to get work in the Balkans for a local company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not for lack of trying,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   French Oil Machine in Piqua was close to selling vegetable oil
processing equipment to Croatia. A Dayton accounting firm narrowly
missed the cut to monitor the finances of a U.N. program in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to look to find good matches,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, business contacts the region makes could have the
greatest impact in promoting peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people have jobs, homes to go to, food to eat, they are
less likely to be belligerent,'' he said.

   Colleges celebrate the end of the academic season with
traditions peculiar to their institutions. Perhaps the defining
word is ``peculiar.'' Wellesley seniors dress in their graduation
gowns and roll wooden hoops around the campus. At Columbia, the
marching band parades through the library on the night before the
organic chemistry final, probably to help concentrate the mind.
</P>
<P>
   On the last night of classes at Williams College in
Williamstown, Mass., the student radio station WCFM conducts a
marathon trivia contest. Teams of almost any number can enter. The
twice-yearly event was first held some 30 years ago. The number of
questions ranges from 500 to around 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of questions are given over the air. Hundreds more are
given out on paper, and they must be turned in, much like the tests
students were supposedly studying for. Last month, a team called
Pokemon Laboratory, which refers to a crucial locale in the popular
Nintendo game Pokemon, won top honors after tackling such arcana as
the names for all the members of the Jefferson Airplane. The prize?
The winners get to put together next semester's test.
</P>
<P>
   _ THOMAS VINCIGUERRA

   Colleges celebrate the end of the academic season with
traditions peculiar to their institutions. Perhaps the defining
word is ``peculiar.'' Wellesley seniors dress in their graduation
gowns and roll wooden hoops around the campus. At Columbia, the
marching band parades through the library on the night before the
organic chemistry final, probably to help concentrate the mind.
</P>
<P>
   On the last night of classes at Williams College in
Williamstown, Mass., the student radio station WCFM conducts a
marathon trivia contest. Teams of almost any number can enter. The
twice-yearly event was first held some 30 years ago. The number of
questions ranges from 500 to around 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of questions are given over the air. Hundreds more are
given out on paper, and they must be turned in, much like the tests
students were supposedly studying for. Last month, a team called
Pokemon Laboratory, which refers to a crucial locale in the popular
Nintendo game Pokemon, won top honors after tackling such arcana as
the names for all the members of the Jefferson Airplane. The prize?
The winners get to put together next semester's test.
</P>
<P>
   _ THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>

song.
</P>
<P>
   Realm: Dietary Restrictions.

   Song: ``My Man'' by the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Realm: Short People Unite.
</P>
<P>
   Subrealm: Robble Robble! Your Soul Is Mine!
</P>
<P>
   Q. The 4-foot-tall stand-up comedian best known for his role as
McDonaldLand's Hamburglar has fallen on hard times of late. He has

<P>
   Q. Why was the M-16 rifle much more deadly before it was
``improved''?
</P>
<P>
   A. The rifling on the barrel was corrected, thus bullets flew
straight. Before the rifling was fixed, they tumbled in the air,
causing much more grievous damage.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Darkened glasses were invented in China prior to 1430. What
was their use before Europeans decided to use them to shield their

 &HT;    Actress readjusts to sounds of her worldBy Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Abigail Bauer, a character on the CBS soap opera
``Guiding Light,'' is an Amish woman who has been deaf since age 7
because of a farming accident. But in a recent episode, she had
surgery that miraculously restored her hearing.
</P>
<P>
   While that's a fairly standard-issue soap development, this plot
twist has its roots in real life: Abigail is played by Amy Ecklund,
an actress who began losing her hearing at age 6 and who until
recently relied on hearing aids, lip-reading and sign language. But
Ecklund, who was raised in Austin, had a cochlear implant in
January, which improved her hearing tremendously. Now, she can talk
on the phone without assistance and can hear the voices of other
cast members on the set _ in addition to experiencing thousands of
other sounds she hasn't heard since grade school.
</P>
<P>
   But this change hasn't come without challenge. Recovering one's
hearing with a cochlear implant is a long, intensive process that
requires a lot of work, says Ecklund.
</P>
<P>
   In the soap, for example, Abigail will be able to hear within
hours of the surgery. In real life, Ecklund's ear healed for six
weeks before the device was turned on. The incision curved around
the back of her ear, and 20 staples were removed. Months of
fine-tuning and therapy with her audiologist followed, a process
that continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a complicated experience,'' says Ecklund, considered
a role model for the hearing-impaired. ``It's both wonderful and
devastating. My whole universe is changing, my whole identity is
changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The cochlear-implant procedure is a controversial one, she says.
It has been successful for her because she remembers various sounds
and is able to process and understand what she hears. Other
hearing-impaired people have different experiences, Ecklund says.
For someone who has been profoundly deaf from birth, having the
implant could be traumatic, she says, because they don't have a
memory of sounds to compare their experiences to, and the sudden
avalanche of noise is overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   After the device was first activated, she could recognize some
sounds easily, like a clock ticking, but others were utterly
foreign, like her dog slurping water out of a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Ecklund, a nominee for a Daytime Emmy in 1998, finds herself
concentrating more than ever on the ``Guiding Light'' set because
of all the sounds coming from every direction. She is also trying
to break old habits, like assessing people based only on their
facial expressions and body language. Now that she can hear their
voices, it's easier to understand how they feel, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ecklund's quick adaptation to the implant is remarkable, her
doctors say. For many patients, talking on the phone only a few
months after their surgery is unrealistic. Her speaking voice has
also improved, becoming clearer and more precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a massive success story,'' Ecklund says. ``It's like those
Slimfast commercials you see, when someone goes from a size 27 to a
size 4, and the line on the screen says 'Results not typical.'''
</P>
<P>
   One wonderful side effect of the implant is being able to hear
her husband's voice. Jon Ecklund is also an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a very deep voice,'' she says. ``My husband's voice is
amazing.''

 &HT;    The ABC's of Austin's herbal gurus
 &HT;    By Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If this garden paradise hidden away from the
traffic on east Manor Road was a cup of herb tea, it would be
calming chamomile.
</P>
<P>
   The front porch rockers, chiming bells of a nearby Catholic
church and greenery surrounding the Case Mill Homestead, a grist
mill and home built in the 1850s, all evoke a soothing sense of
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the restored Austin landmark _ the home of the
American Botanical Council _ more than tea is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, an internationally known authority on herbs that has become
a leading source of information for everyone from national media to
doctors and pharmacists, is at the center of an explosion of
interest in all things herbal: Sixty million Americans bought $4
billion in supplements last year.
</P>
<P>
   As herbs have moved from the fringe and into the mainstream, the
10-year-old ABC has been evolving as well. Since moving into its
new headquarters last year, the nonprofit council has been making
plans to increase its local visibility: Today it's included in a
tour of rainwater-collection facilities around the city. There'll
be a grand opening celebration on the grounds in October and
scheduled, guided tours in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know more? Here are the ABCs on the ABC and some of the
herbs and medicinal plants it champions.
</P>
<P>
   A is for astragalus, a plant used in traditional Chinese and
East Indian medicine for its immune-system-enhancing qualities and
recently discovered by people with AIDS and cancer patients
undergoing chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   B is for books. In the next year or two, ABC will open its
library to the general public. (It's now available only to
researchers). Some of the many books now available through ABC's
extensive sales catalogue include biographies of famous herbalists
and primers on traditional medicines in Asia, India, Africa and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   C is for classes. The council offers everything from continuing
education for doctors, pharmacists and nurses who want to know more
about how specific herbs interact with prescription medicines to
courses in aromatherapy.
</P>
<P>
   D is for depression, the condition that's driving sales of St.
John's wort.
</P>
<P>
   E is for echinacea. The top-selling herb in the United States
for the past few years, echinacea is featured on ABC's letterhead.
Also called purple coneflower, it's best known for strengthening
the body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   F is for feverfew, used as a folk medicine for menstrual cramps
since Greco-Roman times. It's usually found in capsule form.
</P>
<P>
   G is for ginseng evaluation project. An ABC study, to be
published this year, will analyze hundreds of commercial ginseng
products to verify manufacturer claims of ginseng levels.
</P>
<P>
   H is for hawthorn and horse chestnut, two medicinal plants
poised to be the next best-sellers. Hawthorn is being used by
people with hypertension, angina pectoris and other heart ailments,
and is frequently an ingredient in ``heart healthy'' teas. Horse
chestnut is thought to reduce inflammation and discomfort from
varicose veins, phlebitis and other circulation problems. It can be
taken internally, or applied topically in lotions and ointments.
</P>
<P>
   I is for ipecac, used to induce vomiting or, in much smaller
doses, as an expectorant, particularly in treating bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   J is for jojoba oil, used by Native Americans and Mexicans as a
hair conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   K is for kudos. ABC founder Mark Blumenthal is senior editor of
the first alternative medicine publication chosen by Doody
Publishing, a leading reviewer of medical titles, as one of the top
three medical books released in 1998. ``The Complete German
Commission E Monographs'' is an exhaustive reference book for
health professionals seeking information about the benefits and
risks of herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
   L is for lilies. Austinite Leah Neal designed a medicinal lily
garden that features sansevieria, day lilies, garlic, chives,
crinum lilies and many others plants from the family Liliaceae,
used in treating everything from sunburn to coughs to high
cholesterol. Neal won an honorable mention in a garden design
contest sponsored by HerbalGram, the council's publication. Another
prize-winning reader-suggested garden features a winding ribbon of
antioxidant plants and herbs helpful in preventing breast cancer
and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   M is for mission. ABC's is to investigate and promote the safe
and effective use of medicinal plants.
</P>
<P>
   N is for nettle. A tea made from the leaves of the plant has
been used since ancient times to reduce congestion, control coughs
and relieve asthma symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   O is for oak bark. Chopped, powdered and diluted with water,
it's an astringent wash for everything from oozing wounds to sweaty
feet. P is for purification and protection gardens. These flank the
gated entrance, filled with plants thought to provide positive
energy in various cultures: ginger, in Thailand; chili, in Central
America; holy basil, in India; lemon verbena, in Peru and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   Q is for questions. ABC fields inquiries about its research,
programs and tours, but is not a source of information on how to
use herbs medicinally, nor is it a source of herb products.
</P>
<P>
   R is for research. Researchers from around the world will use
ABC's Herbal Education and Research Center, which eventually will
include laboratories. Recent visitor Julie Bonifacio, a botanist
from the Philippines and traditional medicine expert, helped put
together a continuing-education course for health practitioners
who'll be learning about the top 25 herbs. Bonifacio was on a
fellowship from the World Health Organization and her work was
conducted in partnership with the Texas Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   S is for saw palmetto extract, a popular remedy for enlarged
prostate, common in men 50 and older, available in capsules or in
combination with other herbs in formulas designed to support the
male endocrine system.
</P>
<P>
   T is for tours. Blumenthal and others lead trips into the Amazon
rain forest, South Africa and other exotic locales, calling on
local healers to share traditional medicine secrets. The
expeditions have drawn pharmacists and others interested in herbs.
</P>
<P>
   U is for uva ursi, an herb best used in small amounts or in
remedies to treat infections of the urinary tract and bladder.
</P>
<P>
   V is for valerian root, a sleep aid also thought to reduce
nervous irritability, that's usually sold in capsules.
</P>
<P>
   W is for ``What was that again?'' Memory loss among aging baby
boomers has made Ginkgo biloba a top-selling herb capsule.
</P>
<P>
   X is for xanthium, a Chinese herb used to treat sinusitis and
arthritis, and headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Y is for yarrow, recommended for yeast infections and night
sweats. Taken as a tea, or in combination herbal formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Z is for Zingiber officinale, the botanical name for ginger,
used to treat nausea and other digestive difficulties, often in a
tea. Sources: American Botanical Council; American Pharmaceutical
Association's Practical Guide to Natural Medicines; Herbs &AMP; things.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty gardens reflect uses

<P>
   Looking for ideas about how to use herbs?
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Howearth, a Baha'i and a Mexico-based landscape
designer, is creating a patchwork quilt of theme gardens on the ABC
grounds. When it's all through, you'll be able to stroll through an
anatomy garden featuring herbs and medicinal plants considered
beneficial for specific parts of the body. In a section for skin
and hair, you'll find lavender, basil, sage, thyme, aloe,
calendula, St. John's wort, chamomile and comfrey. The digestive
system plot will have horehound, angelica, catnip, lemon verbena,
licorice and caraway. Then there are the brain herbs: ginkgo,
scullcap, wood betony, lavender, feverfew.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just one garden.
</P>
<P>
   A children's health patch will be planted with chamomile,
lavender, catnip, rosemary, sunflowers, comfrey and others.
</P>
<P>
   An array of Chinese medicinal herbs will include agastache,
angelica, astragalus and camphor.
</P>
<P>
   And an Ayurvedic garden will be filled with cardamom, ginger,
turmeric, aloe, pineapple, celery and capsicum annum.
</P>
<P>
   Other theme plots planned will feature culinary, Appalachian,
Andean, aromatherapy and medieval plants.

   On Anniversary of Massacre, Silence and Introspection
</P>
<P>
   Beijing marked the 10th anniversary of the massacre at Tiananmen
Square with a nervous silence. Over the last decade, there has been
little public discussion of the incident, which began on the night
of June 3, 1989, and lasted until the morning of June 4.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown number of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed
when tanks rolled in to quell six weeks of protest.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have never given a public accounting of the
death toll; the estimates of witnesses and human rights
organizations range from several hundred to more than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Exiled leaders of the democracy movement, including some who
spent years in prison, gathered at Harvard University to mark the
occasion. They acknowledged mistakes they had made, but insisted
that the movement they began has changed China for the better.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton briefly acknowledged the
anniversary and argued that only by pushing ahead on expanding
trade with Beijing can the United States remain ``a force for
change in China.''

   Nine Die in Arkansas Crash as Plane Lands During Storm

<P>
   An American Airlines jet crashed on landing in Little Rock,

began concentrating on the severe weather, which may have blown the
plane off the runway, but it soon became clear that the reason for
the incident may be far more complex. Federal officials said some
of the plane's braking devices did not appear to have been properly
set up. Although the pilot was experienced, he had been on duty
near the maximum of 14 hours.

   Japanese Officials Move to Lift Ban on the Pill
</P>
<P>
   In a major step toward approving the birth control pill, Japan's
top medical advisory council suddenly reversed its position and
recommended allowing the pill to be sold. Japan is the only
industrialized country to ban the pill, and the issue has been
debated for decades. Some feminists argue that the ban reflects
male domination of Japanese society and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The case for the pill got a lift recently from the speedy
approval of Viagra, which treats impotence in men. That provoked an
uproar from women's groups who demanded that the pill also be
approved. The pill could be available this fall.

   European Nations Vote to Become Military Power
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's 15 member nations decided to become a
single military power and to appoint a single foreign and security
policy official.
</P>
<P>
   By late 2000, according to a plan announced at the European
Summit in Cologne, Germany, the European leaders would establish a
command headquarters and a joint force for peacekeeping missions in
future crises like those in Kosovo and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Making the European Union a military power would enable NATO
members, as well as several nations that are not members of NATO,
to mount their own campaigns without having to rely on American
might.

   Merrill Lynch to Offer Trading on the Internet
</P>
<P>
   The thundering herd just made a sharp U-turn. For more than two
decades, Merrill Lynch, the United States' biggest stock brokers,
scoffed at ``do it yourself'' discount investing.
</P>
<P>
   But recently even some of Merrill's well-heeled clients have
been lured by the excitement _ and far lower commissions _ of
trading for themselves on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6 million households now trade stocks over the
Internet, accounting for one in every seven stock trades in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So the brokerage bent to the pressures of the Internet era and
said it would introduce a flat rate of $29.95 per trade on the
World Wide Web. Just don't ask for any advice.

   Barnes &AMP; Noble Withdraws Offer to Buy Ingram

   Barnes &AMP; Noble, the United States' biggest bookseller, decided
to withdraw its $600 million offer to buy Ingram Book Group, the
largest book wholesaler, after federal officials prepared to
challenge the deal on antitrust grounds.

   The decision was a victory for smaller bookstores, which have

<P>
   James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' new president, had his first
chance to demonstrate that he could be a heavyweight at the
bargaining table like his famous father, James R. Hoffa. The
younger Hoffa received respectable marks for negotiating a contract
for 12,800 workers who haul new cars to dealers. In an era when
companies are cutting retirement benefits, he won higher pensions,
health coverage for workers who retire at age 55 and prescription
benefits for retirees over 65.

   Worries Over Muscle Drug

   Scientists were surprised _ and concerned. Iowa State University

McGwire said he used on his way to becoming baseball's home run
king. And around which a multimillion-dollar business sprang up on
claims that it builds muscle.
</P>
<P>
   In natural form, it converts to testosterone, which does build
muscle. The scientists put 30 young men on 100 milligrams, some on
placebos; some on weight training, some not. The finding: No
increase in testosterone or muscle, but increases in estrogen,
which can cause pancreatic cancer and heart disease in men. The
implication: a possible ban if larger studies corroborate the
findings.

Mrs. Clinton to inform her that she was giving up and would instead
run for the House.
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Clinton did nothing to talk her out of it. If that
wasn't a clear enough sign that the first lady has settled on
running, Mrs. Clinton made it clearer Friday morning, announcing

   New York's cultural resources seem unlimited, but if you ask a
New Yorker to name the greatest thing about living in the city, the

With a telephone call, New Yorkers can get almost any kind of meal
delivered to their door, from sushi to tandoori chicken to pozole
to anything Chinese.

<P>
   The convenience is apparently worth the clutter of takeout menus

</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time, then, before the growing
population of cellular-phone users would point some entrepreneur
toward the obvious. Sure enough, one Manhattan restaurant, It's a
Wrap, announced it would now take cell-phone orders from Central
Park, to be delivered by bicycle to four locations in the park. It
surely won't be the only restaurant to offer the service.
</P>
<P>
   Some may resent the intrusion of commerce and modern technology
into a bucolic domain of leisure. Yet Central Park is already full
of hot dog and ice cream vendors, cars racing back and forth on the
transverses with radios booming, crazed cyclists and in-line
skaters endangering any pedestrian who has a momentary lapse in
attention. It was fine for Thoreau to hole up and grow beans for a
year, but this is New York, for heaven's sake, and any perceived
right to pastoral pleasures is bowled over by the right to any
food, anywhere, anytime.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the restaurant's menu of tortilla-wrapped sandwiches
and smoothies is pretty good, which may help New Yorkers decide the
issue of nature vs. noshing. Meanwhile, beware of takeout menus
piled under rocks and stuffed into hollow trees.

of the teen-age years haven't reduced them to tears already). They
hunch over calculators, muttering darkly that if they mortgage the
dog and wear designer hand-me-ups from the kids, maybe, just maybe,
they can pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   So it naturally follows, just as a request to take out the trash
is followed by the taking out of trash, that things will be tight,
fiscally speaking, for the educational duration.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. A new study shows that 45 percent of college
students spend more than $2,500 during the school year on
nonessentials _ movies, shopping, wheels _ and 19 percent spend an
astounding $5,000 or more. Officially, they're halfway out of
poverty, and they don't even need to buy bread or hire
electricians.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by EdVenture Partners, a marketing education firm in
Berkeley, Calif., also found that fully 31 percent of students
invest in financial markets. ``These students are caught in the
moment of a society fueled by a record stock market, by salaries
that are extreme,'' said Tony Sgro, EdVenture's president. ``They
look at their peers, and see the cars, the jewelry. They want a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As for investing, ``It's never too early,'' he said. ``Many
students don't think Social Security will be around.''
</P>
<P>
   But is this, perhaps, what the essayist Barbara Ehrenreich,
lamenting the too-rapid plunge ``from pubescence into the
stone-hearted world of finance capitalism,'' once labeled
``premature pragmatism''?

   Then again, they'd better start saving; who knows what their
kids will spend in college.

   SEMAN, Albania _ The sun rises fierce and hot at Camp Hope.
</P>
<P>
   The women are the first out of the olive green tents. They want
water from the new spigots set in fresh concrete squares. The water
trickles, so they wait their turns, hands on hips, talking. Most
are tanned, but a few of the fair-skinned women are burned red. It
is not so sunny in Kosovo, which must seem a sweet, cool dream.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians love conversation. It is perhaps their defining
cultural quality.
</P>
<P>
   For those in Camp Hope, that's a good thing because there are
precious few other ways to pass the time. Each day seems much like
the other, except for the evolving conversation topics.
</P>
<P>
   In the tents, the women make breakfasts of jam and bread and
powerful Turkish coffee. It seems that each family has brought a
set of fine small coffee cups and saucers and can entertain guests
at a moment's notice. You would have to be cold-blooded to be
untouched by this small civility in the most barbaric of
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, there were 3,412 refugees in the U.S. built camp
that eventually will shelter 20,000 and have the distinction of
being Albania's largest shelter. Even if the peace plan holds, camp
planners believe most of these people will spend the winter away
from their homes, either at Camp Hope or someplace like it to be
erected in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Life here revolves around the sun. The kind of sun you find in
south Georgia or central Texas or anywhere in Florida in August. So
blinding in its brightness that you can almost hear it. There is no
wind.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't enough, the cracked earth is covered with rocks
and gravel, which are light gray and powdery like the surface of
the moon. The heat is reflected up, creating the effect of an oven.
</P>
<P>
   The only shade comes from a concrete water tower, which is used
as a watch tower by U.S. Marines, who provide security.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m. it is already uncomfortably warm. The young children
squint when they emerge from their tents to head to school in a
military tent.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Naim Crchugju. He's 11 and speaks some English, as do his
five brothers who live with him in tent A2-10. There is something
unmistakably American in a refugee camp in which all the residents
have short and simple addresses and wear nametags.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Naim,'' he says with a smile. ``Get it? It sounds
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marines call Naim ``Flounder,'' because he reminds them of
the character from the movie ``Animal House.'' It is hard to
overstate the importance of the 150 Marines to the refugees. After
Kosovo, it must be comforting to see such polite, well-trained and
heavily armed men who are duty-bound to protect you. They are
leaving next week, leaving a void that cannot be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Naim is fair-skinned and sunburned. With little inducement, he
will give you a tour of the camp, and try to hold your hand.
``You're my No. 1 friend,'' he says, asking a visitor for access to
a computer. ``The Americans gave my school in Kosovo a computer.
No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   He hates the food, an agonizingly common complaint. In Kosovo,
they ate fresh food from the farm and plenty of milk and cheese.
Here they get beans and bread and whatever else the aid workers can
scrape together. These days they get a lot of what the refugees
call ``Fish in a Prison'' (canned fish).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the teenagers say the sun saps their appetites anyway.
They spend their time smoking and walking up and down the long wide
gravel promenade that runs between the rows of dark green tents.
Every 100 feet or so, they walk past the wooden latrines, which
emit an unspeakable stink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so sorry, so sorry,'' says Naim, truly ashamed for the
smell.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the heat, the camp seems nearly empty _ except
for poor Marines in bulletproof vests and full battle gear. The
women have taken their small children inside, where the men sit on
their haunches and smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The heat begins to break as the sun sets behind a horizon, which
is so flat that the sun lingers as a dull yellow disk before
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening cools, the camp again comes to life. The
promenade is filled with people chattering. The children say
``Hello'' to every adult who isn't obviously Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   It is social hour. People gather in small masses, squatting,
sitting, leaning, full of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about the day, the politics, things like this,''
Naim volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   There are camp lights, which provide the effect of street
lights. It is pitch black outside the camp boundaries, which is
surrounded by miles of plain. Not too far away, you can see lights
coming from the Marines' camp. From time to time, they ride through
on patrols in their jeeps and Humvees.
</P>
<P>
   After sunset, the camp is a pleasant place with a clear starry
sky and the strangely familiar feel that you find in camp grounds,
the warm sounds of people taking the night air before readying
their chidden for bed. For a brief period, it is easy to imagine
that the horrors they have seen and the miseries they endure here
are lifted from them.
</P>
<P>
   After about 10 p.m., the small children have disappeared again.
Families have lit candles inside their tents, casting warm yellow
glows. Still they talk, but now the conversation is among the 12 or
15 people inside each tent. The talk is muffled and more intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Naim must go in. He's greeted by some Marines who have shed
their armament to stroll the promenade. They kid with the boys who
huddle around them.
</P>
<P>
   As it gets later, even the number of teens on the promenade
shrinks to the few smoking cigarettes. The camp begins to be quiet,
except for the roar of the power generator and endless sound of the
heavy trucks and machinery working through the night to ready the
camp.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, the tents fall silent, except for a few baby cries
and the distinct voices of men sharing their last thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The moon is full, shining on a lone heavily armed Marine making
his late rounds down the promenade.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, the tents are silent. Most, for at least a time,
are in Kosovo once more.
</P>

 &HT;    Love match at Belmont? Filly vs. colt
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Of all the strategies and mock-ups offered for
today's 131st Belmont, leave it to trainer Bob Baffert to throw out
the most warped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope as they turn for home, Charismatic is next to
(Silverbulletday) and falls in love,'' Baffert said. ``It would be
like me trying to run after Cindy Crawford.''
</P>
<P>
   Love at the eighth pole probably is not an option for the
1,200-pound great-grandson of Secretariat as he bears down on the
elusive Triple Crown. They'll be a little too busy to start picking
out silver patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The last two Belmonts, Baffert was the one attempting to
complete the Triple Crown _ with Real Quiet last year and Silver
Charm in 1997. He clearly is enjoying the role of pursuer now with
the comely filly and run-on word, Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   He is hyping today's race as an eight-legged Billie Jean
King-Bobby Riggs type of extravaganza. The champion colt against
the undisputed best filly in the land. A he-neighed, she-neighed
debate of global proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Making like a racing Don King, Baffert says we are missing the
story with all this talk of Charismatic's bid for the first Triple
Crown in 21 years. The filly is ready to rumble, he crows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a heavyweight title match,'' he said.
``There's a lot on the line, some serious bragging rights. Every
fan is dying to see this matchup. I tell you, this should be on
pay-per-view. I'd like to have a piece of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The man could talk the whitewash off a stable. As the dominant
trainer in 1997 and '98, he has the credentials to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She makes me look so smart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The filly does intrigue. Silverbulletday is the most elegant
animal in the field, a smooth, sleek runner, compared with
Charismatic's muscled-up style. Identified as the top 2-year-old
filly, she has won all five of her races as a 3-year-old, and her
last eight races overall.
</P>
<P>
   But winning the mile-and-a-half Belmont would fly in the face of
history _ no filly has thrived over this distance since Tanya in
1905. Since 1954, only three have tried.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's only concession to the distance was another one-liner:
``I hope she doesn't pull a Robbie Gordon (of Indy 500 misfortune)
and run out of gas near the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten other horses in the field could have some say today, most
notably Menifee, which finished second to Charismatic in both the
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. ``He's had his chance,'' Baffert
said dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first opportunity Charismatic and
Silverbulletday have had to eye each other. The filly was chased
off by the 19-horse stampede that was the Kentucky Derby field and
discouraged by a poor post draw _ far outside 14th _ at the
Preakness. ``She's had a cupcake schedule all spring,'' Charismatic
trainer D. Wayne Lukas warns.
</P>
<P>
   A nice, simple two-horse match race would make a great story.
And how convenient that Charismatic and Silverbulletday will start
next to each other this afternoon _ post positions three and four.
If a distracted Charismatic tries to get the filly's phone number
while waiting in the gate, that would suit Baffert just fine, too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The impoverished patients who step from the dirt sidewalk into
the modern AIDS research clinic run by Cornell Medical College in
Port-au-Prince, Haiti, are offered a seemingly simple arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to test your blood because you live in an area
where AIDS may be common,'' the English version of the clinic's
consent form reads. ``We will provide you with medicine if you fall
sick and cannot afford such care.''
</P>
<P>
   But the transaction is not as straightforward as it sounds. Many
Haitians who visit the clinic are both patients and subjects of
U.S.-financed medical research, and circumstances that are bad for
their health are sometimes best for research results.
</P>
<P>
   That conflict is especially true in Cornell's most tantalizing
research in Haiti, a study of sex partners, only one of whom is
infected with the AIDS virus. Researchers, seeking clues to
developing a vaccine, study the blood of both partners,
particularly the uninfected ones who continue to be exposed to the
virus through unprotected sex. They are trying to find out whether
some people have natural protections against infection with the
AIDS virus that could be replicated in a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitians are ideal research subjects, largely because they
are not receiving the kind of care now standard in the world's
developed countries. Condom use is low in Haiti, for cultural and
other reasons. Anti-retroviral drugs that are successful at
suppressing the virus are unavailable except to the very wealthy,
and are not included in Cornell's promise to provide medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after Cornell opened the clinic, it provides
some of the best AIDS treatment available in a country devastated
by the epidemic, fighting the myriad illnesses that result from
AIDS. But that is a lower standard of care than patients receive
routinely at American institutions, including the hospital
affiliated with Cornell in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   If the research were done in the United States, experts agree,
the physicians would be obligated to prescribe the anti-retrovirals
and deliver the most effective possible counseling against
unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical questions posed by Cornell's work among Haiti's poor
are at the heart of a global debate about AIDS research that is
roiling international health organizations from Geneva to Thailand,
challenging ethics formulations established decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really like a Faustian bargain,'' said Marc Fleisher, a
member of the committee at Cornell that reviews research on humans.
``It's like, since we're making this a better place, we're going to
exploit it in a way we could never get away with in the United
States,'' said Fleisher, the outside member on a board made up
mostly of university employees who are doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell doctors defended the couples study as vitally important
and stressed that its subjects receive the same counseling about
the dangers of AIDS and the same care as other patients at the
Haitian clinic.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. standards for research on humans were strongly influenced
by outrage over the Tuskegee syphilis study earlier this century,
which misled impoverished black subjects for years while tracking
their disease, and withheld treatment even after penicillin was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Today's subjects are not to be pressured to participate in
research, according to federal regulations. They are to be fully
informed about the research's purposes and risks. They must receive
the best available therapy for their illnesses and be told about
any findings relevant to their health.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the same rules apply to federally financed studies
overseas. But an examination of 15 years of records related to the
Haiti couples research shows that it received scant scrutiny from
government officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And the government's rules barely address the moral ambiguities
of AIDS research in indigent countries.
</P>
<P>
   Should participants receive the best treatment available in the
United States or in Haiti, one of the poorest countries on earth?
How forcefully should researchers who are documenting the progress
of the AIDS virus warn subjects about the dangers of rejecting
condoms?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Warren D. Johnson, the chief of international medicine and
infectious diseases at Cornell, called the couples study ``a very
high priority,'' though he said it had been temporarily suspended
while the university concentrated on other research in Haiti.
``This is the critical group in the world _ couples _ that's where
the war is to be fought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 97 couples have been enrolled in the blood study since
1991, records show, but Johnson said only 30 couples are still
being followed. The study will be expanded to new couples early
next year, he said, and coordinated with AIDS vaccine trials, which
are expected to start in Haiti this fall using similar couples as
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell's clinic in Haiti offers strong inducements to subjects.
It is the only center in the country providing free screening and
treatment for HIV, venereal disease and tuberculosis, a common
complication of AIDS. The thousands who flock to it are too poor to
buy food, let alone the simple medicines and vitamins that serve as
``a powerful incentive for study participation,'' in the words of
one Cornell grant report.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the clinic, Dr. Jean William Pape, is a Haiti native
and Cornell professor who has studied AIDS in Haiti for two
decades. Pape, who trained at Cornell, defended the treatment of
research subjects in the couples study, saying they benefited from
the same counseling and free condoms available to everyone who
visits the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Pape said that offering the life-saving drugs to the handful of
research subjects would be an unethical lure to participate.
Treating all HIV-infected citizens, he said, would cost 10 times
Haiti's health budget.
</P>
<P>
   If the research on couples succeeds, he said, it could help lead
to a vaccine against AIDS. ``You have to take into account people
who mean well for their country and not impose on them things that
you feel are good for Western ideas,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ Fans go to Turner Field to see Chipper Jones
hit or Greg Maddux pitch. Not Jonathan Merry.
</P>
<P>
   When the 18-year-old North Hall High School senior watches a
baseball game, his eyes never leave the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Merry's goal is not to be the next Tom Glavine or Brian Jordan.
Instead, he wants to be the next Harry Wendelstedt or Ed Montague.
</P>
<P>
   For most, umpires are nothing more than easy targets for boos
and ridicule. To Merry, the men in blue are heroes to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, that's going to be me out there,'' Merry said.
``That's my dream, and I'm determined to make it come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds of reaching the majors as an umpire are even greater
than of making it as a player. But Merry, who has a reading
disorder, knows about overcoming obstacles. He has done it all his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Born prematurely, Merry had health problems as a youngster. Then
he was diagnosed with a severe form of dyslexia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said I would never graduate from high school,'' said
Merry, who takes tests verbally and does his papers through a
dictation software program on his computer. ``I've been proving
people wrong for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Merry will graduate from North Hall High School with honors
Tuesday, despite his disability. In May, the Eagle Scout was
honored as Sportsman of the Year at the Gainesville-Hall County
Sports Banquet, and won the Challenged Athlete Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that if Jonathan could graduate from high
school it would be the happiest day of my life,'' his mother,
Rebecca, said. ``But the way he keeps surprising us, who knows?
Seeing him realize his dream to become a major-league umpire would
be very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Merry hopes to be working in the minors by 2000. He graduated
from the Harry Wendel-
</P>
<P>
   stedt Umpire School this past winter _ ranking 35th out of 155
students, most of them in their 20s. Merry, the youngest student in
1999, will go back to the five-week school in Ormond Beach, Fla.,
next year to try to land a Rookie League job.
</P>
<P>
   Wendelstedt thinks Merry will make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed,'' said Wendelstedt, who retired after 33
years as a National League umpire. ``He has the desire, and that's
always the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wendelstedt admits that he had reservations at first when he
learned about Merry's reading disorder. An instructor dictated the
professional rulebook into a tape recorder for Merry and he was
given the final exam orally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tremendous retention,'' Wendel-
</P>
<P>
   stedt said. ``Tell him something once, and he's got it. The only
thing that I still wonder about is the lineup card.''
</P>
<P>
   Merry said, ``I know that's something I will continue to have to
work at. I write down names phonetically so I can keep track of the
changes when teams make substitutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Merry, who played football and wrestled at North Hall, got his
start as an umpire by working youth-league games in Hall County as
a sophomore. He had been cut from the high school team the year
before, and umpiring allowed him to stay a part of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved umpiring from the start and knew that is where I
belonged,'' Merry said.
</P>
<P>
   But umpiring youth baseball isn't easy, and he was challenged
right away. A manager complained about a call and angrily asked
Merry to show him the rule in the rulebook.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Merry was watching the game and her heart sank. She had
read the rulebook to Jonathan so he could memorize it and was
confident he had the call right. But she also knew he couldn't read
the rulebook. Luckily, Merry could remember the number for the rule
and even the page it was on. The manager found it in the rulebook
and apologized to the young ump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started crying,'' Rebecca Merry said. ``I couldn't help
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Merry started thinking about umpiring as a career after he saw a
magazine advertisement for Wendelstedt's umpiring school, where
tuition and room is $2,300. He signed up and adjusted his school
schedule to head to Florida for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I was nervous,'' Merry said. ``Who wouldn't be with
all those major-league umpires watching your every move?''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 of Merry's classmates were hired as professional
umpires, starting at the Rookie League level. The salary is $1,800
a month for three months, with $15-a-day meal money and
25-cents-per-mile travel money.
</P>
<P>
   It takes umpires about six years to reach Class AAA if they are
good enough, with at least four more years at that level before
they get a chance at the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nauert of Lawrenceville, one of Merry's instructors, was
hired this year as one of two new full-time umpires in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's not easy to make the majors,'' Merry said. ``You
really have to love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Merry called high school and colleges games this spring, and now
works five or six days a week umpiring amateur games. He hopes the
added experience will help him reach the minor leagues next.
</P>
<P>
   ``No mother wants her son to be booed or heckled,'' Rebecca
Merry said. ``But I know he can handle it. I can't believe the fans
in the minors are any worse than youth league parents. They can be
pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Cornell's presence in Haiti dates from 1979, when Pape returned
to his native land and took a job at a pediatric hospital where 40
percent of the babies were dying from endemic diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man would come to pick up the bodies three times a day, with
a big bag,'' he recalled, bending his tall frame in a scooping
gesture. ``The noise of the skulls in that bag was unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the latest treatment, oral rehydration, Pape cut the death
rate to 1 percent. But the next year his Haitian colleagues asked
him to help fight an enemy that would prove far more formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Adults were mysteriously falling ill with persistent diarrhea,
harbinger of a new, deadly disease. Suddenly, Pape and Cornell
found themselves on the front lines in the fight against a global
epidemic: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Pape had the credentials to lead the effort. Part of an elite
Haitian family long prominent in medicine, he had earned an
undergraduate degree from Columbia University and a medical
education from Cornell. Supervised by Johnson, his Cornell mentor,
Pape set up a local group to study the new disease and soon won
federal financing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Cornell was awarded a major federal grant to conduct a
study, ``The Natural History of HIV Infection in Haiti.'' A
succession of these five-year grants eventually brought Cornell
more than $7 million in research money and hundreds of thousands
more in related training grants.
</P>
<P>
   The studies produced some important early findings. Researchers
dispelled an early theory that Haitians were unusually vulnerable
to the disease. They also helped show that AIDS could be
transmitted through heterosexual contact.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS testing at the research clinic followed the U.S. model of
the mid-1980s. Haitian patients with the virus, mostly heterosexual
men, were offered condoms and counseling. It was left up to
patients to inform their sexual partners, and at least 60 percent
never did so, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The hope was to get Haitians to practice protected sex, but by
the early 1990s it appeared this approach was not working. Pape
said the data persuaded him that only a vaccine could stem Haiti's
epidemic, then speeding from high-risk men to women whose only risk
was an unfaithful partner.
</P>
<P>
   Looking closer at several hundred couples in which only one
partner was infected, he found that AIDS was transmitted annually
in about 7 percent of the couples having unprotected sex. That was
about twice the rate of similar couples in the United States and
Europe, but even so, it suggested an unexplained resistance to
infection.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitians were valuable for another reason. Unlike AIDS
patients in the United States and Europe, they were not receiving
the anti-retroviral drugs that proved effective in halting the
disease's progress.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of those drugs ``may allow identification of novel
findings not easily studied in the USA,'' Dr. John L. Ho, a Cornell
immunologist, wrote in an application for federal funds. In 1995,
the federal government awarded Cornell an extra $60,000 to expand
this part of the Haitian couples study.
</P>
<P>
   Grant records show that by 1996, five of the 31 previously
uninfected partners studied most closely by Cornell tested positive
for the AIDS virus. But Cornell's blood tests found something to
ponder: In two of the cases there was a substantial delay between
transmission of the virus and actual infection _ 11 and 49 months.
And among those who still tested negative, additional blood
analysis indicated in several cases that infection had occurred but
the virus had disappeared again, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell researchers called these results ``tantalizing'' and
``intriguing.'' They hypothesized that certain levels of sexual
exposure to HIV might be triggering an infection that blocked
transmission, aborted infection or at least weakened the effects of
disease _ all clues to vaccine development.
</P>
<P>
   Research plans approved last year include further study of 19
high-risk Haitian partners who still test negative for HIV but show
intermittent signs of the virus in their blood samples. Cornell
researchers estimated that over five years, at least 36 partners
would contract the virus. One report to the National Institutes of
Health anticipated that 15 to 20 HIV-infected women from the study
would become pregnant each year. Those children, Cornell officials
wrote, could be subjects for another study examining the high
mortality rate of HIV-infected infants.

</P>
<P>
   Outside the gates of the research clinic at 33 Truman Boulevard,
the dirt sidewalk is crammed with people by midmorning. Charcoal
smoke, flies and sewage stench mix with cooking smells as vendors
sell beans by the scoop to waiting patients.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of men and women have made their way to the clinic
over the years, many desperate for relief from sickness, others
sent by lovers to be tested for venereal disease and the AIDS
virus.
</P>
<P>
   All are potential research subjects. But the most interesting to
science are patients like the couple identified in clinic records
as No. 1986, a man with AIDS, and No. 1986C, his uninfected,
pregnant wife.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical standards for federally financed studies require that
patients be told why researchers want to study them. But the
written consent form approved at Cornell and read aloud in Creole
to each potential subject does not mention that the study focuses
on couples in which one sexual partner has tested positive for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The form tells subjects their blood is being tested because
``you live in an area where AIDS may be common.'' It promises all
patients that HIV test results will be kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Pape said that in the case of the couples study, the clinic
makes a practice of disclosing results of AIDS tests to the
uninfected partners. He said they are informed orally by a doctor
at the clinic that their spouse or lover has HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Research subjects, Pape said, are given the same counseling
about the dangers of AIDS as other patients. The clinic offers free
condoms, and videos about protected sex are shown in the crowded
waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   Those who contracted the virus while being studied by Cornell
``have no one to blame but themselves, because they were provided
with everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Europe, the United States and Africa said consent
forms and research outlines in comparable studies typically spell
out detailed procedures for informing partners and dealing with the
clashes that might arise.
</P>
<P>
   A joint consent form used as early as 1988 in Zambia, for
example, specifies: ``One of you is infected with the virus and the
other is not,'' adding, ``It is possible that during the study, the
partner who was uninfected will become infected with the AIDS
virus. This is distressing and can cause depression, anger and
marital problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A review of Cornell's materials found no written procedures for
disclosing a partner's infection, or for forcefully counseling
partners as a couple about the dangers of their situation. Pape
said study subjects choose to reject condoms even though they are
fully informed of the risks. To demonstrate, he provided a one-page
questionnaire dated Dec. 3, 1992. It belonged to patient No. 1986C,
then three months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you still sexually active with your partner?'' it begins.
The only record of the woman's replies are a clinic worker's check
marks and scribbled notations. Yes, said the woman, she planned to
continue having sex with her husband. No, they were not using
condoms. No, she did not want a free supply. The reason was
scrawled in English: ``He does not like it and she's afraid of
condom.''
</P>
<P>
   The document, administered at three-month intervals to subjects
gathered from their shantytowns by social workers paid by the
United States, did not contain the word AIDS or HIV. It asked,
``When have you been aware of the infection of your sex partner?''
The answering notation: ``At entry into the study.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing clinic materials, Marie Saint Cyr, a native of
Haiti who now directs an AIDS program for women in Harlem, said
there was a ``clear conflict of interest'' between the desire to
collect information from research subjects and the obligation to
effectively warn patients at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know somebody is positive and is having sex with a
partner who is negative, you have a life and death situation in
front of you,'' she said. ``You have to do individualized
counseling to really tap into what those people value in life, to
confront them with the reality of HIV and AIDS. This in no way
addresses those serious things.''

 UNDATED: serious things.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Cornell researchers came to Haiti to collect blood, they
stayed high above the swarming slums of Port-au-Prince, at a
colonial, gingerbread-style hotel called the Kinam, where purple
bougainvilea spills over a sunlit swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference at the hotel in April 1998, the president of the
National AIDS Council of France challenged Pape to rethink the way
the disease is treated in Haiti, particularly in patients who are
research subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The French official, Dr. Alain Sobel, said the French government
could provide anti-retroviral drugs to Haiti, as it does already
for the nearby French Caribbean islands of Martinique, Guyana and
Guadeloupe.
</P>
<P>
   Pape, according to both men, replied that the multiple drug
cocktail that had been so effective in treating the disease in
developed countries could not be feasibly used in Haiti. The
country's health care system, he insisted, was not organized enough
to properly distribute the drugs or make sure that patients too
poor to eat regularly take a pill before or after certain meals, as
the demanding regimen requires.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel did not disagree. But he argued that Pape's clinic, with
thousands of patients enrolled in various long-term studies, was
the obvious place to make a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really the only institution that can do this in
Haiti,'' Sobel said later in a telephone interview from Paris. He
said that since Cornell's patients are participating in research,
``they deserve to be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape disagreed. Asked about this argument in an interview, he
said offering such treatment to clinic patients would be ``an
inducement to become infected.'' He questioned how long a foreign
government's commitment to provide such expensive drugs _ about
$15,000 yearly per person _ would endure in an economic or
political downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The clash between Pape and Sobel reflects a larger international
debate over clinical trials in third world nations, which has
intensified in the era of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, The New England Journal of Medicine sharply criticized
research in Thailand and Africa that gave placebos to pregnant
women infected with HIV as part of a search for a cheaper way to
stop transmission of the virus to newborns.
</P>
<P>
   The placebo trials were halted in February 1998, when one of the
studies in Thailand showed that transmission could be prevented
with a short course of the drug AZT costing as little as $50.
</P>
<P>
   The finding came at a price. Pregnant women pass on AIDS to
their children in about 35 percent of cases, and in the studies,
half the women were given dummy pills, the others given much less
AZT than in the proven regimen used in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, the editor of the New England Journal, had
likened the trials to the Tuskegee study of syphilis, in which
public health officials withheld effective treatment from a cadre
of black men for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many research scientists defended the placebo trials as a
shortcut to giving poor nations a new weapon against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, world health officials have clashed over how to
test AIDS vaccines whose effectiveness is best assessed with
subjects exposed to the disease and not treated with
anti-retrovirals because of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in Malawi, why not Appalachia?'' asked Dr. David Rothman, a
professor of social medicine at the Columbia College of Physicians
and Surgeons at Columbia University. ``You have serious
investigators trying to do good, trying to save hundreds of
thousands of lives, but I consider it ultimately destructive of the
investigator's integrity and the well-being of all of us to have an
ethic of human experimentation that changes as it travels.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape said decisions about treating third world patients can be
unusually complicated. For example, he was critical of a proposal
by a U.N. group to give pregnant women at the Haitian State
Hospital AZT last year.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal, he said, did not address the problem of HIV
transmission through breast-feeding. The danger, he said, is that
infected Haitian women who are told of the risks will not nurse
their infants. In a country where safe formula is a relative
rarity, he said, this could put children at an even greater risk of
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethical issues sometimes are torturing me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel attributed Pape's lack of enthusiasm for anti-retrovirals
at least in part to his commitment to developing an HIV vaccine. In
1998, Pape became the principal investigator in a $619,000 federal
contract to prepare for preliminary vaccine trials in Haiti as
early as this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him this was completely utopic, since the vaccine is
not ready and will not be ready for many years,'' Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental vaccines which have been developed elsewhere
are at best only partially protective, many scientists say. Even
so, Pape said he considers it crucial for Haitians to be among the
first in line to test them to establish Haiti's moral claim to an
affordable supply of an effective vaccine when _ or if _ one is
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frantz Large, the vice president of the Haitian Medical
Association, which is collaborating on the plans for vaccine
trials, called Pape a great patriot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would never do anything unethical,'' Large said. ``But if
he had to choose between the survival of 10 people and the survival
of a nation, he would probably choose the survival of a nation, and
I would, too.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impoverished patients who step from the dirt sidewalk into
the modern AIDS research clinic run by Cornell Medical College in
Port-au-Prince, Haiti, are offered a seemingly simple arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to test your blood because you live in an area
where AIDS may be common,'' the English version of the clinic's
consent form reads. ``We will provide you with medicine if you fall
sick and cannot afford such care.''
</P>
<P>
   But the transaction is not as straightforward as it sounds. Many
Haitians who visit the clinic are both patients and subjects of
U.S.-financed medical research, and circumstances that are bad for
their health are sometimes best for research results.
</P>
<P>
   That conflict is especially true in Cornell's most tantalizing
research in Haiti, a study of sex partners, only one of whom is
infected with the AIDS virus. Researchers, seeking clues to
developing a vaccine, study the blood of both partners,
particularly the uninfected ones who continue to be exposed to the
virus through unprotected sex. They are trying to find out whether
some people have natural protections against infection with the
AIDS virus that could be replicated in a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitians are ideal research subjects, largely because they
are not receiving the kind of care now standard in the world's
developed countries. Condom use is low in Haiti, for cultural and
other reasons. Anti-retroviral drugs that are successful at
suppressing the virus are unavailable except to the very wealthy,
and are not included in Cornell's promise to provide medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after Cornell opened the clinic, it provides
some of the best AIDS treatment available in a country devastated
by the epidemic, fighting the myriad illnesses that result from
AIDS. But that is a lower standard of care than patients receive
routinely at American institutions, including the hospital
affiliated with Cornell in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   If the research were done in the United States, experts agree,
the physicians would be obligated to prescribe the anti-retrovirals
and deliver the most effective possible counseling against
unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical questions posed by Cornell's work among Haiti's poor
are at the heart of a global debate about AIDS research that is
roiling international health organizations from Geneva to Thailand,
challenging ethics formulations established decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really like a Faustian bargain,'' said Marc Fleisher, a
member of the committee at Cornell that reviews research on humans.
``It's like, since we're making this a better place, we're going to
exploit it in a way we could never get away with in the United
States,'' said Fleisher, the outside member on a board made up
mostly of university employees who are doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell doctors defended the couples study as vitally important
and stressed that its subjects receive the same counseling about
the dangers of AIDS and the same care as other patients at the
Haitian clinic.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. standards for research on humans were strongly influenced
by outrage over the Tuskegee syphilis study earlier this century,
which misled impoverished black subjects for years while tracking
their disease, and withheld treatment even after penicillin was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Today's subjects are not to be pressured to participate in
research, according to federal regulations. They are to be fully
informed about the research's purposes and risks. They must receive
the best available therapy for their illnesses and be told about
any findings relevant to their health.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the same rules apply to federally financed studies
overseas. But an examination of 15 years of records related to the
Haiti couples research shows that it received scant scrutiny from
government officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And the government's rules barely address the moral ambiguities
of AIDS research in indigent countries.
</P>
<P>
   Should participants receive the best treatment available in the
United States or in Haiti, one of the poorest countries on earth?
How forcefully should researchers who are documenting the progress
of the AIDS virus warn subjects about the dangers of rejecting
condoms?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Warren D. Johnson, the chief of international medicine and
infectious diseases at Cornell, called the couples study ``a very
high priority,'' though he said it had been temporarily suspended
while the university concentrated on other research in Haiti.
``This is the critical group in the world _ couples _ that's where
the war is to be fought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 97 couples have been enrolled in the blood study since
1991, records show, but Johnson said only 30 couples are still
being followed. The study will be expanded to new couples early
next year, he said, and coordinated with AIDS vaccine trials, which
are expected to start in Haiti this fall using similar couples as
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell's clinic in Haiti offers strong inducements to subjects.
It is the only center in the country providing free screening and
treatment for HIV, venereal disease and tuberculosis, a common
complication of AIDS. The thousands who flock to it are too poor to
buy food, let alone the simple medicines and vitamins that serve as
``a powerful incentive for study participation,'' in the words of
one Cornell grant report.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the clinic, Dr. Jean William Pape, is a Haiti native
and Cornell professor who has studied AIDS in Haiti for two
decades. Pape, who trained at Cornell, defended the treatment of
research subjects in the couples study, saying they benefited from
the same counseling and free condoms available to everyone who
visits the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Pape said that offering the life-saving drugs to the handful of
research subjects would be an unethical lure to participate.
Treating all HIV-infected citizens, he said, would cost 10 times
Haiti's health budget.
</P>
<P>
   If the research on couples succeeds, he said, it could help lead
to a vaccine against AIDS. ``You have to take into account people
who mean well for their country and not impose on them things that
you feel are good for Western ideas,'' he said.

<P>
   Cornell's presence in Haiti dates from 1979, when Pape returned
to his native land and took a job at a pediatric hospital where 40
percent of the babies were dying from endemic diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man would come to pick up the bodies three times a day, with
a big bag,'' he recalled, bending his tall frame in a scooping
gesture. ``The noise of the skulls in that bag was unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the latest treatment, oral rehydration, Pape cut the death
rate to 1 percent. But the next year his Haitian colleagues asked
him to help fight an enemy that would prove far more formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Adults were mysteriously falling ill with persistent diarrhea,
harbinger of a new, deadly disease. Suddenly, Pape and Cornell
found themselves on the front lines in the fight against a global
epidemic: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Pape had the credentials to lead the effort. Part of an elite
Haitian family long prominent in medicine, he had earned an
undergraduate degree from Columbia University and a medical
education from Cornell. Supervised by Johnson, his Cornell mentor,
Pape set up a local group to study the new disease and soon won
federal financing.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Cornell was awarded a major federal grant to conduct a
study, ``The Natural History of HIV Infection in Haiti.'' A
succession of these five-year grants eventually brought Cornell
more than $7 million in research money and hundreds of thousands
more in related training grants.
</P>
<P>
   The studies produced some important early findings. Researchers
dispelled an early theory that Haitians were unusually vulnerable
to the disease. They also helped show that AIDS could be
transmitted through heterosexual contact.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS testing at the research clinic followed the U.S. model of
the mid-1980s. Haitian patients with the virus, mostly heterosexual
men, were offered condoms and counseling. It was left up to
patients to inform their sexual partners, and at least 60 percent
never did so, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The hope was to get Haitians to practice protected sex, but by
the early 1990s it appeared this approach was not working. Pape
said the data persuaded him that only a vaccine could stem Haiti's
epidemic, then speeding from high-risk men to women whose only risk
was an unfaithful partner.
</P>
<P>
   Looking closer at several hundred couples in which only one
partner was infected, he found that AIDS was transmitted annually
in about 7 percent of the couples having unprotected sex. That was
about twice the rate of similar couples in the United States and
Europe, but even so, it suggested an unexplained resistance to
infection.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitians were valuable for another reason. Unlike AIDS
patients in the United States and Europe, they were not receiving
the anti-retroviral drugs that proved effective in halting the
disease's progress.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of those drugs ``may allow identification of novel
findings not easily studied in the USA,'' Dr. John L. Ho, a Cornell
immunologist, wrote in an application for federal funds. In 1995,
the federal government awarded Cornell an extra $60,000 to expand
this part of the Haitian couples study.
</P>
<P>
   Grant records show that by 1996, five of the 31 previously
uninfected partners studied most closely by Cornell tested positive
for the AIDS virus. But Cornell's blood tests found something to
ponder: In two of the cases there was a substantial delay between
transmission of the virus and actual infection _ 11 and 49 months.
And among those who still tested negative, additional blood
analysis indicated in several cases that infection had occurred but
the virus had disappeared again, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell researchers called these results ``tantalizing'' and
``intriguing.'' They hypothesized that certain levels of sexual
exposure to HIV might be triggering an infection that blocked
transmission, aborted infection or at least weakened the effects of
disease _ all clues to vaccine development.
</P>
<P>
   Research plans approved last year include further study of 19
high-risk Haitian partners who still test negative for HIV but show
intermittent signs of the virus in their blood samples. Cornell
researchers estimated that over five years, at least 36 partners
would contract the virus. One report to the National Institutes of
Health anticipated that 15 to 20 HIV-infected women from the study
would become pregnant each year. Those children, Cornell officials
wrote, could be subjects for another study examining the high
mortality rate of HIV-infected infants.

   Outside the gates of the research clinic at 33 Truman Boulevard,
the dirt sidewalk is crammed with people by midmorning. Charcoal
smoke, flies and sewage stench mix with cooking smells as vendors
sell beans by the scoop to waiting patients.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of men and women have made their way to the clinic
over the years, many desperate for relief from sickness, others
sent by lovers to be tested for venereal disease and the AIDS
virus.
</P>
<P>
   All are potential research subjects. But the most interesting to
science are patients like the couple identified in clinic records
as No. 1986, a man with AIDS, and No. 1986C, his uninfected,
pregnant wife.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical standards for federally financed studies require that
patients be told why researchers want to study them. But the
written consent form approved at Cornell and read aloud in Creole
to each potential subject does not mention that the study focuses
on couples in which one sexual partner has tested positive for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The form tells subjects their blood is being tested because
``you live in an area where AIDS may be common.'' It promises all
patients that HIV test results will be kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Pape said that in the case of the couples study, the clinic
makes a practice of disclosing results of AIDS tests to the
uninfected partners. He said they are informed orally by a doctor
at the clinic that their spouse or lover has HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Research subjects, Pape said, are given the same counseling
about the dangers of AIDS as other patients. The clinic offers free
condoms, and videos about protected sex are shown in the crowded
waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   Those who contracted the virus while being studied by Cornell
``have no one to blame but themselves, because they were provided
with everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Europe, the United States and Africa said consent
forms and research outlines in comparable studies typically spell
out detailed procedures for informing partners and dealing with the
clashes that might arise.
</P>
<P>
   A joint consent form used as early as 1988 in Zambia, for
example, specifies: ``One of you is infected with the virus and the
other is not,'' adding, ``It is possible that during the study, the
partner who was uninfected will become infected with the AIDS
virus. This is distressing and can cause depression, anger and
marital problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A review of Cornell's materials found no written procedures for
disclosing a partner's infection, or for forcefully counseling
partners as a couple about the dangers of their situation. Pape
said study subjects choose to reject condoms even though they are
fully informed of the risks. To demonstrate, he provided a one-page
questionnaire dated Dec. 3, 1992. It belonged to patient No. 1986C,
then three months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you still sexually active with your partner?'' it begins.
The only record of the woman's replies are a clinic worker's check
marks and scribbled notations. Yes, said the woman, she planned to
continue having sex with her husband. No, they were not using
condoms. No, she did not want a free supply. The reason was
scrawled in English: ``He does not like it and she's afraid of
condom.''
</P>
<P>
   The document, administered at three-month intervals to subjects
gathered from their shantytowns by social workers paid by the
United States, did not contain the word AIDS or HIV. It asked,
``When have you been aware of the infection of your sex partner?''
The answering notation: ``At entry into the study.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing clinic materials, Marie Saint Cyr, a native of
Haiti who now directs an AIDS program for women in Harlem, said
there was a ``clear conflict of interest'' between the desire to
collect information from research subjects and the obligation to
effectively warn patients at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know somebody is positive and is having sex with a
partner who is negative, you have a life and death situation in
front of you,'' she said. ``You have to do individualized
counseling to really tap into what those people value in life, to
confront them with the reality of HIV and AIDS. This in no way
addresses those serious things.''

   When Cornell researchers came to Haiti to collect blood, they
stayed high above the swarming slums of Port-au-Prince, at a
colonial, gingerbread-style hotel called the Kinam, where purple
bougainvilea spills over a sunlit swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference at the hotel in April 1998, the president of the
National AIDS Council of France challenged Pape to rethink the way
the disease is treated in Haiti, particularly in patients who are
research subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The French official, Dr. Alain Sobel, said the French government
could provide anti-retroviral drugs to Haiti, as it does already
for the nearby French Caribbean islands of Martinique, Guyana and
Guadeloupe.
</P>
<P>
   Pape, according to both men, replied that the multiple drug
cocktail that had been so effective in treating the disease in
developed countries could not be feasibly used in Haiti. The
country's health care system, he insisted, was not organized enough
to properly distribute the drugs or make sure that patients too
poor to eat regularly take a pill before or after certain meals, as
the demanding regimen requires.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel did not disagree. But he argued that Pape's clinic, with
thousands of patients enrolled in various long-term studies, was
the obvious place to make a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really the only institution that can do this in
Haiti,'' Sobel said later in a telephone interview from Paris. He
said that since Cornell's patients are participating in research,
``they deserve to be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape disagreed. Asked about this argument in an interview, he
said offering such treatment to clinic patients would be ``an
inducement to become infected.'' He questioned how long a foreign
government's commitment to provide such expensive drugs _ about
$15,000 yearly per person _ would endure in an economic or
political downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The clash between Pape and Sobel reflects a larger international
debate over clinical trials in third world nations, which has
intensified in the era of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, The New England Journal of Medicine sharply criticized
research in Thailand and Africa that gave placebos to pregnant
women infected with HIV as part of a search for a cheaper way to
stop transmission of the virus to newborns.
</P>
<P>
   The placebo trials were halted in February 1998, when one of the
studies in Thailand showed that transmission could be prevented
with a short course of the drug AZT costing as little as $50.
</P>
<P>
   The finding came at a price. Pregnant women pass on AIDS to
their children in about 35 percent of cases, and in the studies,
half the women were given dummy pills, the others given much less
AZT than in the proven regimen used in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, the editor of the New England Journal, had
likened the trials to the Tuskegee study of syphilis, in which
public health officials withheld effective treatment from a cadre
of black men for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many research scientists defended the placebo trials as a
shortcut to giving poor nations a new weapon against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, world health officials have clashed over how to
test AIDS vaccines whose effectiveness is best assessed with
subjects exposed to the disease and not treated with
anti-retrovirals because of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in Malawi, why not Appalachia?'' asked Dr. David Rothman, a
professor of social medicine at the Columbia College of Physicians
and Surgeons at Columbia University. ``You have serious
investigators trying to do good, trying to save hundreds of
thousands of lives, but I consider it ultimately destructive of the
investigator's integrity and the well-being of all of us to have an
ethic of human experimentation that changes as it travels.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape said decisions about treating third world patients can be
unusually complicated. For example, he was critical of a proposal
by a U.N. group to give pregnant women at the Haitian State
Hospital AZT last year.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal, he said, did not address the problem of HIV
transmission through breast-feeding. The danger, he said, is that
infected Haitian women who are told of the risks will not nurse
their infants. In a country where safe formula is a relative
rarity, he said, this could put children at an even greater risk of
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethical issues sometimes are torturing me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel attributed Pape's lack of enthusiasm for anti-retrovirals
at least in part to his commitment to developing an HIV vaccine. In
1998, Pape became the principal investigator in a $619,000 federal
contract to prepare for preliminary vaccine trials in Haiti as
early as this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him this was completely utopic, since the vaccine is
not ready and will not be ready for many years,'' Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental vaccines which have been developed elsewhere
are at best only partially protective, many scientists say. Even
so, Pape said he considers it crucial for Haitians to be among the
first in line to test them to establish Haiti's moral claim to an
affordable supply of an effective vaccine when _ or if _ one is
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frantz Large, the vice president of the Haitian Medical
Association, which is collaborating on the plans for vaccine
trials, called Pape a great patriot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would never do anything unethical,'' Large said. ``But if
he had to choose between the survival of 10 people and the survival
of a nation, he would probably choose the survival of a nation, and
I would, too.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas has never recorded a colder June day than it did on
Friday, when the mercury failed to climb above 67 degrees. The
chilly weather in the Southwest will yield to more seasonable
temperatures Sunday under bright sunshine. However, a new surge of
cold, moist air from the North Pacific will progress southward
through Washington and Oregon accompanied by gusty winds inland and
some showers near the coast.
</P>
<P>
   There will be an interlude of tranquil conditions in the central
and southern Rockies. Skies will remain rather cloudy in Wyoming
and southern Montana as a nearby front causes scattered showers.
Another front in the western plains may produce several severe
storms.
</P>
<P>
   A weakening low pressure system near Fargo will still trigger a
cluster of thunderstorms over the eastern Dakotas, Minnesota and
northern Wisconsin. Jet stream winds will whisk the tops of these
storms rapidly east across the Great Lakes. The leading edge of
hot, humid air should be marked by thundershowers in the St.
Lawrence Valley. A few showers will reach northwestern portions of
New England and clouds and very gusty winds will spread across
central sections.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure centered east of New England will become the
dominant weather factor in the East for the coming week. Its broad
clockwise circulation will draw sultry air from the southern Plains
across the Mississippi Valley and lower Great Lakes. A prolonged
spell of hot, humid weather is likely from the middle of the nation
to the Atlantic Seaboard this week.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: LA Chill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winter made a late appearance in Southern California this week.
On Thursday, Mt. Wilson, 18 miles northeast of Los Angeles, had a
maximum of 38 degrees and a minimum of 30, making it the coldest
June day on record. The chill then progressed farther south and
combined with unseasonal showers early Friday. When the sun rose on
the mountains of San Diego county Friday, 3 inches of wet snow
covered Mount Laguna. This marks the latest snowfall ever, an
entire week later then the previous record. Sunday, the sun will
return and the chill will modify in the Southwest. &QL;

WEARY BELGRADE STARTS TO REBUILD AS DESPAIR AND PESSIMISM LINGER

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ With the sudden and apparent end of
NATO's bombing war against Yugoslavia, Serbs are relieved, angry,
proud, disgusted and resigned, probably in that order, suggested
Slobodanka Bogic, as she stood Saturday morning in her still
windowless house, helping workers repair the damage.
</P>
<P>
   But soon enough, she said, ``everyone will start to become more
afraid, because the winter is coming and there will not be enough
heat, power or food.''
</P>
<P>
   On a bright, hot, sunny day, with NATO's planes no longer
popping the sound barrier over Belgrade, it is easy to imagine Mrs.
Bogic indulging in Slavic pessimism, the other side of the mordant
humor and endurance that ordinary Serbs have displayed in this
bizarre and unequal war.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Zvezdara, which everyone hopes is the last area of
Belgrade to suffer collateral damage from NATO's bombs, only six
days ago now, it is hard to know what anyone's future holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope our house is the last one smashed in Belgrade,''
Mrs. Bogic said. ``But as for me, I'm not sure this is really over.
My daughter keeps telling me, `Come on, mother, don't be afraid,'
but I'm a pessimist.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her daughter, Olivera, 34, who was asleep in the house
when the bombs hit, she is still shaken, jumping nervously when
even the telephone rings. Her cuts from the flying glass are
healing nicely, but not the damage to her spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Olivera sleeps now in her office, in a real estate agency that
has had little work since the prospects of war began to seem real
in January. Her mother continues to sleep in the basement,
believing that more bombs may yet be coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our psyches are smashed,'' her mother said. ``But the worst
thing is the people who died and the invalids. Who knows how many?
And who will need them?''
</P>
<P>
   The houses here still gape emptily, doors and windows blown out,
though many now are covered with plastic. The Bogics and their
neighbors have fixed their roofs, helping one another as if in a
village. Rubble has been neatly swept up and carted away by the
city. The police barracks across the street are destroyed, like so
many other military and civilian buildings, bridges, factories and
power plants across the whole of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, holed and charred government buildings seem to mock
the peace and remind Serbs of the cost of their resistance, which
at least some believe was entirely in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Parliament building, where Serbian legislators bowed to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and confirmed Serbia's
acceptance of the NATO-Russian terms for peace, a sign remains
displayed in a shop window.
</P>
<P>
   It shows a map of Serbia with a target on it, and over Kosovo, a
large, red heart. The legend reads: ``Clinton, do you know what
this red thing is?'' The paper is yellowing, the plastic over it
cracked. How long will it stay?
</P>
<P>
   While many Serbs fume that the peace deal, or what they
understand of it, means the effective loss of Kosovo, a significant
number of people say their resistance to the might of the world is
a historic achievement. They feel that nothing damaged cannot be
rebuilt, and that Serbian defiance these last 74 days will
represent a new, proud chapter in their history.
</P>
<P>
   On Knez Mihajlova, a pedestrian walkway that is Belgrade's main
shopping street, stalls still sell bitter and amusing postcards and
pins chronicling Serbian defiance and mocking Western leaders. One
postcard shows a burning world wrapped in barbed wire with the
slogan: ``Don't worry. NATO is only here to give you a big warm
hug.'' The first six letters in ``big warm'' are in red.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs still promenade in their best casual clothes, drinking
espresso and smoking imported cigarettes as if they hadn't a care
in the world. ``It's a show, of course, just like our television,''
said Dragisa Bogdanov, a mustachioed 40-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   He describes himself as opposed to Milosevic, but feels the deal
Milosevic got ``was the best we could get.'' Bogdanov shrugged.
``How could we win against the world? But at least the West
admitted it had to deal with us instead of just bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``I'm very afraid of the people who will have no
future. Factories, shops, bridges and other things are completely
destroyed. The problem here is that people don't think with their
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others feel that many more Serbs with skills will now
seek to leave a broken country that faces further Western sanctions
and the continued rule of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly speaking, I and my friends are still afraid,'' said
Ilija, a businessman whose business is nearing collapse. ``We
always feared that there would be all this destruction and death
and NATO would leave him still sitting there on top. We fear he
will be the winner, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be domestic unrest as winter nears, Ilija said, and
the soldiers come home with their stories and no barracks in which
to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people are also afraid of more blood,'' he said. ``I
marched for six months for the democrats, but they've become like
all the others. They sell themselves for a cheap price. People are
fed up with our politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An elegant woman in black called the pact ``Cherno-Bill,'' a
reference to a common joke here about a deal between President Bill
Clinton and Russian envoy Victor Chernomyrdin. ``Russia's become
the 51st state,'' she said in disgust. ``We are not all in
agreement with this agreement,'' she said bitterly. ``They say
there is peace, but I'm in black.''
</P>
<P>
   Her clothes were of mourning, she said, for relatives killed by
NATO bombings in Nis, where one of NATO's accidents of war put a
cluster bomb near a market and a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   There is significant bitterness toward Milosevic, but there is
much directed at what many Serbs consider American arrogance and
hypocrisy, where the language of human rights has clothed the naked
exercise of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I'm grateful to the Americans,'' said a prominent
Serbian journalist who asked anonymity. ``They make it clear that
the world is ruled by force. I'm almost sorry I don't live in North
Korea, with a nuclear bomb. Because then they wouldn't dare to have
done this to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksa Djilas, a historian and analyst of Milosevic's career,
said he would predict a new race by every little nation in the
world for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons in order to
prevent this kind of war from the air. ``Even if we had some
S-300's,'' the Russian version of the Patriot antiaircraft missile,
he said, ``the outcome might have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the loss of Kosovo now would fester, becoming
what Sudetenland _ German-populated territory in pre-World War II
Czechoslovakia _ was for the Germans, a potential cause for the
next war. And he is not alone in believing that this new, Western
protectorate over Kosovo, no matter how long it lasts, will be seen
by both the Serbs and the armed Kosovo Albanian rebels of the
Kosovo Liberation Army as a historic interlude before the next
chapter of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that some in the West see Serb nationalists as Nazis,''
Djilas said. But the Serbs, he added, ``see themselves as
Israelis,'' alone against the world if necessary but true to their
land and faith.
</P>
<P>
   Others simply want their sense of isolation to end, for the
borders and airports to reopen, so they and the world can once
again come and go.
</P>
<P>
   But others see a period of continued isolation and further
hardship, with the future only worse than the recent, terrible
past.
</P>
<P>
   In Zvezdara, the Bogics have applied for state and city aid for
war damage, and an official has come and taken photographs of their
house. But Mileta Bogic, 62, thinks they will not see any money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be like World War II,'' he said bitterly. ``Those who
were in the camps got nothing and the money all went to Broz,'' the
postwar leader of Yugoslavia known as Tito.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who care about Kosovo and its loss will learn to live
without it, he said. ``Soon, this war will only be real to the dead
and their families.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Getting your name on something at an art museum
usually requires a fat bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard A. and Evelyn Lauder donated $5 million to have the
Whitney Museum of American Art's fifth floor named after them.
Samuel J. and Ethel LeFrak gave $10 million to have their names put
on the rotunda of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. At the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, simply endowing a curatorship costs
more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Brooklyn Museum of Art, where having your name
on a label next to a painting now costs just $500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Under a program that began with a mailing to 15,000 people on
May 1, the museum is urging its members and visitors to ``be a
modern-day Medici'' and ``adopt a masterpiece'' from its permanent
collection. If $500 is too much, two people can sign on for $250
each. They can even adopt a work in memory of someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it might involve several hundred people eventually,''
said Arnold L. Lehman, the museum's director.
</P>
<P>
   Each work that is chosen _ ``adopted'' is a bit of a stretch,
because the money goes into a kitty for research and conservation
of the museum's holdings, not toward the upkeep of a particular
work _ will get a new wall label. It will go just below the one
that gives the names of the work, the artist and the donor, and
say, in the same size and style of type, ``This work of art has
been `adopted' in 1999 through the generosity of ...''
</P>
<P>
   The program, though, is raising eyebrows _ and questions. Does
it, as a few people believe, bring to the museum a populist touch
of mass? Or does it add a gratuitous touch of crass? Will other
museums feel compelled to follow?
</P>
<P>
   The critics say the program furthers the notion that art is a
commodity _ by their definition, something judged by its worth in
the marketplace instead of its intrinsic intellectual or esthetic
value. And they say the program lacks dignity and cheapens the
museum atmosphere. ``It's the ultimate mixing of commerce and the
heavenly,'' said Stephen E. Weil, a senior scholar at the
Smithsonian Institution's Center for Museum Studies.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of talk angers Lehman. ``All of these people are too
uptight,'' he said. ``Museums are not bastions of peace, quietude
and order. That's an elitist attitude and it's something we want to
stop. It's really annoying, when we're trying to bring people into
the building, to be told that this is tawdry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who holds a Yale Ph.D. in art history and became
director two years ago, sees ``adopt a masterpiece'' less as a way
to raise money than as a way to get more people involved with art.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at the Brooklyn museum, in contrast to the rising
tide at most other big art museums, was stagnant for many years, at
about 300,000 annually. Then Lehman arrived, with many new ways to
attract visitors, including ``First Saturdays,'' a monthly event
that waives the admission fee, keeps the museum open until 11 p.m.
and offers music and dancing as well as art. Attendance in the last
fiscal year was 585,000, helped by a big Monet exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the museum is also doing well and will end its
fiscal year on June 30 in better shape than its budget expected,
though a spokeswoman declined to provide details until the board
reviews them at its next meeting. Lately, Lehman has even begun to
think about expansion. ``No question, we are going to do a capital
campaign soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adopt a masterpiece,'' the first move during Lehman's tenure
to attract dispute, seems to be a first in the museum world, though
not elsewhere: programs to adopt a highway or a tree abound. New
Jersey Transit offers its train stations for adoption, the Central
Park Conservancy lets people sponsor park benches and Rutgers
University has let donors put their names on lockers in the
football team's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems annoyed by signs along a highway or plaques beneath
a tree. And Lehman pointed out that schools, synagogues and
churches sometimes engrave donors' names in stone walls and on
pews.
</P>
<P>
   But critics argue that art is different, an expression of genius
that is supposed to elicit thought and feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Museums always like to pretend they are above the commercial
realm, though in reality they are knee-deep in it, busily creating
items for their museum stores, promoting their restaurants, renting
out space for private events, selling corporate sponsorships and
otherwise trading in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   And as they raise money, most nonprofit organizations, including
museums, offe naming opportunities to donors; adopt-a-masterpiece
simply takes the concept to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look around and see names like Morgan, Vanderbilt and
Whitney on things,'' said Lehman, ``and now they can say: `I can do
that. I can do something that's valued, too.' For them, maybe this
is their first step toward philanthropy, and maybe in 20 years
they'll give a huge contribution.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   So far, about a dozen would-be Morgans from Brooklyn, Manhattan
and Westchester County have adopted artworks, said Peter B. Trippi,
the museum's vice director for development.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Mallin, a 65-year-old self-described ``professional
volunteer,'' and her husband, Joel, a lawyer, are an example. ``I
thought it was a great idea,'' Mrs. Mallin said. ``I do
fund-raising for other museums and I thought this is novel, this is
new. We collect contemporary sculpture, and we know that
conservation and maintenance is costly and ongoing. So this has
appeal.'' Mrs. Mallin and her husband chose a small model, known as
a maquette, for Rodin's ``Burghers of Calais.''
</P>
<P>
   Another donor, Sue Stoffel, a 41-year-old mother of three who is
already a member of the museum, said she ``jumped on'' the offer as
a way of increasing her support. Having recently moved to
Scarsdale, N.Y., after years of living in Switzerland, she picked
``A Storm in the Rocky Mountains'' by Albert Bierstadt, in part
because ``it looks very Swiss'' and her husband is Swiss. An
obvious enthusiast, she said, ``I will take my children and show
them and I will tell everyone about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other works chosen by donors are Georgia O'Keeffe's
``Brooklyn Bridge,'' George Caleb Bingham's ``Shooting the Beef''
and a mid-19th-century wood Luluwa sculpture of a maternity figure
from the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Trippi, who started the program, said he had decided to try it
when a look through the files turned up a half-hearted, early '90s
version of it. The museum had just completed renovating its west
wing, and as artworks were installed in the new galleries, it had
asked several donors and members to contribute $1,000 to sponsor an
object for three years. About 50 people did; each was cited as a
sponsor on a wall label that came down in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Trippi and Lehman decided to revive and revamp the idea with a
populist cast. They had 17,500 postcard solicitations printed and
mailed or distributed at the museum. ``It's now open to everyone,''
Trippi said, ``and we tried to make it more enticing.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Besides being noted on the wall label, participants will receive
an adoption certificate and a tour of the object's gallery with the
relevant curator (American art, African art, European art,
depending on the adopted work). Those who pay $500 a year are also
given membership in the relevant art council, a museum group that
is invited to gallery tours and lectures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envision this as a populist program to tie people to the
collection,'' Lehman said. ``I hope they'll think of the object as
a member of their immediate family. I'd love it if people came and
had their pictures taken with their objects, and brought their
friends to it and said, `That's my painting.' That's the kind of
pride I want to encourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee,'' he added, ``that in the future a lot of
institutions will be doing it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nonprofit organizations everywhere are looking for ways to
recognize donors. So far, $500 has not bought much more than a
place on a published list of contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Emily K. Rafferty, vice president for development at the Met,
said she doubted that it would follow Brooklyn's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a concept we've explored so I can't say we'd never do
it,'' she said. ``And I certainly respect what works for each
institution. But the concerns I have are that we may have donors
that have given the works or given money to purchase the works, and
their names are on the labels. We wouldn't want to confuse that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Met, with its wealth of donors, may not be typical, though.
Other museums are in a less enviable position. Weil of the
Smithsonian, for one, is sure that the idea will spread. ``Anything
that's meretricious is copied,'' he said.

AMONG EDUCATED RUSSIANS, RELIEF IS MIXED WITH SUSPICION OF U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ When Genrikh Borovik was running the Novosti news
agency's North American operations from New York in the late 1960s,
he was a tough critic of the Vietnam War. His friends back in the
Soviet Union saw it a bit differently: ``America was a role
model,'' he recalled last week. ``There were plenty of emotions,
sure. But at the same time, people said, `Nevertheless, America is
a very free place.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years and 180 degrees later, Borovik is a playwright and
television anchor in Moscow, and a man with some sympathy for the
United States' decision to join the war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And now he defends America to friends who believe the United
States is bent on world domination _ and that Russia was its
unwitting ally in the Kosovo peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, people would be much more satisfied if the bombing
would stop,'' Borovik said. ``But to Russians, the logic in `We'll
stop bombing if you leave your own country' is very difficult to
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Those same conflicting senses _ relief that the war appears near
its end mingled with suspicion of what many Russians see as the
desire of the United States to impose its will on the weak _ were
threads than ran through a conversation about Kosovo on Saturday
with several well-educated Muscovites.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered at a dacha some 20 miles south of Moscow to celebrate
St. Helen's Day _ observing saints' days has become something of a
revived tradition here, following the end of Communist rule _ they
alternated between penetrating comments on the accord and caustic
comments about the United States' role in it.
</P>
<P>
   Lena Budnik, 45, a physicist at a Moscow institute, repeated
what has become a cliche in some Moscow newspapers and journals:
that the war over Kosovo was initiated by the Pentagon so that the
U.S. military could test its advanced technology weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And she expressed puzzlement that Russia and Yugoslavia would
agree to what she called ``the NATO variant'' of a peace plan. All
that said, she nevertheless praised the Russian negotiator in the
Kosovo peace talks, former Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, as
``a life saver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our side is not happy with this. The foreign minister has said
he's not happy. But the fact that the bombing will be ended is
already good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Budnik mirrored what Borovik, the playwright, said is the
prevailing view among Russians these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is bothering people is not only that there is killing in
Yugoslavia, but people understand that maybe the whole thing is
happening because the U.S. is trying to show the world the new
order for the 21st century,'' he said in an interview Friday
evening. ``People think the United States is the owner of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Russian at the dacha party, was Vadim Obertyshev, 42, is
a successful businessman married to an American. He seemed to share
Borovik's view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply that the world is set up in such a way that the
strong beat up the weak,'' Obertyshev said. ``There's a double
standard and the strong are always right.''
</P>
<P>
   Obertyshev cast the peace negotiations as something of a
diplomatic stage show _ a play in which ``the main thing is for
everyone to come out with their head held up high, and that's more
or less what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The West understands that it can't keep rubbing Russia's face
in the dirt,'' he said, and so Russia occupied a central role in
the talks. But ``if they didn't want to agree,'' he added, ``then
Chernomyrdin wouldn't have been able to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitors to the dacha were unanimous that Russian troops
should go to Kosovo to enforce any final peace agreement, if only
because the Serbs who remain there need a sympathetic hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always two sides in these things. There are the
Serbs as well, and since the Serbs trust Russia, there should be
Russian troops,'' said Alexei Knizhnikov, 39, an ecologist who is
Ms. Budnik's brother. ``We shouldn't rush to try to solve the
problems of Kosovo. It doesn't matter at whose expense all this was
agreed on, as long as we stop the bombing.'
</P>
<P>
   Obertyshev was insistent that the peacekeepers should be under
United Nations command, and _ like most Russians and their media _
paid scant heed to the plight of the Kosovo Albanians driven from
home by Serbian forces, focusing instead on the loss of Serbian
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO took on too much in this conflict,'' he said. ``All of
this should not have been started _ the bombing. It should have
been decided by principles of the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps NATO might have been justified had Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic invaded another country, he added, echoing
another common view here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have been influenced in hundreds of other ways,'' he
said. ``But to send hundreds of innocent people to the grave for
nothing?''

KOSOVO REBEL FORCE WILL BE PROVINCE'S NEW POWER BROKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, the Albanian separatist movement
that remains heavily armed and deeply divided, is likely to become
the new power broker in the southern Serbian province under any
deal worked out between NATO and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Although it would be required to disarm under the peace plan,
the rebel group nonetheless seems certain to inherit effective
power in Kosovo, which is supposed to gain autonomy but remain part
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But there are already signs that getting the group's most
radicalized and distrustful members to hand over their weapons may
prove difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Factions within the group, whose leadership ranges across a
broad and sometimes bizarre ideological spectrum, are already
bitterly vying for control and have never shied from using violence
to settle scores among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   How that internal struggle plays out will help determine whether
the rebel group sanitizes itself and becomes a legitimate political
party or remains a nagging and dangerous thorn in the side of both
Belgrade and the NATO force that is now expected to keep peace in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces could well find themselves caught in the middle of a
feud between armed factions, something that took place in northern
Iraq when the two rival Kurdish factions fought pitched street
battles after the Persian Gulf war allies created a safe area and
Iraqi troops withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an insurgent group is stopped in its tracks, it is pretty
hard to unwind what has been wound up,'' said Jack Galvin, the dean
at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University and
a former NATO supreme allied commander in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect we will see a lot of reluctance on the part of a lot
of KLA members and some units to go out of business,'' he added.
``We are going to have to assume that there will be some kind of
trouble, especially with Serb police and military starting to move
out.''
</P>
<P>
   If rival fiefdoms solidify in Kosovo they will have to be
supplied with weapons, as they are now, from Albania. NATO troops,
under the agreement, will be in charge of monitoring the border
area. Any weapons trafficking could trigger clashes between
peacekeepers and armed smugglers bringing in supplies over the goat
tracks and trails that wind their way through the peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Further, it will be difficult for NATO troops to identify the
insurgents or warring antagonists, many of whom are often out of
uniform and have already hidden cashes of weapons in farm sheds and
crude underground bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leaders, many of whom have spent years in prison for
separatist activities, are likely to remain hardened to Serbian
promises, extremely wary of outside influence and secretive.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leadership is currently rife with divisions and ranges
from Marxist to fascist to Islamic radicals, and as part of the
peace plan it will be expected to settle, if not resolve, those
differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   But the group's commitment to democratic governance in Kosovo is
uncertain, even though the Kosovo Albanians who form its base made
up 90 percent of the province's 2 million people before the recent
expulsions began.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the group has presented itself as a liberation movement
that, as its spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said last year, did not have
a political platform because, ``We do not have time for such things
even if we were interested in them.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the advent of a settlement between NATO and Yugoslavia,
issues that have been put off by rebel commanders because of these
divisions _ like the shape and structure of a new government in
Kosovo _ will have to be addressed swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that can be done without unleashing bloodshed within
their own ranks is an open question. At least two rebel commanders
Ramush Hajredinaj and another known as ``Remi,'' each based in
different parts of the province, stand in open defiance of Hashim
Thaci, who has emerged as the nominal head of the guerrilla force.
</P>
<P>
   While Thaci has publicly accepted the peace plan it is not clear
that these men, as well as other commanders, will prove compliant,
especially if disarming means ceding power to Thaci. Thaci, in an
attempt to seize control, has already named a provisional
government, with himself as prime minister and close relatives in
key posts.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group has also spawned a rival armed faction, known as
the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosovo, funded and backed by
Bujar Bukosi, who served as the self-styled prime minister of
Kosovo under the leadership of Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   While the new group is small and poorly organized it took
control of some territory last year in central Kosovo, before
backing down after confrontations with superior Kosovo Liberation
Army units. Its armed cadre controls slices along the border with
Albania and may be able to rally disgruntled commanders to their
cause, especially given the millions of dollars raised by Bukosi
during his years in exile in Europe. The refusal to turn over this
money to the Kosovo Liberation Army has also angered Thaci.
</P>
<P>
   With the Serbs expected to pull out of the province these
factions will have to reconcile their differences peacefully,
something they have been unable to do, or battle each other for
control.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group cadre frequently brand Rugova, who for nearly a
decade led the struggle against Serbia and now advocates a peaceful
solution, ``a traitor.'' And televised pictures of Rugova meeting
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, and apparently calling for
reconciliation at the height of the bombing, has only deepened this
antipathy.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats say that Thaci has, in a move they find
troubling, already ordered the assassination of Bukosi. There have
also been death threats made against Rugova by lower ranking rebel
commanders, although Thaci publicly invited Rugova to join his
``government.''
</P>
<P>
   Those threats may be far from idle. Last year, a rebel commander
was assassinated in Tirana, the Albanian capital, a killing Western
diplomats have widely attributed to rivals within the guerrilla
movement.

OVERSIGHT AGENCIES GIVE CORNELL'S AIDS RESEARCH IN HAITI SCANT
REVIEW
</HEADLINE>
   (Sidebar to HAITI-CORNELL-AIDS; also moving in `i' news file) 
(rk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cornell's research in Haiti, like all federally funded studies,
is subject to extensive government rules intended to protect
patients from abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas projects are to be reviewed by two independent boards,
one in the United States at the sponsoring university, the other in
the country where the research is taking place. The boards, in
turn, are overseen by the Office of Protection from Research Risk,
which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
as well as by federal program officials who award the research
grants.
</P>
<P>
   But according to documents and interviews, Cornell's research on
couples in which one partner has AIDS has received scant scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The review board at Cornell, for example, appears to have taken
only a cursory look at the research procedures it renewed year
after year for the couples studies. When Marc Fleisher, the outside
member on a Cornell board made up mainly of university employees,
was read the statement used at the university's Port-au-Prince
clinic to inform subjects about the study, he derided it as
``doublespeak'' and ``just a lie.'' He was unaware that he himself
had twice approved the statement last year in board votes.
</P>
<P>
   The impartiality of the local board in Haiti is in question.
Documents show that its members include the husband of Dr.
Marie-Marcelle Deschamps, one of the study investigators; the
mother of Dr. Jacques Boncy, who heads the research clinic's lab,
and Dr. Gladys Taverne, the psychologist who originally designed
the clinic's HIV counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jean William Pape, the Cornell professor directing the
research in Haiti, said there was no conflict of interest. But Dr.
Tom Puglisi, a director in the Office of Protection from Research
Risk, which approved the composition of the board, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would consider it a conflict of interest for a family
member of an investigator to sit on the IRB,'' he said, referring
to the Haitian institutional review board. ``If that's in there and
we missed that, that's something we should have caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal documents show that the government failed to follow up
when officials did discover flaws in Cornell's research
arrangements. Puglisi's office demanded in 1996 that the clinic
change the statement read to patients, making explicit that
participation was voluntary and that counseling was available.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Warren D. Johnson, the chief of international medicine and
infectious diseases at the medical school, wrote back that the
changes had been made. But because of what he called a paperwork
oversight, this was not done.
</P>
<P>
   No one noticed. The National Institutes of Health renewed
Cornell's overall Haitian research grant, now more than $786,000 a
year, every year from 1985 through 1999. And in 1995, when Pape and
Dr. John L. Ho of Cornell applied to the institutes' Fogarty
International Center to add money for expanded couples research to
a $600,000 medical training grant, it was approved without
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Dr. Rodney Hoff, a program official in the
institutes' Division of AIDS, raised questions about the consent
procedures. Unaware that the expanded project was already under
way, he barred Cornell from the research on human subjects until it
revised the consent form. Since the revision, Cornell has suspended
the research again, but Johnson said there were plans to resume and
expand the study next year.

   GDANSK, Poland _ Pope John Paul II arrived Saturday in the
birthplace of the Solidarity movement that he sparked with his
first papal visit 20 years ago, offering Poles ``the greeting of a
fellow Pole who comes among you to fulfill the needs of his own
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the eighth return to Poland by John Paul II, and like
all the previous trips it is an emotional homecoming by a Pole, now
79, who has never masked his deep nostalgia for his native land.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's 13-day visit, the longest of his tenure to Poland, is
grueling, crammed with Masses and meetings that will take him _
sometimes by helicopter _ to 21 different towns. It is a thematic
kaleidoscope of his papacy, allowing him to relive historic
moments, revisit religious landmarks, greet old friends and also
weave his own personal story with that of his nation and the entire
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one thing is different: The visit may well be the
first time that the pope has returned to Poland without a dramatic
emergency awaiting him. ``You are coming to Poland at a time when
sovereignty, security, and fast economic progress are seen as a
normal thing,'' Poland's president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, a
former Communist, told the pope at the arrival ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   From his first, electrifying papal visit in 1979 to Gdansk,
where a workers' revolt against Communism eventually took fire
across all of Eastern Europe and spread, in the end, even to the
Soviet Union, to the last visit, in 1997, when former Communists
seemed poised to win parliamentary elections and the country was
divided over a new Constitution, fellow Poles have always met the
pope with a frenzied outpouring of affection _ and an urgent
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The affection, lavished on the aging and frail pontiff by tens
of thousands of Poles who lined his parade route to town Saturday,
holding up signs and shouting his name, has not slackened. But the
tension, urgency, and feverish excitement has ebbed.
</P>
<P>
   Poland still has troubles, yet 10 years after Communism
collapsed the pope is returning to a country where the president,
once a minister in a Communist government, has proved his
commitment to democracy and capitalism. Poland became a member of
NATO this spring. Since 1997, its Parliament has been dominated by
political parties that support democracy _ and heed the Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his pontificate, in Warsaw, John Paul II
will address a national Parliament. He chose Poland, because it is
Poland, and also because this month is the 10th anniversary of the
overthrow of Communism at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Poland was the first Eastern European country where democracy
was voted in by elections, a ballot box triumph that paved the way
later in 1989 for the collapse of the Berlin wall and the crumbling
of Communist rule in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and
Romania.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary address is also the pope's way of paying
homage to one European democracy that still appears willing to heed
his moral teachings. All three branches of government will be
represented at the meeting, as will the diplomatic corps. Religious
leaders, Catholic and non-Catholic, are also invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their presence is a way of showing that democracy should in
some way be bound by ethical values,'' said Joaquin Navarro-Valls,
the pope's spokesman. ``Not just those of the Catholic Church, but
all religions in Poland.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, however, it was the Catholic Church that lobbied
Parliament to pass a law that bans abortion in all cases except
when the mother is a rape victim or her life is at stake. A few
weeks before his visit, with the support of the Catholic Church,
the government finally removed the crosses at the Auschwitz camp at
Oswiecim that had been erected by Catholic extremists in defiance
of the Polish bishops, and arrested the ringleader _ swiftly
smoothing over a religious controversy that has helped poison
relations between Jews and Catholics for years.
</P>
<P>
   Poland is perhaps the only capitalist democracy where the
government has banned alcohol sales and removed billboards
featuring scantily clad models in every city and town the pope
visits. The pontiff is not a teetotaler, but the Polish authorities
worry that excess drinking could lead already excitable crowds to
unseemly public behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Poles are worried about that. Adam Michnik, a former
dissident who now edits the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, assured
fellow journalists that some bars would remain open. ``We are a
very Catholic country, but we are secular when it comes to
alcohol,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five percent of Poles are Catholic, and 75 percent
describe themselves as practicing believers, making Poland one of
the most devout countries in Europe. The pope, who is to meet on
several occasions with religious leaders of different faiths _
Eastern Orthodox, Jewish, Lutheran and Muslim _ will preach an
ecumenical message to a country that has not yet had much practical
experience in reaching out.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the conservative leader of
Poland's Catholic Church, seemed eager to embrace the pope's agenda
on this trip, conceding that ``there is also a need to work on
development of ecumenism, social justice and solidarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many intellectuals and liberals are hoping that the pope's
presence _ scarcely viewed as a liberalizing force among West
European Catholics _ will prod his conservative home church to be
more accepting. ``The Polish church is changing, and is more
accepting of democracy, but there is still a ways to go,'' said
Artur Domoslawski, a journalist who recently published a book about
John Paul II and his theological critics within the church that
caused a stir in a country that has yet to look critically at its
national hero. ``This visit is a chance for the pope to direct his
message of reconciliation also to the Polish church.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Poland is not exactly free of political tension or social
turmoil. The economy is relatively healthy, and even though its
growth rate has slowed, it is still expected to be 4 percent this
year _ twice that of many, more developed, European countries. Yet
economic reforms are painful, particularly in such traditional
fields as heavy industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, farmers have been using blockades and mass
protests to force the government to increase food prices and
forgive debts. The government last month granted concessions, such
as subsidies to grain producers, partly in hopes of staving off a
conflict during the pope's visit _ although such subsidies may
complicate Poland's hoped-for entry into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Kwasniewski told the pope that there was ``a large margin of
bitterness'' among those left behind in the economic and political
transformation of Poland, and conceded that ``the positive changes
of the last years have not spread evenly across the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of farmers' and other protesting unions who had asked
for an audience with the pope were rebuffed by Polish bishops,
mostly because their political representatives belong to parties
that are deeply opposed to the current government and unfriendly to
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say that the pope nevertheless insisted on adding two
stops to his schedule to towns where economic changes have cost
people jobs and security. The pope is also expected to meet with
miners and steelworkers in the industrial center of Silesia.
Restructuring plans for the aging and inefficient industries there
call for 140,000 layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has long warned against the economic injustices of
capitalism. In 1991, he scolded newly liberated Poles so sternly,
and perhaps prematurely, about morality and the dangers of Western
materialism that the visit was considered his least successful.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday he seemed mostly impressed by the economic and
social changes that have transformed a country he lived in during
the World War II occupation and Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The pope paid his respects to the ``cry of conscience'' that
rang out first in Gdansk, and led to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I notice with joy that our country has made great progress on
the path of economic development,'' John Paul II told the cheering
crowd. ``I pray unceasingly that Poland's material development will
increase at an equal rate with its spiritual development.''

ANALYSIS: A MATURING ELECTORATE REALIGNS SOUTH AFRICA'S
OPPOSITION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ When South Africa's 15,000 polling places have
been cleaned up, the white and blue election commission flags taken
down and the final votes counted, it may look as if nothing much
happened in last week's elections.
</P>
<P>
   President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress will have
the vast majority of the seats in Parliament, as it did before. The
man who was running the day-to-day affairs of the country, Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki, will officially become president _ and go on
running the country.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition? Well, it won't be any bigger than before.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look reveals a sea change. Parties that have long
histories in this country virtually died in this election. One new
one got a foothold that will keep two potent personalities in the
headlines. Though the opposition numbers are still tiny, the
African National Congress may end up facing a far livelier
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Change may come from Mbeki, too. In the last few months, he has
sent strong signals that a major housecleaning is just around the
corner. A few weeks before the election, he fired three of the
country's nine provincial premiers in one bold stroke. Even before
that, several of the party's oldest and least effective Cabinet
ministers quietly announced that they would be retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki said recently that he would not appoint ``politically
popular'' ministers who were not very hard-working. ``This is not a
status thing,'' he said of membership in the Cabinet. ``This is a
working thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's Cabinet was a complex quilt, constructed not so much
for competence as to create a huge unifying umbrella at a time when
the country's peace was fragile. It reached out to as many
constituencies as possible and included almost every kind of South
African, from white Afrikaners to former guerrilla fighters, labor
leaders, Communists, a Zulu chief and a Pondo princess.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Mbeki is signaling a different organizing
principle _ the ability to administer. He is heeding the voters'
call, and the ANC may get even more than the 62.6 percent it got
last time. But it had to work for that support. Early on, the party
was down in the polls, huge numbers of voters were undecided and,
with crime high and jobs scarce, complaining was the national
pastime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Thabo Mbeki heard all that,'' said Chris Landsberg,
the deputy director of the nonprofit Center for Policy Studies
here.
</P>
<P>
   South African racial barriers were not broken in this election.
The majority of blacks stuck to the African National Congress.
Nonblacks went elsewhere. But there was a great deal of movement
among the opposition parties. The big loser was the New National
Party, which gave South Africa apartheid and ruled for more than 40
years. In 1994, it finished with 20 percent of the vote and the
title of official opposition. This time the count suggests that it
will not get more than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Its core supporters _ white Afrikaners _ jumped ship for the
liberal Democratic Party, a party that was founded on the principle
of opposition to apartheid and is now led by a feisty lawyer, Tony
Leon.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller Freedom Front, an Afrikaner party dedicated to
establishing a ``volkstaat'' where Afrikaners can rule themselves,
also lost most of its support, dropping from 2 percent of the vote
in the last election to less than 1 percent in this one.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of the Afrikaner vote, say many analysts, shows
that while Afrikaners are not yet ready to vote for a black-led
party, they have at least abandoned their ethnic fraternities and
begun voting on the issues. Many Afrikaners see the Democratic
Party, with its emphasis on individual rights, federalism and a
willingness to duke it out with the African National Congress, as
their best protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``However you look at it, it's a big deal for them,'' said Tom
Lodge, a political analyst with the University of the
Witwatersrand. ``They moved to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon's party had only seven members in Parliament last time and
yet managed to dominate the opposition, leading battles against
affirmative action, corruption and trade legislation that was
likely to anger the United States and Britain. Now, with at least
five times as many seats, the party will surely keep the fire under
the ANC's toes.
</P>
<P>
   One of South Africa's most interesting political phenomena has
been the emergence of the United Democratic Movement, founded by
Bantu Holomisa, a black former African National Congress official
thrown out of the party for insubordination, and Roelf Meyer, an
Afrikaner who left the National Party when the old guard was
unwilling to make the changes he thought necessary.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, the party was often involved in violent
confrontations with ANC supporters, which may have blackened its
image for potential white backers. As the votes were counted, it
was clear that Holomisa and Meyer were disappointed in their 3
percent share.
</P>
<P>
   But it is enough to give the United Democratic Movement a sure
toehold in Parliament and government funds to continue. It was not
eligible for a dime as it tried to begin its campaign, yet it
clearly worried the African National Congress, which spent the last
few weeks trashing Holomisa as an apartheid-era puppet.
</P>
<P>
   The elections also seemed to sound the death knell for the
Pan-Africanist Congress, which in the 1960s was the ANC's chief
rival. Many young blacks sympathize with its ``Africans first''
rhetoric, but its leadership crippled itself with infighting and it
was incompetent both in Parliament and in campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   As early election results came in showing it getting less than 1
percent of the vote, its leader, the Rev. Stanley Mogoba, offered
to resign.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York City will have to dust off decades-old files to
determine the value of the 116-year-old Brooklyn Bridge. California
will have to value hundreds of miles of eight-lane freeways. And,
hundreds of cities will struggle to tally up the cost of schools,
jails and sewers built many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The group that sets the standards for how the nation's 84,000
state and local governments keep their books is expected to approve
a plan this week that would require them to operate more like
businesses, providing taxpayers with a more complete picture of
what their dollars buy.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which has attracted little publicity, has
nonetheless prompted hundreds of cities, towns and other local
governments to deluge the rule makers with letters predicting how
difficult and costly it will be to comply. Municipalities say they
are already overburdened by work associated with the Year 2000
computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   But citizens groups laud the plan, saying it will eventually arm
taxpayers with new information that will help them understand when
their politicians are spending too little, as well as when their
ambitions have grown too large.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would fundamentally change the way that government
officials look at almost all financial decisions, from spending on
infrastructure to borrowing money to selling properties. But most
significantly, it would make many costs that are now hidden and
shifted to future administrations far more apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a major step in the right direction,'' said
Roland Calia of the governmental Research Association, which
represents dozens of taxpayer groups across the nation. ``This will
help people raise questions about what their government is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For many government officials, who until now have been allowed
to live in the moment _ recognizing cash only when it comes in and
costs only when the checks have been sent _ the changes are nothing
short of momentous. Even officials who applaud the new rules say
that the costs of compliance are frightening. Under the most
significant and controversial change, governments will for the
first time have to calculate the value of nearly every major asset
they own, from roads to bridges to prisons to hospitals, even if
those assets were acquired or built decades ago. Until now, the
value of those projects vanished from view on financial statements
almost the moment the money was spent.
</P>
<P>
   To comply, governments say they will have to hire armies of
accountants, engineers, consultants and appraisers to come up with
the numbers, money that could be spent on worthier causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to think, `I'm just not sure what I'm
going to do,''' said Jake Lorentz, assistant director at the
Government Finance Officers Association, a Chicago-based group of
more than 14,000 state and local officials. That group has opposed
the new rules because of the costs it would impose, especially on
the smallest cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   The Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which is at the
heart of the firestorm, has not been the object of such heated
debate since it began setting rules in 1984. Based in Norwalk,
Conn., the group's seven voting members are scheduled to approve
Statement No. 34 on Thursday. Its 200 pages of particulars are
expected to impact nearly every government in America, except the
federal government, which writes its own rules. Board chairman Tom
Allen, the former auditor of Utah, said he expected unanimous
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the board retreats, the largest governments would start
using the rules for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2001.
Smaller governments would have one or two more years to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The rule makers have already made concessions in a few crucial
areas to appease critics.
</P>
<P>
   Governments with fewer than $10 million in annual revenues will
not be required to go back and put a value on their existing
infrastructure. But in future years, they would be bound to the
same rules as everyone else. And all governments would be exempt
from having to establish values for assets that were acquired more
than 25 years ago, unless significant renovations have taken place.
Thus, the Brooklyn Bridge might have escaped the process, but it
was renovated around the time of its centennial in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another concession, the board is also prepared to allow
the governments to estimate the cost of historic projects if that
is easier than going back through old records and determining the
actual expense. And governments will have another four years from
the effective date of the rules to include the cost of projects
built before the new rules were adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, much work will be required. In New York state, for
instance, officials must value 37,000 miles of state-owned roads
and 7,800 bridges as well as assign values to hundreds of
university classrooms, state hospitals and prisons.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Sam McCall, the state's deputy auditor general, said
accountants would have to determine the cost of the giant Sunshine
Skyway Bridge that spans Tampa Bay and was built in 1987. ``In the
past, we've taken the position that bridges were not going to be
sold, so we haven't recorded it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By forcing states and cities to include the cost of bridges and
roads on their annual financial statements, McCall said that it
would not be so easy to put off necessary repair and maintenance
when money is tight. ``If you don't fix a pothole, it only gets
bigger,'' he said. ``This is progress.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The board can not legally enforce its rules. But most state and
local governments are now required to abide by the board's
standards as a condition of the municipal bonds they issue. And, in
some states, lawmakers have passed legislation requiring cities and
towns to follow the accounting board's rules. And unless they
comply fully, governments could not expect their outside auditors
to endorse their financial statements, a red flag that would invite
taxpayer scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The board has been debating the wisdom of these new rules almost
since its inception, especially since there is no easy answer just
how to arrive at the values government officials are now expected
to produce. Should a bridge be reported at original cost,
replacement value or at some combination? Should those numbers be
adjusted for inflation? If it is architecturally significant, does
that matter?
</P>
<P>
   For now, the board has settled on relying largely on what
governments actually spent in building or acquisition costs. Those
numbers would decrease for each year of wear and tear, or increase
if the government was spending on meaningful improvements. As
vexing as all that is, governments also have to hazard a guess on
how many years those highways, bridges, prisons, schools,
firetrucks and other assets might last.
</P>
<P>
   With that information, governments' willingness to undertake
certain projects _ and what taxpayers understand about those
projects _ will almost certainly change.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a state that builds a prison for $100 million and
expects the building to last for 50 years would show $2 million in
building costs each year under the proposal. Currently, however,
the state would just report a one-time expense of $100 million in
the year the prison was built. In later years, voters who look at
the financial statements would see salaries for correctional
officers but nothing for the prison walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't known in the past what it cost to operate a
prison,'' McCall said. ``This will help people understand what it
costs to operate the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed system, voters would see the total cost of
operating the correctional system, allowing them to weigh the
trade-offs between building prisons and, for instance, paying for
projects that keep people out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another significant break with the past, governments
would no longer be able to shift a cost to the next year simply by
delaying payment. Until now, governments have been allowed to wait
to record an expense until a bill was paid, a financial maneuver
that is like allowing consumers to pretend they did not owe money
on purchases charged to their credit cards. But the new rules will
require governments to accrue costs in the same way businesses do.
For example, a cost will be recorded when office supplies are
delivered, not when the bill is eventually paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has been like a little family checkbook,'' said
Wilbur Ross, executive managing director of Rothschild Inc., who
has advised New York City on some financial matters in the past.
``That is no way to run a thing as big and complicated as a city
like New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Far less controversial is a proposal to require governments to
prepare one comprehensive financial statement to account for all
the money coming in and going out. Now, governments account for
their services in many different funds, which has confused both
citizens and financial experts.
</P>
<P>
   But governments would also be encouraged to provide more
detailed breakdowns on specific services so that taxpayers can more
easily spot how much it costs to provide police protection, run the
schools, pick up garbage, or operate amenities like public golf
courses.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting board is also poised to require government
managers to answer for themselves, much the way executives of
public companies do. Each fiscal year, elected officials would have
to give taxpayers ``an objective and easily readable analysis'' of
the government's financial performance. Government officials will
have to explain such things as why they sold a large piece of land
or issued millions of dollars in bonds. And for the first time,
officials must explain why they spent more than was approved in the
budget at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens will be able to see government as a whole so that
there can no longer be any games played simply by moving things
around,'' said Andrew S. Rein, who has spent years trying to track
how the governments of New York City and New York state spend
taxpayer money as a research analyst for the Citizens Budget
Office, a nonprofit group. ``They will have a much better view of
what is going on.''

FORMER INSIDER STILL HOPES LEADERS WILL RETHINK TIANANMEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Since last year, Bao Tong, a former senior Communist
Party official, has been prodding and exhorting China's leaders to
rethink their verdict on June 4, 1989, when soldiers used guns to
quash a massive pro-democracy protest, killing hundreds in and
around Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Bao, the highest government official jailed after the crackdown,
spent seven years in prison, followed by two years of house arrest,
for sympathizing with the protesters. He was released in May 1998
and quickly started talking publicly from time to time about the
incident that still haunts him.
</P>
<P>
   The killings are never openly discussed or written about in
China, except for government statements that the decision to call
in soldiers was necessary to quell ``a counterrevolutionary
rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   No one of Bao's stature has been willing to condemn the
Tiananmen killings publicly. In the tense week leading up to the
10th anniversary of the event, he intensified his efforts, writing
commentaries for liberal Hong Kong newspapers about the need to
reassess Tiananmen and discussing this strictly taboo subject on
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Tiananmen killing is not condemned, China is unlikely
to fundamentally achieve long-term political stability,'' he said
in a recent interview, adding, ``The issue will not die away.''
</P>
<P>
   As the top aide in 1989 to Zhao Ziyang, who was then president,
Bao was witness to many of the decisions that sent tanks rolling
into Beijing on June 3 that year. When Bao looks at a dais holding
the Central Committee members, he knows who supported negotiating
with the students and who supported firing on them.
</P>
<P>
   Many high officials, prominent academics and company leaders who
supported the students and recoiled at the thought of sending in
troops later lost their jobs in 1989, and now live in quiet
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Bao, a young-looking 66, has chosen a different route, and says
plainly that he considers the killings both a national tragedy and
a political error.
</P>
<P>
   Under constant surveillance, he treads on China's most forbidden
territory, seemingly oblivious to the minefields, most notably the
possibility that he will be rearrested.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese police have repeatedly warned him not to give
interviews and have prevented him from meeting visitors, but have
gone no further, perhaps because they fear the outcry that more
aggressive action would prompt here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that the police are ``generally rather polite and
well mannered,'' preventing face-to-face interviews, but not
usually interfering with phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his precarious position, Bao is a direct and
relentlessly upbeat man. Interviewed for a book that will be
published outside of China later this month, he calls his life
``very relaxed,'' centered around reading, calligraphy, shopping,
taking his granddaughter to school and tutoring her in math.
</P>
<P>
   Bao told the interviewer, an exiled Chinese journalist named
Zhang Weiguo, that his relations with the government were
``normal,'' adding, tongue in cheek, ``The government is probably
extremely concerned with my safety, and there are probably many
people who spend every moment of every day worrying about me.''
</P>
<P>
   They may have good reason: There remains much discomfort within
senior government circles about the Tiananmen killings, and Bao is,
to many, a respected old comrade.
</P>
<P>
   When Bao was hospitalized several years ago, his medical chart
indicated that he should pay his own bills, as a former convict and
disgraced party member. But on seeing his name, the doctors and
nurses decided not to charge him.
</P>
<P>
   As a former insider, Bao has produced writings that have
provided some insight into the decision-making process that called
in the troops, though he has been circumspect about pointing
fingers at those still in power.
</P>
<P>
   China's leadership was deeply divided on how to respond to the
protests, Bao said in an interview, with Supreme Leader Deng
Xiaoping supporting a ``crackdown on rebellion'' and Zhao wanting
to negotiate with them ``based on democratic principles and rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the public didn't know was that Zhao's policy had
obtained support of a majority at both the Politburo meetings of
May 8 and May 10,'' Bao said. ``But Deng Xiaoping tragically
overruled Zhao and I continue to believe that most of the senior
leaders did not want to see a crackdown and a halt to political
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhao was toppled just after June 4 and has been under house
arrest ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Zhang, Bao said that in 1989 ``what might
have been a tremendous opportunity for kick-starting political
reform was destroyed, and we took a road backward.'' He noted that
while students may have been too uncompromising, the government
bears responsibility for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``My own thinking at the time was that I expected
reform would suffer a setback, but I never imagined they would
actually open fire on ordinary Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the troops came in to Beijing, Bao was brought to
Qincheng Prison, where he was imprisoned for the next seven years;
he never saw another inmate. He was originally charged in part with
passing news of the crackdown to the students.
</P>
<P>
   Bao was questioned extensively in an effort to understand which
of his former colleagues shared his pro-student views. ``But sadly
I'm indolent by nature, and not much of a socializer,'' he told
Zhang. ``So apart from regular work I didn't have much to confess
or impart.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his experiences, Bao is an inveterate optimist,
believing that current leaders may at some point reverse their
verdict on Tiananmen _ even though they have said they will ``never
reappraise it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he takes issue with the common wisdom that the current
leaders will not rethink June 4 because it would undermine their
authority; Li Peng, the Communist Party's second in command, was
premier in 1989 and declared martial law.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Communist party clearly believes that reassessing the
killings on June 4 will open a Pandora's box, signaling to people
that may once again aggressively speak out in their demands for
political change. In the days leading up to the 10th anniversary,
the center of Beijing was a picture of precaution, filled with
uniformed and plain-clothed police.
</P>
<P>
   But Bao argues that the leadership would actually score points
by opening discussion of a bloody event that still weighs heavily
on the minds of ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The current approach ``is a policy of mobilizing fear,'' he
said. ``But in my view, if the change could be initiated by the
highest authorities, the gain for China would be maximized and the
risk to them minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   Government leaders have not listened to his advice, of course,
and speaking out has had a cost. Bao applied a year ago for a
passport to visit his son in the United States. He has made a dozen
visits to various government offices, who all say they cannot
accept his application.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``It seems the whole public security apparatus doesn't
know where I can send my application.''

AS VOTE NEARS, INDONESIA BRACES FOR RESULT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia steps into the unknown on Monday
with a highly complex parliamentary election in which, even if
everything goes smoothly, the outcome is sure to cause confusion
and protests.
</P>
<P>
   All across this huge archipelago, with its population of more
than 200 million, supporters of 48 parties have been celebrating
the country's first free election in a generation with a campaign
that has all the euphoria of a victory rally. Helicopters shower
crowds with leaflets, daring young men climb tall monuments to hang
strings of flags and convoys of buses wind through the streets with
sure-footed youngsters dancing on their roofs.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest Islamic nation, repressed for three decades
by former President Suharto, is pouring all its hopes for change
into this vote. Many are going to lose, a prospect they may not be
prepared to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of hope,'' said Annette Clear, an American
election monitor. ``The danger of violence comes later, when
people's hopes are dashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's tortuous and obscure electoral process, unfolding
one year after Suharto's forced resignation, seems almost intended
to cause consternation.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's ballot, a tally of 30 percent or 35 percent by any
one party will be considered a victory in the overcrowded field,
but that will be only the first step in the competition for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition-building will come next, and even that will be just
the beginning of a process _ filled with pitfalls _ that could last
into November.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem, among many, is that the 462 representatives to
be elected on Monday will constitute only two-thirds of an assembly
that will choose Indonesia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plurality of the leading party will probably be no more
than one-third,'' said Eric Bjornlund of the National Democratic
Institute, an American organization that is helping monitor the
election. ``That adds up to one-third of two-thirds. That's it.''
No one political party, therefore, will be able to stake out a
clear future for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of the 700 presidential electors will include 38
members of the military; 35 appointed representatives of sectoral
groups like religious leaders and civil servants and 165 regional
representatives to be chosen by the country's 27 provincial
assemblies, whose members will also be elected on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, on the eve of the election, the details of the
procedures for choosing the sectoral and regional representatives
still have not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   As this untested process plays out, members of what seems to be
the winning party, who may dance in the streets next week, could
bit by bit see their victory taken from them. Vote manipulation,
money-politics and back-room dealing, as well as the legitimate
workings of the electoral system, may dull their joy.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, many will be dissatisfied. There are Islamic
parties who see this as their chance to win greater influence.
There are human rights groups hoping for unprecedented freedoms.
There are populists for whom the election is the chance for a
wholesale redistribution of the nation's wealth. There are the
perennially affronted student groups, who it seems will be
satisfied with nothing short of utopia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those groups share a common opponent, Golkar, the party
of Suharto, which won every election during his 32 years in power
and is still the incumbent party, with the current president, B.J.
Habibie, as its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Golkar has looked comparatively weak during the campaign, not
daring to fly its yellow flags in some areas dominated by the
opposition. But it could still wrench its way back into power
through its political savvy, money and control of the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   It also appears to be politically strong in the outlying islands
of Indonesia, far from the showy parades of the political center on
the main island of Java, where a victory by opposition parties
sometimes gives the appearance of being inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   If Golkar is not crushed in Monday's vote, it may be able to
count in the presidential election assembly on the support of the
military bloc, which was a pillar of Suharto's old regime, as well
as on a disproportionate share of the provincial delegates, many of
whom are likely to be career Golkar functionaries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, elected representatives have no legal obligation to
stick with their parties, and the potential price of a
parliamentary seat is rumored to run into the hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   With the raucous campaigns amounting to a show of force and
electoral momentum, particularly by the opposition party of
Megawati Sukarnoputri, the danger is that the losers may not accept
the results, said Donald K. Emmerson, an expert on Indonesia at the
University of Wisconsin who is now in Jakarta to observe the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a kind of over-optimism on the part of many parties,
and if Golkar, for example, gets a plurality, a number of
Indonesians won't need to know anything more about the elections,''
he said. ``They'll conclude that somebody must have cheated on a
massive scale _ even though, to be fair, that may not be the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the picture recently at a voter education center in
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a free and fair election?'' came the question.
</P>
<P>
   The answer: If Golkar wins, the election was not free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is what some analysts, in a sort of hangover of
cloak-and-dagger caution, like to call the ``Cendana factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Cendana is the home of Suharto, the ever-smiling, ever-enigmatic
former leader who many people still believe is the most potent
political force in the country _ a billionaire with good friends in
the military and the country's best network of powerful contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have the possibility of Cendana obstruction,'' said
Kenneth D. Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   For all their expertise on Indonesia's election system, said his
colleague, Bjornlund, ``We've never figured out the Cendana
factor.''

ARAB DISUNITY STANDS IN WAY OF NEGOTIATING WITH ISRAELIS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ The election of a new Israeli government has
rekindled Arab hopes for renewed Middle East peace talks, but an
enduring rift between Syria and the Palestinians has blocked an
effort to forge a common Arab stand.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff has been intensely frustrating to many Arab
commentators, who see Ehud Barak's election as Israel's prime
minister as an opportunity for progress toward a broader Middle
East peace but believe the Arabs will be strongest if they can
speak with one voice.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who was elected three weeks ago, has signaled a
willingness to resume peace talks with the Palestinians, Syria and
Lebanon, possibly as early as mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   After Barak's election, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had
tried to bring those parties together with Egypt and Jordan to
coordinate their stands. But on Friday, he was quoted as saying
that he had abandoned that effort for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot press for the convening of the meeting because there
is a Palestinian-Syrian rift,'' Mubarak told the state-owned
Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram.
</P>
<P>
   The infighting is regarded as a problem by Arab experts because
of the nature of the issues that might soon be on the negotiating
table, including the fate of Jerusalem, and of the Palestinian
refugees scattered across the Arab world. The concern is that these
issues might become submerged by the bickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that the five would-be participants open the
lines of communication and hash out the issues,'' The Daily Star, a
Beirut newspaper, wrote in an editorial on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many differences to be sorted out,'' it continued,
``and probably a few apologies to be made if, as Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad said not too long ago, the Arabs are to make peace
with each other before heading into any serious attempt to do so
with the Israelis.''
</P>
<P>
   While Egypt and Jordan made their own peace with Israel, and the
Palestinians have started down that road, Syria and Lebanon have
not. What still separates the Palestinians and the Syrians is the
decision made in 1993 by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to agree
to the step-by-step peace with Israel spelled out in the accords
worked out secretly in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has never forgiven Arafat for taking that step, which left
Syria and Lebanon isolated as the only front-line Arab states still
technically at war with Israel, and that resentment still runs
deep.
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, Syria's bitter criticism still rankles,
as does the fact that Syria and Lebanon still play host to Arafat's
enemies, in the form of Palestinian factions like the militant
Islamic groups Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Farouq al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister, said on a visit
to Lebanon last week that the differences between the Arabs would
not have been reconciled by a day or two of pomp and pageantry _ a
scathing reference to the summit meeting that Egypt had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the election of Barak, an apparent dove compared with his
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been seen as tantalizing by
many Arab politicians, although most take pains to disguise their
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the withdrawal of an Israeli-backed militia from
an enclave in southern Lebanon, although not related to Barak's
election, is being seen as a possible prelude to the full-scale
Israeli withdrawal from its occupation zone along the Lebanese
border that Barak has said would take place within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this much: Barak cannot be worse than Netanyahu,''
Lebanon's prime minister, Selim al-Hoss, said in an interview here
this week. Nevertheless, Hoss said: ``We are reluctant to wager on
Barak.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lebanon, and for Syria, the very prospect of further Israeli
withdrawals poses difficulties. Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon, has been a crucial backer of the Hezbollah guerrillas,
whose 17-year campaign against the Israeli occupation force has
been instrumental in forcing Israel to consider a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah campaign in Lebanon, the last active front in the
Arab-Israeli conflict, has in effect been Syria's main pressure
point on Israel _ and a tool for efforts to force Israel to
renounce its annexation of Syria's Golan Heights, a front that the
Syrian government has preferred remain quiet.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel were to withdraw from Lebanon, Syria would be left
without that pressure point, so both Lebanon and Syria have refused
to discuss the issue except as part of peace talks involving all
three parties.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak and the Egyptians clearly believe that such a stance
will be more effective if it is echoed by all of Israel's immediate
neighbors. ``A five-way meeting of these states must be held,'' he
was quoted as saying in Al Ahram on Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Beyond this Denver suburb, public figures
from Vice President Al Gore to Gary Bauer, the conservative
Republican running for president, have praised Cassie Bernall as a
symbol of everything that is right with young people today.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbine High School, Miss Bernall is considered a martyr.
In the churches and prayer groups that define life for many people
here, Columbine students repeat the story of how on April 20, as
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went through the school library
shooting classmates, one of them pointed a gun at her and asked
whether she believed in God. Miss Bernall, a 17-year-old who had
been born again only recently, said yes, and then the gunman killed
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's definitely a hero,'' said Ben Schumann, 15, a member of
the youth group at St. Frances Cabrini, a Roman Catholic church
with an evangelical bent. ``If I was ever faced with a situation
like that, I hope I could do what she did. I love God that much
that I would give my life because he gave his life for us.''
</P>
<P>
   While Miss Bernall, in death, has become a kind of celebrity _
her mother, Misty Bernall, has a contract to write a book about her
daughter's religious conversion _ she was part of a broad Christian
community here. Though in many ways her final act might strike
people as extraordinary, in her life in Littleton she was in many
ways just another teen-ager active in her church.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the shooting, as people groped for
explanations, much was made of the cliques at Columbine High
School. But for all the talk of the jocks, preps and trench-coat
mafia, it was their faith that bound Miss Bernall and many of her
peers. They spurned the counselors brought in by their school and
instead went to their churches. They proclaimed themselves
satisfied with an answer that explained nothing about Columbine
High School or the community around it or American society: They
are all in God's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gathered up his army of angels and protected as many
people as he could,'' said Sara Martin, a graduating senior who
belonged to the youth group at West Bowles Community Church, part
of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, where Cassie Bernall was a
member. ``The whole school was meant to blow up. Good always
overpowers evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The students' comments after the shooting serve as a vivid
reminder of how strong a role religion plays in the lives of people
in Colorado and other parts of the country, but they also suggest
why evangelical faith is spreading, particularly among the young:
In a society that seems unanchored, it provides certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally believe that God always wants the best for us, no
matter what,'' said Matt Bruce, a Columbine sophomore who belongs
to the youth group at St. Frances, and who was in the cafeteria
when the shooting began. ``Was God trying to test us? That was
never a question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like there were thousands of angels in there protecting
people, helping people,'' he went on. ``A lot of people might feel
that God abandoned people. I feel like he came through
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say adolescence is a prime time for seeking spiritual
meaning along with personal identity. They say that as many
teen-agers rebel, experiment and test widely different beliefs _
Miss Bernall, before being born again, had been dabbling in
witchcraft and fighting with her parents, according to her
minister, the Rev. George Kirsten _ evangelical churches stand out
in their ability to take teen-agers seriously, for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that this generation is in a
search mode spiritually,'' said Greg Laurie, pastor of the Harvest
Christian Fellowship in Riverside, Calif., who leads crusades
across the country. ``So many of them have been raised in an amoral
culture, without absolutes, without values, and so the result is
that many of them have been searching for meaning and finding it in
a relationship with Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our crusades, I very unapologetically declare the Bible as
truth. I say, `Here's how to know God.' They're very responsive to
that. They want somebody to just get up there and say, `Here it
is.'''
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings at Columbine, attention focused on a loose
group of friends known as the trench coat mafia that sometimes
included Harris and Klebold. Less noticed was Columbine's Bible
Club, which has some 70 members who meet weekly at 6:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible Club includes popular students like Miss Martin, one
of the speakers at commencement last month. Like Miss Bernall, she
said, she made her own spiritual journey recently, joining the
Bible Club and the youth group at West Bowles only after dabbling
in everything from Catholicism to Zen Buddhism. ``I was kind of two
different people,'' Miss Martin said. ``With my friends, I was
totally crazy, loud, obnoxious. Talk about lonely: I would go home
and say, `God, I know you're there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zen Buddhism was ``cool,'' but not for her. ``I didn't get why
you would want to attain nothingness,'' she said. ``I've always
believed in somethingness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 another Columbine student, Craig Nason,
invited her to his church, West Bowles, for a concert by Kry, the
Christian rock group. ``Craig was totally out there,'' she said.
``He was so friendly.'' She wanted to know Nason's secret. ``When
you see someone who has joy _ grounded joy _ you want to know
what's going on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the concert, Miss Martin participated in an altar call,
stepping forward and committing herself to Jesus Christ. ``Every
other religion I could dip in and out of,'' she recalled. ``This
was, like, `boom!' This could change your life.''
</P>
<P>
   West Bowles is a member of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church,
a small, theologically conservative denomination established in
1981. But it had plenty of kindred spirits. The youth group has
about 300 members, and half the 1,200 parishioners are under 25.
</P>
<P>
   In step with a generation that a West Bowles spokesman, Charles
Moore, described as ``more familiar with a talk show format than
with religious cathedrals,'' the church resembles a theater, with
individual seats rather than pews, a large orchestra pit and stage
area, and a huge screen where videos are shown on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the youth group hang out together several evenings a
week, studying Scripture, playing Frisbee, volunteering at a
halfway house for recovering drug addicts and former prison inmates
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The church, Moore said, is an antidote to the rootlessness of
the sprawling Colorado suburbs. ``There is no semblance of
community anymore,'' he said. ``It's such a mobile, high-tech
culture. That's one of the things we're trying to counter. There is
a strong emphasis on relationship building. This becomes the center
of their social lives.''
</P>
<P>
   With the church as their center, the students find it easier to
resist peer pressure to drink, and have sex, they said. ``Our love
for Christ gets us high,'' Nason said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the shooting, many Columbine students found
a refuge in church. ``We kid ourselves if we can't relate to Eric
and Dylan,'' Nason said. ``We've all felt that emptiness and
rejection. I call it a God-sized hole.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At St. Frances Cabrini, where two of the 12 students murdered,
Daniel Mauser and Matt Kechter, were members, Ben Schumann and the
other members of his youth group talked and cried and prayed
together.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Bartlett, a junior, explained why she didn't want to talk
to professional counselors. ``Counselors just seem to go, `Uh, huh,
I'm sorry,''' she said. ``They can't say, `I won't promise this
won't happen again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of seminarians came down, and talking with the
seminarians was a really big help. They just knew what to say. They
referred everything back to our faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Bartlett and Schumann and their friends say the shooting
has strengthened their faith. But the youth minister at St.
Frances, Jim Beckman says others have been deeply shaken. He has
been having long talks with one 16-year-old Columbine student in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I don't think I can come to church right now,'''
Beckman said. ``I told him, `Hey, dude, you just went through one
of the most traumatic experiences of your life. You need to doubt;
you need to wrestle.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The members of Beckman's youth group see God's presence clearly
in the events of April 20. ``All those people died for a reason,''
said Charise Walters, 16, a sophomore. ``God was with them every
step of the way. He chose them for some special reason.''

   Asked about Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the members of the
youth group declared that they had forgiven them. ``I pray they're
in heaven,'' Miss Walters said.

HISTORIANS FIGHT TO SAVE CLEVELAND'S ORE UNLOADERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ill.)   By KRISTIN OHLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ It may seem hard to imagine now, but Cleveland's
four Hulett Automatic Ore Unloaders used to mount a mesmerizing
show on the lake front, west of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   From 1912 until 1992, these 96-foot behemoths lumbered along the
shore, leaning forward and sinking their jaws into the bellies of
Great Lakes ships, taking 17-ton bites of iron ore and spitting
them into nearby rail cars. They looked like a family of grazing
dinosaurs as they dipped forward, reared back again, and rumbled
their odd, metallic song.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huletts are now rusting quietly at the edge of the
Cleveland Bulk Terminal, rendered obsolete by a new generation of
ships equipped with unloading systems that discharge 10,000 tons of
ore an hour. Less quiet is the debate between the Huletts' owners
and preservationists, who have been wrangling to save the machines
from demolition.
</P>
<P>
   The battle might end on Thursday, when the Cleveland Landmarks
Commission is to decide then whether to allow the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority to raze three of the
Huletts and dismantle a fourth for storage, or to grant a second _
and final _ six-month delay to allow time for the development of
alternative proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are nationally significant historic monuments,'' said
Carol Poh Miller, a local historical consultant. ``Given the
intimate relationship of the Huletts to Cleveland's industrial
history, it s unbelievable that we would sweep them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller is a member of the Committee to Save Cleveland's
Huletts, a group of preservationists, urban planners, industrial
archaeologists, and others.
</P>
<P>
   The group has already scored some victories. In 1993,
Cleveland's City Council gave the Huletts local landmark status.
The unloaders are also listed in the National Register of Historic
Places, have been named a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark,
and are semifinalists for the National Trust for Historic
Preservation's list of America's 11 most endangered historic
places, to be announced June 14.
</P>
<P>
   None of those designations, though, would prevent the port from
proceeding with its plans.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service has offered to underwrite a study to
help gain National Historic Landmark status for the machines, and
preservationists across the country have rallied to the Huletts'
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are realists and understand the position of those in
commerce, but there is only so much historic material out there,''
said Robert Vogel, past president of the Society for Industrial
Archaeology and curator emeritus of mechanical and civil
engineering at the Smithsonian Institution. ``Commerce can spring
up anywhere, but there is only one group of the Huletts left in
Cleveland. When they re gone, they'll be gone forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huletts were invented by a Clevelander, George Hulett, in
1898, and they revolutionized the handling of iron ore on the Great
Lakes. Before the Hulett, gangs of men shoveled ore from the holds
of ships. After the Hulett automated this work, the cost of
unloading ore dropped to 6 cents a ton, from 19 cents.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 of the machines were built, and most were installed
around the Great Lakes. Cleveland itself, once the largest iron-ore
terminal in the world, serving the big Midwestern steel centers,
had 15 Huletts. Today, there are only six of these machines left:
Cleveland's four and two later models in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority and Oglebay Norton Co., which operates the
Cleveland Bulk Terminal, say they must remove the Huletts so they
can modernize the dock for higher volume and a greater diversity of
bulk materials. Oglebay Norton commissioned a study showing that
volume could rise to 6 million tons a year from the current 1.8
million, and the company says there is plenty of demand for this
extra capacity. Port officials say that other area docks cannot
handle this demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our other deep-water docks are operating at 130 percent
capacity,'' said Gary Failor, the Port Authority's executive
director. ``It's like we are packing 10 pounds of potatoes into a
5-pound sack there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the determination of Oglebay Norton and the port,
many preservationists have despaired of achieving the original goal
of preserving the Huletts in their original location. Some support
a plan for dismantling one or two and moving them to a proposed
industrial heritage park.
</P>
<P>
   The port and Oglebay Norton have offered to dismantle a single
Hulett, at an estimated cost of $500,000, and provide $100,000 more
to hire a professional who will raise the money needed to rebuild
it. However, this offer is contingent upon the Landmarks
Commission's approval of their demolition plan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Other preservationists will have none of this, and Ms. Miller is
among them. ``History is where you find it, where it happened, and
this is where the Huletts operated for 80 years,'' she said. ``But
nobody ever said I wasn't a purist.''

WAGING WAR ON THE SERBS: OLD PROBLEM, NEW LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a curious mismatch of a war.
</P>
<P>
   In the near corner stood the richest, best-armed military
alliance in history: The American-led North Atlantic Treaty
Organization had been around for 50 years without having to fight a
war. It was big, but bulky. All 19 of its members had to agree
before it could throw a punch.
</P>
<P>
   In the far corner stood a wily Balkan dictator who answered to
no one but himself: Slobodan Milosevic specialized in using thugs
and his antiquated army to fight hugely destructive wars that he
ultimately lost, but which whipped up nationalist fervor inside
Serbia. They had kept him in power in a new Europe that has no
stomach for dictators.
</P>
<P>
   Equally odd were the rules. As President Clinton laid them down
on day one: ``I do not intend to put our troops in Kosovo to fight
a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of White House skittishness about U.S. combat deaths,
NATO was obliged to do what had never been done: Win a war without
risking its own soldiers on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   If the peace deal holds up, the curious war comes out this way:
The bulky alliance won, but at a savage cost to the people who were
supposed to be protected. Much of Kosovo has been razed, more than
1 million of its ethnic Albanian residents have been uprooted and
thousands of innocents have been killed. The West will have to
spend many billions of dollars to rebuild what it and the Serbs
have destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The dictator lost, but he stays on in his shrinking Yugoslavia.
If his bad habits hold and if the Serbs do not depose him, he may
well cause trouble another day.
</P>
<P>
   And just possibly a new lesson in war has been learned. Thanks
to the wonders of high-tech weaponry, an overwhelmingly powerful
alliance can crush a small nation's aggressive will without having
to risk its own soldiers, if it is willing to spend enough money
and if it can stomach mistakes that kill innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it was a 72-day campaign of violent accretion.
</P>
<P>
   As bombs did their work, diplomats from the United States,
Western Europe and Russia ignored the West's oratory about
Milosevic being a latter-day Hitler and went about the delicate
business of offering him an exit.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombs did their work, Milosevic's forces did what damage
they could in Kosovo; then he prepared his people for another lost
war. As soon as he was offered a way to stay in power while losing,
he jumped on it.
</P>
<P>
   Generals and politicians often learn the wrong lessons from the
last war. The wrong lesson that U.S. officials took from dropping
bombs to end the war in Bosnia in 1995 was that Milosevic would
fold after a few days of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-chance attempt to head off war in Kosovo on March 23,
Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special envoy to Yugoslavia, failed to
scare Milosevic with the threat of imminent bombing.
</P>
<P>
   On his way out of the country, Holbrooke was asked if he feared
that NATO's air attacks would ignite a humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is our greatest fear by far, by far,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what NATO, operating only from the air, could do to
prevent a catastrophe, Holbrooke went silent and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   The Bombing Begins
</P>
<P>
   `Lessons' of Bosnia Did Not Apply
</P>
<P>
   The bombing began on March 24 and on Monday, March 29, in the
Oval Office, the grim faces of Clinton's top foreign policy
advisers, captured in official photographs and in the memories of
participants, told the story: War in the Balkans was going to be
brutish _ and not short. Hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians
were being terrorized and bullied out of Kosovo by Milosevic's
forces and NATO seemed helpless to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The president and other officials insisted in public that they
had anticipated Milosevic's defiance and had expected his brutal
ethnic assault on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But in private they acknowledged their shock, disappointment and
miscalculation. ``It's one thing to say we expected this,'' a
senior adviser said. ``But living it is not the same as thinking
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only had Milosevic refused to give in but Yugoslav
anti-aircraft gunners had downed an American F-117 stealth fighter
the night before. The loss of the aircraft, one of the jewels of
the U.S. military arsenal, was a propaganda coup for Serbia and an
embarrassing display of the vulnerability of high-technology
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton concluded that his top aides _ including the secretaries
of state and defense and the director of central intelligence _
needed an injection of fighting spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys, let's not lose sight of why we did this,'' the president
told the group, according to one participant. ``Let's not forget
what prompted us to do this and who is responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The responsible party, Milosevic, had been the principle
provocateur in the collapse of Yugoslavia. He had orchestrated the
bloodiest explosion of violence Europe has endured since World War
II. During the 10-week war in Kosovo, he presided over a grisly
forced exodus that outraged the world and was indicted by an
international court on charges of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not a fool, and he had compelling reasons for
fighting, many of which made popular sense inside Serbia. Kosovo
has genuine religious and historical meaning to 10 million Serbs.
Peacefully surrendering control to the ethnic Albanians would have
been a national humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   As important, as least to Milosevic, Kosovo was where he found
his feet as a strongman. In 1989, when he was president of Serbia,
he stripped the Albanian majority of its power by revoking the
autonomy that the province had enjoyed and tapped a deep vein of
rage among Serbs who for decades had resented the clout of other
ethnic groups in Tito's Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rambouillet conference outside Paris in February, after
12 months during which the rise of an armed rebel movement in
Kosovo had led to Serbian attacks against civilians, the West
presented Milosevic with what he and many Serbs regarded as a
``capitulate or be bombed'' agreement. ``If there had been any
`cake,' Milosevic might have cut a deal,'' said Vuk Draskovic, then
a minister in the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   There was no cake to offer, as Holbrooke, looking defeated and
deeply worried, acknowledged on his way out of Belgrade. The next
day, March 24, the bombs began to fall. To Washington's
astonishment, Milosevic was more than ready for war.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stage 2
</P>
<P>
   The Only Alternative: More Fire Power
</P>
<P>
   The day the bombing began, one top Air Force general in
Washington fretted privately about a ``new Vietnam.'' On June 2,
the day before the peace deal was announced, another very senior
Pentagon official expressed doubt that the air war could ever be
won and predicted that the bombing could go on for years.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``hope to win'' strategy, said Colin Powell, the
retired general and architect of the Persian Gulf war in 1991,
which was won with a combined air-land-sea strategy of overwhelming
force.
</P>
<P>
   The hope was that just a few bombs would push Milosevic back to
the bargaining table. But the Serbian leader had launched a
blitzkrieg of ethnic purges, burning and looting Albanians' homes
and killing and mutilating enough Albanians to send hundreds of
thousands of others fleeing at the first sound of rifle butts
against their doors.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House did not have a Plan B.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came to realize that his ruling out of ground troops was
a mistake, according to a White House official, and the president
last month made a point of saying he was keeping all options open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has never been prepared to lose,'' this official
said. ``From the first day, he said we have to win this. It was
absolutely clear. Because of the consequences for the U.S., for
NATO, for his responsibilities as commander in chief, we had to win
this.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's only alternative, then, was to bomb _ a lot.
</P>
<P>
   More than 33,000 missions were flown and during 12,500 of them,
bombs were dropped or missiles were fired. Hampered by bad weather
and political fears in the alliance, the air campaign started
slowly and ineffectively.
</P>
<P>
   But over time more precise weapons allowed NATO to destroy
virtually any major target it wanted at minimal risk to its pilots.
Only two aircraft were lost, and both pilots were quickly rescued.
While three Americans were captured on the ground _ abducted,
Americans believed, by Macedonians sympathetic to Yugoslavia _ they
were eventually released.
</P>
<P>
   In the last weeks of the war, a rebel Albanian offensive flushed
Serbian forces out of hiding places along the Kosovo borders and
NATO aircraft were able to cut many of them down.
</P>
<P>
   `Collateral Damage'
</P>
<P>
   Making Mistakes, Mending the Rifts
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes in the air campaign _ the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade and attacks on passenger trains, buses,
hospitals, bridges and apartment buildings that killed 1,500
civilians, by Yugoslav estimates _ brought apologies from NATO, but
no change in tactics. As weeks passed, NATO commanders were given
increasing license to go after targets like electricity grids and
water supplies. For the first time in a decade of war in
Yugoslavia, the suffering was brought home to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy on May 7 threatened
to splinter the alliance; some members, notably Greece, Italy and
Germany, faced mounting domestic protests over the civilian toll.
</P>
<P>
   As orchestrated violence erupted in China, with mobs trapping
the U.S. ambassador in his embassy, the allies realized there was
no turning back on the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Chinese Embassy debacle marked a turning point, one
at which formerly reluctant NATO members agreed to widen the range
of targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted the bombing to come to an end quickly but realized
we needed to intensify to make that happen,'' one official said.
``The flip side of intensification was there would be more
collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before the bombing campaign began to bear fruit, the
Clinton administration had to orchestrate the 50th anniversary of
NATO in Washington so that the alliance would not be torn apart in
its search for an endgame.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of that late April meeting, the Greeks and Italians
were already making noises about a halt in the air campaign. Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain was making even louder noises,
giving speech after speech about how NATO ought to capitalize on
the bombing. He wanted to send in ground troops after the Serbian
forces were demoralized and crippled, but before there was an
agreement to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary, though, held together. Clinton pushed the issue
of ground troops off the table by convincing NATO's
secretary-general, Javier Solana, to announce a formal assessment
of ground-troop options in the weeks after the summit ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO leaders presented a united front, cobbling together a
set of core demands that the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart,
summarized in four words, ``Serbs out, refugees back.'' These
demands, plus the non-negotiable insistence that Kosovo be occupied
by an international force with NATO at its core, formed the basis
of the peace plan that Milosevic signed six weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   But the crucial difference between what he accepted and the
Rambouillet plan, from Milosevic's point of view, is that the
international force is not composed solely of NATO soldiers and is
to operate under U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians
</P>
<P>
   Trying to Sidestep Slavic Allegiances
</P>
<P>
   There remained, though, a towering brick wall between NATO and
any peace settlement with Milosevic: the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The night the bombing began, Russia denounced it as an act of
brazen aggression and suspended cooperation with NATO. Yevgeny
Primakov, then the prime minister, made a dramatic U-turn in the
sky, turning his plane back from a trip to Washington at which
Russia had hoped to win loans from the International Monetary Fund
for its crumbling economy.
</P>
<P>
   (As it happens, the U-turn was staged to appease an angry
Russian public who sympathized with the Serbs, according to an
adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. He said Primakov had
been informed before his plane took off that the bombing would
start.)
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, desperate for a partner in his war against the West,
seized on Russia's support and demanded that its traditional Slavic
ally become a player in any deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian government's enthusiasm for Milosevic,
notwithstanding its bravura show of solidarity as the bombing
began, has always been tepid. Milosevic, after all, had supported
the Communist generals who had tried to overthrow Yeltsin in 1991.
As Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy to the Balkans,
later told German officials, ``Russia cannot identify with this
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moscow was squeezed between a domestic political need to appear
to be defending the interest of the Serbs, and a compelling
economic need to secure more financial help from the West.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing began, many Western European leaders tried to
entice Yeltsin back into cooperation with NATO. Since the peace
agreement, officials in Bonn, Germany, and Washington have both
claimed that they had played the pivotal role.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, it seems, had greased the diplomatic track before
serious contacts were made between Washington and Moscow. Michael
Steiner, chief diplomatic adviser to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
was driven at first by the conviction that the Russians had to be
brought on board for a political solution to be reached. Otherwise,
Milosevic would always have wriggle room.
</P>
<P>
   A political solution was the only viable way out for Germany
because if NATO moved toward a ground invasion, Schroeder's
coalition government would almost certainly fall. The Green Party,
a key part of the coalition, adamantly opposed a ground war.
Because Germany, then, would not back a ground invasion, a
political solution was needed to avoid a hugely damaging rift in
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a central difficulty in winning over the Russians.
It was Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internally, we never said `the Russians,''' Steiner said. ``We
said `Yeltsin and Primakov,' because we knew there were different
positions and different possibilities there. And we always had the
sense that Primakov might go before the end of the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's first visit to Bonn on March 30 was a disaster. He
had been in Belgrade on March 29 and came straight from Milosevic
to meet with Schroeder. His position shocked the Germans. He was
supportive of Milosevic and denounced the ``illegality'' of the
NATO bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke in this turgid bureaucratic language of the old
Communist past,'' Steiner said, ``and what he had to say was
essentially that Russia defended Milosevic's position.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the outset, however, German contacts with Yeltsin
suggested that he saw little sense in putting Russia's standing in
the West on the line for Milosevic. Yeltsin's appointment of
Chernomyrdin on April 14 as special envoy to the Balkans was the
first concrete sign that the Russian position was shifting. He
fired Primakov a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was quickly invited to Bonn, where the meeting with
Schroeder went much better. Chernomyrdin was no pushover, but he
made clear from the start that he had no special sympathy for
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Mediation
</P>
<P>
   Team of a Russian and a Finn Arrives
</P>
<P>
   On April 25, 11 days after Chernomyrdin's appointment, Yeltsin
called Clinton. The NATO anniversary summit meeting was still going
on and Clinton was in a secure holding room at the Mellon
Auditorium in Washington preparing to address the closing session.
</P>
<P>
   According to administration officials, Yeltsin had decided he
had to reassert Moscow's position as a major world power or risk
being marginalized in the most important conflict in Europe since
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders spoke for 90 minutes, with Yeltsin presenting a
variety of ideas for ending the Balkan war on terms acceptable to
Moscow and Belgrade, according to a U.S. official who spoke to
Clinton immediately afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected most of Yeltsin's suggestions as incompatible
with the simple NATO principles: Serbian forces out, ethnic
Albanians back under the protection of a force with NATO at its
core. This rejection of Russia's ideas for ending the war while
embracing Russia's desire to once again be a big-league diplomatic
player became a defining and productive pattern of the talks that
produced the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Yeltsin's ideas did take root _ the reopening of the
dormant channel of communication between Vice President Al Gore and
Chernomyrdin. They had met several times when Chernomyrdin was
still prime minister in what became a prime channel of U.S.-Russian
communication.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke twice by telephone during the following week, with
Gore repeating the NATO position and Chernomyrdin replying that
Milosevic was unbending in his resistance to the occupation of
Kosovo by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   With matters at a standstill, Yeltsin called Clinton again on
Sunday, May 2, telling the president that he wanted to send his
envoy to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would be happy to receive him, and did so the
next day. Chernomyrdin met for 90 minutes in the Oval Office with
the president and his foreign policy team, and then traveled the
three miles to Gore's official residence on Embassy Row.
</P>
<P>
   That evening Chernomyrdin and his small delegation spent three
hours with Gore; Sandy Berger, the national security adviser;
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott; and Leon Fuerth, Gore's
top foreign policy aide. Little progress was made, but the door was
left open for new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 the next morning, the Russians called Gore's staff.
Chernomyrdin wanted to meet for breakfast. He had a new idea.
</P>
<P>
   Over muffins at Gore's house, Chernomyrdin proposed a team of
himself and someone who would both be acceptable to Milosevic and
trusted implicitly by NATO. The idea excited the White House team,
which that morning had been joined by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. ``I thought it was good to come at Milosevic from two
angles,'' Albright recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Someone suggested Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, but
Albright quickly vetoed that idea. She had another name: Martti
Ahtisaari, the president of Finland, a patient negotiator who had
worked 13 years for a peace in Namibia and who for years had urged
Europe to be patient with Russia. As the leader of a neutral
nation, he could meet with Milosevic and, according to a senior
administration official, Albright trusted him not to weaken or
compromise on NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voht!'' Chernomyrdin replied in Russian. ``That's it!''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, after Ahtisaari was persuaded to come on
board, the State Department devised what it called a
``double-magnet strategy'' with the Russian and the Finn.
</P>
<P>
   As an administration official put it, ``They bring the Russians
closer to us and in turn bring the Serbs closer to a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement suited the Russians, who had warned that they
would never serve as a mere ``postman'' for NATO's demands.
Chernomyrdin could play good cop in negotiating with Milosevic,
setting down general principles of peace, while Ahtisaari, the bad
cop, could insist on the unpalatable details of surrendering Kosovo
to a NATO-controlled force.
</P>
<P>
   Albright busied herself stamping out what she called ``envoy
envy.'' To that end, she made scores of phone calls _ to the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, to members of Congress, to Czech and Greek leaders _
demanding that they stay out of Belgrade. Her aides say she was
determined not to let Milosevic play envoys off against one
another.
</P>
<P>
   She was particularly adamant that the United Nations be kept
backstage and out of Belgrade. Her aides say she pressured Annan to
delay naming an envoy. After he selected Carl Bildt, a former
senior official in the Bosnia peace deal, and Eduard Kukan, the
foreign minister of Slovakia, Albright convinced the
secretary-general to limit their role to implementing peace after a
deal was completed.
</P>
<P>
   She distrusted the United Nations because she felt that in the
past its negotiators had been played for fools by Milosevic. She
feared that such envoys would complicate and possibly derail the
work of Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   Also in early May, Germany's cultivation of the Russians paid
off. At a Bonn meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations,
plus Russia, the first joint statement about ending the conflict in
Kosovo was issued.
</P>
<P>
   It was extremely vague on all the most contentious issues,
particularly NATO command of a peacekeeping force, but its
political message was clear: The Americans, the Europeans and the
Russians were trying to work together. In this sense, it amounted
to a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The Agreement
</P>
<P>
   Marathon Sessions Across the Continent
</P>
<P>
   To hammer out the wording of the peace agreement, Talbott, the
State Department's senior expert on Russia, met with Chernomyrdin
and Ahtisaari four times in marathon negotiating sessions. In these
and other meetings, whenever Chernomyrdin persuaded Talbott to
change the wording of the peace deal, he would ask, in Russian:
``What about Mother Boss? Will she be OK with this?''
</P>
<P>
   (He was referring to Albright, who said Chernomyrdin never
called her ``Mother Boss'' to her face, but only in reference to
her when he was negotiating with Talbott.)
</P>
<P>
   The first marathon session was at the official residence of the
Finnish president in Helsinki. Two sessions were held on the
grounds of Stalin's dacha outside Moscow, and the final one took
place over the first two days of June near Bonn, at the Petersberg,
a palatial former government guest house.
</P>
<P>
   This meeting was the longest and most fraught. Working out a
two-page, take-it-or-leave-it peace plan took until 4 a.m. on
Tuesday and much of Wednesday, until the hour when the negotiating
duo was scheduled to leave for Belgrade. The trickiest part was
persuading Chernomyrdin to accept the NATO conditions _ referred to
by Talbott as the ``family jewels'' _ in front of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Chernomyrdin was heading off for his fifth trip
to see Milosevic and he did not want to leave Belgrade with only
``jaw jaw'' as the result, one U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   After a dinner with Chernomyrdin, Ahtisaari and their host, the
German chancellor, Talbott slipped away to talk to Berger and
Albright. He then proposed a footnote to the document that was
being prepared for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The footnote spelled out demands that the Russians had been
resisting for weeks: NATO command and control of the peacekeeping
force with control of the operation in the hands of the North
Atlantic Council, the chief decision-making body of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The footnote allowed NATO to make its demands without Russia
having to formally endorse them, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin pledged not to argue when the document was
presented.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the Russian envoy promised to remain silent
when the Finnish president told Milosevic that if he did not accept
the conditions, the demands would only get more stringent as the
war wound on, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade
</P>
<P>
   An Edgy Final Round With Milosevic
</P>
<P>
   When the negotiators met with Milosevic in Belgrade on Wednesday
night and Thursday morning, they found him ``serious and calm,''
according to a U.S. official. ``He did not seem under excessive
stress, as Chernomyrdin had reported from his previous visit,'' the
official added.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was respectful, correcting one of his colleagues when
he failed to address Ahtisaari as President Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   The two visitors immediately set the ground rules. They were
mediators, not negotiators. They explained the document. As they
had expected, Milosevic asked if there could be revisions.
</P>
<P>
   He was told, flatly, no.
</P>
<P>
   In the first sign of acquiescence, Milosevic told them he would
send the document to his Parliament for approval. In an odd effort
to create more cover for himself, Milosevic invited Ahtisaari to
address the Parliament; Ahtisaari declined.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first evening session, Milosevic offered a
meal, but the visitors said no thanks and went off to consult their
delegations.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Milosevic appeared to be more agitated and his
military chiefs looked fairly distraught, Ahtisaari later reported.
Milosevic opened the meeting with a rendition of the importance of
Kosovo to the Serbs, and as he was nearing the end, Ahtisaari
interrupted and asked Milosevic what he was going to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb replied, according to an American, ``We accept your
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   To seal the deal, the Yugoslavs were given the telephone number
of Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, along with several other
numbers at NATO. They were told that they should call one of the
numbers to begin the military negotiations. No mention was made at
the meetings of Milosevic's indictment on charges of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators then flew to Cologne, Germany, on Thursday to
brief Talbott and the heads of the European Union who were meeting
there. Later that day, Talbott went to the North Atlantic Council
in Brussels, Belgium, to brief the 19 NATO ambassadors. The meeting
started at 8:30 p.m., and when Clark walked into the room about 30
minutes later, he announced that he had just received a call from
the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs, according to Clark, suggested that they have
their first meeting on Sunday to work out precise details of the
Serbian withdrawal. Clark reminded them that the bombing would
continue until there was a verifiable withdrawal of their troops.
``How's Saturday morning?'' the Yugoslavs replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a plan, a strategy, a concept with regard to the
Russians,'' Talbott said on Friday. ``What happened this week has
played out impeccably.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs
</P>
<P>
   A Leader Patches Up His Political Fences
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in Belgrade, Milosevic was eager to cut a deal. Weeks
before, he had started to prepare the public for a political
solution as early as the first week of May. That it took another
month may have been a result less of his unwillingness to make a
deal than of the West's slowness to grasp that he was serious.
</P>
<P>
   The signs were everywhere. The visit of Jackson, during which
Belgrade handed over the three U.S. soldiers, was shown endlessly
on Belgrade television, complete with praise for Jackson's calls
for peace and for an end to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   All of Chernomyrdin's visits were given broad coverage, as the
state-controlled press abruptly shifted from obsessive coverage of
NATO bomb damage to an emphasis on diplomatic progress. The two top
generals in charge of the operation in Kosovo went to Belgrade to
report to Milosevic that their work was done. The Kosovo Liberation
Army, they said, had been routed, and the sovereignty of Kosovo was
assured.
</P>
<P>
   The propaganda machine that had aroused public opinion for war
in Kosovo began heralding the end of the military campaign and
preparing Serbs for a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic reportedly prepared a major announcement of a troop
withdrawal on May 9, a day when Chernomyrdin was due to visit
Belgrade. But the Russian envoy did not come and the announcement
the next day was downplayed, while being dismissed in the West.
When Chernomyrdin delayed his trip for a whole week, he was
criticized sharply in the official newspaper, Politika, a sign of
Milosevic's displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there were signals in May that the Serb
people, who had rallied around Milosevic in March, were fed up with
the war and growing angry. Demonstrations in the southern towns of
Krusevac, Aleksandrovac and Raska began after the delivery on May
14 of 10 bodies of soldiers killed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds gathered at the funerals, and there were protests at the
bus stations as more reservists were due to leave for Kosovo. Only
women protested at first, defying the ban on demonstrations during
the state of war declared shortly after the NATO bombing began.
They were careful in their demands. Not wanting to appear
unpatriotic, they asked for their sons and husbands to be allowed
leave, or at least be allowed to serve in shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government had announced a withdrawal from Kosovo,
they asked that their men be allowed home first. Some said they did
not want their men to die in a war they no longer supported. The
authorities tried to order the women home. When that did not work,
the top general, Col. Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, traveled to meet with
the women personally. He also allowed many of their men to go home.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later as the demonstrations continued and even
spread, Pavkovic went to Raska to meet with soldiers and their
families again. After still more demonstrations, the authorities
moved in and made arrests. The regime, though, seemed shaken by the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   For many in the cities, the loss of water and electricity
brought home how miserable life was going to be if the war
continued. Ordinary Serbs began to think that civilian deaths did
not mean very much to NATO. They said, too, that NATO did not make
mistakes and that it hit hospitals in Belgrade and Nis on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it doesn't matter how they end it,'' said Momir
Karadarevic, 72, who was busy retrieving wooden beams and window
support from the rubble of his home in Valjevo. ``If you ask me,
this shouldn't have started in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Milosevic appears to have decided that months of
bombing were more likely than ground troops and that there was
little to be gained from enduring it. Belgrade analysts and
diplomats believe that Milosevic calculated that peace was better
suited to his personal survival than war.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombing had even started, there were whispers in
Belgrade that Kosovo would be lost after a war that cost the Serbs
dearly. It had happened twice before, in the former Yugoslav
republics of Croatia and Bosnia, when Milosevic abandoned the Serbs
there.
</P>
<P>
   In an uncanny bit of prophecy before NATO's bombing campaign
began, a Belgrade journalist, Bratislav Grubasic of the VIP news
agency, described Milosevic as a realist who knew it would be
better for the people of Serbia to cut a deal in Kosovo before
bombs fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is not his way,'' Grubasic said. ``Milosevic's way is
to stretch it out, make it as messy and nasty as possible, and then
still lose it.''

NATO'S COMMANDER PRESENTS PACT TO THE SERBS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ Five senior Yugoslav military officers came
here Saturday to meet with NATO officials and to review and sign
the terms for their withdrawal from Kosovo after 10 weeks of
bombardment by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In what could mark the end of a decade of wars that destroyed
Yugoslavia, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, commander of NATO forces
here, presented the technical military agreement to Gen. Obrad
Stevanovic, assistant secretary of the interior, and Gen. Blagoje
Kovacevic, representing the Yugoslav general staff.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO officials had made clear in advance that there were to
be no negotiations, only acceptance of the document to end the
weeks of killings and forced expulsions by Serbian troops that led
more than half a million Kosovo Albanians to flee the province.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and the Parliament in
Belgrade had already accepted NATO's terms to end the airstrikes on
Thursday, after meetings with a special Russian envoy and the
president of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no negotiations, only discussions,'' said the
NATO spokesman, Lt. Col. Robin Clifford. ``They are going over
every page. It is extremely important that this is gotten right.
Both sides need to understand what is meant by the words.''
</P>
<P>
   After five hours of discussions, members of the Yugoslav
delegation left in cars at about 5:30 p.m. and returned across the
border to use secure telephone lines to consult with officials in
Belgrade about a ``few points of detail,'' NATO officials said,
without giving more information.
</P>
<P>
   Without revealing specifics contained in the document presented
Saturday, NATO officials said it spells out, among other things,
how and when Serbian troops are to leave Kosovo, the routes NATO
troops are to use to enter the province, and the NATO troops and
equipment to be used in maintaining peace there.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires the Yugoslav army to remove the land mines with
which they have seeded the province, according to a NATO official.
And unlike the military annex to the peace accord that ended the
war in Bosnia in 1995, this document is a separate military
agreement that goes into effect as soon as it is signed.
</P>
<P>
   If the document is signed Saturday, NATO troops could enter
Kosovo as early as Monday. First, though, Serbian troops must
demonstrate in at least 24 hours that they are indeed withdrawing.
Only then, said a NATO spokesman, Maj. Trey Cate, would the
alliance call a bombing pause. The first of the 16,000 NATO troops
would immediately enter into Kosovo on the heels of the withdrawing
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature abhors a vacuum,'' Cate said, ``so we'll be following
pretty closely behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO would reserve the right to resume bombing if the Serbian
forces fail in any way to abide by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Two sedans carrying the Yugoslav officials arrived here two
hours late for their 9:00 a.m. appointment with the NATO
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The delay came when the Yugoslav delegation, waiting across the
border less than one-half mile away, raised questions with a NATO
official about several details of the meeting, including their
insistence that the modest roadside cafe NATO had leased for the
meeting was not in a sufficiently neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that this was an attempt to postpone Saturday's signing,
NATO officials immediately solved the problems ``at the highest
levels,'' Clifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the hundreds of reporters waiting outside, the Yugoslav
officials then entered the restaurant, near the site where railway
cars had only recently disgorged some 60,000 dispirited Albanians
who had been evicted from Kosovo by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, the Yugoslav delegation sat on one side of a
U-shaped table across from Jackson, who is British, and two top
NATO officials, including one American officer.
</P>
<P>
   The four brigade commanders from Italy, France, Germany and
Great Britain sat behind the men and were joined by at least 20
other NATO officials. The meeting was put together so hastily that
the place cards were blank for the Yugoslav delegation because
Belgrade was unable to confirm who would represent the Yugoslav
military.
</P>
<P>
   As they read the document line by line on the green-covered
tables, representatives of the two sides regularly excused
themselves to walk out of the restaurant and use secure
walkie-talkies to call headquarters. First a Serbian general, then
Jackson himself, strode out of the hilltop cafe to speak in private
about matters of interpretation and translations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless the atmosphere in the somber dining room was ``very
professional,'' according to Clifford, the NATO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   As the discussions continued into late afternoon, Clifford said
they may be continued on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion marked the most humiliating defeat for Yugoslavia
under Milosevic's leadership. It was 12 years ago in Kosovo that
Milosevic gave the speech that propelled him to power, asserting
that no one would again harm the Serbs who had become a minority in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a military agreement, Milosevic is not required to
sign the document, allowing NATO to avoid further negotiations with
the Yugoslav leader, who was indicted for war crimes last month by
an international tribunal. Nor were any other members of
Milosevic's government who have been indicted sent here from
Belgrade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MORE)
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NATO officials completed writing the military
agreement, which is a revision of the military annex to the accord
negotiated in February in France, according to a NATO spokesman.
NATO officials then sent the document to the Yugoslav government
and settled on Saturday's meeting. For extra insurance, NATO
commanders confirmed the appointment late Friday night with the
Yugoslavs after the North Atlantic Council had approved the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels Saturday, the NATO spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said
Jackson had full authority to lay down detailed withdrawal terms to
the Yugoslav commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firstly, they have to commit themselves, and Yugoslavia, to a
phased and rapid withdrawal of the Yugoslav ground forces,'' Shea
said. ``This means that all personnel, all organizations with a
military capability, must start to withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``This would involve, of course, units from the
regular army, but also armed civilian groups, national guards,
border police, army reserves, military police, the intelligence
services, police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, local special
riot and anti-terrorist police, and any other groups or individuals
that will be designated by General Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also means that as these military and police forces leave,
they will have to stick to a firm schedule, using designated
assembly areas and designated routes, and designated areas that
will have to be vacated,'' he added. ``The withdrawal of the
Yugoslav armed forces must be completed within seven days from the
entry into force of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav forces would also have to agree to withdraw all
their aircraft, air defense radars and communications systems,
surface-to-air missiles, and anti-aircraft artillery ``very
quickly,'' Shea said, so that allied planes could safely carry out
reconnaissance missions during the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers would also be expected to see to it that the
Kosovo Liberation Army is disbanded and disarmed, though Maj. Gen.
Walter Jertz, a spokesman for the allied military command said
Saturday that this was ``a difficult issue.''
</P>
<P>
   British forces will be the first to enter Kosovo, according to a
NATO spokesman, an acknowledgment of their leading role in the
peacekeeping force, which will be led by Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The British, French, German, Italian and American forces will
each establish a zone of command in Kosovo, NATO officials said.
Those sectors will divide the province like slices of a pie. All of
these forces will enter with armor, including tanks and armored
personnel carriers. One NATO official said the United States will
use Apache helicopters during the first phase of the entry. ``It
will send a strong message that we are serious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the rough outline of the military agreement, NATO
forces will have the right to prevent any disruptions to the peace,
whether by Serbian forces or troops of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
They will also have to contend with the problems of booby traps
left by the Serbs, especially in the houses and shops of the
Kosovar Albanians who have fled over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   The five sectors will also include soldiers from other NATO and
non-NATO countries to police the peace agreement for years to come,
according to NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops hope to establish a ``safe and secure environment''
in advance of any return of the more than 500,000 Kosovar refugees
waiting in camps here and in Albania. At the same time, they will
be searching for the tens of thousands of Kosovar Albanians who
have hidden in the hills and abandoned villages after being thrown
out of their own homes and are believed to be in desperate need of
food, water and medical attention.

<P>
   KATMANDU, Nepal _ In the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal _ home to
some of the world's highest mountains, mightiest rivers, thickest
jungles and poorest people _ His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram
Shah Dev is 53, democratic government is nearing 10 and the Maoist
rebellion in the countryside has just turned three.
</P>
<P>
   The political landscape, like the topographical one, is full of
extremes. The king is thought by many to be a reincarnation of the
god Vishnu. The elected Parliament is widely viewed as replete with
pocket-stuffing crooks. The bomb-throwing revolutionaries are
considered by many to be fighting their ``people's war'' with
lunatic acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-stage election, on May 3 and 17, voters had the
opportunity to create some order out of this social entropy, and if
local analysts are correct they demonstrated admirable wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the Maoists' command to boycott the elections _ a
directive ominously underscored with a few beheadings _ and largely
shunning politicians who favor a return to absolute monarchy, the
people gave a majority of the seats in Parliament to the Nepali
Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
   That will allow a single political camp a long-sought chance to
govern without sharing power in a foredoomed coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, democracy has more or less meant multiparty
chaos,'' said Devendra Raj Panday, an economist and author here in
Katmandu. ``Coalitions of odd bedfellows with no ideological
compatibility have been running things. Apparently the people have
now realized that one party or another has to be given a chance to
govern.''
</P>
<P>
   With 23 million people, Nepal is an Arkansas-sized nation
landlocked between India and China. Until 50 years ago it was
largely isolated from the rest of the world. The annual per capita
income is still only $210. The adult literacy rate is 40 percent.
Average life expectancy is 57.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 political agitation forced the Harvard-educated,
walrus-mustached Birendra to give up most of his absolute powers
and accept a constitutional monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   But the years of democracy have been marked by a hapless
cavalcade of seven prime ministers, most of them the product of
bizarre alliances cobbled together only to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Royalists, social democrats, moderate Communists, less moderate
Communists, entirely immoderate Communists _ they have all taken
turns in the foreground like the circling figurines on a cuckoo
clock.
</P>
<P>
   Among the consequences has been political corruption that is
denied by no one. ``If you're in the government, and you think it
might last only six months or so, you've got to stuff your wallet
fast,'' said a Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``Pajero culture'' has become popular _ an allusion to
an expensive Japanese vehicle favored by the elite. Just as the
king's courtiers became exempt from heavy import duties on
automobiles, members of Parliament voted themselves the same
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than a new beginning, the goal was to get on the old
gravy train,'' said Mana Ranjan Josse, Nepal's best-known newspaper
columnist. ``Most politicians didn't even keep the Pajeros. They
sold them to businessmen for a handsome reward in rupees.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent election was called after the governing Nepali
Congress _ best-described as a social democratic party _ had a
falling out with its main coalition partner, the Marxist-Leninists,
best described as a breakaway group from the more-temperate Unified
Marxist-Leninists.
</P>
<P>
   Voting was held in two stages to allow 35,000 soldiers and
police officers to protect the voters from the Maoists. The
resulting tally went beyond even what optimists had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The success may be attributed to a show of unity by Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, 75, who offered to step aside for a
fellow war horse and longtime party rival, Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai, 74. Once before, the Nepali Congress won a majority in
Parliament, but feuding between those leaders split the party's
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We burned our fingers by quarreling between ourselves and lost
the government,'' Bhattarai said in an interview. ``We will not
make this mistake again.''
</P>
<P>
   [ Bhattarai was sworn in as prime minister on May 31 and named a
16-member Cabinet, all from his own party.)
</P>
<P>
   Born in India to exiled parents, Bhattarai is one of Nepal's
legendary freedom fighters. As a young man he was imprisoned for 14
years after an arrest in a Kafkaesque manner by the king's
government for ``offenses that will remain unknown to you.''
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong bachelor, he is a devout Hindu, but his religion did
not keep him from earning a reputation as a connoisseur of
beautiful women and strong drink. These days, age has blunted those
appetites, he said. He is more devoted to yoga.
</P>
<P>
   He is fatalistic about corruption, explaining that craving
possessions ``is a natural human weakness.'' He is complimentary
toward Birenda, calling him a ``fine, highly educated gentleman,''
though adding that he is surrounded by courtiers who are
scoundrels.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed Maoism as a movement that had failed to move very
many. ``They are on the run,'' he said with condescension.
</P>
<P>
   According to confidential police files, the Maoists have a
well-trained, dedicated fighting force of only about 200 soldiers.
But the police say they can assemble student and worker militias
that raise their military strength above 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Maoists have made themselves felt in 37 of Nepal's
75 districts, though the police say the guerrillas are ``very
strong'' in only four places in the remote western hills. Favored
tactics include assaults on constabularies and on agricultural
banks, where the records of loans to farmers are ceremoniously
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Like its democracy, Nepal's Maoist revolution seems to be
feeling its way, trying to master the basics. The guerrillas have
only recently begun using explosives that are set off by remote
control. They finance themselves largely through extortion, the
police say.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the Maoists have killed 43 policemen and 72
civilians since early 1996. The police say they have killed 519
rebels. Both sides have been accused of ruthlessness by human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Maoists have killed too many innocents to be an effective
champion of the people,'' said Bhattarai, who had seated himself in
a yogic posture on a floor mat. As an example, he cited the
pre-election throat-slitting of a candidate, Yadu Gautam. Voters
objected. They elected Gautam's wife instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy has a solid future in Nepal,'' Bhattarai said with
an air of confidence. ``Don't you think it's about time?''

COHEN PUTS NO TIME LIMIT ON U.S. AND OTHER NATO FORCES IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen said Saturday that
there was no time limit on the deployment of NATO forces, including
U.S. troops, in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the controversy over the deployment of U.S.
peacekeepers in Bosnia in 1995, who officials vowed would leave
within a year, the Clinton administration has not said how long it
expects the NATO force to stay. Cohen, who as a Republican senator
opposed an open-ended commitment of troops in the Balkans, said he
would not put ``time limits'' on the U.S. involvement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give you a timetable,'' Cohen said in an interview
with reporters in his office. ``And I'm not going to say, `Is it
six months? Is it a year? How long is it going to take?' We will do
our best to facilitate the transformation of Kosovo into a
self-governing province under the aegis of NATO and the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also signaled that NATO saw its expanding mission in the
Balkans as extending beyond keeping peace in Kosovo and allowing
refugees to return. He said NATO had drafted military plans to
prevent President Slobodan Milosevic from overthrowing the
government of Montenegro, Yugoslavia's junior republic, and would
still be prepared to use the plans after a settlement of the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the air war against Yugoslavia, NATO said it has
tried to minimize its attacks against Montenegro, whose government,
led by Milo Djukanovic, is considered more democratic and
pro-Western than that of Milosevic's Serbia. And the alliance also
warned that it would intervene if there was an outright coup by
forces supporting Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have plans in the event there is an attempt to
destabilize Montenegro and then to pose a threat to NATO,'' Cohen
said, indicating that in his view a move against Montenegro would
undermine the settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's concern over Montenegro underscores the lingering
questions and potential threats swirling around Milosevic and his
country.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment of 7,000 U.S. troops _ on top of more than 6,000
still in Bosnia _ is certain to be controversial in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Before NATO's bombing began, many Republicans in Congress
opposed the administration's pledge to send only 4,000 troops to
Kosovo as part of a much smaller force of 28,000. Cohen noted that
opposition but said it was vital that the United States take part
now that Milosevic had backed down. ``It will be up to me to go
back up to the hill and try to persuade my former colleagues they
should support this effort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He described a daunting list of tasks facing the peacekeepers.
These include the destruction of weapons left behind, the clearing
of mine fields and booby traps and the rebuilding of homes,
bridges, roads and other infrastructure destroyed by Serbian forces
and by NATO's air strikes _ all before the bulk of the ethnic
Albanian refugees are allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hard part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Cohen said he did not expect fighting to erupt in
Yugoslavia, either over Montenegro or among Serbs, Yugoslavia is
clearly moving into a period of uncertainty after two and a half
months of bombing and with the coming occupation of the southern
Serbian province of Kosovo by NATO-led troops.
</P>
<P>
   If Yugoslavia begins to withdraw its army and police units, as
called for under the proposed peace agreement, NATO troops could
begin moving into Kosovo as soon as Monday or Tuesday. The first of
7,000 U.S. troops _ marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit
aboard ships heading to the Aegean Sea _ could move in days after
that.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said NATO's strategy had succeeded despite strains in the
alliance and criticism from many quarters that the allies had not
prepared adequately for the possibility of using ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Despite errors in the bombing that killed dozens of civilians,
Cohen said NATO's campaign had been remarkably precise and
successful. Even as the administration and some NATO allies began
openly discussing the possibility of ground troops, he said the
intelligence reports and satellite photographs proved that the air
strikes were eroding Serbian resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw evidence mounting that the air campaign was starting to
take a toll,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After 74 days of bombing, the Pentagon now estimates that
Yugoslavia's army and police forces have lost a quarter of the
armored vehicles in Kosovo and 40 percent of artillery and mortars.
NATO, according to the Pentagon, has destroyed 80 percent of the
Yugoslav Air Force and its surface-to-air missile batteries and
severely degraded its military airfields.

 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first glance, Ronald H. Blackley, a high school
graduate who says he never earned more than $30,000 a year back
home in Mississippi, does not seem like the kind of target Congress
had in mind when it created special prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago in his home state, he worked for a congressman
named Mike Espy on farm issues. When Espy was named secretary of
agriculture in 1993, Blackley was hired as his chief of staff for
$115,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to Washington as an idealist,'' Blackley's lawyer,
Sheldon Krantz, said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Blackley left Washington a convicted criminal, owing more than
$300,000 in legal fees and loans, his suburban Virginia house lost
to foreclosure. Soon, unless his appeals are successful, he will go
to prison for 27 months.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sharon, sat beside him and cried as Blackley told of
being swept up in an investigation aimed at Espy, who was accused
but ultimately cleared of taking favors from companies that did
business with the Agriculture Department. The special prosecutor in
the case, Donald Smaltz, had hoped Blackley would help him convict
his former boss. ``I could have,'' Blackley drawled, ``if I'd
lied.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Blackley himself became a target of Smaltz and, his
lawyer says, another victim of a statute that has spawned boundless
multimillion-dollar investigations that have often gone on for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Now many in Congress are considering letting the
independent-counsel law lapse when it comes up for renewal in
Congress this month.
</P>
<P>
   Blackley, who is 48, was convicted in late 1997 of three counts
of making false statements about $22,000 in outside income he
received while serving as the agriculture secretary's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz convinced a jury that Blackley took the money from
longtime Mississippi friends in return for helping them get
Agriculture Department subsidies, and then lied about it, first on
financial-disclosure forms and later to investigators for the
department and for the U.S. Agency for International Development,
where he worked after leaving the department in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Blackley was guilty of nothing more than ``being in the wrong
place at the wrong time,'' Krantz said, adding that what happened
to his client ``is an example of what is wrong with the
independent-counsel statute,'' and why it should be allowed to die.
</P>
<P>
   To compare the prosecutor's version of the case with the defense
lawyer's is to wonder whether they are talking about the same man
and the same events.
</P>
<P>
   Krantz said $10,000 of the $22,000 was a loan from an old friend
who wanted to help Blackley get settled in the Washington area.
About $10,000 more came in installments for the sale of a rice
brokerage Blackley owned before coming to Washington, and another
$1,000 was a high school graduation gift to Blackley's son, the
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Blackley simply tried to cut through red tape and get subsidies
for people entitled to them, Krantz said.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, Krantz elicited testimony that many people have
trouble with the financial-disclosure forms. He tried to show that
Blackley's violations, if any, were technical and attributable to
the documents' baffling language, including ambiguous wording on
how to list money earned in a certain year, compared with money
actually received in a given year.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors characterized those explanations as ludicrous
and said there was overwhelming evidence that Blackley had cashed
in on his position.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which version is true, or whether the ``truth'' lies
in some undiscoverable terrain in between, this much is clear: If
there were no independent-counsel law, Blackley would not have been
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Passed in 1978 when memories of Watergate were fresh, the Ethics
in Government Act provides for court-appointed independent counsels
to go after wrongdoing at the highest levels of government. The
statute has been endlessly debated. Its critics complain that some
special prosecutors stray far from their original missions,
spending millions to pursue people on the periphery of scandal, as
well as the truly guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Smaltz was appointed to investigate Espy, who resigned
amid suspicions that he had accepted tickets to sporting events,
luggage and other gifts worth thousands of dollars from people and
companies he was supposed to be regulating, like Tyson Foods, the
giant poultry producer based in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz went after Blackley mainly to get information to use
against his former boss. ``Blackley was a link in the chain to
Secretary Espy,'' the prosecutor said in a television interview
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Blackley said: ``They wanted me to do for them what they
couldn't do, which was convict Mike Espy. I didn't have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackley said he made that clear in several interviews with
investigators. He said they told him, at first, that he was not a
target. But the questioning became less friendly, and Blackley said
he began to hear from friends in Mississippi that investigators
were checking on him.
</P>
<P>
   Blackley's financial-disclosure forms came under scrutiny only
because Espy was under investigation, Krantz said. Attorney General
Janet Reno unsuccessfully opposed Smaltz's request for
authorization to pursue Blackley, reminding the federal judicial
panel overseeing the counsel's office that Blackley was not covered
in its original mandate. Reno expressed alarm at a special
prosecutor's potentially ``unbridled power.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Department of Justice and the Agriculture
Department's inspector general's office had earlier examined
Blackley's forms and found nothing to prosecute. That decision was
in keeping with the Justice Department's policy of not prosecuting
financial-disclosure violations, Krantz said, but rather allowing
filers to correct the forms, or settle cases civilly.
</P>
<P>
   Blackley was indicted on April 22, 1997, and was tried in U.S.
District Court in Washington. Blackley did not testify on his own
behalf; his lawyer thought that there was no need and that the
prosecution had not proved its case.
</P>
<P>
   Blackley was convicted on Dec. 1, 1997. On March 13, 1998, Judge
Royce Lamberth sentenced him to 27 months in prison, departing from
sentencing guidelines that indicated probation for a defendant like
Blackley, whose offense was his first of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant was a high-level government official,'' Lamberth
said, calling his conduct ``despicable'' and saying he wanted to
send a message to other officials who might be tempted to be greedy
and lie.
</P>
<P>
   Krantz lost an appeal before the District of Columbia U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals. He has asked the Supreme Court to review
the case, on the grounds that the independent counsel should never
have pursued Blackley, and that the sentence was excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Blackley was never called as a witness against Espy, who was
acquitted on Dec. 2, 1998, a year and a day after Blackley was
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After the acquittal, Smaltz defended his four-year, $17 million
investigation. He noted that his office had gained more than a
dozen convictions and garnered some $12 million in fines, including
$6 million from Tyson Foods, which pleaded guilty to making illegal
gifts to Espy, who was acquitted of taking them.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, the Supreme Court overturned one of the convictions
obtained by Smaltz, setting aside a verdict against a California
agricultural cooperative that had given the secretary gifts. Simply
giving presents without a demonstrated link between the gifts and
an official's actions did not violate the law against illegal
gratuities, the court held.
</P>
<P>
   Krantz has prosecuted organized crime in Miami, taught law at
Boston University and was dean of the University of San Diego Law
School before settling in Washington to defend white-collar
defendants. ``I have never seen an injustice like this,'' he said
of Blackley's case. ``It shakes my confidence in the administration
of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackley and his wife are living in her mother's house in
Mississippi, for now. His friends hold occasional fund-raising
dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Is he afraid of prison? ``No. I'll just go do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he said, he will probably go back to Mississippi and
return to farming. ``I can't make too many long-term commitments,''
he said.

KOSOVO DEAL HELPS GORE CAMPAIGN AND SHOWS SPLIT AMONG REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If a possible peace settlement in Kosovo has any
effect on presidential politics in 2000, it highlights an advantage
of being the sitting vice president and the disadvantage of a
fractious mass of opposition candidates vying for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has been able to play a presidential-level role in
helping to resolve what is arguably one of the biggest foreign
policy crises of recent years. For two months he steadfastly
supported a war-fighting policy that, for now, seems to have
worked, without a single American combat casualty, but that still
carries great risks as long as Americans stay in the Balkans. And
at a crucial juncture, he called on ties with Russia to help
facilitate a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest advantage for Gore, assuming the settlement
holds, is what it heads off: the likelihood that Gore would have to
defend American deaths in a ground war in a far-away land just as
the presidential campaign heats up. Thus it could help Gore
campaign on the most reliable of political platforms, peace and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the political effects of any Kosovo settlement
are murkier. The conflict pointed up the divisions between the
party's isolationist and internationalist wings. The lack of a
single clear voice criticizing President Clinton's policies has
undercut the Republicans' traditional claim on foreign policy as
their area of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is well positioned to take credit while his lone Democratic
opponent for the nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley, does not
overtly challenge the administration's actions, and while the
Republicans debate whether it is wise to send U.S. forces into
Kosovo to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley praised the negotiators and added: ``Our priority must
be the welfare of the refugees. We should support those who wish to
return and provide them targeted assistance. We should also support
those refugees who do not wish to return but want to resettle
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a presidential contender and a
constant critic of the White House's approach, said, ``If it works
out, the administration will deserve credit for bringing it to an
end,'' but he said that he, for one, did not know what role Gore
played. ``I've read different versions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said of his own views, ``I still believe I was right that by
ruling out the option of ground troops, the White House made
Milosevic more efficiently able to ethnically cleanse and commit
atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, the former head of the American Red Cross, said,
``The Clinton-Gore administration has been very vague about the
terms of this proposal, and I'm worried that we're on the verge of
a sellout'' to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, at the moment the presumptive
Republican front-runner, put out a statement shortly after the
tentative settlement was announced. He said that any peacekeeping
force involving Americans should be under U.S. or NATO command,
which is indeed a feature of the plan. ``I think it's also
important for the president to lay out a timetable as to how long
they will be involved and when they will be withdrawn,'' Bush said,
adding it was important for Europe to ``carry the majority of the
load.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the publisher and Republican candidate, said the
administration should not send U.S. troops into Kosovo regardless
of whether the peace plan holds. ``The Clinton-Gore administration
should have learned a lesson from Bosnia,'' he said. ``American
peacekeeping troops have been in that region for years, with no end
in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle suggested that the agreement
reflected the president's falling support in public opinion
surveys. ``Faced with both declining poll numbers and the prospect
of a protracted conflict, President Clinton was forced to recognize
that negotiation, not escalation, represented the only appropriate
strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle added that the United States should send no troops. ``The
Clinton administration squandered substantial resources and, far
more importantly, our nation's credibility in the pursuit of
matters wholly unrelated to America's vital national security
interests,'' he said. ``It was a terrible mistake that has
established a troubling precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   In their struggle to depict the administration in a way that
would favor one of them over Gore, the Republicans have revealed a
new schism in their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has created another ideological division within our
party,'' said Tom Rath, a senior adviser to the presidential
campaign of former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and a long-time
Republican strategist in Concord, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Rath and others said that with Milosevic still in power, it was
too early to make any predictions about political fallout. But,
they said, unless the settlement failed and the Kosovo refugees
could not go home, the war would probably have little effect on the
presidential election beyond bringing the focus back squarely to
domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Kenneth Duberstein, who was chief of staff under
former President Ronald Reagan, said that Kosovo was never a true
litmus test for Republicans _ unlike, say, policy toward China, a
more complex and persistent issue.
</P>
<P>
   But several advisers within the Republican campaigns said there
were probably some short-term effects on the candidates. The war
prompted Bush to learn to react more promptly to unfolding events
once he was criticized for being slow in responding to the bombing
campaign. It gave Mrs. Dole a chance to spark publicity for her
campaign with a trip to a refugee camp. And it let McCain, who has
been deeply involved in international issues, emerge as a chief
foreign policy voice on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's role will no doubt become part of his campaign, even
though as recently as the week before last his advisers were
suggesting that Gore would have approached Kosovo differently from
the way Clinton did. They were not specific, but Gore has more
strongly advocated the Colin Powell doctrine _ if a nation is going
to apply force, it should seek rapid and total victory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore has had a long-time relationship with Victor
Chernomyrdin, now Russia's special envoy to the Balkans, and kept
open the lines of communication with him as official relations
frayed between the United States and Russia. It was during a
meeting with Chernomyrdin at Gore's home in Washington last month
that the two agreed on asking Finnish President Martii Ahtisaari to
help find a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign made no claims to good fortune. ``If the peace
is real, it's good for America and good for the nations around the
world to have stood up against genocide,'' said Marla Romash, the
deputy campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Given the uncertainties over how the peace agreement will
actually work out, Gore's backers are being careful not to seize
this moment for boasting. But some of them say privately that they
hope the outcome can help build an image of the vice president as a
man who may not be flashy but can work with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the inverse of Gore as boring, stiff and
noncharismatic _ in his steady, methodical way, he is a guy going
toward a larger goal,'' said one backer. ``He can talk about these
issues in ways that very few others can,'' this supporter said.
``He can pick up the phone.''

IN MICHIGAN, A POWERHOUSE GATHERING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Okla., N.H., Iowa)   By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. _ Every state has its insiders, its
striding embodiments of wealth or power, and Michigan is no
different. But in no other state do so many of them _ 1,400 this
year _ gather at a single schmoozefest like the one held here each
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit region's chamber of commerce is host to this
sprawling conference, where the business executives rub shoulders
with politicians for three days. Each year it draws ``about
everybody who is anybody in the state,'' from local government to
Congress, said Rep. John Dingell, Democratic dean of Michigan's
congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders and their lobbyists _ including those from the
giant American automakers and a number of other Fortune 500
companies _ are drawn by the chance to hobnob with the state's
politicians in a one-stop-shopping atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   They have been gathering here 19 years, for the Detroit Regional
Chamber Leadership Policy Conference. The event has become so
popular that more 200 people were turned away this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't get away unless they can swim real well,'' said
Randolph Agley, of Talon Group, a Detroit venture-capital company.
The island, 260 miles north of Detroit, can be reached only by
ferry or private plane.
</P>
<P>
   Though checks may not be exchanged here, the future support of
business leaders is expressed in handshakes. ``They make or break
politicians through financing their campaigns or through economic
development in their districts,'' said Mario Morrow, a Detroit
political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where all the deals are made,'' Morrow said. ``This is
where all the power brokers and political activists who have any
political power at all convene to set the agenda for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushing his way through a crowd of Michigan's movers and
shakers, Patrick McCollough, a longtime statehouse lobbyist,
grinned exuberantly. ``It's like Christmas shopping,'' he said,
walking out onto the porch of the Grand Hotel, as lilacs of every
hue bloomed on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   There were Michigan's political stars, Gov. John Engler, a
Republican, and Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, a Democrat. National
political figures attending included Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New
York; Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla.; Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.; and
Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume called on the hundreds of business leaders to hire
minority workers, not just sell products to them. Mfume said he
came here from Washington because ``this audience has the ability
to affect the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of people
around the state.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John Schwarz, R-Battle Creek, who is the Senate's
president pro tempore, said one of the benefits of the conference
was peculiar to the state's polarized racial politics. ``It helps
for the white business community in Oakland and McComb County to
get to know and to relate to the black business community in
Detroit and the black political leadership as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's politics extends into many other areas, though.
State legislators put the finishing touches on a bill that would
move Michigan's presidential primary to the third Tuesday of
February, after primaries in New Hampshire and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Why here? ``This is where so many of the key players are,'' said
State Sen. Ken Sikkema, who represents the Grand Rapids area.
``We're going to get it done this weekend and we'll move it next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders are involved in the politicking, as well.
William Clay Ford Jr., chairman of Ford Motor Co., encouraged
others to support Detroit. ``We look at social responsibility and
community involvement as a competitive advantage,'' Ford told the
group.
</P>
<P>
   More than 125 companies took his advice and volunteered to help
refurbish 263 run-down Detroit schools.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, who got a sunburn while golfing Friday afternoon with
his son, and several business executives and lawyers, said he had
made good use of the past two days. ``Since I've been up here,'' he
said, ``I've closed a number of business deals.''

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS RULING ON PRIVATE SCHOOL AID  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Utah, Calif.)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Raising the stakes in the debate over public aid to
parochial schools, the Clinton administration is asking the Supreme
Court to review a federal court's finding that it is
unconstitutional for public schools to provide computers and other
``instructional equipment'' for use in religious school classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has proposed spending $800 million on an
educational technology program that would, among other things, help
connect every classroom and school library in the country to the
Internet. But the little-noticed ruling last August by the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, poses a formidable
constitutional obstacle to that goal, as the administration told
the Supreme Court in a brief it filed last month.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's brief supports a group of parochial school
parents from the New Orleans area who are appealing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of the case reach far beyond classroom
computers to the highly charged question of where _ and how _ to
draw the line between permissible and prohibited government
assistance to religious schools. Although the question of publicly
financed vouchers for religious school tuition is not directly at
issue, the stakes are high for that constitutional debate as well.
</P>
<P>
   The court is likely to announce later this month whether it will
hear the appeal, a prospect significantly enhanced by the
administration's intervention. The fact that another federal
appeals court, the 9th Circuit in San Francisco, reached an
opposite conclusion three years earlier also adds to the likelihood
that the justices will add the case to their docket for the next
term.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit case began as a challenge to a provision of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 under which public
schools receive federal aid for special services and equipment,
including computers, and must share the material on a ``secular,
neutral, and nonideological'' basis with students enrolled in
private schools within their boundaries. Several taxpayers in
Jefferson Parish, La., where 41 out of 46 private schools were
religious, objected that this aspect of the program was
unconstitutional and filed a lawsuit in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The case had a tangled history before finally reaching the
appeals court last year. Writing for a three-judge panel, Judge
John M. Duhe Jr. opened his opinion by commenting that ``this case
requires us to find our way in the vast, perplexing desert of
Establishment Clause jurisprudence.'' He then went on to find that
a series of Supreme Court decisions on parochial school aid, dating
from the 1970s, had drawn a fairly clear line between the
permissible and the prohibited, based on the ``character of the aid
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Textbooks in secular subjects were on the permissible side of
the line, Duhe said, because in the Supreme Court's view, the
public school district could screen the books in advance to make
sure that they would not be used as part of a parochial school's
religious mission. But he said the precedents made clear that other
material, with less easily confined and ascertainable content, more
subject to diversion to religious purposes, were off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the 5th Circuit's view of the current state of the law
is accurate is obviously open to debate, given the 9th Circuit's
conflicting opinion in a similar case. So the real question in this
case, Mitchell vs. Helms, No. 98-1648, is where the justices think
their precedents place the line, and whether they are prepared to
adjust or jettison those precedents to make room for technology
that was not even on the horizon a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in a case from New York that concerned another
provision of the same 1965 federal education law, the court
explicitly overturned an earlier decision and ruled that the
Constitution permitted public school teachers to offer remedial
courses in parochial school classrooms. Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor's opinion for a 5-4 majority in that case, Agostini vs.
Felton, said the court's ``understanding of the criteria used to
assess whether aid to religion has an impermissible effect'' had
changed and that a 1985 decision barring public school teachers
from parochial classrooms was accordingly no longer good law.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief for the administration in the current case,
Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman cited the Agostini decision as an
indication that the ``broad categorical rule'' the 5th Circuit
derived from the Supreme Court's precedents, with textbooks on one
side of the line and everything else on the other, is no longer an
accurate statement of the majority's view. The brief invites the
justices to re-examine the precedents and, he said, adopt ``a more
nuanced rule'' that would permit public schools to provide
computers and other instructional equipment to parochial schools as
long as safeguards were in place to make sure the material would
not be diverted to religious use and would not ``supplant resources
that the school itself would otherwise provide or obtain.''
</P>
<P>
   Although cases in the lower courts seeking or challenging
tuition vouchers for parochial schools have been receiving
headlines, this case has been the focus of intense interest among
lawyers and others who monitor church-state developments. The
parochial school parents bringing the appeal are represented by
Michael W. McConnell, a law professor at the University of Utah
whose articles and advocacy for the view that religious and secular
institutions are constitutionally entitled to equal treatment have
been highly influential over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief, McConnell maintained that the 5th Circuit's
decision ``consigns those who attend religiously affiliated schools
to the use of textbooks under the program, while children of other
taxpayers are using graphing calculators to solve polynomial
equations and reading about the latest in Mesopotamian
archeological discoveries on CD-ROM's.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Boothby, a Washington lawyer and well-known advocate of
strict church-state separation, has represented the plaintiffs in
this case since they filed their lawsuit 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really at stake,'' he said in an interview last week,
``is whether we will abandon the concept the court has historically
followed of not providing any direct aid'' to parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is being asked to reject some pretty bedrock
no-direct-aid principles,'' he said, adding that if the justices
accepted that invitation, ``I don't know where you draw the line.''

AGASSI COMPLETES TRIP TO FRENCH OPEN FINAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ When the skies parted at noon Saturday as if on cue,
Andre Agassi, the balding optimist from Las Vegas who began growing
a French Open victory beard as soon as he negotiated his
opening-round hurdle here, quickly completed his rain-delayed
semifinal against Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty.
</P>
<P>
   After a night spent berating himself for not sweeping the
30th-ranked Slovak in straight sets, Agassi hustled back onto
center court with his Grand Slam blinders securely in place and, 23
minutes later, had wrapped up a 6-4,7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's victory over Hrbaty, who had upset top-ranked Yevgeny
Kafelnikov and ninth-seeded Marcelo Rios, sent him into the final
against another resurgent and balding Andre, 100th-ranked Andrei
Medvedev of the Ukraine. Agassi thus earned his third trip to the
French final, whereas Medvedev's best finish here was the 1993
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping I can make him worry about how to handle me,'' said
Agassi, who pronounced himself ``happy, blessed and committed'' to
making this Roland Garros final a ``no regrets'' experience for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi succumbed to Andres Gomez and Jim Courier in the 1990 and
1991 finals, but he didn't foresee that happening against Medvedev,
who sneaked into this final despite making 85 unforced errors in
his semifinal against Fernando Meligeni.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a wonderful two weeks,'' Agassi said. ``I think it's
teaching me exactly what I can accomplish if I put my mind to it.
The nerves will exist before and the relief will exist after.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1990 and 1991 French Open finals, Agassi said , he didn't
have the same direction or maturity that now informs his game, and
his life. Agassi called this 1999 edition of himself a far cry even
from the player he was in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I had to build over from 140th in the world; this
year I have a different goal for myself,'' said Agassi. ``I'm more
interested in coming into the slams feeling fresh, feeling strong,
and feeling ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi came into this major with an inflamed tendon in his right
shoulder but hasn't let it interfere with his mission to reassert
himself on the Grand Slam stage. ``You don't let any opportunities
to go by,'' said Agassi, who is currently three for seven in Grand
Slam finals.
</P>
<P>
   The American has not reached a Grand Slam final since the 1995
U. S. Open and won the last of his three Grand Slams at the 1995
Australian Open. If he wins this title, he would become the first
man to own titles at all four Grand Slams since Rod Laver collected
four in the space of a single season 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only Laver, Don Budge, Fred Perry and Roy Emerson have won
titles at all four Grand Slams, but their feats were accomplished
on just two surfaces, clay and grass. Agassi, who won his first
major at Wimbledon in 1992 and added two more on hard courts at the
1994 U.S. Open and 1995 Australian Open, would join Jimmy Connors
as the only men in the game's history to conquer Grand Slams on
three surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   But first Agassi has to conquer Medvedev, a man who rose to
fourth in the world after attaining the 1993 semifinals here but
soon tumbled off the radar. Injuries and a broken heart conspired
against Medvedev, but he claims to have been reborn this spring
after resuming his love affair with Anke Huber of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Medvedev's dismissals of second-seeded Pete Sampras and
eighth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten, the 1997 champion here, were
evidence of the 6-foot-4 player's rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, whose divorce from actress Brooke Shields was official
two months ago, said he didn't expect his single-minded
rededication to tennis to have any more impact on Sunday's final
than Medvedev's newfound bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like him being in love makes any difference to me
outside of the fact that he's a good guy and I'm happy to hear
that,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added with a smile, ``I'd prefer if he let his
girlfriend play for him instead, with all due respect to her
game.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Agassi knows what the tall Ukrainian is capable of on court; he
was beaten by Medvedev at New Haven in 1993 in their only previous
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Against Hrbaty on Friday, Agassi, who used midweek attendance at
a Bruce Springsteen concert to help defuse the tension of this
Grand Slam campaign, quickly assumed the upper hand. After being
broken in the sixth game, he ignored a 40-0 deficit as Hrbaty
served in the seventh game and commenced a 16-point winning spree
that switched the score from 4-2 for Hrbaty to 5-4 for the Las
Vegan. In the second set's tie breaker, Agassi used an ace to take
a 5-3 lead and got his second set point with a cross-court forehand
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, however, Agassi got off to wrong-footed start in the third
by dropping serve. By the time Hrbaty held for 5-3 it was raining,
and the American, annoyed that the weather was undermining his kick
serve and topspin and assisting Hrbaty's flat ground strokes, was
broken for the set by a backhand return.
</P>
<P>
   Though Agassi wanted play suspended there and then, the duo
ventured three games into the fourth set before play was suspended
with 2:03 on the match clock.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the elements were in Agassi's favor, and after a
nervous service game where he saved two breaks to level the set at
2-2, he settled down and made life miserable for Hrbaty, a
first-time Grand Slam semifinalist. Agassi broke for a 4-3 edge
with a backhand return, held with an ace for 5-3 and served out the
match at 5-4. A service winner gained him his first match point,
and a discouraged backhand into the net by Hrabty sent Agassi into
his eighth career Grand Slam final.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the former No. 1 in the world,'' Hrbaty said. ``I mean,
he knows something about the tennis. He has the game he can play on
all surfaces. I wanted to win, but he was better. There was like no
chance for me today.''

COMMENTARY: RUDY IN REVERSE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even at this distance, you can almost hear Rudy
raving, the shrill sound of one mayor carping: So she's going to do
it. Bring her on. I can take her.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't know the IRT from the IRS, but she thinks she
deserves to be a senator from New York just because she's a victim?
</P>
<P>
   Fine. I can do that. I can be a victim. I can pry some of that
sympathy vote away from her.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, I've been doing the victimizing. I've been raining
punishment on New York. I'm very proud to be the only politician of
our time who owes my success to my reputation as a victimizer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm taking all the fun out of Fun City. I'm closing down all the
places that Bill Clinton would love to visit when he moves here.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary used to be known as a victimizer, too. But then she
realized that in order to be a hero in this country, she had to
become a victim. And she was lucky. She was married to Bill
Clinton. All she had to do was wait. Victimization was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Bill's romp with Monica transformed Hillary into the most
popular, lovable woman in the country. Girls jump out of crowds to
touch the hem of her garment. She's Our Lady of Perpetual Conjugal
Suffering, the patron saint of every woman who's ever been wronged.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even going to be a campaign. It's just going to be a
massive ego trip (hers, not mine). Everything is all about her and
her sense of entitlement. It's like ``The First Wives Club,'' Part
II.
</P>
<P>
   But I can take her. No sweat. All I need to do is make myself
the perfect Giuliani victim. It's Giuliani time for Giuliani. After
years of giving pain to New Yorkers, now I need New Yorkers to feel
my pain.
</P>
<P>
   How can I show vulnerability? How can I soften, even feminize,
myself? How can I become a figure of pathos?
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough that I have no neck, a bad combover and a scary
smile. It will take a lot more than that to make people feel sorry
for me.
</P>
<P>
   I need to be punished. I need to be dealt a blow by fate. I need
to be ennobled by suffering. I need to cry a little bit and sigh a
little bit.
</P>
<P>
   I could ask Donna to pitch in. I could prevail upon her to order
some pizza from a hunky City Hall intern on a Saturday night when
no one else is around. I could get her to do a Bob Dole and trash
my campaign to The New York Times, maybe even throw her feminist
support to Hillary. That would humanize me!
</P>
<P>
   I'll start jaywalking all the time. I'll start spitting while
I'm jaywalking. Maybe some unfeeling cop will give me a ticket, or
better still, insult my ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   I'll let Goalie run around without a leash. If the city catches
and destroys my dog, all of New York will pity me.
</P>
<P>
   I'll turn up the Puccini on the car radio to 69 decibels, arrest
myself for ``unreasonable noise,'' find myself guilty, lock myself
up and complain loudly about my Draconian measures.
</P>
<P>
   I'll hail a cab, but all the cabbies will pass me by. When one
finally picks me up, the Sally Jessy Raphael tape will keep
skipping.
</P>
<P>
   I'll gorge on hot dogs from the vendors I tried to shut down and
then suffer terrible indigestion, which will be my just deserts.
</P>
<P>
   I'll loosen up by learning to do the Booty-Call line dance, like
Al Gore. At ladies' choice, nobody will ask me to dance. What a sad
sack I will be.
</P>
<P>
   I'll beat Hillary to the Martha Stewart punch and publish
``Rudolph Giuliani's Guide to Entertaining at Gracie Mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll hire Dick Morris; everybody feels sorry for his clients.
</P>
<P>
   I'll go on morning television and moan about a vast left-wing
conspiracy, from Balthazar to Barney Greengrass.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be conspicuously nestled in one of the community gardens
reading House &AMP; Garden.
</P>
<P>
   I'll shop at Restoration Hardware. I won't buy fireplace tools,
with which I might hurt someone. I'll buy scented candles.
</P>
<P>
   I'll sit in for Regis and powwow with Kathy Lee on gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   I'll summon reporters to my office and dramatically confess that
I've had bouts of depression.
</P>
<P>
   I'll go to the Lilith Fair, and wonder out loud why Joan
Osborne's second record hasn't been released.
</P>
<P>
   I'll get caught buying pornography, if I can find any.
</P>
<P>
   If the new Rudy doesn't carry the day, I'll declare martial law.
(BOX)

MAYORAL PANEL SAYS CUNY IS `ADRIFT' AND URGES OVERHAUL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying that the City University of New York is ``an
institution adrift'' and is ``caught in a spiral of decline,'' a
mayoral task force is calling for a total revamping of the
university.
</P>
<P>
   The task force report, which will be formally released Monday by
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, reaffirms the university's historic mission
of providing access to a higher education for the city's diverse
population.
</P>
<P>
   But it says that if it is to educate New Yorkers effectively, it
must be transformed from a loosely managed confederation of
scattered institutions with no direction and few standards into a
tightly managed operation that measures what its students know when
they enter, what they have learned by the time they leave and which
approaches are most effective in teaching them.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 200,000 students and a budget of nearly $2 billion,
CUNY is the United States' third-largest public university system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `chaotic' doesn't even begin to describe it; it's
moribund,'' said Benno Schmidt, the task force chairman. ``That
suggests a huge opportunity, but first CUNY needs to invent
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   While the report is highly critical of CUNY, as expected, it
assigns some blame for the university's problems to the city and
the state, and particularly New York City's weak public schools. It
also says the state's system of financial aid forces many students
who are not prepared for college work to enroll at CUNY, because it
is the only way they can receive financial support for their
remedial work.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many reports that end up sitting on the shelf after they
are issued, the Schmidt report has an unusually good chance to
become a blueprint for change. It comes as both the mayor and the
governor are pressing to revamp the university, and a majority of
the trustees support that goal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Herman Badillo, a member of the task force who was
promoted to the university's chairmanship last weekend, will be in
a unique position to press for the commission's recommendations. He
said the report would serve as CUNY's ``goal posts'' and that he
would present it to his fellow trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The commission offered a multitude of recommendations, including
the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ The state and the city should provide separate, additional
funding for students needing remedial instruction so they do not
use up their college aid while they learn reading, writing and
mathematics skills they should have learned before college.
</P>
<P>
   _ City University should continue to offer remedial courses, but
at its community colleges, and it must test students more carefully
before and after the courses to try to learn which approaches work
best.
</P>
<P>
   _ The university should designate at least two of its senior
colleges as flagship institutions that can attract students of high
academic promise.
</P>
<P>
   _ It must work with New York City's public high schools to try
to raise their quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``CUNY's downward spiral can be and must be reversed,'' the
report says. ``At the eve of a new century, the United States
urgently needs a model of the urban public university, and CUNY
should be that model of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   The study comes at a time when many universities, and
particularly urban universities, are struggling to cope with a
flood of poorly educated high school graduates and with immigrants
who speak little or no English but are desperate for a college
education to help them prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said in an interview that in an era when a college
degree has become ``virtually the only source of opportunity,'' he
hoped the report would offer strategic help not only for CUNY but
for all urban universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``CUNY's historic mission is more important now than it has ever
been,'' he said. ``CUNY has the chance to be the model for great
public urban universities for the next century, the way land-grant
institutions were in the last century, and it's absolutely vital to
make it right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is not an attack on open admissions,'' he added,
referring to CUNY's decision in the late 1960s to allow all high
school graduates to enter. ``This affirms the principle that CUNY
is for anyone with a high school diploma and for immigrants and for
returning adults; it is the way CUNY goes about it that is very
very flawed,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the mayor and the governor, whom Schmidt personally briefed
about the report, were said to be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sets such a positive tone for change,'' Michael McKeon,
Gov. George Pataki's press secretary, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he could not comment on how the governor would
respond to the report's recommendation for additional financial aid
for remedial students since the governor's staff was still going
through the details of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office said that the 109-page report will be posted
on the the city's Web site (www.ci.nyc.ny.us). The task force made
copies of the report and its 10 volumes of supporting studies
available to newspapers on Friday on the condition that no articles
be published until Monday. The Daily News printed an article on
Saturday that it said was based on an earlier draft of the report.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor created the task force in May 1998, there was
widespread skepticism that the panel would do anything more than
recommend shrinking the university and turning its work over to
private universities and corporations, since some of the panel's
seven members are advocates for privatization of government
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt is chairman of the Edison Project, a private company
that manages public schools for profit. Richard Schwartz, another
member, is a former senior adviser to Giuliani who helped design
New York City's welfare-to-work initiatives and privatization
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the report argues forcefully that City University
is critical for New York, and, if anything, should be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``CUNY's historic missions _ to provide broad access to a range
of higher education opportunities of quality, suited to New York
City's diverse population and to the city's needs _ will be more
important in the 21st century than ever before,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the task force was measured in its response to the
mayor's request to tell him how to privatize the university's
remedial functions. Rather than urging that such instruction be
shifted to private companies and private colleges, as the mayor has
advocated, the report called for experiments to stimulate
competition. It also says that City University should continue to
offer remedial courses, so long as the need exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``CUNY should provide remediation, and we applaud them for doing
it,'' Schmidt said. But, he added, ``It's very important for CUNY
to approach remediation in an organized, serious and effective way
because so many of its students fall into that category.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem, Schmidt said, was that the tests the university
uses to evaluate entering students ``are not good; they do not
generate diagnostically helpful information.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, a constitutional scholar who was formerly Dean of
Columbia University's Law School and president of Yale University,
approached the panel's investigation like an academic research
project, making it into virtually a second full-time job. He wrote
the final report himself, with help from other task force members.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a year, he met twice a month and sometimes
more frequently with the other members. He and staff members
visited all of the university's 17 undergraduate campuses and
interviewed hundreds of students, professors, administrators and
others. They held public hearings (some marked by protests by
students and professors). They commissioned reports from Rand Corp.
and Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the accounting and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the task force raised $300,000, in sums of
$75,000 or less from various foundations, to help pay for the work,
and is still trying to raise more.

COMMENTARY: IT COULD HAPPEN 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She's gotten through the health-care debacle, Whitewater, the
Lewinsky scandal and the impeachment of her husband. Now Hillary
Rodham Clinton is packing her carpetbag and preparing to run for
the U.S. Senate in New York. Welcome to the post-traumatic stress
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense. A seat in the Senate is more satisfying than
therapy, more fun than divorce. It's the perfect way for the
Clintons to hang on to the power, glamour and excitement they both
crave. Mrs. Clinton's historic quest is already overshadowing Al
Gore's lackluster run for the presidency. If the first lady makes
it to the Senate, it will be impossible to quiet the calls that she
run for president herself.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate threat to this grand scenario is one Rudolph
Giuliani, who has grand ambitions of his own. The compulsively
combative mayor is laying the land mines and marshaling the forces
he plans to use to demolish the first lady's dream. The pollsters,
the political consultants and the press are beside themselves with
glee. They expect the coming clash to be colossal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make the gunfight at the OK Corral look like a
gourmet meal,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist
Institute for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   t's a difficult fight to handicap. Both camps will be
incredibly well financed. Mrs. Clinton's carpetbagger status is an
advantage for Giuliani. But the mayor may face a primary threat
from Rep. Rick Lazio, an attractive candidate from Long Island who,
at least for now, has the support of Gov. George Pataki and former
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who are both angry (that's an understatement)
at Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he gets the nomination, Giuliani would appear to be
especially strong in the suburbs, where he is widely admired as the
man who made New York a safer place. Suburban voters who now feel
more comfortable coming into the city for work and for pleasure,
and who worry less about their kids coming into the city, are
grateful to him.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton will need to roll up an enormous majority in
traditionally Democratic New York City to offset Giuliani's
strength in the suburbs and the normal Republican advantage
upstate. Charles Schumer took nearly 75 percent of the city vote
when he defeated Al D'Amato in the Senate race last year. But
Giuliani will not be as vulnerable in the city as most Republicans
have been.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor may also be helped by the so-called Clinton fatigue
factor. A lot of voters have had their fill of Bill and Hillary and
would like to move on. For those voters, almost any other candidate
will do.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, on the other hand, may be helped by Giuliani's
tendency to go overboard in his attacks on his opponents. He seems
to enjoy demonizing and humiliating them. Said one Democrat:
``Ohmigod, he's going to try to kick the daylights out of her. And
if he does that, it would be a mistake. He could generate sympathy
for her and unite women for her.''
</P>
<P>
   If New York Democrats were smart (and there is no evidence that
this is the case), they would be registering everything that moves
in the city and the suburbs. The publicity generated by a
Clinton-Giuliani race, the widespread hostility toward Giuliani
among blacks and some other ethnic minorities, and the fact that
the race will occur in a presidential election year will tend to
boost turnout. For Mrs. Clinton to have a good shot at winning,
that increased turnout will have to be stocked with loads of new
voters committed to her.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is scanning the real-estate listings and is
expected to set up light housekeeping in the suburbs. Her celebrity
will generate excitement and keep the money flowing. But that won't
be enough. She'll have to find a way to get New Yorkers to embrace
her. She'll need a compelling message, a rationale for her
candidacy that resonates not just with Democrats, but with
independent-minded voters, especially those in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   It could happen. If she can erode some of Giuliani's suburban
strength, and if Democrats around the state do a good job getting
their voters to the polls, and if women rally to her cause, Mrs.
Clinton could land not just in the Senate but in the history books
in her own right.

AS ALLIES CONTINUE BOMBING, MOSCOW SHOWS ITS IRRITATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Despite the apparent imminence of a peace
deal, NATO kept up the bombing of Yugoslavia on Saturday _ an act
that allied diplomats said riled Russia so much that Moscow delayed
a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
the foreign ministers of seven other countries, including Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting had been planned for Bonn on Sunday. German
officials said Albright, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and
their counterparts from the six most powerful industrial
democracies were now expected to meet Monday to draft a United
Nations Security Council resolution approving the peacekeeping
mission for Kosovo and putting the Serbian province under
international civil administration so that reconstruction can
begin.
</P>
<P>
   The British general who will command the peacekeepers met
Saturday with Yugoslav officers on the Macedonian border to present
them with the terms for their withdrawal within seven days from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Yugoslavia inactivates and withdraws air defense
radars, missiles, and antiaircraft artillery from Serbia, and
low-flying allied aircraft can see that Serbian forces are actually
starting to move out of Kosovo, NATO officials said, the alliance
would halt the bombing. But they said that would probably not
happen before Sunday evening, and that Monday was probably the
earliest that peacekeepers would be ready to start moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was insisting that Ivanov would not attend the foreign
ministers' meeting in Bonn until the bombing stopped, according to
one diplomat here. Russia apparently also failed to take up an
invitation to send an observer to the talks between Lt. Gen. Sir
Michael Jackson of Britain and the Yugoslav army in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told European Union and
Russian negotiators in Belgrade on Thursday that, after 10 weeks of
bombing, he was ready to accept allied terms, pull his 40,000
troops, paramilitaries and police forces out of Kosovo, and allow
international peacekeepers to escort nearly 1.5 million ethnic
Albanian refugees back to their ruined homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we have learned about President Milosevic is that we
cannot take his word on anything,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea
on Saturday morning in explaining why the allies had not stopped
their attacks. ``We are determined to put Belgrade to the test,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied ambassadors planned to meet in Brussels on Sunday to
approve an operational order enabling Jackson to start moving his
forces in as early as Monday. The order would determine the rules
on how the peacekeepers would respond to attacks against them or
violations of the withdrawal terms.
</P>
<P>
   It would also spell out what the peacekeepers should do if they
find people indicted by the international criminal tribunal in The
Hague for war crimes committed by Yugoslav and Serbian forces in
Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces were still engaged Saturday in ``intense''
fighting with ethnic Albanian rebel soldiers of the Kosovo
Liberation Army on the border between Albania and Kosovo, Shea
said. NATO forces concentrated most of the bombing Friday and
Saturday on Serbian units in that area, attacking nine tanks, 21
armored personnel carriers, 30 artillery pieces, five mortar
positions and fortified troop positions.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, a spokesman for the allied military
command, said only anti-aircraft guns and a shoulder-fired missile
had shot at NATO planes Saturday, but that none had been hit.
</P>
<P>
   Allied planes flew 536 separate missions between Friday and
Saturday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides agreeing to a very specific and complete withdrawal of
military and police forces, Shea said, the Yugoslavs are also
expected to give Jackson complete information about all mines in
Kosovo, and withdraw all aircraft, air defense, radars and
communications systems. The peacekeepers would also be expected to
see to it that the Kosovo Liberation Army is disbanded and
disarmed, though Jertz said Saturday that this was ``a difficult
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian leaders agreed to disarmament when they signed
an accord in Paris in March. Milosevic's refusal to accept that
agreement led to the start of NATO's bombing campaign March 24.
</P>
<P>
   With the allies now focused on planning for peacekeeping,
British Defense Ministry officials in London announced Saturday
that 7,500 more British troops would move to Jackson's command in
Macedonia by June 13, making the British, with 13,000 soldiers, the
largest single contributor to the peacekeeping force. Britain,
France, Germany, and other European countries now have about 15,000
troops in Macedonia, most of whom would go into Kosovo as
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and France have said they would provide 7,000
troops each for the peacekeeping operation, which NATO plans to
call ``Joint Guardian.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the 47,868 soldiers already pledged would come from
other NATO European countries and 11 other eastern European and
nonaligned nations, all of which have confirmed their offers of
participation with the allied military command, Shea said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The allies would like to have Russian forces join them, but have
not yet been able to work out command arrangements with Moscow,
which is not willing to place its soldiers under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope in coming days to sit at a table and see what Russia
can contribute and how,'' Shea said. ``NATO will do its best to
find a formula that could associate the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   How the civilian reconstruction effort in Kosovo will be
coordinated, and what international organizations will oversee it,
has not been decided, according to diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has proposed a longterm
stability pact for the Balkans to encourage international
investment. Romano Prodi, the new president of the 15-nation
European Union's Executive Commission, has estimated the costs of
reconstructing and supporting the 2 million people of Kosovo at
about $6 billion a year for at least five years.

AS WELFARE ROLES SHRINK, CITIES SHOULDER BIGGER LOAD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif., Ohio, Tenn., Ill., Md.)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Welfare rolls are shrinking more slowly in big
cities than elsewhere in the states and, as a result, welfare
recipients are increasingly concentrated in urban areas, state and
local officials and welfare policy experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The largest American cities are becoming home to a larger and
larger share of the nation's welfare recipients,'' said Bruce Katz,
director of the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy at the
Brookings Institution here.
</P>
<P>
   Urban counties containing the 30 largest American cities have 20
percent of the nation's population, but 39 percent of the welfare
recipients _ up from 33 percent in 1994, Katz said. He recently
completed a two-year study of welfare rolls in U.S. cities,
methodically tabulating caseload data for each city after finding
that the federal government no longer collected such information.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1998, the number of families on welfare declined 35
percent in the big cities (those with populations of more than
470,000), compared with a decline of 44 percent for the nation as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Federal, state and local officials offer many explanations for
the disparities.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Cooper, a deputy mayor of Philadelphia, said:
``Philadelphia, the city proper, has had a weak economy with a slow
recovery from the last recession. The proportion of welfare
recipients who have been on the rolls for two years or more is
higher here than in the rest of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia had 39 percent of the families receiving welfare in
Pennsylvania in 1994, but the proportion reached 47 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   A booming economy has created millions of jobs across the
country. But Ms. Cooper said that job growth in Philadelphia had
been stunted because of ``an extraordinarily high business-tax
burden,'' which includes a 4.7 percent tax on wages. A recent
report from Mayor Edward Rendell, a Democrat, said that
Philadelphia's ``oppressive tax structure'' had driven hundreds of
businesses from the city and caused the loss of tens of thousands
of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Cooper said, auto insurance premiums are
extremely high for many inner-city neighborhoods of Philadelphia,
so it is difficult for poor people to afford cars to get to jobs in
the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, said: ``Three-fourths of the people on welfare
live in inner cities. But two-thirds to three-fourths of all new
jobs are being created outside urban areas.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City has aggressively reduced its welfare rolls,
converting welfare offices to job centers and emphasizing ``work
first.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1998, the number of families on welfare in New York
City declined 28 percent, to 225,651, while the total number of
families on welfare in New York state declined 30 percent, to
323,723. The city now has 70 percent of the state's welfare cases,
up from 68 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Los Angeles County now has 37 percent of the families
on welfare in California, up from 34 percent in 1994, while Chicago
(Cook County) has 74 percent of the Illinois caseload, up from 66
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Katz said, people who remain on welfare are those
with the most problems. They are more likely to have mental
illnesses, learning disabilities or histories of alcohol and drug
abuse. They tend to have fewer job skills, less formal education
and less work experience. Many of the women suffer abuse from
husbands or companions.
</P>
<P>
   Katz found that Baltimore's share of the Maryland caseload rose
to 56 percent in 1998, from 48 percent in 1994, while Detroit's
share of the Michigan total rose to 48 percent, from 42 percent.
Shelby County, Tenn., which includes Memphis, has 35 percent of the
state's welfare families, up from 28 percent in 1994. Cleveland has
24 percent of Ohio's cases, up from 19 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, states now have more money to spend on each welfare
recipient because they receive a fixed amount of federal welfare
money each year, a ``block grant,'' even if the number of welfare
recipients declines. But Ms. Cooper noted that the money goes to
the state, and she said there was no guarantee that the governor
and the state legislature would provide money to cities in
proportion to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bias in Harrisburg against appropriating resources
to the city of Philadelphia,'' Ms. Cooper said. ``That's a historic
bias. It's like a mantra: no state money in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements over welfare policy have caused ``considerable
antagonism between the city and the state,'' which cooperate on
many other issues, Ms. Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Walker, director of operations at the Illinois Department
of Human Services, said Chicago and Cook County had initially
lagged behind other parts of the state in responding to the
landmark welfare law approved by Congress in 1996. But that has
changed, Ms. Walker said, and the city accounts for much of the
recent decline in the state's welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Month after month in the last year,'' Ms. Walker said, ``we've
seen a rise in the number of welfare recipients who are working in
poverty-stricken communities of Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   A few cities, defying the national trend, have reduced their
welfare rolls faster than the states in which they are located.
These cities include San Jose, Calif., in Santa Clara County.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Szalay, executive director of the California State
Association of Counties, said, ``Santa Clara came out of the
recession early and did a tremendous amount of work to anticipate
welfare reform,'' using its own money to provide job training,
child care and transportation for welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The growing concentration of recipients in big cities coincides
with changes in the racial and ethnic profile of families on
welfare. Whites are leaving the welfare rolls much faster than
black and Hispanic families, and the minority share of the caseload
has, as a result, risen to the highest level on record. Black and
Hispanic welfare recipients together outnumber whites by about two
to one.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials carefully monitor the number of welfare
recipients in each state. But Kharfen, from the Department of
Health and Human Services, said the federal government stopped
collecting welfare data on counties and metropolitan areas about
five years ago, when officials placed a higher priority on carrying
out changes in welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Katz said his research on the cities should serve as ``a
cautionary note for states that are boasting a bit too loudly about
the dramatic declines in welfare caseloads.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE KNICKS' EVOLVING SEASONS THROUGH THE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every generation gets the Knicks team it deserves,
actually the Knicks team we fantasize about. Already, I am becoming
defensively nostalgic for this team. Who knows how the world will
turn this week? We already know fate is an Achilles' tendon, a
questionable call, a finger roll away. You go to sleep with Jeff
Van Gundy biting your leg and you wake up to find Phil Jackson
meditating at the foot of your bed. Now and Zen. We might deserve
that, too.
</P>
<P>
   This all presupposes that you really know and care about the
similarities and differences between Red and Gumby, between the
Captain and Patrick, between Clyde and Spree, between, most
important, George Lois and Spike Lee. On the other hand, you might
well be a pure hoops junkie, a lover of mechanics, in which case
you can just post up and out.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can try to take this as far as it goes to ``Black Planet:
Facing Race During an NBA Season,'' a risky and brilliant book that
Crown will publish in the fall. It compares favorably to Frederick
Exley's classic ``A Fan's Notes.'' It is an emotional journey into
Jock Culture's heart of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Our protagonist-guide in ``Black Planet'' is novelist David
Shields, who writes: ``It would be impossible to overstate the
degree to which sports-talk radio is shadowed by the homosexual
panic implicit in the fact that it consists almost entirely of a
bunch of out-of-shape white men sitting around talking about black
men's buff bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields was on sabbatical from teaching English at the
University of Washington when he began covering the Seattle
SuperSonics for a local weekly and for an insider's book about the
1994-95 season. He caught a sense of the routine contempt athletes
have for sportswriters, but he didn't last long enough to be used
by them for negotiations and revenge. Management suddenly withdrew
credentials and access, which turned out to be to Shields' and the
reader's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of another piece of reportage, made bitter or
ingratiating by how the reporter was treated, we get serious
reflection; Shields wrote from a spectator's remove, buying good
season tickets and monitoring the Internet and talk radio. Exley's
object of obsession was Frank Gifford; Shields' is Seattle's point
guard, Gary Payton, whose ``outlaw'' pose he found ``erotic.''
</P>
<P>
   How else to think of Latrell Sprewell, who makes some people
nervous, who liberates others? Is Spree the free radical who will
destroy the body, or is he the ruthlessly self-focused artist who
will finally get that chapel ceiling painted? Remember that Walt
Frazier, currently such a consciously benign role model, was
watched warily 30 years ago lest his clothes, his now-quaint
``rocking steady'' cool (a jazz root of hip-hop) corrupt the
suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the '60s there was talk of the game's becoming too
black. Bill Bradley was promoted as a Knick who would bring to the
Garden white, upper-middle-class, well-educated consumers like
himself, the kind of crossover customers who would decades later go
to opera to hear the three tenors. No one seemed whiter than
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Shields writes: ``The tension between players and coaches in the
NBA seems a reflection, in part, of the fact that a middle-aged
white man is acting as a faux father figure for young black men,
the overwhelming majority of whom grew up without fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Red Holzman and Jeff Van Gundy, comforting
figures for their times. A been-there-done-that former player,
Uncle Red masked his authoritarianism with chuckly aphorisms
(``Never go to a bald barber'') and never blatantly tried to
upstage his players. Of course, he didn't have to then; the white
press naturally assumed that Coach was the central intelligence,
players merely the arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Another former player, workaholic and teacher, Pat Riley, had to
make more of an issue of his control, flaunting his amateur
head-shrinking and his inspirational babble. Ultimately, it didn't
help John Starks, who probably could have used real therapy, or the
group dynamic; was the mugger image Riley's genius or his loss of
control? Or was it what we wanted then, the swagger of rap coming
to the mainstream? Now, of course, it is considered poetry, on a
par with the Cavaliers (not Cleveland), and slams are as
institutionalized as dunk contests.
</P>
<P>
   Most athletes are in a stage of arrested adolescence, glancing
over their shoulders at Dad while pretending to rebel against him.
The best seem to make peace with that conflict, even if it involves
choking Dad without actually killing him. Who would ever choke Van
Gundy, who looks and acts like those killer nerds, brilliant,
consumed, loyal, who built the silicon empires. Given the chance,
Van Gundy will make everyone richer or die trying.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman and Van Gundy both had to build around stationary
pillars, strong and moral centers, Willis Reed and Patrick Ewing,
both of whom played with pain. The Captain, grievously injured,
medicated, limped out to beat Wilt Chamberlain and the Lakers in
1970. Poor Ewing, tagged ``warrior'' by a generation that took its
warlike victories in boardrooms and on playing fields, never got
the support he needed to win. Eventually, even his body let him
down. But he can't lose. If the Knicks are beaten without him, it
will be seen as proof of his importance. If they win, it will be
proof of his inspirational leadership from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   No one understood any of this better than the superstar fan of
each era. The Holzman-Bradley-Frazier-Reed cheerleader was an
advertising executive, George Lois, ahead of his time in sensing
the edgy eroticism of the game and its potential to transcend the
hardwood. He was replaced by Spike Lee, who may be remembered for
his provocative films, but seems to be making his living selling
the shoes his heroes wear. (It's interesting that New York's
superfans are image-makers and Los Angeles' superfans are images.)
</P>
<P>
   The superfan of the future may be the intellectual from a small
market who played high school basketball and, approaching middle
age with a wife and child, still finds something in the game that
engages him in ways that nothing else can. This is Shields in
Seattle, willing to write himself naked about the hungers and
envies that move across the grandstand like the wave. In one of his
dreams, he knocks down jumpers off Payton passes, but worries about
passing the real test _ the repartee between plays.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ That was quite an off-Broadway performance the other
day by Jeff Van Gundy up at the Knicks' training base in Purchase.
The embattled coach made a colorful and calculated plea to the
officials to come to their senses and save the Knicks from being
rear-ended out of the playoffs by a sturdy compact named Mark
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the same Mark Jackson who was driven right out of New York
by a certain coaching legend for allegedly being too slow, unable
to guard a waste basket and for desecrating the sport with a push
shot he developed by watching early home movies discovered in the
basement of Dr. Naismith's long-deceased third cousin.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, Jackson has dramatically been elevated, at least against
the Knicks, from cagey point guard to controversial post god.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to end up doubling Mark, he's going to crush
you,'' Van Gundy raved before the Knicks and Pacers squared off
Saturday night in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference final at Madison
Square Garden. ``He's as good a passer out of the post as anyone _
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Before we get carried away, let's remember that out West in the
Portland-San Antonio series, the post confrontation is Arvydas
Sabonis, who passes like Bill Walton, against Tim Duncan, who plays
like Bill Walton. Here in the East, the strategic fascination has
been centered around the 6-foot-3-inch, 185-pound Jackson backing
up rather inelegantly, like a bumper car with a reverse gear,
against Charlie Ward and Chris Childs.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead. Sell that one to Madison Avenue. Mark Jackson's
posterior against Chris Childs' chest. Fantastic!
</P>
<P>
   If there is one ratings-driving luxury the National Basketball
Association has been able to count on for years, it has been
prime-time matchups for climactic late-night programming. Magic
versus Dr. J. Bird against Magic. Kareem on Moses. Hakeem and Shaq.
Jordan against the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if it isn't bad enough that Jordan has left and pro ball
has devolved into a stationary game of dribble, dribble, foul,
clank, here is Larry Bird, of all people, trying to have Jackson
back the Pacers into the finals, with all the fluidity of a piano
being shoehorned through a doorway.
</P>
<P>
   In the mind's eye, Oscar Robertson and the Knicks' own Walt
Frazier are always playing with their backs to the basket, but
about to pirouette, float in the lane, or fade gracefully for a
textbook jumper. And there was always ballet in the feet of the
great post giants, Kareem positioning for his sky hook, Olajuwon
drawing the defender off his feet, again and again, like a
frustrated marionette.
</P>
<P>
   That was dance. This is drudgery, none of it the fault of
Jackson, who is only best using his modest offensive gifts. Van
Gundy is right _ Jackson is and always has been a great passer. If
the Knicks are foolish enough to double-team, Bird would be crazy
not to run this set every time down. With a lineup of outside
shooters who have difficulty creating their own shots, that is
allowing the Pacers to create a good shot without so much as
breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy agrees, but complains that Jackson is too often
allowed to turn his left shoulder and lower it into the chest of
the defender, to support the drive of his legs and rear. If the
defender gives ground, he'll wind up under the basket with Jackson
in position to shoot a jump hook that is short on jump and long on
hook. If Ward and Childs hold their ground but get called for the
block _ as was the case in Game 2 _ they'll foul out by the end of
a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go to basketball camp when you're young and practice
that move,'' Van Gundy said. ``You learn the back-in in the NBA.
It's called displacement, but an offensive player doesn't have the
right to drive his shoulder through you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wars could begin and end with all the time between these games,
but one argument Van Gundy is not going to settle is what actually
constitutes a playoff foul. The mood of the officials. The
alignment of the stars. From one game to the next, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Quit posturing. Jackson is not the first point guard to cause
problems on the post. When Tim Hardaway was healthy, he, too, could
score from there against Childs and Ward. If the Pacers want to
stand around and watch their season hinge on Jackson's hang time,
let them.
</P>
<P>
   Mix up the defensive matchups. Put a bigger man on Jackson from
time to time. The Bulls sent long-limbed Scottie Pippen after
Jackson in last year's conference final and the jump hook went the
way of the hula hoop. The Pacers went back to setting screens for
Reggie Miller, and playing off Rik Smits. On Broadway, we prefer
dance. Used to be that displacement came for those who couldn't. &QL;

CROCKER SNOW, EARLY PILOT AND AVIATION EXPERT, DIES AT 94 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Mass.)  (rk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crocker Snow, a pilot and aviation official whose aerial
adventures spanned more than seven decades, from the biplane era to
the jet age, died on Tuesday at his home in Ipswich, Mass. He was
94.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, who had flown more than 15,000 hours in 140 types of
planes, helped inaugurate commercial air travel in New England,
oversaw civil aviation in Massachusetts and served as head of a
federal advisory panel on air traffic. As an officer in the Army
Air Forces in World War II, he directed the ferrying of aircraft
from the United States to Britain. And he flew more than 20 bombing
missions in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Snow flew solo until last year, operating a single-engine North
American Navion he bought in 1947. He logged more than 900,000
miles in the plane. Its base was a grassy airstrip alongside his
home; the Federal Aviation Administration informally referred to it
as the Ipswich International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, the son of a lawyer, was born in Boston on Feb. 26, 1905,
14 months after Orville and Wilbur Wright made the first successful
flights of a heavier-than-air machine in Kitty Hawk, N.C. As a boy,
Snow was captivated by the exploits of the World War I air aces and
the achievements of his oldest brother, Bill, a naval aviator who
flew anti-submarine patrols off the French and English coasts.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1922, while a freshman at Harvard, Snow rode in an
open-cockpit Avro biplane flown by another brother, Kick, a pilot
in the Massachusetts Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first flight was all I had dreamed of: sailing effortlessly
over the trees at the end of the field, watching the houses shrink
and the landscape expand as we climbed,'' Snow recalled in ``Log
Book: A Pilot's Life'' (Brassey's, 1997). ``It was incredible _ the
freedom, the solitude and the boundless possibility of the open
skies. The exhilaration of flying would stay with me forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Kick Snow was killed in an air crash in 1923, but Crocker Snow
was determined to fly. He received Massachusetts pilot license No.
5 in February 1927, during his freshman year at Harvard Law School,
and by May was giving rides in an OX-5 Travel Air biplane.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first passengers was a social worker at Denison
House, a haven for the poor in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Denison House friend approached to ask if I could possibly
fly her over the city to drop leaflets advertising a charity
fund-raiser,'' Snow said in his book. ``It was drizzling, with a
low ceiling, and most pilots probably wouldn't have gone up.
However, I was always ready for a good excuse to fly, especially if
it involved an attractive young lady passenger, so I said, `Sure.'
She loaded up her `flyers' and we were off.''
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper headline the next day read, with a slight
misspelling: ``Miss Amelia Earheart Flies in a Plane Over Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Amelia Earhart, who went on to become a noted aviator before
vanishing over the Pacific Ocean on her round-the-world flight in
1937, was not Snow's only passenger to gain aviation renown.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s, he gave flying instruction to Nancy Harkness
Love and Jacqueline Cochran, who became commanders of the Women's
Air Force Service Pilots in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Snow dropped out of Harvard Law School after one year, and in
March 1928 became a founder of Skyways, one of the first commercial
airlines in Boston. He was named the first director of aeronautics
for Massachusetts in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the United States entered World War II in 1941, Snow,
although only a lieutenant, took control of the ferrying operation
that moved aircraft over the North Atlantic to Britain by using
airfields he helped develop in Maine, Newfoundland, Iceland and
Greenland. In November 1944, while deputy commander of the 498th
Bomb Group, he flew on the first bombing raid of Japan by B-29
Superfortresses.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Army Air Forces as a lieutenant colonel, Snow
returned to his post overseeing civilian air traffic in
Massachusetts. In the early 1970s he was chairman of the Federal
Aviation Advisory Commission, a panel created by Congress to study
the long-range needs of commercial and private aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Snow is survived by his wife, Janice Vaughan; a son, Crocker
Jr., and a stepson, Donald Vaughan Little, both of Ipswich; a
stepdaughter, Janice Patricia Moseley of Hamilton, Mass., nine
grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

RUTH LANGER LAWRENCE, 77, BOYCOTTED 1936 OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga., Ore.)  (rk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Langer Lawrence, who as a 15-year-old Austrian Jewish
swimmer refused to compete in the 1936 Olympic Games in Nazi
Germany, died May 2. Lawrence, who lived in London, was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence was born and reared in Vienna and took up swimming at
age 11 with the Jewish sports club Hakoah (meaning strength). At
14, she broke the Austrian records for the 100-meter and 400-meter
freestyles and won the Austrian championships at those distances.
</P>
<P>
   Although Austrian officials were uncomfortable about choosing
Jews for their Olympic team, she, Judith Deutsch and Lucie Goldner,
all Jews, were about to be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism was strong in Austria then, and the pools where
the swimmers would do their final training carried signs saying
``No entry for dogs and Jews.'' Heeding the recommendation of the
World Federation of Jewish Sports Clubs, headed by Lord Melchett of
Britain, the three swimmers refused to take part in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not boycott Olympia, but Berlin,'' they said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The three women were immediately banned from Austrian swimming
``due to severe damage of Austrian sports'' and ``gross disrespect
for the Olympic spirit.'' The names of all Jewish swimmers were
removed from the Austrian record books.
</P>
<P>
   After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Lawrence escaped to Italy
by dyeing her hair blonde and carrying a false baptismal
certificate. In 1939, she moved to England, and that year she won
the last British long-distance championship swim in the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, World War II began and she was evacuated from
London to Bath as an ``enemy alien.'' She was later allowed to
return to London, where she met John Lawrence, whom she married in
1943. She is survived by her husband, a son and a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's photograph is included in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum's traveling exhibition of the Nazi Olympics. The exhibition
closed last week in Portland, Ore., and will reopen July 1 in San
Diego. She was also interviewed for Stephen Spielberg's Holocaust
archives.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Lawrence told Reuters:
``Whenever the Games come up again, I get a heartache. It's
something that stays with you for the rest of your life. It was a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But being Jewish, it was
unthinkable to compete in the Games in Nazi Germany, where my
people were being persecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Federation of Austrian Swimming Clubs lifted the
ban imposed on her. The federation president wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I learned in recent weeks that athletes who refused to
serve as window-dressing for the Hitler regime received a lifetime
ban ... I blushed with anger and shame. I am deeply ashamed of the
decision taken at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You, who as an irreproachable and decent athlete, did
everything you could to achieve athletic success, were already
stamped by the Nuremberg Laws as a second-class person, and for
renouncing athletic success in order to show solidarity with the
persecuted, you were punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those responsible today for the Federation of Austrian
Swimming Clubs are glad that you survived that cruel and merciless
time and humbly apologize for what our predecessors did. All of
your athletic successes and achievements are hereby confirmed and
recorded in the perpetual scoring tables. You, Ms. Lawrence, are an
example to young people. We are proud that you are there.''

BAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 A 19-MONTH cONFINEMENT SHOWS PLIGHT OF THOSE TOO POOR TO POST (bl)  
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The verdict was the one that Jose Padro had longed
for: not guilty. The sentence, though, was irreversible: 19 months
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   A paradox lies at the heart of Padro's strange journey through
New York's criminal justice system. Accused of a serious sex crime
and unable to raise $5,000 for bail, Padro spent more than a year
and a half on Rikers Island, in what is euphemistically known as
pretrial detention. Adamant in proclaiming his innocence, he turned
down two offers for a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Padro, 28, who was born and raised in the Bronx,
prevailed. Acting State Supreme Court Justice Dominic Massaro
acquitted him in late January, after a long nonjury trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Padro paid a heavy price. He served more time in jail before
acquittal than he probably would have under either of the plea
offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stand by what I believed, and I believed I was
innocent,'' Padro said. ``I believed in the legal system. I threw
myself at its feet. I thought they would believe me. They did, but
look how long it took.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the details of the case are salacious _ Padro was
accused of sexually assaulting a quadriplegic man for whom he
worked as a home health aide _ Padro's experience with the criminal
justice system is fairly common, many legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, bail exists only to insure that a defendant will
return to court for hearings and a trial. But poor and
working-class defendants often lack the money to make bail, and
they can languish in jail for a year or more before their guilt or
innocence is determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several national studies have made clear that people were
being detained arbitrarily, not on their willingness to return, but
on their lack of money,'' said Chester Mirsky, a professor of
clinical law at New York University Law School. ``The question you
have to ask yourself is whether money bail is an appropriate
measure of someone's willingness to return to court, or if it
simply reflects someone's ability to pay bail.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who cannot afford to make bail, there is often added
pressure to agree to plead guilty to a reduced charge, usually in
return for a reduced sentence. It is the rare criminal defendant
who actually goes on trial; only 6.5 percent of felony indictments
in New York City resulted in trials last year, according to the
state Office of Court Administration. More than 82 percent were
resolved through pleas.
</P>
<P>
   Padro said his legal odyssey had its origin in a dispute over a
cup of soup. He had worked for three months in the small rundown
apartment of Alberto Edwards in the Parkchester section of the
Bronx. Edwards, who was shot eight years ago, needs the help of
home attendants for virtually every aspect of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who stands by his accusation, had complained early to
officials of the home-care agency that oversees his care, Partners
in Care, that he did not want Padro as his aide because he thought
Padro was gay. But Padro, who is gay but never acknowledged this to
Edwards, continued to work 12-hour shifts, three days a week, at
the apartment. ``He was very moody,'' Padro said of Edwards. ``One
minute he was fine, and the next minute he was ranting and
raving.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Padro did not know it at the time, Edwards had a long
history of complaining about health aides to the agency, court
records show. Many aides said he had been verbally abusive.
</P>
<P>
   On May 2, 1997, a Friday, the tension between Padro and Edwards
erupted. Padro said he had heated up some soup with rice and,
seated on a crate, had tried to spoon-feed it to Edwards. Some soup
fell on Edwards' chest. ``He said I'd burned him, that I was
incompetent,'' Padro said.
</P>
<P>
   They argued, and Edwards said he did not want Padro to work in
his home anymore. ``He said, `I'm going to tell them you sexually
abused me,''' Padro said.
</P>
<P>
   Padro said he did not take the threat seriously because Edwards
had made many threats previously, though none involved sexual
accusations. Padro told a supervisor at Partners in Care that
evening that he could no longer work with Edwards. About the same
time, court records show, Edwards was on the phone with another
official of the agency, saying that while he had been in bed that
afternoon, Padro had performed oral sex on him against his will.
</P>
<P>
   The next Monday, Padro met with several supervisors at the
agency, and he said they seemed not to believe Edwards' story.
</P>
<P>
   But police, whom Edwards had also called with his accusation,
were less understanding. Within six weeks, Padro was arrested. Soon
afterward, he was indicted by a grand jury on charges of
first-degree sodomy and first-degree sexual assault, with bail set
at $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bail was reduced to $5,000 in September 1997, but Padro said
he and his family lacked the money to meet either figure. He
bounced for months between Rikers and State Supreme Court in the
Bronx, where nearly two dozen hearings were held.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is poor, Padro was represented by the Legal Aid
Society. He said he was offered a plea bargain early in the case.
``The Legal Aid said I could cop out now,'' Padro said. ``He told
me the DA was offering me one to three years if I copped out. I
said, `No, I don't want to cop out.' I was innocent. He said a
trial could take six months to a year. I told him, `As long as it
takes.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It took longer than either of them had imagined. Padro went
through three lawyers, with the first two leaving Legal Aid for
reasons unrelated to the case. It took time for each of the new
lawyers to learn the case, although the turnover was not a major
reason for the delays, said Irwin Shaw, the attorney in charge of
the Bronx office of Legal Aid's criminal division.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said that it took months to investigate Edwards' background
thoroughly, and that the time was well spent since the outcome of
the trial hinged on his credibility. Defense lawyers filed many
motions seeking records kept by Partners in Care and hospitals
where he had received care. They also demanded, and eventually got,
Edwards' psychiatric records.
</P>
<P>
   Trials are also delayed because of the relatively small number
of judges available to hear criminal cases, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The time it took to get Padro to trial was not so unusual, Shaw
said. Had the defendant been free on bail, the pace would have been
acceptable. Shaw also said that the bail was high for someone with
no previous criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said that
it bore no responsibility for delays in Padro's case. ``It took as
long as it did because there were problems with the defendant
getting counsel,'' said Steven Reed, a spokesman for Johnson. ``He
changed counsel, and there were times when they were not ready to
proceed. We were ready to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said there was some validity to Reed's assertion, but he
also said that it was critical for defense lawyers to investigate
Edwards carefully. ``This was essentially a one-witness case,''
Shaw said. ``The reliability of that witness was very important.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If this case had been tried in seven, eight or nine
months, which would be fast, I can't tell you that it would have
had the same outcome. Our lawyers did whatever they had to do so
this client would have the best chance of having a favorable
verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Padro eventually got that verdict. He asked for a nonjury trial,
he said, because he was afraid that jurors might be biased against
a gay defendant. Instead, he took his chances with Massaro, with
whom he had occasionally had harsh words over the months of
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, which began early in November 1998 and ran
intermittently into January, the defense was able to impeach
Edwards' credibility, documenting many examples in which he had
complained about other home health aides and several instances in
which he had been caught making false accusations about other
aides. The defense also called witnesses to testify to Padro's
character.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the trial, the judge and district attorney made
another plea offer: Padro could plead guilty to a low-level felony
and be sentenced to a year in jail. Since he had already served 18
months by then, he could have gone free. Padro turned it down. If
convicted at trial, he would have faced a sentence of 5 to 25 years
in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'm not pleading guilty to a felony,''' he recalled.
`` `This is a serious offense. How am I going to get a job?' Even
the judge told me I was making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Jan. 29, Massaro pronounced Padro not guilty on both
counts. ``He gave me a look like, is this good enough for you?
Because I had given him a hard time,'' Padro said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards still insists he was telling the truth. ` ``When he
wasn't found guilty, I felt defenseless, like I was worthless,''
Edwards said. ``This isn't justice.''
</P>
<P>
   For Padro, who has been free for four months, the transition has
been difficult. He said he was reluctant to go back to work as a
home health aide, fearing that another patient might accuse him of
wrongdoing. He said he had been depressed, suffered nightmares, and
felt uncharacteristically aimless and unmotivated. He got a break
two weeks ago, when a designer of costume jewelry hired him to help
assemble and sell her designs.
</P>
<P>
   Padro has obtained a new lawyer, Elliot Taub, who has sued the
health care agency, Partners in Care, charging negligence and
contending that it had failed to warn Padro about Edwards and thus
was responsible for his arrest and incarceration. The suit asks for
$15 million in damages. Lyle Churchill, a vice president of the
Visiting Nurse Service of New York, which controls Partners in
Care, declined to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Padro said he still did not understand why he spent so long in
jail, or even why the police and prosecutors pursued the case.
``How could they let someone make one phone call and all this
happens?'' he said.

SABRES VS. STARS: SUPER BOWL, OF SORTS, FOR STANLEY FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   If the Stanley Cup finals were a presidential campaign, the
National Hockey League's ticket would be balanced. The Dallas
Stars, who qualified by beating Colorado on Friday night, are an
older team from a Southern state that borders Mexico. They were the
top-seeded team in the Western Conference, they play in an older
arena due to be replaced and their coach never played professional
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents will be the Buffalo Sabres, who eliminated
Toronto on Monday and have rested since then. The Sabres are a
younger team from a northern state bordering Canada. They were a
seventh-seeded team from the Eastern Conference and they play in a
new arena. Their coach played for 12 seasons in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Stars may be weary from a seven-game third round
and the Sabres are rested after a five-game series, the Stars
should be favored when the four-of-seven-game championship round
begins in Dallas on Tuesday night. During the regular season,
Dallas finished 23 points ahead of Buffalo. In the last four
seasons, the finals have ended in sweeps, the most recent three won
by the Western qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   Many hockey observers thought that the Dallas-Colorado series
was the real championship round, with Dallas clinching it at home
Friday night with a 4-1 victory behind two goals from Mike Keane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's anticipating a letdown,'' Mike Modano, the
Dallas alternate captain, said, even before the final game. ``And
I'm sure Buffalo will use that as a great motivator. They're going
to read a lot of statements from players who don't think the Sabres
have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Should this series go the distance, it will end on June 22. The
latest finish in history was the Devils' clinching on June 24,
1995, ending a season delayed by a 15-week lockout. The weather
around this season's late finish could be a factor, especially in
Dallas, where ice conditions are often poor even in the coldest
months and where June temperatures sometimes go above 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   That could favor the Stars, who are more accustomed to it. They
reached the third round last season before losing to Detroit as the
Red Wings were on their way to their second consecutive title.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Buffalo reached the third round last season
before losing to Washington. Keane said the Stars might not get too
many more chances, at least not with this group. The Sabres'
average age is 26 years; the Stars' average is 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an older club,'' Keane said. ``So this is an important
time for the Dallas Stars. We know that we have a very mature club,
so this year we want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said he did not think the age of the
Dallas team, combined with the long series, would make any
difference. ``When you get into the finals, I don't think anybody
is tired,'' Ruff said. ``They are going to have three days to
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Peca, the captain of the Stars and their first-line center,
said the Stars ``have got a lot of guys contributing offensively
and scoring goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they are playing now, they are a team that is
extremely tough,'' Peca said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team has won the cup. The Stars, who started in
Minnesota with the 1967 expansion, have reached the finals twice,
losing to the Islanders in 1981 and to Pittsburgh in 1991, both
times while the team was still based in Minneapolis. The Sabres, an
expansion team of 1970, reached the finals once, losing in 1975 to
Philadelphia. The Sabres and the Stars have met twice before in the
post-season, each winning one series, but they have not played in
post-season since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   A Buffalo-Dallas matchup sounds more like the Super Bowl than
the Stanley Cup finals. But instead of comparing quarterbacks, it
is hockey style to compare goalies, and these two teams offer an
interesting match.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's Dominik Hasek used to be the backup to Dallas' Ed
Belfour when both played for Chicago in the early 1990s. Since
going their separate ways, Hasek has evolved into the best goalie
in the business, winning the Hart trophy the last two seasons as
most valuable player in the NHL as well as the Vezina trophy as
best goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has had less success in Dallas and is generally regarded
in the second echelon of NHL goalies _ good but not great. After
Friday night's victory, during which he stopped 18 of 19 Colorado
shots, Belfour discussed Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got along fine,'' Belfour recalled. ``We worked hard
together. He was a good partner for me and we learned a lot from
each other. I respect him and he respects me, and I look forward to
competing against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff is in his second season behind the Sabres' bench, and his
team is also less experienced. While Dallas players such as Keane,
Guy Carbonneau and Brian Skrudland have played for cup winners, the
Sabres have no players with championship experience in the NHL,
although Hasek won a gold medal with the Czech Republic in the
Winter Olympic Games in 1998.

MEL TORME, 73, VELVET VOICE OF POP AND JAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: selective album discography at end of obit) 
 (bl) 
By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mel Torme, the fluent pop-jazz singer who earned the nickname
the Velvet Fog for his smooth, soft vocal timbre, died Saturday of
complications from a stroke he suffered in 1996. He was 73 and
lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Torme was rushed early Saturday from his home to the University
of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, said his publicist,
Rob Wilcox.
</P>
<P>
   A supreme vocal technician whose style encompassed everything
from intimate pop crooning to jet-propelled scat improvisations,
Torme was rivaled in virtuosity only by Ella Fitzgerald, who moved
between the worlds of pop and jazz with a similar ease. An innate
classicist who approached popular songs with an analytic sense of
balance and proportion, Torme infused everything he sang with a
geniality that seemed ingrained in a voice that was incapable of
making an unpleasant sound.
</P>
<P>
   Torme was also a prolific songwriter, drummer, pianist, musical
arranger, actor and author. His most famous composition, ``The
Christmas Song'' (also known as ``Chestnuts Roasting on an Open
Fire''), written with the lyricist Robert Wells, became one of the
most beloved of seasonal standards after it was recorded by Nat
(King) Cole in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Torme liked to recall that the song was written in just 40
minutes on a sweltering July afternoon in Los Angeles and that it
had subsequently been recorded in 1,734 versions.
</P>
<P>
   The singer's several books included ``The Other Side of the
Rainbow'' (1970), an account of his experiences working as the
musical adviser to Judy Garland on her television shows in the
1960s, a novel, ``Wynner'' (1978), and an autobiography, ``It
Wasn't All Velvet,'' published in 1988. The Garland book, with its
portrait of the troubled singer, won critical praise but earned the
wrath of her family, who unsuccessfully sued Torme.
</P>
<P>
   But it was as a singer that Torme made his deepest mark. The
critic Will Friedwald, in his book ``Jazz Singing,'' cited Torme as
a pioneer of the ``cool jazz'' approach, spun off from the pop
crooning of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Torme works with the most beautiful voice a man is allowed to
have, and he combines it with a flawless sense of pitch,''
Friedwald wrote. ``As an improviser he shames all but two or three
other scat singers and quite a few horn players as well.''
</P>
<P>
   His standards included ``Blue Moon,'' ``It Might as Well Be
Spring,'' ``Oh, You Beautiful Doll'' and ``Mountain Greenery.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Howard Torme was born on the South Side of Chicago on
Sept. 13, 1925, to a working-class Jewish family. His parents were
immigrants whose name had been changed from Torma to Torme by an
immigration agent. He was a musical prodigy who sang professionally
at age 4 with the Coon-Sanders Orchestra, singing ``You're Driving
Me Crazy,'' at the Blackhawk restaurant in Chicago for $15 a
session, and he was also a busy child actor on radio serials,
appearing from 1933 to 1941 on such network programs as ``The
Romance of Helen Trent'' and ``Jack Armstrong, the All-American
Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   He started writing songs at 13 and was only 16 when Harry James
scored a hit with his song ``Lament to Love.'' While still a
teen-ager, he toured as a singer, arranger and drummer in a band
led by Chico Marx of the Marx Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, he made his movie debut in the musical ``Higher and
Higher,'' playing a supporting role to Frank Sinatra, who was also
making his film debut.
</P>
<P>
   The same year he formed the vocal group Mel Torme and His
Mel-Tones, a quintet that sang in a style modeled after Frank
Sinatra and the Pied Pipers. After his appearance in the 1947
musical ``Good News'' made Torme a bobby-soxer idol, the Mel-Tones
slipped increasingly into the background.
</P>
<P>
   He was only 21 when he appeared as a soloist at the Copacabana
in New York, and Fred Robbins, a local disk jockey, gave him the
nickname Velvet Fog, a sobriquet he detested. Torme recorded for
Decca in 1945, for Musicraft (1946-48), singing with the Artie Shaw
Orchestra, and in 1949 moved to Capitol, where his first recording
for the label, ``Careless Hands,'' became his only No. 1 hit. It
was followed by a two-sided hit, ``Again'' and ``Blue Moon,'' which
became one of his best-loved signature songs. The same year, his
composition ``California Suite,'' a jazzier answer to Gordon
Jenkins' pop oratorio ``Manhattan Tower,'' became the first 12-inch
LP put out by the label.
</P>
<P>
   Torme was 30 when he met Red Clyde, the jazz producer who
founded Bethlehem Records, and decided to switch gears and move
toward jazz. From 1955 to 1957, he recorded seven albums for the
label, including ``Mel Torme With the Marty Paich Dektette,'' a pop
jazz classic featuring a 10-member ensemble (arranged by Paich)
that combined the power of a big band with the freedom of a small
ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to embed in the minds of the public at large,
particularly jazz fans, that this syrupy, creamy bobby-sox
sensation was taking the musical bull by the horns and singing the
kind of music he wanted to sing,'' Torme later recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But artistic integrity did not breed commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't deny that I would have been pleased to have a
best-seller,'' Torme said, ``but if you're constantly working to
good rooms and to good crowds, records are only frosting on the
cake. Yet my managers kept bugging me for the big hit, and to
satisfy them, when rock erupted in the mid-1960s, I recorded some
of the worst dreck you can imagine _ to no avail.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Torme found himself eking out a living playing
out-of-the-way clubs. As rock-and-roll solidified its domination of
the airwaves, he briefly considered retiring from music and
becoming an airline pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The next two decades were a frustrating period of dues-paying in
which Torme moved from record company to record company and often
found himself forced to record the pop hits of the day with tinny
arrangements. He managed to score a minor hit, with a blues song,
``Comin' Home, Baby,'' in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation as a jazz singer continued to grow, based on his
live performances. In 1976 he won an Edison Award (the Dutch
equivalent of the Grammy) for best male singer, and a Downbeat
award for best male jazz singer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ground swell of recognition accelerated after a triumphant
1977 Carnegie Hall concert with George Shearing and Gerry Mulligan,
which Torme viewed as a turning point in his career. He later
recorded five albums with Shearing, whose cool, romantic pianism
perfectly complimented Torme's serene vocal style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to imagine a more compatible musical
partner,'' Shearing said after hearing of Torme's death. ``I humbly
put forth that Mel and I had the best musical marriage in many a
year. We literally breathed together during our countless
performances. As Mel put it, we were two bodies of one musical
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Torme finally found a stable recording base in Concord
Jazz Records, for whom he made a succession of albums that
established him as an articulate custodian of a broad
pop-jazz-swing tradition that encompassed Bing Crosby, Fred
Astaire, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and the Gershwins.
</P>
<P>
   Torme's career also got a lift in the 1980s through the
television series ``Night Court,'' in which Harry Anderson's
character, Judge Harry Stone, was an unabashed fan.
</P>
<P>
   Torme was married four times. His first three marriages ended in
divorce. He is survived by his wife, Ali; five children, Steve,
Melissa, Tracy, Daisy and James Torme, all of Los Angeles, and two
stepchildren, Carrie Torme and Kurt Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   Regular appearances at the JVC Jazz Festival and annual
nightclub engagements at Michael's Pub in Manhattan solidified
Torme's position as a musician who melded the achievements of the
past into a sweeping but personalized vision of American popular
music in its golden age as a vernacular kind of classical music.
</P>
<P>
   For well over a decade, Torme's September appearances at
Michael's Pub, on the Upper East Side, unofficially opened New
York's fall cabaret season. A typical Torme performance there might
have been a salute to a pop music giant like Bing Crosby, Fred
Astaire or Benny Goodman, in which the singer distilled his rich
personal vision of a career in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   These shows featured intricate medleys that showcased Torme's
phenomenal flexibility as both a singer and an arranger with an
enthusiasm for his subject that matched his encyclopedic knowledge.
Such a medley might string fragments from as many as two dozen
songs into a virtuosic vocal (and sometimes also drum) display that
would change in mood every few seconds as the singer glided from
the most ethereal pop crooning into the sort of machine-gun driven
scat improvisations that only Ella Fitzgerald, in her prime, could
match in precision and rhythmic intensity.
</P>
<P>
   These engagements compressed volumes worth of pop-jazz history
and lore into an explosion of musical energy that was as lucid as
it was comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe there's such a thing as a jazz singer,''
Torme declared late in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every pop singer is influenced a little by jazz, because it's
our native folk art,'' he said. ``But labeling someone a jazz,
rather than a pop singer, is only a matter of degree of
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Selective Discography
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel Torme Sings Shubert Alley'' (Verve). A light, swinging
collection of show tunes recorded in 1960 with the Paich Dektette
includes sizzling renditions of ``Too Darn Hot'' and ``Just in
Time,'' and a melting version of ``A Sleepin' Bee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel Torme: A Tribute to Bing Crosby'' (Concord Jazz). Recorded
with a 20-piece string orchestra, this 16-song collection features
smooth-as-silk versions of Crosby's movie songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mel Torme Collection'' (Rhino). The collection of four
compact discs includes 92 songs recorded between 1944 and 1985,
when Torme signed with the Concord Jazz label. All the early hits
are here, as well as the best of the Dektette years.

HOLLYWOOD IS SILENT ON FILM VIOLENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ For years, Hollywood moguls and studio chiefs have
sought to use their influence, voices and money for numerous
political and social causes, from apartheid, AIDS and migrant farm
workers to Democratic candidates for state and national office.
</P>
<P>
   But the one issue over which the Hollywood hierarchy has direct
control and responsibility _ violence in films _ has left industry
executives uncharacteristically silent. In fact, the moguls and
studio chiefs whose violent films are even more popular abroad than
in the United States, seem like a herd of deer caught in the
headlights of Washington's focus.
</P>
<P>
   Left unspoken is a tenet that Hollywood executives are almost
reluctant to acknowledge: violence sells.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the killings at a Colorado high school in
April, angry criticism among lawmakers in Washington has included
accusations of Hollywood's irresponsibility and demands for
controls over the marketing practices of the film, recording and
video game industries.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has raised tens of millions of dollars
for the Democratic Party among the Hollywood elite, unexpectedly
announced on Tuesday that he had asked the Justice Department and
the Federal Trade Commission to study whether the entertainment
industry was implicitly luring children to watch violent films,
listen to sexually explicit music lyrics and play video games that
depict mayhem and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Producers and studio executives here insist that Hollywood is an
easy target, especially for lawmakers who are loath to take on the
gun lobby. Moreover, executives say, blaming the entertainment
industry for youth violence _ especially after the high school
killings that took 15 lives in Littleton, Colo. _ is not just
unfair but wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people become outraged, they look for someone to blame it
on,'' said Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Association
of America, the studio's lobbying arm, in Washington. ``And movies,
being so high-profile, become an inviting target.''
</P>
<P>
   But this hardly explains the resolute, and surprising, silence
of most top executives in town. Clinton's most vocal supporters in
Hollywood, David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg,
who run Dreamworks, declined to talk about violence. A spokeswoman
at Warner Brothers, which has produced films like Oliver Stone's
``Natural Born Killers,'' with its brutal and horrific murders, and
the jokey but violent ``Lethal Weapon'' series, said Valenti would
handle all questions about violence.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, executives at several other major studios said,
through associates, that they would not discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   One top producer, who makes his share of violent films and who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said simply: ``By going after
the movie business, it's like taking a high-powered rifle into a
field and shooting a cow. The cow is standing there. It's the
easiest target in the world. It's as simple as that. What do we do?
We make movies. We make excitement. We don't make movies to create
killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although their underlings are silent, corporate titans like Time
Warner chief executive Gerald Levin and Seagram chief executive
Edgar Bronfman Jr. have spoken out and accused Washington of trying
to use Hollywood as a scapegoat, and indicated that the
entertainment industry's output is not an important factor in the
violent behavior of children.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, whose conglomerate includes Warner Brothers and the WB
network, criticized the political opportunism and moral arrogance
of Washington for faulting Hollywood but failing to deal in any
major way with the gun issue. Bronfman, who owns Universal Studios,
has accused Washington of finger-pointing and chest-pounding on
violence issues.
</P>
<P>
   But, within Hollywood itself, the issue among those who actually
green-light films seems more complicated. For one, the movie
business, and perhaps the nation itself, has an ambivalent attitude
toward violent films in contrast to movies that deal with sexual
issues. It is commonly known in Hollywood, for example, that movies
dealing with sex have a far more difficult time with the the Motion
Picture Association's ratings board than those that are extremely
violent.
</P>
<P>
   Just recently the creators of ``American Pie,'' a light-hearted
comedy that opens in July, about Midwestern teen-agers struggling
with sex, were compelled to go four times before the Motion Picture
Association's rating board to finally get an R-rating as opposed to
a prohibitive NC-17, which would have effectively killed the movie
commercially.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the ratings board fails to raise substantive
questions about extremely violent films like ``Natural Born
Killers'' and ``The Basketball Diaries'' and, more recently, ``Pulp
Fiction,'' ``Con Air,'' ``Payback,'' ``8 MM,'' ``Scream'' and
numerous others. All were awarded R-ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Why are films dealing with sex given more rigorous treatment by
the ratings board than those that are violent?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with subjectivity here,'' Valenti said. ``Sex is
easier to define. There are only so many ways to couple. Language
is easier to define, too. But what is too much violence? The
ratings board has to decide. Is `Schindler's List' too violent? Is
`Saving Private Ryan' too violent? What about `The Wild Bunch'?
There are so many ways that violence can be committed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin Winkler, a veteran producer of films like ``Rocky''
and the four other ``Rocky'' movies, and classics like ``Raging
Bull'', ``The Right Stuff'' and ``Goodfellas'' , said pointedly
that the ratings system had failed to deal with the violence issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand the ratings board,'' he said. ``If you cut
off a woman's breast, it's probably not as terrible as showing her
nipple. They're very free about violence and puritanical about
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   So far television has responded a bit to Washington's
accusations. At the WB network, executives recently pulled the
series finale of ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' because it dealt
with a high school graduation ceremony that exploded into violence.
The episode will be shown later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, CBS decided not to pick up ``Falcone,'' a
Mafia series, for its fall lineup but held out the possibility that
it could be shown later in the year. CBS network president Leslie
Moonves said: ``We felt a responsibility not to put it on now. It
just didn't feel right.'' The network has, however, several action
shows with violence on the air.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects studios to stop making violent films as long as
many of them are so successful, especially overseas. (The recent
``Lethal Weapon 4,'' for example, took in $130 million at the
domestic box office, barely making back its cost. It also took in
$155 million abroad.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I do sense that there is an unusual sensitivity now to this
issue _ and I hope it's more than lip service,'' said Steve Tisch,
a producer of movies like ``Forrest Gump'' and ``American History
X.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler echoed Tisch. ``I think people are taking it seriously
now, partly because they're being attacked.'' But he added, ``I
don't think people took it seriously in the past.''

PARCELLS TELLS JETS: DON'T LOOK AT THE POSITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Parcells gathers his players each year before training camp
and delivers a little speech about football as a metaphor for life.
As the New York Jets got ready for their series of minicamps, which
ended Saturday, he told them that they were vulnerable after their
surprisingly successful season _ that unless they watched it, they
could soon resemble ``chickens falling off a cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Jets are going to be reminded by outsiders that
they are one of pro football's best teams, that they came
incredibly close to reaching the Super Bowl last season, that one
of their nemeses _ John Elway _ is gone from Denver, and that
another potential obstacle _ Marshall Faulk _ has been traded by
Indianapolis and no longer plays in their division.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has told the Jets to ignore all this, to pay no
attention to friends who tell them how good they will be, or to the
Las Vegas oddsmakers who have already established the Jets as a 9-2
shot to go to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But deep down, Parcells is only human. So, after Faulk was
traded to the St. Louis Rams, Parcells admitted, ``I went upstairs
and joined the conga line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tuna's dancing in celebration because Faulk is no longer in
the East Division to torment his team may have been a chimera. But
as the minicamp opened at Hofstra University on Friday, Parcells
was earnest in his warnings. It's true the Jets went 12-4 in 1998,
scored an impressive victory over Jacksonville in the second round
of the playoffs, and had a halftime lead over the Broncos in the
American Football Conference title game. Yet Parcells knows that of
the last 10 AFC teams that lost the conference championship game,
none won the Super Bowl the next season. And only one even got to
the Super Bowl a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The players have heeded him. They already are speaking
conservatively, as if last season's dramatic turnaround was
something in the distant past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it,'' linebacker Bryan Cox said, ``is that
everything is absolutely new. New rookies, new players coming in,
the makeup, the chemistry, will be different. You just can't insert
somebody into a role and expect it to be better right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the Jets certainly appear to be better than they
were last season except at guard, where no one has played in a
National Football League game. (That could change if Matt O'Dwyer
accepts the Jets' offer to return from free agency.)
</P>
<P>
   They appear to have upgraded themselves with Steve Atwater at
free safety (where three players tried and failed last season), Tom
Tupa booming punts, Roman Phifer on the outside of a four-man
linebacker corps, and Eric Green at tight end _ not to mention the
important factor of Vinny Testaverde's starting the season at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, nobody expected it,'' Cox said, referring to the
Jets' success. ``The pressure was different. Tampa Bay, the Giants,
San Francisco, people expected all those teams to win the division.
They didn't. Instead of being the hunter, we're the hunted.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has had every one of his players in the New York area
for most of the off season. He knows they have heard glowing
predictions from friends and fans and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows that last year the Jets started 0-2 and turned
it around. He is concerned about another slow start with a more
difficult schedule and has been contemplating how to avoid that. He
wants his team in place and ready immediately. He will alter his
exhibition-game strategy to avoid experimenting so much and to get
his players prepared for a tougher schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we faced eight playoff teams and won seven games,''
he said. ``This year we face 10 playoff teams.''
</P>
<P>
   He has already explained the schedule to the players: they face
the Patriots in Week 1, have a Sunday night game at Buffalo in Week
2, and that by the end of Week 5 will have faced four playoff
teams, including Denver in a Monday night game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elway's absence doesn't affect us,'' linebacker Mo Lewis
claimed. ``We're all 0-0 now.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is aware of Parcells' ruses to avoid overconfidence.
``He's planted things in our mind about what we have to do,''
Testaverde said. ``So if you're thinking of taking a day off and
not working, you realize how difficult it is to play hard and win,
and you don't sit around on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lewis, even breaking in free-agent veterans like Phifer,
from the Rams, and Atwater, from the Broncos, is difficult. Players
like Pepper Johnson, Kyle Brady, Glenn Foley, Jerome Henderson and
Brian Hansen are gone. Whatever their shortcomings, they were part
of a team that went 12-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Colts,'' Lewis said. ``They don't have Faulk but
they figure a new running back will do well there, too. Other teams
will improve. We've changed. It's never going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a difficult transition. It has taken the Jets decades to
feel this good about themselves. And now they cannot revel in their
success. Parcells seems to remember only that they lost their last
game. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A SCRIPT FOR THE SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, June 6:
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that almost all the discussion about the
upcoming U.S. Senate race in New York concerns personalities. The
cast of characters is, after all, larger than life. First lady
Hillary Clinton has all but officially announced her candidacy, as
has New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. If Giuliani has to fight
for the Republican nomination against Rep. Rick Lazio of Long
Island, chances are that the mayor's combative persona will be the
focus of that primary as well.
</P>
<P>
   But New York is a state with more than its quota of economic and
social problems. It deserves a campaign that includes a full
discussion of the issues that will affect it in the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Education is a critical concern, and even at this early date,
Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton have been sparring gingerly about school
vouchers, which the mayor supports and the first lady opposes. But
New York deserves a broader debate about how to improve the quality
of its educational system. What is the proper role for the federal
government in supporting local public schools? Should there be
national standards to measure teacher qualifications and student
success? What part could a U.S. senator play in debates about
social promotion, remedial education and the proper role of
teachers' and principals' unions?
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for the Senate always promise to bring home more
bacon, but Mrs. Clinton will have to explain why it would be in the
state's interest to have two Democratic senators when the
Republicans appear to have a hold on majority control. Her opponent
should be challenged to describe what he would do when his
Sunbelt-dominated party pushed legislation that threatened the
Northeast on matters like acid rain and transportation spending.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare reform bill, which Lazio supported and Giuliani
opposed in part, is now the law of the land with wide backing even
among the Democrats. But New York's role as a haven for immigrants
and the presence here of so many second- and third-generation
welfare recipients will make it hard for the state to proceed to
the next step, when time limits kick in and families start being
ejected from the system. The candidates should tell us what changes
they would endorse to help states with large populations of recent
immigrants and the very poor.
</P>
<P>
   Past experience suggests that when it comes to foreign policy,
the Senate campaign will focus on the Mideast, with each candidate
trying to grab the mantle of best friend to Israel. We would like
to see a broader discussion that focused on the proper
international role for the United States. Under what circumstances
should Americans intervene in other countries' affairs? How much
should we rely on the United Nations and NATO to represent our
interests? How important are human-rights issues when it comes to
relations with trading partners like China or Indonesia?
</P>
<P>
   On campaign finance reform, Mrs. Clinton would have a great deal
of explaining to do about the abuses of existing laws that went on
during her husband's administration, some of which involved her
close associates, including her senior political adviser, Harold
Ickes, and members of her White House staff. Giuliani ought to
discuss how far he would be willing to buck his party, which has
been blocking serious reform in Congress. Lazio, who has voted to
strengthen the campaign finance laws, would have to tell voters why
he declined to join his party's reform wing to force those bills to
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has already said that she would not try again to
create the sort of sweeping solution to the nation's health care
problems that she advocated in her early days as first lady. But
about 43 million Americans remain uninsured, including 3.1 million
New Yorkers, and many of those who do have coverage express
dissatisfaction with the restrictions of managed-care programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, during the exciting but not always enlightening
Senate race between Charles Schumer and Alfonse D'Amato, the
candidates were asked how health care costs could be kept down if
insurance companies were forced by Congress to cover more and more
procedures. The candidates, who had been vying to appear toughest
on health maintenance organizations, both avoided the query and
went back to arguing about who was more of a liar.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a year and a half before the Senate election, the
candidates should have plenty of time to answer serious questions.
</P>
<P>
   Personalities are not irrelevant to this race. Mrs. Clinton and
Lazio would have every right to question whether Giuliani has the
temperament to be an effective senator. Giuliani, who has already
been harping on the carpetbag issue, is not out of line in
wondering whether New York should be represented by someone who has
actually lived here. Voters would naturally want to know how Mrs.
Clinton plans to balance her role as Senate candidate with her
duties as first lady, and we have confidence her opponent will
bring the matter up on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a shame if this contest, which may be the focus
of almost as much attention as the presidential race, should
degenerate quickly into a sound-bite battle. Besides being national
personalities, Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani are intelligent and
thoughtful political veterans with very different takes on the
proper role of government. Lazio, who seems intent on depriving the
national media of their dream race, is a serious legislator who has
surprised people in the past with his ability to topple a
high-profile politician.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too early to ask that the candidates, as they
announce, commit themselves to a series of issue-based debates
throughout the campaign, each focusing on a single topic, like
education or foreign policy. The campaign will inevitably make
compelling theater, but the candidates will need to give serious
topics their due.

EDITORIAL: THE KREMLIN LOOKS WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, June 6:
</P>
<P>
   When the war in Yugoslavia started nearly 11 weeks ago, it
threatened to rupture relations between Russia and the West.
Instead, it brought Moscow and Washington closer together as they
collaborated on a diplomatic settlement. Bill Clinton and Boris
Yeltsin should find ways to build on the partnership. The Kremlin's
willingness to part company with Slobodan Milosevic and throw its
influence behind the West's peace terms in Kosovo is one of the
more hopeful international developments since the end of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   The war did not come without a price in overall relations with
Russia. The NATO bombing angered many Russians, who identified with
their Slavic cousins. Anti-American sentiment sharply increased
across Russia, as did fear that NATO, long a defensive alliance,
had become a threat to Russia itself and a potential factor in
Russia's own ethnic conflicts in places like Chechnya. The
political fallout may be felt for years, as Communists and
nationalists seek to exploit the resentment in parliamentary and
presidential elections. They greeted the peace agreement with
scorn, and even some of Yeltsin's aides distanced themselves from
it.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin was not moved by such concerns. There were doubtless
many reasons, not the least of which was Moscow's desperate need
for Western financial assistance. The White House will likely look
more kindly on Moscow's request for additional loans from the
International Monetary Fund now that Yeltsin has leaned on
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's action bespeaks a larger vision of Russia's future
as a democratic society. Milosevic may be a fellow Slav, but he is
also a political fossil, just the kind Yeltsin has dueled with in
Russia since the last days of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin recognized
that continued alliance with Milosevic's dictatorship was a
political and economic dead end for Russia. As logical as that
decision might seem in the West, it was a bold act of leadership in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has often been a maddeningly erratic leader, but
throughout his years as president he has fought valiantly against a
resurgence of communism in Russia and a revival of Cold War
hostilities between East and West. Now, with a year remaining in
his final term, he has once again edged Russia closer to Europe and
the United States, and has put in place a new government in Moscow
that seems prepared to consolidate that shift.
</P>
<P>
   Formation of the government has not been smooth _ it never is in
Moscow _ but Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin has put economic and
foreign policy largely in the hands of pragmatic men, many of whom
favor further reform. The dismissal of Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov in May looks increasingly like a wise decision that
allowed Yeltsin to pursue his Balkan diplomacy freely and opens the
way for renewed economic change.
</P>
<P>
   All of which affords the White House a chance to bring Russia
into closer partnership with the West. President Clinton wisely saw
the possibilities of enlisting Russia's help in Kosovo, and Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott skillfully helped turn the
opportunity into a joint peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperation can be advanced in the weeks ahead. Russian
forces are likely to serve as peacekeepers in Kosovo, along with
NATO troops. Further Russian assistance may be needed in dealing
with Milosevic as the war ends. But Clinton should be looking
beyond the Balkans for other ways to work with Russia and to help
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The first chance will come later this month in Cologne, Germany,
when Yeltsin joins Clinton and the leaders of Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the annual economic summit
meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies. Though
Russia's feeble economy makes it an odd addition to this group, it
belongs there because of its political weight. By making Russia a
full-fledged member, and working to diminish its economic distress,
Clinton and the other leaders can provide tangible benefits for
Yeltsin and overcome Russian doubts about the West.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin, two men headed into the final months of
their presidencies, can leave an enduring gift to their countrymen
if they capitalize on the collaboration that began in Kosovo.

ANNAPOLIS TO NEWPORT, VIA SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ With a new sailing season in the Northeast comes
the Annapolis to Newport Race, the first major offshore regatta of
the year. With it comes a lingering ill wind from the
Sydney-to-Hobart Race, an Australian regatta in which six yachtsmen
died last December. But a fresh breeze of caution is filling sails
in the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 60 sailboats _ from 33 to 70 feet _ are expected to
set out next Saturday from Annapolis, Md., for a 473-mile offshore
passage to Newport in the 26th running of the race, one in which
mostly cruising sailors participate.
</P>
<P>
   While safety rules are not significantly different from recent
years, they are being strictly enforced this year. ``I'm a stickler
for the letter of the law for those kinds of things,'' Gaither
Scott of Annapolis, the race's chairman, said. ``I don't let
anybody through if there's a doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said that people who plan to race offshore these days
can't help heeding what they read about the 115 sailboats caught in
the storm off Sydney, Australia, last December. It was one of the
worst boat-racing incidents in history. Six yachtsmen died, and 55
crew members were saved by helicopter or rescue craft. Five
sailboats sank.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a review committee organized by the Cruising
Yacht Club of Australia, the Sydney race's sponsor, released a
report about the catastrophe. It indicated that numerous
precautionary steps in the future might prevent a similar calamity,
but that skippers and crews were unable to pinpoint reasons for the
disaster. They ``certainly see no basis to apportion blame to any
particular group,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The review committee pointed out that ``exceptional'' waves,
some twice as large as the prevailing seas, pounded the race boats
from different directions. At the time, reports of 90-mile-an-hour
winds and higher gusts were common.
</P>
<P>
   The report alluded, however, to lapses in safety equipment, and
in search-and-rescue techniques. It suggested that new boats should
have to make a 200-mile qualifying passage to prepare for the race.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also recommended that at least 30 percent of each
boat's crew should be required to attend prerace weather and safety
seminars. And it suggested that a weather forecaster at the race
control center be able to issue meteorological data in layman's
language.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said that he was not surprised by the committee's refusal
to lay blame for the Australian debacle. ``People want you to come
up with a finite answer, and you can't,'' he said. ``There's no
pattern to something like that. It's hard to come up with
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The race from Annapolis to Newport has had its trying times too,
Scott said. In 1967, one-third of the fleet failed to finish
because of a storm. The wind blew at 40 knots out of the northeast
for three days. The storm pattern caused steep seas, and forced the
fleet into an unrelenting beat to windward. No one had to be
rescued, but six sailboats lost their masts overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, the boats were built heavier than they are
today,'' Scott said. As for the boats in Sydney, he said, ``That
doesn't necessarily mean they weren't as strong, but they were
lighter.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1967, he added, ``people didn't go out looking for the
hottest crew _ guys who would be pushing their brains out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They would get their friends together instead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Annapolis to Newport Race also comes with the luxury of
nearby landfalls. Some of the boats that got into trouble off
Sydney had tried to turn back and found themselves bucking huge
seas. Others kept going into the Bass Strait, an unruly stretch of
open water between Sydney and the island of Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
   In the passage to Newport, any number of safe harbors dot the
coastline. In the 1967 storm, many of the competitors sought
shelter in Delaware Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them were just too tired and sick to go on,'' Scott
said.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR KNICKS' WILLIAMS, REMINISCING IS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You might think that after 18 seasons in the National
Basketball Association, Herb Williams would have become a
sentimentalist. Sentimental about the Knicks' unlikely playoff run.
Sentimental about the chance to turn in one last exhilarating
playoff performance. Looking forward to doing in his old Indiana
Pacers teammates.
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' career hasn't been based on sentiment but rather cold,
hard analysis. The impact of Patrick Ewing's season-ending injury
after two games of the Knicks-Pacers series reverberates all the
way to the end of the Knicks' bench, where Williams, the
41-year-old center, has sat and watched like a sage.
</P>
<P>
   He mostly has served as a cheerleader, but with yet another
dramatic twist added to the team's tale, the 6-foot-11-inch
Williams, relegated to chants of ``We want Herb,'' when games are
out of reach, may be pressed into duty for the remainder of the
series. When, where, how remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never know when I'm going to play,'' he said. ``I always
want to play. That's no secret.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams was asked how he could get his body to play
``young,'' he said: ``You don't have to be young; you have to be in
shape, ready to play hard.'' Asked if he thought he could ``mix it
up'' with Rik Smits, the Pacers' 7-2 center, Williams was
incredulous: ``Do I think I can do what? Don't ask me questions
like that. Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, what about the Pacers' physical style? ``Physical?''
Williams said. ``They're not physical. Rik? Physical? He's not
physical. Rik's a scorer. He shoots the ball well. He's good on the
pick-and-roll.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy didn't discount using Williams in
the remainder of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have in Herb is a very intelligent player who won't
make mistakes, which is very critical,'' Van Gundy said. ``If
you're going to bring in a guy for just a few minutes what you
don't want is a mistake player, and Herb is the exact opposite of a
mistake player. He's going to do the right thing on the court to
help us be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans only know Herb Williams as the team elder whose
appearance in a game has become the ceremonial confirmation of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Williams was a star in the league. In Patrick Ewing's
first season, 1985, Williams enjoyed his finest year as a pro with
the Pacers. He scorched the Knicks for a career-high 40 points that
season, was the Pacers' leading scorer and had a career high with
184 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' minutes and role have evolved since he arrived in New
York in 1992 after 11 seasons in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't want to take a stroll down memory lane. He is
focusing on the Pacers, the Knicks' sudden change in fortunes. The
here and now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what I did in the past; all that matters is
that I'm confident in myself and what I can do,'' Williams said.
``If they have seen me play or if they remember me, it would have
been all right. But I don't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, called ``a reserve for a reserve'' by the assistant
coach Don Chaney, has been upgraded from a reserve who was not on
call to a reserve who is on call because of the injury to Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he came to the Knicks expecting to play serious
minutes. Instead he went from the 27 minutes a game he played with
the Dallas Mavericks to 10.4 minutes a game with the Knicks and
that is what his role has been for most of the last six seasons. A
large part of Williams' longevity has been his ability to adapt and
accept a role _ no matter how far out on the periphery _ and think
``team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to change your mind-set; you've got to adjust,'' he
said. ``I'm always ready to play. I don't come to the game ready to
sit on the bench. When you play in New York, there are a lot of
different variables that can cause you to play or not to play. I
understand that and I've always been the guy who has been out. So,
its hard at times. Some guys can't take it, other guys don't want
to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the bottom line is that it's not Herb Williams. It's
team _ and it has always been that way, even though you may feel
you should play or you may feel you should be put in at certain
situations. The bottom line is that if the team wins, the team is
doing well and you've got to be happy for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone expressed surprise that Williams still carried a passion
for crucial minutes at this point in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you something,'' he said with mild indignation, ``if
I didn't want to play, I wouldn't have on this uniform. I don't
need to be out here playing just to make money. That ain't what I'm
out here for. I'm out here to play and to win a championship.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what about the ``We want Herb'' chants? Wouldn't it be great
to prove, one last time, that he can still contribute?
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that I can play and that's all I worry about,''
he said. ``The chant, that's great, but you can't get caught up in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the possibility of being pressed into service against his
old team and ousting them from the playoffs, Williams once again
deflects: No. No. No. No sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't matter who we are playing,'' Williams said. ``It's
not going to be extra good because it's Indiana and I used to play
for Indiana. This series is the same as playing against Atlanta,
the same as playing against Miami. I just want to win and go on to
the next series.''

PURSUING JOB OF INCUMBENT COACH IS NOT COVERED IN RULE BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two weeks ago in the wake of Dave Checketts
disclosing that he had met with Phil Jackson, the name of Glenn
``Doc'' Rivers surfaced in connection with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the former player and current television
analyst was interested in the team's head coaching or the general
manager job, but Rivers had reportedly made contact with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers, worried that he was about to be disparaged in the
coaching fraternity for maneuvering behind the scenes for a job
currently held by Jeff Van Gundy, called the Knicks coach to assure
him he had not personally campaigned for the position.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers was so concerned and upset over the report that he
telephoned his Atlanta-based agent, Lonnie Cooper, to find out if
his representative had spoken to Checketts, the president of
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became moot this weekend after Rivers came off the
league's most-coveted list and was signed for $8 million over four
years by the Orlando Magic. The team is expected to announce at a
news conference Monday that Rivers, 37, will become the fourth head
coach in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   But the uncomfortable situation faced by Rivers two weekends ago
underscored a major problem for prospective coaches trying to
secure multimillion dollar deals: do you follow the profession's
unwritten rule and wait for the current coach to finally be
relieved of his duties before applying, or risk losing out to a
candidate whose agent worked the phones months ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's proper to talk about a job or speculate or
meet with somebody about a job if the job is filled, simple as
that,'' said Dick Harter, the Indiana Pacers assistant coach who
once worked with Van Gundy in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it's an unwritten rule in the coaching
fraternity because the coaching fraternity doesn't have a lot of
rules,'' Harter said. ``But among the good people, though, that's
the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the financial rewards increase, so, too, does the dealing
behind the scenes. It often leads to insecurity and mistrust at the
highest levels. Case in point: When a rumor got back to Nets coach
Don Casey three months ago that Van Gundy was being considered as a
candidate to coach the Nets, he grew agitated that such false
information could get around.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Casey earning the respect of his players and Van
Gundy's team floundering across the Hudson River at the time, but
Van Gundy's agent, Rob Ades, was also Casey's personal lawyer and
friend for the last 30 years. The notion that Ades would go behind
Casey's back to campaign for Van Gundy at the Meadowlands was
ludicrous, Casey thought.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. The rumor turned out to be bogus. And yet, this is
the kind of unstable environment created by the rush for a
lucrative job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think agents are going to make contact beforehand; it's part
of the business,'' Rivers said. ``I think it's more unethical when
the guy himself does it. If Phil Jackson is picking up the phone
and calling Dave Checketts when Jeff Van Gundy has a job, I think a
lot of coaches would have a problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it's Phil Jackson's agent, his agent is just doing his
job. I don't think Jeff Van Gundy would be upset about that
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning Jackson and Checketts, the Knicks made first contact.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana assistant Rick Carlisle has been up for several jobs
over the past year, and will likely entertain more offers in the
off season. He, too, is bothered by the approach taken by some
agents and their clients. But like the trend of teen-age phenoms
leaving school before their time, he believes the ongoing lobbying
for coaching jobs has become a seedy but accepted part of the
profession. ``The situation is one where you would hope to be
treated the way you would want to be treated,'' Carlisle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a job, of course I would feel horrible if they were
talking about somebody else taking my place before I'd actually
been relieved of that position. On the other hand, it's certainly
got to be tempting if you're another person interested in a job,
and they're willing to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurs Hop on Merry-Go-Round?
</P>
<P>
   At some point over the last few months, the Knicks, the Lakers,
the Nuggets, the Magic and the Nets have sprouted up as possible
franchises for Phil Jackson's return to the National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But the job that may be the best fit of all for the former coach
of the six-time champion Chicago Bulls has not been mentioned _ for
obvious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs, under Gregg Popovich, are motoring toward
the finals and looking like a juggernaut for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich, the team's general manager, took over the team on an
interim basis from Bob Hill two years ago with the intention of
eventually hiring someone else.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when the team was 6-8 in March, he casually mentioned
to a prominent coaching candidate to stay by the phone in case
something happened.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was not that candidate, but the Spurs appear to have all
the prerequisites to lure him away from Bill Bradley's Presidential
campaign: a maturity level among the veterans. A one-newspaper town
that does not cover the team like the White House. And, yes, Tim
Duncan, perhaps the best player in the game for the next 10
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   More signs are pointing toward Jackson waiting a year to rejoin
the coaching ranks, especially after his agent, Todd Musburger,
spurned a lucrative package from the Nets in the last week. And
from all accounts, the Spurs' owner, Peter Holt, is very pleased
with Popovich and has no inclination to hire Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Jackson were to enter the picture, there are some
drawbacks. Holt has intimated that the team will move if city does
not vote in favor of building a new arena late this summer; the
team lost a vote on the arena last year.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is that if the team advances to the finals, the vote
will pass.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Under Inquiry
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter is one of the league's new meal tickets, a
skywalking guard with more athleticism than even Michael Jordan
possessed his first season in the National Basketball Association.
But the rookie of the year for the Toronto Raptors may be in the
market for new representation soon.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's current agent, William (Tank) Blank, is under
investigation by the National Football League players association
for allegedly doling out cash payments to prospective NFL recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Black represents about 40 NFL players, but Carter is his only
NBA client.
</P>
<P>
   If Black were disciplined by the players association, there is a
chance he would also be disciplined by the NBA's players
association. The union's general policy is that any NBA agent who
is charged or disciplined by another union is required to provide
an explanation of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Carter may still retain Black in the wake of the allegations,
but the players association has shown recently it does not tolerate
unbecoming behavior from its agents.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the decertification of Steve Woods was upheld by the
arbitrator George Nicolau. Woods had his right to represent NBA
players revoked when the union deemed his comments and actions
during the lockout as harmful to the players' cause. &QL;

ON BASKETBALL: A PSYCHOLOGICAL GAME BETWEEN THE COACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Beyond their profession, Larry Bird and Jeff Van
Gundy do not have much in common. The former is among the best
players in history, a 6-foot-9-inch Hall of Famer who enjoys bass
fishing, beer and mowing his lawn; Van Gundy is a 5-9 intellect who
happens to be a coaching lifer, his Division III point-guard body
constantly grappling with an Ivy League mind.
</P>
<P>
   Their sideline demeanors don't mesh, either. If Bird were told
his pant cuffs were on fire during a game, he would gradually shift
his eyes downward at the flames before ever so slowly looking up
again to declare: ``Yep, yer right. They are.'' Van Gundy fidgets
like a ferret, sipping his Diet Coke, moving to and fro like an
expectant father.
</P>
<P>
   Big Larry and Little Jeffy, two birds of a different feather.
</P>
<P>
   Yet throw this odd couple in the crucible of a hotly contested
playoff series _ in which an official's call could mean the
difference between nirvana and next season for the Knicks or the
Pacers _ and they become spiritual brothers in the art of off-day
politicking on behalf of their unjustly persecuted team.
</P>
<P>
   After his team lost Game 1, Bird wanted the referees to respect
Mark Jackson's low-post game. After the Knicks lost Game 2, Van
Gundy wanted Jackson penalized for bulldozing his itty-bitty point
guards.
</P>
<P>
   After only two games, the Knicks coach has already labeled
Reggie Miller and Rik Smits ``flop artists,'' players who act as if
they have been assaulted after incidental contact.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the Pacers forward Antonio Davis' labeling of Kurt
Thomas as ``dirty,'' Van Gundy said Indiana was a much more
physical team than the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   To which Bird facetiously replied: ``We're not bullies. We're
not that tough.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear exactly when these two became some of the most
influential lobbyists of the 20th century. But now that the whiners
within have emerged and the chess match is on, Bird and Van Gundy
join those political animals of post-seasons past _ Pat Riley, Phil
Jackson and Chuck Daly.
</P>
<P>
   On an off day, even an old-school purist like Red Auerbach was
not immune to running for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to do it to too _ all that psychological stuff between
the games,'' said the patriarch of the Boston Celtics by telephone
from his home in the Washington area. ``But these guys nowadays
take it a little too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, you got fined for saying something dumb, and it was
a lot of money. It meant something to lose that money. Now? So they
fined the coach $5,000 _ what does that mean? The team might be
paying that for him, and what's $5,000 to these guys with huge
deals?''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bird nor Van Gundy is a proud lobbyist. But since Riley
and Jackson raised the stakes during the Knicks-Bulls rivalry of
the early 1990s, it has become a necessary evil to jockey for
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy, an assistant under Riley, soaked in the knowledge _
just as Bird did in Boston when he played for a great playoff
politician, K.C. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's first real indoctrination came in his first season as the
Pacers coach last June. He complained about Scottie Pippen's
defense on Jackson in the conference finals, wondering aloud if a
foul would ever be called after the Bulls went up 2-0 in the
series. It worked. Jackson began getting those calls.
Coincidentally or not, the Pacers extended the Bulls to seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy complained about the officiating earlier this week to
Rod Thorn, the league's senior vice president of operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, whining wins,'' Van Gundy said. ``And that's
sad, and that's not what the game of basketball game is about.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls of Jackson mastered the subtleties of working the
referees through the news media between games, Jerry Sloan's Utah
Jazz were not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Jazz learned from the Bulls is how to get the world
to see the game through their eyes,'' said Bill Walton, the Hall of
Fame center and television analyst. ``You've got to convince the
referees what you're doing is right. That whole psychological
relationship with the referees is critical to your overall
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton added: ``What real champions don't do is argue on the
court at the moment of the call. They convince the referees over
time, between the games and through the media. You never saw
Michael Jordan, John Stockton, Larry or Magic going crazy during
the game. During the course of a series, they would establish
themselves as credible advocates for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem with this whole process is, every time a team
loses it becomes the referees' fault. And some of these coaches
almost set the stage for fights. They plant the idea in their
players' heads that they've been victimized and persecuted, and
that's when they lose their cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to benefit from four days worth of lobbying, Bird and Van
Gundy led their teams into Game 3 at Madison Square Garden last
night. Whiners, crusaders or merely people doing their jobs, they
both honored a longstanding tradition last week _ a tradition
handed down by some of the great complainers of our time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychology is all about the next game, the next call,''
Auerbach said. ``Or, how far you can go without a technical to
influence the next call. That hasn't changed from when I used to
say something to the officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, the squeaky coach gets the grease. &QL;

L. JOSEPH BUTTERFIELD, 72, PIONEER IN NEONATOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Ill., Ind. N.M.)  (rk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. L. Joseph Butterfield, whose innovative care of newborns
earned him a reputation as a pioneer of modern neonatology, died
June 2 at his home in Denver. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, according to the Children's
Hospital of Denver, where he spent more than 40 years in
neonatology, the branch of medicine dealing with infants up to 2
months old.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield established one of the country's first regional
centers for perinatal care, a field involving the period closely
surrounding the moment of birth. He also gave Children's Hospital
an innovative hospice unit where families could be close to their
dying infants.
</P>
<P>
   He vigorously propagated the work of Dr. Virginia Apgar, a
pediatrician and anesthesiologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center who died in 1974, and helped win general acceptance of what
is now known throughout the world as the Apgar score, which lets
pediatricians assess the health of a child within five minutes of
birth.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by Dr. Apgar in 1953, the simple, inexpensive
procedure appraises five vital functions to alert doctors to the
need for intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   To assist health workers, Butterfield devised a mnemonic for the
procedure: A _ appearance (skin color); P _ pulse; G _ grimace
(reflexes); A _ activity, and R _ respiration.
</P>
<P>
   After Dr. Apgar's death, Butterfield led a 10-year campaign that
persuaded the Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp in her
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield was born in Terre Haute, Ind., and grew up in Pana,
Ill. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in biology at the
University of New Mexico and moved to the University of Colorado
Medical School to receive his medical degree in 1955. The next
year, he began his affiliation with Children's Hospital in Denver
as a pediatric resident.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, the hospital asked Butterfield to set up its Children's
Newborn Center and be its medical director. The center served a
vast area and set a national pattern for regional perinatal care.
</P>
<P>
   His later influence in newborn and family matters went beyond
the nursery, verging into advocacy on broader children's issues. He
spent much time on a program in which he taught the intricacies of
the legislative process to people hoping to use it on behalf of
children.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield is survived by his wife, Perry; a son and daughter,
Bruce Butterfield and Tate Ulrich, both of Monument, Colo.; three
brothers, Bernie, George and Dr. Donald Butterfield, all of
Albuquerque, N.M., and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The hospice program Butterfield started at Children's Hospital
in 1979 provided a private family space next to the neonatal
intensive-care ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensive-care unit can be a bizarre and impersonal place,
with all of the monitors beeping and constant clatter,''
Butterfield said at the time. ``That's why it is important for a
family to have a quiet place, to be alone with the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   For him it was a deeply felt matter, the remembrance of a
child's death. ``When my own 23-year-old daughter died,'' he said,
``we were there at the end to hold her, to say goodbye.''

 SELLING REMINDERS OF 2 SISTERS' SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, N.Y. _ The memento seekers who lined up at the
two-story brick home at the end of a cul-de-sac Saturday were a
mixed crowd of women and men, black and white.
</P>
<P>
   But they were all hoping to obtain a piece of history at the
estate sale of the Delany sisters, the daughters of a freed slave
who became trailblazing professionals and lived past the age of
100.
</P>
<P>
   Bessie and Sadie Delany, who grew up in Raleigh, N.C., and went
on to become a dentist and a teacher, respectively, were famous for
their book ``Having Our Say,'' which became a Broadway play and a
television movie.
</P>
<P>
   And those who came Saturday for a teacup, a cookie cutter, a
mirror, a crumbling almanac, some of which were sold for as little
as $2, also wanted a bit of the sisters' spirit, their religious
beliefs and their commitment to family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible history,'' said Donna Dunkelman, whose son
read the sisters' book in the eighth grade. Ms. Dunkelman said she
was particularly awed by the fact that their father, a freed slave,
went on to become the country's first black Episcopalian minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just to be here with all this history, knowing about
their past and feeling that I'm a part of it,'' that she came, she
said as she waited patiently outside to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, many of the women browsing in the old-fashioned kitchen
and in the bedrooms upstairs said the Delanys had been role models.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Lloyd, a lawyer, mused on the secrets of the sisters'
lives that allowed Bessie to live to 104 and Sadie, who died less
than five months ago, to 109. She examined a bottle of mineral oil
and reflected that the Delanys also ate garlic every day, did yoga
and remained unmarried, which she thought might have added to their
longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Hudson, a retired IBM employee back for the second day of
the sale, said as she clutched a blue flowered plate and a handful
of books, ``I'm hoping I can capture their spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   After a sleepless night, she had returned for the plate after
realizing that it was the one pictured on the cover of the Delanys'
book.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement, Cynthia Evans showed off her purchases _
old-fashioned cookie cutters and jars, a box of thread, and an old
edition of the Gospel of St. John.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fascinated by their lives and wanted to get my little
piece of history,'' she said. The jars brought back memories of her
childhood summers in Bridgeville, Del., where she helped her
grandmother preserve strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, the estate sale has attracted 1,500 people, said
Barbara Hawkins, who is running it for the Delanys' heirs. She said
that a North Carolina museum had called and, sight unseen,
purchased Sadie's Victorian bed, a fur coat, and Bessie's dental
chest, for $1,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Their papers, including their mother's diary from 1850, will go
to St. Augustine's School in Raleigh, N.C., where their father
worked as a vice-principal.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne Arrindell, an actuarial consultant from Brooklyn browsing
in the library, said she had come because her daughter, Lisa
Arrindell Aaronson, had played Sadie in the television movie. She
explained that her daughter had recently baked her a pound cake
using Sadie's recipe from the book, so she wanted to buy a Delany
family plate to hold future pound cakes.

   BBO-UMPIRE-DREAMS _ GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ Most fans go to Turner
Field to see Chipper Jones hit or Greg Maddux pitch. Not Jonathan
Merry. When the 18-year-old North Hall High School senior watches a
baseball game, his eyes never leave the umpires. He wants to be the
next Harry Wendelstedt, not Tom Glavine. The odds of reaching the
majors as an umpire are even longer than making it as a player. But
Merry knows about overcoming obstacles. He has done it all his
life. ``Everyone said I would never graduate from high school,''
Merry remembered. ``I've been proving people wrong for a long
time.'' Despite his reading disorder, Merry will graduate from
North Hall High School with honors Tuesday. He has already
graduated from umpire's school and hopes to be working in the minor
leagues by next season. (Curtright, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The verdict was the one that Jose Padro had longed
for: not guilty. The sentence, though, was irreversible: 19 months
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   A paradox lies at the heart of Padro's strange journey through
New York's criminal justice system. Accused of a serious sex crime
and unable to raise $5,000 for bail, Padro spent more than a year
and a half on Rikers Island, in what is euphemistically known as
pretrial detention. Adamant in proclaiming his innocence, he turned
down two offers for a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Padro, 28, who was born and raised in the Bronx,
prevailed. Acting State Supreme Court Justice Dominic Massaro
acquitted him in late January, after a long nonjury trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Padro paid a heavy price. He served more time in jail before
acquittal than he probably would have under either of the plea
offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stand by what I believed, and I believed I was
innocent,'' Padro said. ``I believed in the legal system. I threw
myself at its feet. I thought they would believe me. They did, but
look how long it took.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the details of the case are salacious _ Padro was
accused of sexually assaulting a quadriplegic man for whom he
worked as a home health aide _ Padro's experience with the criminal
justice system is fairly common, many legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, bail exists only to insure that a defendant will
return to court for hearings and a trial. But poor and
working-class defendants often lack the money to make bail, and
they can languish in jail for a year or more before their guilt or
innocence is determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several national studies have made clear that people were
being detained arbitrarily, not on their willingness to return, but
on their lack of money,'' said Chester Mirsky, a professor of
clinical law at New York University Law School. ``The question you
have to ask yourself is whether money bail is an appropriate
measure of someone's willingness to return to court, or if it
simply reflects someone's ability to pay bail.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who cannot afford to make bail, there is often added
pressure to agree to plead guilty to a reduced charge, usually in
return for a reduced sentence. It is the rare criminal defendant
who actually goes on trial; only 6.5 percent of felony indictments
in New York City resulted in trials last year, according to the
state Office of Court Administration. More than 82 percent were
resolved through pleas.
</P>
<P>
   Padro said his legal odyssey had its origin in a dispute over a
cup of soup. He had worked for three months in the small rundown
apartment of Alberto Edwards in the Parkchester section of the
Bronx. Edwards, who was shot eight years ago, needs the help of
home attendants for virtually every aspect of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who stands by his accusation, had complained early to
officials of the home-care agency that oversees his care, Partners
in Care, that he did not want Padro as his aide because he thought
Padro was gay. But Padro, who is gay but never acknowledged this to
Edwards, continued to work 12-hour shifts, three days a week, at
the apartment. ``He was very moody,'' Padro said of Edwards. ``One
minute he was fine, and the next minute he was ranting and
raving.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Padro did not know it at the time, Edwards had a long
history of complaining about health aides to the agency, court
records show. Many aides said he had been verbally abusive.
</P>
<P>
   On May 2, 1997, a Friday, the tension between Padro and Edwards
erupted. Padro said he had heated up some soup with rice and,
seated on a crate, had tried to spoon-feed it to Edwards. Some soup
fell on Edwards' chest. ``He said I'd burned him, that I was
incompetent,'' Padro said.
</P>
<P>
   They argued, and Edwards said he did not want Padro to work in
his home anymore. ``He said, `I'm going to tell them you sexually
abused me,''' Padro said.
</P>
<P>
   Padro said he did not take the threat seriously because Edwards
had made many threats previously, though none involved sexual
accusations. Padro told a supervisor at Partners in Care that
evening that he could no longer work with Edwards. About the same
time, court records show, Edwards was on the phone with another
official of the agency, saying that while he had been in bed that
afternoon, Padro had performed oral sex on him against his will.
</P>
<P>
   The next Monday, Padro met with several supervisors at the
agency, and he said they seemed not to believe Edwards' story.
</P>
<P>
   But police, whom Edwards had also called with his accusation,
were less understanding. Within six weeks, Padro was arrested. Soon
afterward, he was indicted by a grand jury on charges of
first-degree sodomy and first-degree sexual assault, with bail set
at $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bail was reduced to $5,000 in September 1997, but Padro said
he and his family lacked the money to meet either figure. He
bounced for months between Rikers and State Supreme Court in the
Bronx, where nearly two dozen hearings were held.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is poor, Padro was represented by the Legal Aid
Society. He said he was offered a plea bargain early in the case.
``The Legal Aid said I could cop out now,'' Padro said. ``He told
me the DA was offering me one to three years if I copped out. I
said, `No, I don't want to cop out.' I was innocent. He said a
trial could take six months to a year. I told him, `As long as it
takes.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It took longer than either of them had imagined. Padro went
through three lawyers, with the first two leaving Legal Aid for
reasons unrelated to the case. It took time for each of the new
lawyers to learn the case, although the turnover was not a major
reason for the delays, said Irwin Shaw, the attorney in charge of
the Bronx office of Legal Aid's criminal division.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said that it took months to investigate Edwards' background
thoroughly, and that the time was well spent since the outcome of
the trial hinged on his credibility. Defense lawyers filed many
motions seeking records kept by Partners in Care and hospitals
where he had received care. They also demanded, and eventually got,
Edwards' psychiatric records.
</P>
<P>
   Trials are also delayed because of the relatively small number
of judges available to hear criminal cases, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The time it took to get Padro to trial was not so unusual, Shaw
said. Had the defendant been free on bail, the pace would have been
acceptable. Shaw also said that the bail was high for someone with
no previous criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said that
it bore no responsibility for delays in Padro's case. ``It took as
long as it did because there were problems with the defendant
getting counsel,'' said Steven Reed, a spokesman for Johnson. ``He
changed counsel, and there were times when they were not ready to
proceed. We were ready to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said there was some validity to Reed's assertion, but he
also said that it was critical for defense lawyers to investigate
Edwards carefully. ``This was essentially a one-witness case,''
Shaw said. ``The reliability of that witness was very important.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If this case had been tried in seven, eight or nine
months, which would be fast, I can't tell you that it would have
had the same outcome. Our lawyers did whatever they had to do so
this client would have the best chance of having a favorable
verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Padro eventually got that verdict. He asked for a nonjury trial,
he said, because he was afraid that jurors might be biased against
a gay defendant. Instead, he took his chances with Massaro, with
whom he had occasionally had harsh words over the months of
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, which began early in November 1998 and ran
intermittently into January, the defense was able to impeach
Edwards' credibility, documenting many examples in which he had
complained about other home health aides and several instances in
which he had been caught making false accusations about other
aides. The defense also called witnesses to testify to Padro's
character.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the trial, the judge and district attorney made
another plea offer: Padro could plead guilty to a low-level felony
and be sentenced to a year in jail. Since he had already served 18
months by then, he could have gone free. Padro turned it down. If
convicted at trial, he would have faced a sentence of 5 to 25 years
in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'm not pleading guilty to a felony,''' he recalled.
`` `This is a serious offense. How am I going to get a job?' Even
the judge told me I was making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Jan. 29, Massaro pronounced Padro not guilty on both
counts. ``He gave me a look like, is this good enough for you?
Because I had given him a hard time,'' Padro said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards still insists he was telling the truth. ` ``When he
wasn't found guilty, I felt defenseless, like I was worthless,''
Edwards said. ``This isn't justice.''
</P>
<P>
   For Padro, who has been free for four months, the transition has
been difficult. He said he was reluctant to go back to work as a
home health aide, fearing that another patient might accuse him of
wrongdoing. He said he had been depressed, suffered nightmares, and
felt uncharacteristically aimless and unmotivated. He got a break
two weeks ago, when a designer of costume jewelry hired him to help
assemble and sell her designs.
</P>
<P>
   Padro has obtained a new lawyer, Elliot Taub, who has sued the
health care agency, Partners in Care, charging negligence and
contending that it had failed to warn Padro about Edwards and thus
was responsible for his arrest and incarceration. The suit asks for
$15 million in damages. Lyle Churchill, a vice president of the
Visiting Nurse Service of New York, which controls Partners in
Care, declined to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Padro said he still did not understand why he spent so long in
jail, or even why the police and prosecutors pursued the case.
``How could they let someone make one phone call and all this
happens?'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR OPENERS, YANKS AND METS OFFER A SERIES FOR THE
FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although the Yankees and the Mets keep trying to
deflate the tension of their subway series, they all acknowledge,
``It's great for the fans.'' And for Friday night's opener, 56,175
of those fans showed up, the fourth-largest non-opening-day
regular-season crowd at Yankee Stadium since the House that George
Rebuilt reopened in 1976. But one of those fans turned the Yankees'
4-3 victory. Maybe a Yankee fan with a method to his madness?
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine wouldn't bite, saying, ``Maybe it was a Mets
fan.'' But whatever that fan's allegiance, the Yankees prospered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad the fans decided to participate,'' Valentine, the
Mets manager, would say later. ``They're not participants.''
</P>
<P>
   With two out in the Mets' sixth and the Yankees leading, 3-2.
Robin Ventura walked and hurried to third on Brian McRae's single.
Rey Ordonez slashed a line drive down the right field line but a
fan reached out and touched the ball. Ground-rule double. Ventura
scored, but McRae, instead of possibly scoring, had to stop at
third.
</P>
<P>
   And the question will never be answered: if the fan hadn't
touched the ball, would McRae have scored the Mets' fourth run?
</P>
<P>
   Had a Yankee fan been smart enough to touch the ball on purpose
in order to prevent McRae from scoring the go-ahead run?
</P>
<P>
   Yankee catcher Jorge Posada wouldn't rule that out. He talked
about how he had seen home fans deliberately stay away from balls
hit by Yankees, but touch a ball hit by an opponent in order to
create a ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 playoffs, remember, umpire Rich Garcia awarded Derek
Jeter a home run when a then 12-year-old Yankee fan, Jeffrey Maier,
leaned over the right-field wall and caught the ball above Oriole
right-fielder Tony Tarasco's glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won that game and the American League Championship
Series. And now a fan, knowingly or not, helped them win the subway
series opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether Brian could have scored, that's the umpires' judgment
call, we'll never know,'' Valentine said. ``If the ball had gone
into the corner and rattled around, Brian might have been able to
score; at least there would have been a play at the plate. But
because the fan touched the ball so quickly, the play was called
quickly. So we'll never know what might have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae was running toward third when he heard ``one of the
umpires yell'' for him to stop at third as Ordonez glided to
second.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno walked, loading the bases, but Jason Grimsley,
replacing Yankee starter David Cone, induced Rickey Henderson to
bounce a grounder to second baseman Chuck Knoblauch for the third
out. The Mets never scored again as their losing streak reached
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   McRae, the Mets' center fielder who was put on waivers recently,
had three of the Mets' seven hits, including a second-inning homer
off David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't look at Coney,'' he said, alluding to his circling
the bases, ``because I was going to laugh. Me and him are good
friends. We hang out in the city. And he'll get back at me. I got
three hits, but they won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the three seasons of inter-league competition, the Yankees
now have a 5-2 record against the Mets in their subway series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series takes on a life of its own,'' Joe Torre, the
Yankee manager said. ``The media builds it up and the fans love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans were as much of a show as the game. The assembly of
predominantly Yankee fans enjoyed welcoming Rickey Henderson to the
Stadium where he once was the Yankee left fielder. When he made a
snatch-catch of Scott Brosius' fly ball in the third inning, the
fans in the lower left-field stands buzzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were yelling for me to make a snatch-catch even before I
made it,'' Henderson said. ``I recognized a few fans who were out
there when I played here. And all that yelling at me, it don't
bother me. It makes you play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson had a single and two stolen bases, but the Mets
couldn't quite play well enough to win the subway series opener
after having been swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks and the
Cincinnati Reds at Shea Stadium in their six previous games. And
they had two more games at Yankee Stadium this weekend, then three
more against the Yankees at Shea on July 9-10-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fans and media blow this way out of proportion,'' said
Rick Reed, the Met starter who allowed only five hits before being
relieved in the seventh. ``This is just another series for us.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not. And it shouldn't be. Until the Yankees and the
Mets meet in the World Series, if ever, the subway series will have
to do. And it does very nicely, thank you. No matter which team
wins. All those fans at Yankee Stadium this weekend are the proof
of that.
</P>
<P>
   Even if one of those fans was a participant. &QL;

STRIKE ZONE CHANGE HURTS MADDUX AND GLAVINE 
MARLIN ANSWERS DOUBTS 
NOMO A HAPPY BREWER 
THE NO-HOME-RUN RACE 
`CIVILIZED' AT SHEA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In spring training, before pitchers and hitters knew how umpires
would adjust to the strike zone edict from the commissioner's
office, a couple of pretty good pitchers were expressing their
views on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   What's that, Greg Maddux asked, they're going to stop calling
strikes on pitches beyond the outside corner of the plate? ``I
didn't know they called pitches off the plate intentionally,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His pal at the next locker, Tom Glavine, was more forthcoming.
Asked if the change would affect him, he said, ``Of course it
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine added: ``I'm not going to lie. We get a little off the
plate. But people want you to believe we're getting six or eight
inches off the plate. We don't get that. There aren't many umpires
out there who will give you two inches, four inches, six inches if
you keep going. They might give you two, but they're going to draw
a line.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the edict to reduce the widened strike zone,
umpires for the most part have taken away the pitch, and the
artistic ability that helped Maddux and Glavine win six Cy Young
awards between them.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the new strike zone or not, the Atlanta Braves'
devastating duo are suffering this season as they haven't since
their earliest years in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, a 20-game winner last season for the fourth time in his
career, has a 3-7 record and 5.00 ERA. Maddux pitched against the
Red Sox Saturday with a 4-3 record and a 4.54 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Other numbers make their performances even worse. Opposing
batters were hitting .329 against Maddux, .291 against Glavine.
That's like a career .202 hitter suddenly winning a batting title
with a .348 average.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux has allowed 113 base runners in 711/3 innings, Glavine
121 in 771/3, giving each a ratio of 14 base runners per nine
innings. The last time Maddux reached double figures in base runner
ratio was in 1991, when he permitted 10.4. In three of the
intervening seven seasons, his ratio was under 9, reaching a
personal low of 7.5 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 of the last 11 seasons, Maddux has allowed fewer hits than
innings pitched. This season opposing batters have 100 hits in
711/3 innings, peppering Maddux for 10 or more hits in five
successive starts at one stretch. Last season teams amassed 10 or
more hits against Maddux a total of four times, only once in his
first 27 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, who walks many more batters than Maddux, has
traditionally put more runners on base, but not as many as he is
putting on this season. In the previous two years, his ratios were
10.5 and 10.9.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox, their manager, played down the problems they have
experienced. But he acknowledged they are not pitching to the same
strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strike zone is tightened up a lot,'' Cox said. ``We don't
want strikes off the plate; we want strikes on the plate. The
problem is the strike zone has become so small with a lot of guys.
The outside, if you want to shrink it, shrink it. But that crease
below the kneecaps and the letters are supposed to be a strike. But
they aren't, so nothing's a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling, Philadelphia's strikeout pitcher, has said that
some umpires have gone so far to show they are not calling pitches
off the plate strikes by not calling pitches on the corners of the
plate strikes either.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I see,'' Cox said. ``They're not giving the
corners. Then they're blowing pitches right down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves' hitting coach, Don Baylor has watched Maddux and
Glavine from a different dugout this season. For the last six
seasons he watched them as the Colorado Rockies' manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making them throw the ball over the plate a little bit
more,'' Baylor said. ``I see a lot of that. I see a lot of
inconsistency with the umpires. With Glavine early, even in spring
training, he threw pitches and got nothing but ball, ball. Here's a
Cy Young guy who threw those same pitches last year and got
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   His hitters in Colorado, Baylor said, chased pitches that Maddux
and Glavine threw ``because they knew they were going to be around
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it seems they're on the plate more,'' he said. ``I see
guys sitting there waiting for their pitch, even young guys.
They're taking ball one, ball two, then they get their pitch and
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor mentioned a game a few weeks ago in which the Chicago
Cubs battered Maddux for 14 hits. ``Sometimes you didn't have 14
swings against him,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps next winter the stars of one of the best television
commercials ever made can make a commercial about their
determination to improve their pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin Answers Doubts
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Marlins were not certain this past spring that
Preston Wilson would win a job. Before they decided whether to put
him on the team, they had to determine if he would get enough
playing time. They didn't want him spending too much time on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   But Cliff Floyd began the season on the disabled list with a
knee injury, opening an outfield spot for the rookie the Marlins
acquired from the Mets in the Mike Piazza deal last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what direction we would have gone in,'' general
manager Dave Dombrowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the best choices are the ones made for you. Wilson,
son of Mets coach Mookie Wilson, hit .177 through April 27, but
since then he had batted .337 (30 for 89) entering Saturday night's
game, hit nine home runs and driven in 19 runs in 29 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known that he has tremendous power,'' Dombrowski said.
``The thing he needs to do is make better contact. He doesn't have
to take a big swing. The ball jumps off his bat. Lately he's
shortened his swing some. He's a young player and I can't tell you
he will do that on a consistent basis. But he's swinging at more
strikes and getting more hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's rapid development prompted the Marlins to send Todd
Dunwoody, their starting center fielder, to the minor leagues two
weeks ago to work on his hitting (.208). Wilson took over in
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have to improve out there, but he has played
solidly,'' Dombrowski said. ``He can run and throw.''
</P>
<P>
   The general manager said he wouldn't burden the 24-year-old
right-handed hitter with specific expectations, but the Marlins
certainly like his power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the capability of hitting 30 home runs at the big
league level,'' Dombrowski said. ``I'm not saying he'll do it this
year. But he's always a threat to hit the ball out of the
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Nomo a Happy Brewer
</P>
<P>
   Released by the Mets and the Chicago Cubs this year, Hideo Nomo
has found success in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's throwing strikes; that's the big thing,'' Steve Phillips,
the Mets' general manager, said. ``He didn't do it with us and he
didn't do it with the Cubs in Triple A.''
</P>
<P>
   From his entry into the major leagues in 1995 to his twin
releases this year, the Japanese right-hander suffered a
precipitous plunge in status. Then he was the NL rookie of the
year, the league leader in strikeouts and shutouts and the major
league leader in opponents' batting average. Now he was a discarded
pitcher, seemingly on the way to a premature, forced retirement.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mets released him during spring training, Nomo gained
an audition with the Cubs by way of their Triple A team. But he was
wild, and the Cubs asked for one more start before making a
decision. Don Nomura, Nomo's agent, declined, and the Cubs released
him.
</P>
<P>
   With pitching in a fragile state, the Brewers were willing to
give Nomo a third chance, and this one worked. In his first five
starts with the Brewers, Nomo compiled a 2-1 record and a 2.41 ERA
walking only nine and striking out 30 in 33 2/3 innings. His loss
was a 3-2 decision to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he thought Nomo has found a comfortable place to
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   `It's slightly different pitching there and pitching here,'' he
said. ``The expectations were such that I think he put a little
pressure on himself. Now he's on minimum salary and it's a
can't-lose situation for Milwaukee.''
</P>
<P>
   The No-Home-Run Race
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa's home runs command all of the attention in Chicago
Cubs games, but last Wednesday Lance Johnson hit a home run that
was noteworthy for its timing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, noted for his triples, has not hit many home runs in
his career _ 34 in more than 5,000 times at bat _ and he does not
usually hit them this early. Last year, for example, he hit two all
season, the first in the Cubs' 157th game (Sosa already had slugged
63), the second in their 158th.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Johnson hit one home run, his first in 641 major league
at-bats. He hit none in 1991 (588 at-bats) and 1993 (540) and three
in 1992, giving him four home runs in his first 2,599 at-bats. He
hit his first this season in his 182nd at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson already on the home run chart, it is left to others
to run the no-home-run race. Entering Saturday's games, Luis
Castillo of Florida was leading with 193 times at bat without a
home run. Tony Womack of Arizona was right behind at 191 and Mike
Caruso of the Chicago White Sox was next at 187.
</P>
<P>
   `Civilized' at Shea
</P>
<P>
   After Randy Johnson pitched at Shea Stadium for the first time
last Sunday, he had an observation. ``The biggest thing I noticed
was the fans were a lot different than in Yankee Stadium,'' he
said. ``I mean that in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   How were they different? ``I just think a little more, you know
`go get em, Randy,' more positive, considering I'm a visiting
player.'' Did he mean more civilized? ``Yeah,'' he said, laughing,
``that's a good word.''

PORT AUTHORITY WAGED AN UPHILL BATTLE TO BUILD TRAIN TO KENNEDY
AIRPORT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In its all-out campaign to win approval for a rail
line linking Kennedy International Airport to local subways and
trains, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey recently
treated some City Council members to a bus ride through Queens. It
even provided some entertainment along the way: a brief clip from
an old ``Seinfeld'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   But the clip was hardly chosen at random. It showed one of the
characters, Elaine, explaining her elaborate plans to reach Kennedy
on time, only to be foiled by the perpetually clogged expressway
leading to the airport, the roadway whose very name is a punch
line: the dreaded Van Wyck.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if to demonstrate that life is too short to waste
time imitating art, the bus load of Council members, who were
heading to the rail line's proposed transfer point in Jamaica, got
stuck in traffic on the Van Wyck.
</P>
<P>
   The bus trip was just one aspect of the Port Authority's intense
and ultimately successful mission to win a $1.5 billion project to
connect the airport to the city's mass transit system _ a plan that
its representatives agree is both imperfect and a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Community boards in Queens questioned the disruption that
building an elevated rail line down the middle of the Van Wyck
would cause. Some transportation experts deplored the failure to
link the system to La Guardia Airport in northern Queens and
doubted its overall practicality. The staff of the City Council
issued a report that described the project's purported economic
benefits as illusory.
</P>
<P>
   The authority also had to overcome the problem of its own
reputation. One of its lobbyists described that reputation as ``the
evil empire.'' One of its executives went further: ``We are the big
fat bloated bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   To overcome those perceptions, the authority hired a SWAT team
of lobbyists, made expensive promises to various communities,
showered southeastern Queens with marketing studies and fact
sheets, and _ in the last days _ tinkered with the design to
appease Peter F. Vallone, speaker of the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   It also had on its side a simplistic but nevertheless persuasive
argument: Something is better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the pieces fell into place. Very reluctantly, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani cut a deal that propelled the project forward. The
Planning Commission described the project, called Airtrain, as a
disaster-in-waiting, but then approved it. And despite the
devastating Council report, two Council committees gave
near-unanimous approval last week, clearing the way for the full
Council to grant final approval this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they were all spurred by the realization that New
York City lags far behind other cities in providing quick,
convenient access to its airports. Travelers can reach Kennedy by
public transit, but only circuitously. The trip involves taking the
A train to the Howard Beach-Kennedy stop in Queens, about an hour
from midtown Manhattan, and then a free bus to the terminals, which
takes another 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Sabini, the chairman of one of the Council committees
that endorsed the Airtrain plan, reflected the lawmakers' general
sentiment this way: ``It's not the best project I've ever seen. But
on the whole, weighing pluses and minuses, we thought this was the
best thing _ and we voted for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things: you hold your nose and vote for
it,'' said one of the Port Authority's lobbyists, Martin
McLaughlin. ``But sometimes a flawed project is better than nothing
at all.''

   MEXICO-LEAD-$ADV06 _ TORREON, Mexico _ Facing what could be one
of its worst environmental disasters, Mexico is trying to clean up
waste from a metals refinery in Torreon that is blamed for
poisoning more than 1,000 children. The children _ and some people
who are now adults _ are suffering from elevated levels of lead in
their blood, which can cause permanent developmental damage. The
refinery has agreed to set up a $6.4 million health fund and sweep
affected areas in this northern Mexican city with special vacuums.
This brewing crisis didn't come out of nowhere: residents in one
poor neighborhood that sits next to the refinery and a giant slag
heap began to fight the company back in 1984. (Ferriss, Cox News

 &HT;    ONCE THE BOMBS STOP, REBUILDING KOSOVO WILL BE SLOW, DIFFICULT
AND COSTLY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON When U.S. Marines first set foot as peacekeepers
inside Kosovo, perhaps as early as this week, they'll begin what
promises to be a long-term mission to try to nurse the ravaged
province back to health.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring security and rebuilding Kosovo, however, are only the
most urgent steps in an emerging plan to knit the war-torn Balkans
back together and somehow shepherd the bloodstained region into the
fold of modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That goal, which only in recent weeks has become central to the
ambitions of the United States and its European allies, will likely
cost American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars and could take
a generation to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Even that prognosis assumes success in a region that has a way
of dooming the best of intentions to failure.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is that as soon as NATO bombs stop falling on
Serbia, NATO peacekeepers will march in. When their job will be
finished, no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking decades,'' said Kurt Bassuener, associate
director of the Balkan Action Council, a research and policy group
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent billions on this war, and we're going to have to
spend billions to prevent another one,'' said Bassuener. ``It's
going to take leadership, it's going to take money, it's going to
take attention and it's going to take time.''
</P>
<P>
   After 74 days of NATO air strikes, Serbia, and Kosovo in
particular, was still being pounded with bombs early Sunday. NATO
and Serb military commanders were scheduled to meet Sunday for a
second day at a cafe along the Macedonian border to try to agree on
a plan for pulling all Serb troops, police and paramilitary forces
out of Kosovo over the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the withdrawal begins in earnest, U.S. and NATO
officials insist, will the air strikes end.
</P>
<P>
   Once that happens, some 2,000 Marines as well as French, British
and other lead elements of a NATO peacekeeping force that will
eventually be 48,000 strong will start moving into Kosovo. Next,
convoys would begin hauling food and medical supplies into the
province to an estimated half a million ethnic Albanians who have
fled their homes and are living off the land inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 800,000 or so living in refugee camps or scattered
throughout private homes in neighboring Albania and Macedonia will
likely have to wait weeks, if not months, to return to their homes,
as NATO troops and aid workers rebuild shattered roads, bridges,
water supplies and shelter to accommodate the returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A certain amount of security has to be established before it's
safe for them to go back,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said
Saturday. ``I'm not positive that everybody will be able to get
back before winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Daunting as it is, the task of securing Kosovo and enabling
refugees to return is only the first step in an overarching scheme
unfolding in Washington and European capitals to try to resuscitate
a region wheezing from nearly a decade of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an enormous opportunity to be seized here, a chance
to shift our focus from defeating something evil to building
something good,'' President Clinton said Friday. He was laying out
the fresh challenge to American policymakers and the public at
large to invest billions of dollars to help the Balkans mature into
a democratic and economically viable part of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a goal that has been worth fighting for over the last
weeks,'' said Clinton, ``a goal we must work for with steadfast
determination in the months and in the years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The wording was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton once promised, after all, that American troops would be
required in Bosnia for a single year. That was nearly four years
ago. There are still 6,200 U.S. troops in Bosnia, part of a larger
NATO peacekeeping force there of some 31,000. And they appear
certain to remain for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made clear this time that stitching Kosovo back
together will be neither quick nor easy.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows how much it will cost to repair the destruction
NATO bombs have rained down upon Serbia's bridges, factories,
railroads, power plants and refineries, not to mention its military
barracks, ammo dumps, tanks and warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has destroyed nearly 1,000 major targets or pieces of
military equipment in the field, and Belgrade has estimated the
damage at up to $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and European aid will begin pouring into Kosovo as soon as
NATO peacekeepers secure the province. The issue of massive
assistance will be near the heart of the agenda when Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright meets with her counterparts from the
so-called Group of Eight _ Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Russia and the United States _ in Europe sometime this week,
and when Clinton joins other G-8 leaders in Cologne later this
month for their annual summit.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding the rest of Serbia, however, is more problematic.
Anything other than humanitarian aid is likely to be withheld so
long as Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia,
remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Indicted for war crimes by a United Nations tribunal, Milosevic
is blamed by the West for Kosovo's humanitarian nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   With Serbia in ruins, the outlook for broader Balkan recovery is
grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prospects are bad,'' said Daniel Serwer, a former U.S. envoy
to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could rebuild every house in Kosovo and still not have an
economy,'' said Serwer. ``Kosovo's economy is dependent on Serbia,
as are the economies of several of Serbia's neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is rimmed by Balkan states struggling along the road to
political and economic renewal. Democratic and free market reforms
have swept through Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Macedonia and even
Montenegro. All are tied economically to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got ideal conditions in the surrounding states and a
disaster, a black hole, in the center of the Balkans,'' said
Serwer, a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute for Peace, a
government think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Brittle as his future may be, Milosevic has proven to be a
political survivor. Every day he remains on his last leg in power,
said Serwer, postpones Balkan renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region as a whole can't recover fully without a change,
not only in leadership, but in the kind of regime that Serbia
has,'' said Serwer. ``The last thing they want to do is be left in
a cage with a wounded bear.''

eventually be 48,000 strong will start moving into Kosovo. Next,
convoys would begin hauling food and medical supplies into the
province to an estimated half a million ethnic Albanians who have
fled their homes and are living off the land inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 800,000 or so living in refugee camps or scattered
throughout private homes in neighboring Albania and Macedonia will
likely have to wait weeks, if not months, to return to their homes,
as NATO troops and aid workers rebuild shattered roads, bridges,
water supplies and shelter to accommodate the returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A certain amount of security has to be established before it's
safe for them to go back,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said
Saturday. ``I'm not positive that everybody will be able to get
back before winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Daunting as it is, the task of securing Kosovo and enabling
refugees to return is only the first step in an overarching scheme
unfolding in Washington and European capitals to try to resuscitate
a region wheezing from nearly a decade of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an enormous opportunity to be seized here, a chance
to shift our focus from defeating something evil to building
something good,'' President Clinton said Friday. He was laying out
the fresh challenge to American policymakers and the public at
large to invest billions of dollars to help the Balkans mature into
a democratic and economically viable part of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a goal that has been worth fighting for over the last
weeks,'' said Clinton, ``a goal we must work for with steadfast
determination in the months and in the years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The wording was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton once promised, after all, that American troops would be
required in Bosnia for a single year. That was nearly four years
ago. There are still 6,200 U.S. troops in Bosnia, part of a larger
NATO peacekeeping force there of some 31,000. And they appear
certain to remain for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made clear this time that stitching Kosovo back
together will be neither quick nor easy.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows how much it will cost to repair the destruction
NATO bombs have rained down upon Serbia's bridges, factories,
railroads, power plants and refineries, not to mention its military
barracks, ammo dumps, tanks and warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has destroyed nearly 1,000 major targets or pieces of
military equipment in the field, and Belgrade has estimated the
damage at up to $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and European aid will begin pouring into Kosovo as soon as
NATO peacekeepers secure the province. The issue of massive
assistance will be near the heart of the agenda when Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright meets with her counterparts from the
so-called Group of Eight _ Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Russia and the United States _ in Europe sometime this week,
and when Clinton joins other G-8 leaders in Cologne later this
month for their annual summit.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding the rest of Serbia, however, is more problematic.
Anything other than humanitarian aid is likely to be withheld so
long as Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia,
remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Indicted for war crimes by a United Nations tribunal, Milosevic
is blamed by the West for Kosovo's humanitarian nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   With Serbia in ruins, the outlook for broader Balkan recovery is
grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prospects are bad,'' said Daniel Serwer, a former U.S. envoy
to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could rebuild every house in Kosovo and still not have an
economy,'' said Serwer. ``Kosovo's economy is dependent on Serbia,
as are the economies of several of Serbia's neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is rimmed by Balkan states struggling along the road to
political and economic renewal. Democratic and free market reforms
have swept through Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Macedonia and even
Montenegro. All are tied economically to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got ideal conditions in the surrounding states and a
disaster, a black hole, in the center of the Balkans,'' said
Serwer, a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute for Peace, a
government think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Brittle as his future may be, Milosevic has proven to be a
political survivor. Every day he remains on his last leg in power,
said Serwer, postpones Balkan renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region as a whole can't recover fully without a change,
not only in leadership, but in the kind of regime that Serbia
has,'' said Serwer. ``The last thing they want to do is be left in
a cage with a wounded bear.''

AS THEIR STARTERS FALTER, WILL THE METS IMITATE STEINBRENNER?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Leiter is considered the leader of the Mets'
pitching staff. He has a 2-5 record and a 6.39 earned run average.
Is that any way to lead a pitching staff?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put that on myself,'' the left-hander said
Saturday, when he was asked about himself as the leader. ``I can't
worry about everybody else. I've got to worry about getting hitters
out. My focus is on their lineup tomorrow night and what I have to
do to get them out, not to think about the big picture. That, for
me, is total distraction. It doesn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone here help the Mets' starting pitchers? With a 5.58
earned run average, 14th worst among 16 National League starting
corps, they are, to a large extent, responsible for the team's
plight a third of the way into the season. Leiter himself has the
fifth-worst era among pitchers who have made 10 or more starts.
</P>
<P>
   That's why rumblings have begun to surface about the status of
Bob Apodaca, the pitching coach. A report in Saturday's Newsday
said the club had begun to contemplate Apodaca's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps sheer coincidence that the Mets are at Yankee
Stadium this weekend for a three-game interleague series with the
Yankees. Under the ownership of George Steinbrenner, the Yankees,
if they didn't invent it, mastered the art of firing the pitching
coach when the team wasn't playing well. Or the hitting coach, or
the bullpen coach, or any combination of coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Further coincidence had Clyde King in the stands Saturday. He
was seated behind the Mets' dugout because he was the guest of a
friend who had seats in that location, but King is employed by the
Yankees. He also has vast firsthand knowledge of pitching coach
changes from his active days with the club.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner would fire a coach for one of two reasons: as the
scapegoat for the team's poor play or to get at the manager, whom
he really wanted to fire but didn't feel he could at the time.
</P>
<P>
   If Apodaca goes, he could fit either one of those categories,
scapegoat or conduit, with the former being more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, declined to talk
about Apodaca. ``I'm not going to comment on the status of any of
the coaches,'' he said. ``Clearly we have not pitched well. We have
to evaluate things on a daily basis as to how we're performing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, though, Phillips, when asked, did comment on
the manager's status. ``He's fine,'' Phillips said. ``I think he's
doing a good job. I expect him to be able to lead us out of this
slump we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine, who despite comments from Mets' officials to
the contrary, could himself be in jeopardy if the Mets don't get
serious about contending for a playoff spot. When they began play
Saturday, three first-place teams and six other teams had better
records.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who becomes offended at the suggestion that he does
anything wrong, staunchly defended Apodaca. ``Bob Apodaca is a very
good pitching coach,'' he said. ``His track record is as good as
anybody's in the game. He works as hard as and is as knowledgeable
as any coach I've been associated with.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine added that he remains committed to all of his coaches
``until they prove they're not doing the job they were hired to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Apodaca, who came to the Mets from their Norfolk minor league
team with Valentine in 1996, said passionately that he continues to
do his job the same way he always has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only known one way to do it,'' he said, ``and that's be
the first person at the ball park everyday, to prepare myself for
the team we're playing, to prepare my pitchers for the team we're
playing, work with them constantly as far as getting better,
including myself. If I'm responsible because I'm not doing more
than that, I don't know what more I can do. I approach the game the
same way I've always approached it and that's give my employer
every ounce of my energy.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue beyond the way Apodaca does his job has been raised,
and that is the coach's relationship with Leiter and reliever
Dennis Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not unaware of that issue,'' Phillips said. ``Not this
year, but I was aware of the question last year, the relationship
of those guys.'' One team member said the relationship between
Apodaca and Leiter has improved ``a little bit'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   One pitching coach has paid the price for an underachieving
pitching staff. The Rupert Murdoch Dodgers, who signed Kevin Brown
to a $105 million contract last winter, fired Charlie Hough 11 days
ago. If the Mets make a similar move, they would not be plowing any
new ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we've struggled and we have to be open to
considerations as to how we're going to turn it around,'' Phillips
said. He added, ``We are all accountable, including me, for the
team's performance.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying that the City University of New York is ``an
institution adrift'' and is ``caught in a spiral of decline,'' a
mayoral task force is calling for a total revamping of the
university.
</P>
<P>
   The task force report, which will be formally released Monday by
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, reaffirms the university's historic mission
of providing access to a higher education for the city's diverse
population.
</P>
<P>
   But it says that if it is to educate New Yorkers effectively, it
must be transformed from a loosely managed confederation of
scattered institutions with no direction and few standards into a
tightly managed operation that measures what its students know when
they enter, what they have learned by the time they leave and which
approaches are most effective in teaching them.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 200,000 students and a budget of nearly $2 billion,
CUNY is the United States' third-largest public university system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `chaotic' doesn't even begin to describe it; it's
moribund,'' said Benno Schmidt, the task force chairman. ``That
suggests a huge opportunity, but first CUNY needs to invent
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   While the report is highly critical of CUNY, as expected, it
assigns some blame for the university's problems to the city and
the state, and particularly New York City's weak public schools. It
also says the state's system of financial aid forces many students
who are not prepared for college work to enroll at CUNY, because it
is the only way they can receive financial support for their
remedial work.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many reports that end up sitting on the shelf after they
are issued, the Schmidt report has an unusually good chance to
become a blueprint for change. It comes as both the mayor and the
governor are pressing to revamp the university, and a majority of
the trustees support that goal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Herman Badillo, a member of the task force who was
promoted to the university's chairmanship last weekend, will be in
a unique position to press for the commission's recommendations. He
said the report would serve as CUNY's ``goal posts'' and that he
would present it to his fellow trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The commission offered a multitude of recommendations, including
the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ The state and the city should provide separate, additional
funding for students needing remedial instruction so they do not
use up their college aid while they learn reading, writing and
mathematics skills they should have learned before college.
</P>
<P>
   _ City University should continue to offer remedial courses, but
at its community colleges, and it must test students more carefully
before and after the courses to try to learn which approaches work
best.
</P>
<P>
   _ The university should designate at least two of its senior
colleges as flagship institutions that can attract students of high
academic promise.
</P>
<P>
   _ It must work with New York City's public high schools to try
to raise their quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``CUNY's downward spiral can be and must be reversed,'' the
report says. ``At the eve of a new century, the United States
urgently needs a model of the urban public university, and CUNY
should be that model of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   The study comes at a time when many universities, and
particularly urban universities, are struggling to cope with a
flood of poorly educated high school graduates and with immigrants
who speak little or no English but are desperate for a college
education to help them prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said in an interview that in an era when a college
degree has become ``virtually the only source of opportunity,'' he
hoped the report would offer strategic help not only for CUNY but
for all urban universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``CUNY's historic mission is more important now than it has ever
been,'' he said. ``CUNY has the chance to be the model for great
public urban universities for the next century, the way land-grant
institutions were in the last century, and it's absolutely vital to
make it right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is not an attack on open admissions,'' he added,
referring to CUNY's decision in the late 1960s to allow all high
school graduates to enter. ``This affirms the principle that CUNY
is for anyone with a high school diploma and for immigrants and for
returning adults; it is the way CUNY goes about it that is very
very flawed,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the mayor and the governor, whom Schmidt personally briefed
about the report, were said to be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sets such a positive tone for change,'' Michael McKeon,
Gov. George Pataki's press secretary, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he could not comment on how the governor would
respond to the report's recommendation for additional financial aid
for remedial students since the governor's staff was still going
through the details of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office said that the 109-page report will be posted
on the the city's Web site (www.ci.nyc.ny.us). The task force made
copies of the report and its 10 volumes of supporting studies
available to newspapers on Friday on the condition that no articles
be published until Monday. The Daily News printed an article on
Saturday that it said was based on an earlier draft of the report.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor created the task force in May 1998, there was
widespread skepticism that the panel would do anything more than
recommend shrinking the university and turning its work over to
private universities and corporations, since some of the panel's
seven members are advocates for privatization of government
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt is chairman of the Edison Project, a private company
that manages public schools for profit. Richard Schwartz, another
member, is a former senior adviser to Giuliani who helped design
New York City's welfare-to-work initiatives and privatization
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the report argues forcefully that City University
is critical for New York, and, if anything, should be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``CUNY's historic missions _ to provide broad access to a range
of higher education opportunities of quality, suited to New York
City's diverse population and to the city's needs _ will be more
important in the 21st century than ever before,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the task force was measured in its response to the
mayor's request to tell him how to privatize the university's
remedial functions. Rather than urging that such instruction be
shifted to private companies and private colleges, as the mayor has
advocated, the report called for experiments to stimulate
competition. It also says that City University should continue to
offer remedial courses, so long as the need exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``CUNY should provide remediation, and we applaud them for doing
it,'' Schmidt said. But, he added, ``It's very important for CUNY
to approach remediation in an organized, serious and effective way
because so many of its students fall into that category.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem, Schmidt said, was that the tests the university
uses to evaluate entering students ``are not good; they do not
generate diagnostically helpful information.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, a constitutional scholar who was formerly Dean of
Columbia University's Law School and president of Yale University,
approached the panel's investigation like an academic research
project, making it into virtually a second full-time job. He wrote
the final report himself, with help from other task force members.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a year, he met twice a month and sometimes
more frequently with the other members. He and staff members
visited all of the university's 17 undergraduate campuses and
interviewed hundreds of students, professors, administrators and
others. They held public hearings (some marked by protests by
students and professors). They commissioned reports from Rand Corp.
and Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the accounting and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the task force raised $300,000, in sums of
$75,000 or less from various foundations, to help pay for the work,
and is still trying to raise more.

YANKEES OWN SERIES AS METS LOSE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees and Mets are as different right now as
the Bronx and Queens. Having come to grips with the reality they
are not going to win 125 games in 1999, the Yankee are formidable
once more. The Mets, on the other hand, are headed for upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   The loser of the Subway Series was seemingly destined for
in-house turmoil, and with their 6-3 defeat at Yankee Stadium on
Saturday. the Mets are assured of that distinction. Having won the
first two games of this three-game series, the Yankees will send
Roger Clemens to the mound Sunday, bearing his personal 20-game
winning streak. The Mets have lost eight consecutive games and the
pitching coach, Bob Apodaca, is reportedly in jeopardy of losing
his job.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, 32-21 and 11 games over .500 for the first time
this year, were led by Derek Jeter _ who else _ who had a sacrifice
fly and doubled to start another rally. Jeter has reached base in
all 53 of the Yankees' games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' desperation to win this game _ to win any game _
became apparent in the third inning, when, with the starting
pitcher Masato Yoshii (5-5) struggling, the left-hander Allen
Watson got up to throw in the Mets' bullpen and the right-hander
Pat Mahomes joined him. Warming up two relievers in the third
inning is something only seen in the World Series or the playoffs _
or in the Subway Series, when an entire city is watching and your
team is in danger of drowning in the National League East standing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets grabbed victory by the throat in the early innings,
before losing their grip. With runners at second and third and
nobody out in the second inning, Brian McRae pulled a grounder to
the right side to drive in the game's first run and send Robin
Ventura to third base. Rey Ordonez then smashed the ball on one
bounce, a grounder destined for center field _ before Orlando
Hernandez jabbed it with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez reached with his right hand to retrieve the ball from
his glove, and realized immediately that it was stuck in the
webbing. Hernandez began running toward first base, like a
quarterback on a rollout, and, with an overhand motion, he flipped
his glove and the ball to first baseman Tino Martinez, who caught
the whole package for the second out of the inning. The 55,935
fans, witnessing a play few had ever seen before, roared in
delight, saluting Hernandez's calm and quick thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Soon their responses turned ugly, however. The next hitter,
Roger Cedeno, pushed a bunt in front of home plate. Hernandez (6-5)
rushed in to barehand the ball, and he had little chance of
throwing out Cedeno. But Yankees catcher Jorge Posada directed
Hernandez to throw to first, with a wave of his arm. Posada had not
bothered to notice that Ventura was coming down the line from third
base; nor had Posada returned to his position, to cover home plate.
Cedeno was safe at first base, and when Martinez tried to throw the
ball back to Posada in an attempt to nab Ventura, Posada was
completely unprepared, and Ventura ducked home with the Mets'
second run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla's sacrifice fly in the third inning gave the Mets
a 3-0 edge. Yoshii, who pitched a strong game against the Yankees
last year, had shut them out in the first two innings, and there
was a sense that the Mets might hang on for a day and quash their
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Yankees did not score in the first or second
inning, they looked comfortable at the plate against Yoshii; they
looked aggressive and confident, as if it was only a matter of time
before they were going to pound him. Yoshii threw 68 pitches on
this day, and the Yankees' batters swung and missed exactly once
(Bernie Williams leading off the second inning).
</P>
<P>
   Tony Tarasco, who is being given a chance to claim the
left-field job as his own, lined a double into the right-field
corner leading off the third. Scott Brosius fouled off three
consecutive pitches against Yoshii, his timing improving with each
offering, before ripping a run-scoring single to right field.
Following Brosius, Chuck Knoblauch fouled off six straight pitches,
and on the 10th pitch of the at-bat, Yoshii threw a pitch down and
in, Knoblauch's favorite area of the strike zone; the Yankees'
second baseman bashed a double to left field, Brosius stopping at
third.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter's fly ball allowed Brosius to score and Knoblauch to
take third, and Brosius scored on a ground ball, tying the score at
3-3. The Mets require miracles to establish three-run leads these
days, and within the span of six hitters, their advantage was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The third inning ended with Mahomes and Watson both warmed up
and ready to go in the Mets' bullpen, but Yoshii came out to pitch
the fourth _ and allowed an upper-deck home run on the first pitch
he threw, to Tino Martinez. Chili Davis lofted a fly ball high and
to left field, where Rickey Henderson stared deeply into the sun.
He learned nothing about his inner soul and lost sight of the ball,
as well, and Davis ended up with a double. The Mets' dugout was
seized in mournful inertia.
</P>
<P>
   Three batters later, Brosius hammered a line drive to
right-center, beyond right fielder Cedeno, and Davis trotted home
with the Yankees' fifth run. With their eighth straight loss, the
Mets (27-28) fell under .500 for the first time since losing their
season opener. They will send Al Leiter (2-5) against Clemens on
Sunday.

RACERS EXPRESS SHOCK AT ITALIAN'S SUSPENSION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Sweden, France, Poland, Belgium)   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAMBERY, France _ Far from the Giro d'Italia, 116 bicycle
riders were starting their own race Saturday morning when the news
about Marco Pantani's disqualification there for failing a drug
test swept through their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a joke,'' said Glenn Magnusson, a Swede with
the U.S. Postal Service team in the one-day Classique des Alpes.
``A very bad joke too. Then people understood that it was true.''
</P>
<P>
   Pantani was over the authorized limit of the hematocrit (red
blood-cell ratio) in his body and faces an automatic two-week
suspension. There was doubt as to whether he would ever race again.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Italian, who is the Tour de France champion, was
the only rider of the 10 competitors to be tested by the sport's
world governing body, UCI, whose level was above the legally
permitted 50 percent, registering 52 percent. Anything above 50
percent suggests that the rider had taken erythropoietin, or EPO,
which boosts the red blood cells that carry oxygen around the body.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani was devastated. ``I have already undergone two tests as
race leader,'' he told Agence France-Presse in Madonna di
Campiglio, Italy, ``and I think there is something strange going on
here. I feel all sorts of things but words would be too much. I had
the pink jersey, my hematocrit level was at 46 percent, and I wake
up to this surprise. I think there's certainly something not quite
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Pantani, who has twice fought back from serious injury, then
addressed the future. ``I've returned from two big accidents, but
this time, morale-wise, we've touched the bottom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Chambery, Pantani's fellow riders were left shaking their
heads. ``Unbelievable,'' Magnusson said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the one word riders used to sum up their reaction after
the Italian failed a drug test and was not allowed to start the
next to last stage of the Giro he was leading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said Geert van Bondt, a Belgian with the TVM
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said Darxiusz Baranowski, a Pole with Banesto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still stunned by the news,'' said Cedric Vasseur, a
Frenchman for the Credit Agricole team who finished 14th here
today. ``This is bad for the whole family of racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong, the American leader of the Postal Service team
who dropped out late in the race, said: ``I'm surprised. I like
Pantani. He's an honest guy, an intelligent guy, and that's why I'm
surprised and disappointed. Like all of this, it's bad for the
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Thevenet, who won the Tour de France in 1975 and 1977
and now is a television commentator, saw some benefits in the
announcement in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible for the sport but in a strange way it may be
good for the sport,'' Thevenet said. ``This tells all the riders
that no matter how much of a star you are, no matter what race you
are leading, you can be caught and punished if you're using
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Another one of the riders who quit Saturday's race, Pascal
Derame, a Frenchman with the Postal Service team, said he had been
stunned by the news at first, but then pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be candid, as a Frenchman,'' he said, ``I'm glad this
happened because it shows that it's not just France that's cracking
down on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The French battle, led by the courts and the police, began last
July in Tour de France and resulted in the expulsion of the Festina
team, then top-ranked in the sport. Its nine riders were accused of
the systematic use of illegal performance enhancing drugs, a charge
that six of them later admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of what became known as the Festina Affair,
French authorities have questioned dozens of riders, team officials
and doctors plus French officials in organizations that govern
bicycle racing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some foreign teams have avoided French races since
the season began in February. The Classique des Alpes Saturday, for
example, had a field reduced by about two dozen riders from last
year's edition and the weeklong Dauphine race, a major tune-up for
the Tour de France begins Monday with only 96 riders, about 40
fewer than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Absent Sunday from the Classique des Alpes of last year's
winner, Laurent Jalabert, a Frenchman with the ONCE team based on
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wears the blue, white and red jersey of the French
national champion, Jalabert has not ridden a race on native soil
this season. He also refuses to take the quarterly medical
examinations now required of riders with a French license, and so
is ineligible to defend his title later this month and cannot
represent his country in the world championships in October.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: TRIPLE CROWN IS BRIGHTER EVERY PASSING YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ This was back before Charismatic was a Triple
Crown contender, back when he was merely a colt who had almost been
claimed for $62,500.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer D. Wayne Lukas called co-owner Bob Lewis and tried to
explain why the colt was worth the oats and the hay and the
supplements they poured into him every day.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas told the owner that he wasn't sure Charismatic was ready
to win the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness. ``But then Wayne said,
`I'm really confident he's a Belmont type of horse,' ' Lewis
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Lewis hung up the phone, he told his wife, Beverly,
``This is one salesman who knows how to pump up another salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who had made his fortune peddling beer to the waiting
world, could relate to Lukas' gift of gab.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic's Belmont turned out dismally Saturday as the colt
finished third behind Lemon Drop Kid, and was hobbling after the
finish line. With the colt's health a concern, it was almost
overlooked that racing would not have its first Triple Crown since
Affirmed won in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one years proves it is not easy to win those three races
in one frantic springtime. It is one thing to win the Derby at a
mile and 1/4, another to win the Preakness at a mile and 3/16, and
a third to win at a mile and 1/2, to be a Belmont type of horse.
</P>
<P>
   It is a totally different thing to win all three races in one
year, which going into Saturday had happened only 11 times in more
than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert came close the last two years with Silver Charm and
Real Quiet, discovering in June that he did not have a Belmont type
of horse.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas and Baffert really are rivals. Don't believe all the
poppycock about being respectful colleagues. Last year, Lukas found
himself in the same box with Baffert at the Belmont as Real Quiet
tried to hang on for the first Triple Crown in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got it!'' Lukas shouted as Victory Gallop and Real Quiet
pounded across the finish line. ``I thought he did,'' Lukas
recalled this week.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the ``Inquiry'' sign went up, Baffert did not dare
hope because he knew that Victory Gallop had lived up to his name.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Baffert was throwing off verbiage about the Belmont's
being merely the end to a grueling ordeal. That was not true,
either. Winning the Triple Crown was huge, a windfall waiting to
drop on somebody. ``The Triple Crown pulls the average guy in off
the street,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how in 1973 Secretariat ``was on the cover of
Newsweek, Time and Sports Illustrated,'' but he conceded that if
Charismatic won, he would make Sports Illustrated, at best. There
will only be one Secretariat, ever. Still, the long wait had made
the Triple Crown valuable, like a trust fund that has been sitting
there collecting interest.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing has almost none of the cachet it did 40 to 50 years
ago, before television brought Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky and
Ken Griffey Jr. into everybody's living rooms in the glorious
springtime.
</P>
<P>
   Racing has slipped backward into a slower way to gamble than
scratching a card at the local stationery store, except for a few
minutes every spring, particularly if there is the potential for a
Triple Crown. ``There are no soft spots these days,'' Lukas said
recently. ``In the '50s and '60s, the horses could prepare all
spring. There was no Breeders Cup in the fall, not as many December
and January races. The style is different now. They run at you
every step of the way. We have to train harder.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the theory that because of the emphasis on speed,
horses are bred too fine, and find it hard to stay healthy for the
longest race, to become a Belmont type of horse. Lukas tried to
portray his colt as an underdog, mostly because Charismatic was
almost lost in a claiming race last February. ``This is the player
who didn't get a full scholarship and had a tough sophomore and
junior year but now he's an all-American,'' said Lukas, who coached
basketball in high school and college.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas added: ``America loves the underdog, the low draft choice
who makes the pros. America wants Rudy to play for Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   That was fine, but Charismatic was now a 2-1 favorite, being
challenged by the trainer who did not win the Triple Crown the last
two years. Lukas said the concept of a bitter rivalry was ``way
overdone,'' and tried to shrug off the insertion of
Silverbulletday. The filly had been held out of the Derby and the
Preakness because Baffert depicted her as not strong enough for the
male field. Now she was here, only the 21st filly to run in the
Belmont, with only two _ Ruthless in 1867 and Tanya in 1905 _
winning it.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert tried to play down the weight of the Triple Crown,
claiming the Derby was the true rush _ ``you forget how you got to
the winner's circle'' _ but he said that by the Belmont, ``you're
just glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you win the Belmont, of course. And the winner of a
Triple Crown just might never be able to recall how he got to the
winner's circle, too. &QL;

WAGING WAR ON THE SERBS: OLD PROBLEM, NEW LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a curious mismatch of a war.
</P>
<P>
   In the near corner stood the richest, best-armed military
alliance in history: The American-led North Atlantic Treaty
Organization had been around for 50 years without having to fight a
war. It was big, but bulky. All 19 of its members had to agree
before it could throw a punch.
</P>
<P>
   In the far corner stood a wily Balkan dictator who answered to
no one but himself: Slobodan Milosevic specialized in using thugs
and his antiquated army to fight hugely destructive wars that he
ultimately lost, but which whipped up nationalist fervor inside
Serbia. They had kept him in power in a new Europe that has no
stomach for dictators.
</P>
<P>
   Equally odd were the rules. As President Clinton laid them down
on day one: ``I do not intend to put our troops in Kosovo to fight
a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of White House skittishness about U.S. combat deaths,
NATO was obliged to do what had never been done: Win a war without
risking its own soldiers on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   If the peace deal holds up, the curious war comes out this way:
The bulky alliance won, but at a savage cost to the people who were
supposed to be protected. Much of Kosovo has been razed, more than
1 million of its ethnic Albanian residents have been uprooted and
thousands of innocents have been killed. The West will have to
spend many billions of dollars to rebuild what it and the Serbs
have destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The dictator lost, but he stays on in his shrinking Yugoslavia.
If his bad habits hold and if the Serbs do not depose him, he may
well cause trouble another day.
</P>
<P>
   And just possibly a new lesson in war has been learned. Thanks
to the wonders of high-tech weaponry, an overwhelmingly powerful
alliance can crush a small nation's aggressive will without having
to risk its own soldiers, if it is willing to spend enough money
and if it can stomach mistakes that kill innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it was a 72-day campaign of violent accretion.
</P>
<P>
   As bombs did their work, diplomats from the United States,
Western Europe and Russia ignored the West's oratory about
Milosevic being a latter-day Hitler and went about the delicate
business of offering him an exit.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombs did their work, Milosevic's forces did what damage
they could in Kosovo; then he prepared his people for another lost
war. As soon as he was offered a way to stay in power while losing,
he jumped on it.
</P>
<P>
   Generals and politicians often learn the wrong lessons from the
last war. The wrong lesson that U.S. officials took from dropping
bombs to end the war in Bosnia in 1995 was that Milosevic would
fold after a few days of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-chance attempt to head off war in Kosovo on March 23,
Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special envoy to Yugoslavia, failed to
scare Milosevic with the threat of imminent bombing.
</P>
<P>
   On his way out of the country, Holbrooke was asked if he feared
that NATO's air attacks would ignite a humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is our greatest fear by far, by far,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what NATO, operating only from the air, could do to
prevent a catastrophe, Holbrooke went silent and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   The day the bombing began, one top Air Force general in
Washington fretted privately about a ``new Vietnam.'' On June 2,
the day before the peace deal was announced, another very senior
Pentagon official expressed doubt that the air war could ever be
won and predicted that the bombing could go on for years.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``hope to win'' strategy, said Colin Powell, the
retired general and architect of the Persian Gulf war in 1991,
which was won with a combined air-land-sea strategy of overwhelming
force.
</P>
<P>
   The hope was that just a few bombs would push Milosevic back to
the bargaining table. But the Serbian leader had launched a
blitzkrieg of ethnic purges, burning and looting Albanians' homes
and killing and mutilating enough Albanians to send hundreds of
thousands of others fleeing at the first sound of rifle butts
against their doors.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House did not have a Plan B.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came to realize that his ruling out of ground troops was
a mistake, according to a White House official, and the president
last month made a point of saying he was keeping all options open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has never been prepared to lose,'' this official
said. ``From the first day, he said we have to win this. It was
absolutely clear. Because of the consequences for the U.S., for
NATO, for his responsibilities as commander in chief, we had to win
this.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's only alternative, then, was to bomb _ a lot.
</P>
<P>
   More than 33,000 missions were flown and during 12,500 of them,
bombs were dropped or missiles were fired. Hampered by bad weather
and political fears in the alliance, the air campaign started
slowly and ineffectively.
</P>
<P>
   But over time more precise weapons allowed NATO to destroy
virtually any major target it wanted at minimal risk to its pilots.
Only two aircraft were lost, and both pilots were quickly rescued.
While three Americans were captured on the ground _ abducted,
Americans believed, by Macedonians sympathetic to Yugoslavia _ they
were eventually released.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes in the air campaign _ the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade and attacks on passenger trains, buses,
hospitals, bridges and apartment buildings that killed 1,500
civilians, by Yugoslav estimates _ brought apologies from NATO, but
no change in tactics. As weeks passed, NATO commanders were given
increasing license to go after targets like electricity grids and
water supplies. For the first time in a decade of war in
Yugoslavia, the suffering was brought home to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Embassy debacle marked a turning point, one at which
formerly reluctant NATO members agreed to widen the range of
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted the bombing to come to an end quickly but realized
we needed to intensify to make that happen,'' one official said.
``The flip side of intensification was there would be more
collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The NATO leaders presented a united front, cobbling together a
set of core demands that the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart,
summarized in four words, ``Serbs out, refugees back.'' These
demands, plus the non-negotiable insistence that Kosovo be occupied
by an international force with NATO at its core, formed the basis
of the peace plan that Milosevic signed six weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   But the crucial difference between what he accepted and the
Rambouillet plan, from Milosevic's point of view, is that the
international force is not composed solely of NATO soldiers and is
to operate under U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
   On April 25, Russian President Boris Yeltsin had called Clinton.
The NATO anniversary summit meeting was still going on and Clinton
was in a secure holding room at the Mellon Auditorium in Washington
preparing to address the closing session.
</P>
<P>
   According to administration officials, Yeltsin had decided he
had to reassert Moscow's position as a major world power or risk
being marginalized in the most important conflict in Europe since
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders spoke for 90 minutes, with Yeltsin presenting a
variety of ideas for ending the Balkan war on terms acceptable to
Moscow and Belgrade, according to a U.S. official who spoke to
Clinton immediately afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected most of Yeltsin's suggestions as incompatible
with the simple NATO principles: Serbian forces out, ethnic
Albanians back under the protection of a force with NATO at its
core. This rejection of Russia's ideas for ending the war while
embracing Russia's desire to once again be a big-league diplomatic
player became a defining and productive pattern of the talks that
produced the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Yeltsin's ideas did take root _ the reopening of the
dormant channel of communication between Vice President Al Gore and
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy to the Balkans. They
had met several times when Chernomyrdin was still prime minister in
what became a prime channel of U.S.-Russian communication.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke twice by telephone during the following week, with
Gore repeating the NATO position and Chernomyrdin replying that
Milosevic was unbending in his resistance to the occupation of
Kosovo by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   With matters at a standstill, Yeltsin called Clinton again on
Sunday, May 2, telling the president that he wanted to send his
envoy to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would be happy to receive him, and did so the
next day. Chernomyrdin met for 90 minutes in the Oval Office with
the president and his foreign policy team, and then traveled the
three miles to Gore's official residence on Embassy Row.
</P>
<P>
   That evening Chernomyrdin and his small delegation spent three
hours with Gore; Sandy Berger, the national security adviser;
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott; and Leon Fuerth, Gore's
top foreign policy aide. Little progress was made, but the door was
left open for new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 the next morning, the Russians called Gore's staff.
Chernomyrdin wanted to meet for breakfast. He had a new idea.
</P>
<P>
   Over muffins at Gore's house, Chernomyrdin proposed a team of
himself and someone who would both be acceptable to Milosevic and
trusted implicitly by NATO. The idea excited the White House team,
which that morning had been joined by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. ``I thought it was good to come at Milosevic from two
angles,'' Albright recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Someone suggested Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, but
Albright quickly vetoed that idea. She had another name: Martti
Ahtisaari, the president of Finland, a patient negotiator who had
worked 13 years for a peace in Namibia and who for years had urged
Europe to be patient with Russia. As the leader of a neutral
nation, he could meet with Milosevic and, according to a senior
administration official, Albright trusted him not to weaken or
compromise on NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voht!'' Chernomyrdin replied in Russian. ``That's it!''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, after Ahtisaari was persuaded to come on
board, the State Department devised what it called a
``double-magnet strategy'' with the Russian and the Finn.
</P>
<P>
   As an administration official put it, ``They bring the Russians
closer to us and in turn bring the Serbs closer to a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement suited the Russians, who had warned that they
would never serve as a mere ``postman'' for NATO's demands.
Chernomyrdin could play good cop in negotiating with Milosevic,
setting down general principles of peace, while Ahtisaari, the bad
cop, could insist on the unpalatable details of surrendering Kosovo
to a NATO-controlled force.
</P>
<P>
   Albright busied herself stamping out what she called ``envoy
envy.'' To that end, she made scores of phone calls _ to the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, to members of Congress, to Czech and Greek leaders _
demanding that they stay out of Belgrade. Her aides say she was
determined not to let Milosevic play envoys off against one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Also in early May, Germany's cultivation of the Russians paid
off. At a Bonn meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations,
plus Russia, the first joint statement about ending the conflict in
Kosovo was issued.
</P>
<P>
   It was extremely vague on all the most contentious issues,
particularly NATO command of a peacekeeping force, but its
political message was clear: The Americans, the Europeans and the
Russians were trying to work together. In this sense, it amounted
to a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   To hammer out the wording of the peace agreement, Talbott, the
State Department's senior expert on Russia, met with Chernomyrdin
and Ahtisaari four times in marathon negotiating sessions. In these
and other meetings, whenever Chernomyrdin persuaded Talbott to
change the wording of the peace deal, he would ask, in Russian:
``What about Mother Boss? Will she be OK with this?''
</P>
<P>
   (He was referring to Albright, who said Chernomyrdin never
called her ``Mother Boss'' to her face, but only in reference to
her when he was negotiating with Talbott.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first marathon session was at the official residence of the
Finnish president in Helsinki. Two sessions were held on the
grounds of Stalin's dacha outside Moscow, and the final one took
place over the first two days of June near Bonn, at the Petersberg,
a palatial former government guest house.
</P>
<P>
   This meeting was the longest and most fraught. Working out a
two-page, take-it-or-leave-it peace plan took until 4 a.m. on
Tuesday and much of Wednesday, until the hour when the negotiating
duo was scheduled to leave for Belgrade. The trickiest part was
persuading Chernomyrdin to accept the NATO conditions _ referred to
by Talbott as the ``family jewels'' _ in front of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Chernomyrdin was heading off for his fifth trip
to see Milosevic and he did not want to leave Belgrade with only
``jaw jaw'' as the result, one U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   After a dinner with Chernomyrdin, Ahtisaari and their host, the
German chancellor, Talbott slipped away to talk to Berger and
Albright. He then proposed a footnote to the document that was
being prepared for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The footnote spelled out demands that the Russians had been
resisting for weeks: NATO command and control of the peacekeeping
force with control of the operation in the hands of the North
Atlantic Council, the chief decision-making body of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The footnote allowed NATO to make its demands without Russia
having to formally endorse them, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin pledged not to argue when the document was
presented.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the Russian envoy promised to remain silent
when the Finnish president told Milosevic that if he did not accept
the conditions, the demands would only get more stringent as the
war wound on, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   When the negotiators met with Milosevic in Belgrade on Wednesday
night and Thursday morning, they found him ``serious and calm,''
according to a U.S. official. ``He did not seem under excessive
stress, as Chernomyrdin had reported from his previous visit,'' the
official added.
</P>
<P>
   The two visitors immediately set the ground rules. They were
mediators, not negotiators. They explained the document. As they
had expected, Milosevic asked if there could be revisions.
</P>
<P>
   He was told, flatly, no.
</P>
<P>
   In the first sign of acquiescence, Milosevic told them he would
send the document to his Parliament for approval. In an odd effort
to create more cover for himself, Milosevic invited Ahtisaari to
address the Parliament; Ahtisaari declined.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Milosevic appeared to be more agitated and his
military chiefs looked fairly distraught, Ahtisaari later reported.
Milosevic opened the meeting with a rendition of the importance of
Kosovo to the Serbs, and as he was nearing the end, Ahtisaari
interrupted and asked Milosevic what he was going to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb replied, according to an American, ``We accept your
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   To seal the deal, the Yugoslavs were given the telephone number
of Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, along with several other
numbers at NATO. They were told that they should call one of the
numbers to begin the military negotiations. No mention was made at
the meetings of Milosevic's indictment on charges of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators then flew to Cologne, Germany, on Thursday to
brief Talbott and the heads of the European Union who were meeting
there. Later that day, Talbott went to the North Atlantic Council
in Brussels, Belgium, to brief the 19 NATO ambassadors. The meeting
started at 8:30 p.m., and when Clark walked into the room about 30
minutes later, he announced that he had just received a call from
the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs, according to Clark, suggested that they have
their first meeting on Sunday to work out precise details of the
Serbian withdrawal. Clark reminded them that the bombing would
continue until there was a verifiable withdrawal of their troops.
``How's Saturday morning?'' the Yugoslavs replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a plan, a strategy, a concept with regard to the
Russians,'' Talbott said on Friday. ``What happened this week has
played out impeccably.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in Belgrade, Milosevic was eager to cut a deal. Weeks
before, he had started to prepare the public for a political
solution as early as the first week of May. That it took another
month may have been a result less of his unwillingness to make a
deal than of the West's slowness to grasp that he was serious.
</P>
<P>
   The signs were everywhere. The visit of Jackson, during which
Belgrade handed over the three U.S. soldiers, was shown endlessly
on Belgrade television, complete with praise for Jackson's calls
for peace and for an end to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   All of Chernomyrdin's visits were given broad coverage, as the
state-controlled press abruptly shifted from obsessive coverage of
NATO bomb damage to an emphasis on diplomatic progress. The two top
generals in charge of the operation in Kosovo went to Belgrade to
report to Milosevic that their work was done. The Kosovo Liberation
Army, they said, had been routed, and the sovereignty of Kosovo was
assured.
</P>
<P>
   The propaganda machine that had aroused public opinion for war
in Kosovo began heralding the end of the military campaign and
preparing Serbs for a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic reportedly prepared a major announcement of a troop
withdrawal on May 9, a day when Chernomyrdin was due to visit
Belgrade. But the Russian envoy did not come and the announcement
the next day was downplayed, while being dismissed in the West.
When Chernomyrdin delayed his trip for a whole week, he was
criticized sharply in the official newspaper, Politika, a sign of
Milosevic's displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Milosevic appears to have decided that months of
bombing were more likely than ground troops and that there was
little to be gained from enduring it. Belgrade analysts and
diplomats believe that Milosevic calculated that peace was better
suited to his personal survival than war.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombing had even started, there were whispers in
Belgrade that Kosovo would be lost after a war that cost the Serbs
dearly. It had happened twice before, in the former Yugoslav
republics of Croatia and Bosnia, when Milosevic abandoned the Serbs
there.
</P>
<P>
   In an uncanny bit of prophecy before NATO's bombing campaign
began, a Belgrade journalist, Bratislav Grubasic of the VIP news
agency, described Milosevic as a realist who knew it would be
better for the people of Serbia to cut a deal in Kosovo before
bombs fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is not his way,'' Grubasic said. ``Milosevic's way is
to stretch it out, make it as messy and nasty as possible, and then
still lose it.''

<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Charismatic, standing on the threshold of
sweeping the Triple Crown, missed his date with history Saturday
when he ran third in the Belmont Stakes behind the long shot Lemon
Drop Kid. And worse, as Charismatic chased the winner across the
finish line, he sustained a cracked bone in his left front ankle
that brought a stunning end to an otherwise memorable day at
Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid, ninth in the Kentucky Derby while Charismatic
was winning it at odds of 31-1, skipped the Preakness but came
roaring back in the Belmont Stakes, ridden by Jose Santos. In a
furious rush through the homestretch, he won his first race since
February, scoring by a head over an even longer shot, Vision and
Verse, and ended the dramatic saga of Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke down right after we crossed the wire,'' said Chris
Antley, who rode Charismatic in all three of the Triple Crown
races. ``He gave us a lot. He gave America a lot. But I think he'll
be OK The game goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic's defeat was dramatic enough. It marked the third
straight year that a horse had stood on the edge of completing his
sweep of the Triple Crown, only to miss narrowly in the Belmont.
But this time, said Bob Lewis, who owns Charismatic, ``We're
devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley dismounted just after the finish line and Charismatic was
attended to on the track for five minutes before being taken away
in a horse ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Bramlage, a veterinarian from Lexington, Ky., reported
immediately after the race: ``The veterinarians on the track say he
may have cracked a bone in his ankle. They put a splint on it, and
he seems to be handling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday was in the hunt until the quarter pole, but
faded to seventh in her bid to become the first filly to win the
Belmont since 1905.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid, who is trained by Scotty Schulhofer, ran the
mile and 1/2 in 2:27 4/5 and paid $61.50 for a $2 bet to win, the
third-highest payoff in Belmont history.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic took his shot at racing history on a resplendently
clear and sunny afternoon with a huge crowd jamming Belmont Park
with great expectations. The Yankees were playing the Mets in
Yankee Stadium and the Knicks were playing the Indiana Pacers in
Madison Square Garden on a day to remember in New York sports. But
at Belmont, the Triple Crown was on the line, one more time.
</P>
<P>
   This was the culmination of the saga that Charismatic had spun
beginning in February, when he ran in a claiming race for $62,500
at Santa Anita and was ignored. Since then, he raced from rags to
riches: fourth in the Santa Anita Derby on April 3, first in the
Lexington Stakes on April 18 with a record-setting performance,
first in the Kentucky Derby on May 1, first in the Preakness Stakes
on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might overlook this horse, but at your own peril,'' said
his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, who confessed that he, too, had been
fooled by the colt. ``He has improved every time, and he is
legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas had won 12 Triple Crown races going into his day of days,
including six in a row at one point, but he had never swept the
series with one horse.
</P>
<P>
   And he acknowledged that the odds against Charismatic were long:
Only 11 horses had swept the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the
Belmont, three stakes within five weeks at three tracks with three
different surfaces and dimensions, and at three different
distances.
</P>
<P>
   The last to succeed was Affirmed in 1978; since then, no horse
had managed to sweep the series. Six horses had won the Derby and
Preakness but failed in the Belmont since then, two in the last two
years, both trained by Bob Baffert. In 1997, Baffert lost the
Triple Crown when Silver Charm was beaten in the final yards by
Touch Gold, and last year he lost again when Real Quiet was edged
out by a nose by Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way in this year's classics, some prized thoroughbreds
fell by the wayside in the rush to glory: notably Exploit, Vicar,
Cat Thief, General Challenge and Prime Timber. &QL;

OFFICIALLY, A FATHER-SON SUICIDE, BUT MOBSTER'S DEATH STIRS
DOUBTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN FEUER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SADDLE BROOK, N.J. _ There was no note, no sign of illness or
depression, and no apparent motive for suicide. But there was a
folding chair kicked over on the floor, a half-empty bottle of
Johnnie Walker Red nearby and two bodies _ one of them a convicted
gangster _ hanging from a ceiling beam.
</P>
<P>
   It is the type of mystery that mob buffs live for, an aging
wiseguy found dead with his dead son dangling at his side, a
curious brew of suicide and organized crime that many law
enforcement officials are saying just does not feel right.
</P>
<P>
   The story began May 21 when a Saddle Brook police dispatcher
received a frantic phone call from a young woman saying that her
father, Giovanni Ligammari, 60, and her brother, Pietro, 37, had
hanged themselves, face-to-face, in separate nooses, with nylon
packing cord from the basement rafters of the elder man's
two-family home in this affluent Bergen County suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni Ligammari was a known figure in organized crime, having
been found guilty of racketeering and conspiracy charges in 1987 in
the so-called Pizza Connection case, in which 31 men were charged
with running a heroin ring from several New York pizza shops. But
his death was ruled a suicide, and the case was officially closed
after a brief investigation, during which his widow and daughter
were never interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the news of the deaths, cynical shop talk
started as veteran organized-crime investigators from as far away
as Rome began clucking their tongues at whether the salty old
Sicilian and his son had really killed themselves. Was it suicide
or something darker? For the moment, not many people are sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smells,'' said one veteran FBI agent who worked on the case
and agreed to speak only if his name was withheld. ``It just
doesn't jibe at all, you know? And I'm not normally a doubting
Thomas. But on this one I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Run down a list of possible motives for suicide and those who
knew the Ligammaris will say that none of them applied.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Ligammari lived a quiet pensioner's life in Saddle
Brook, collecting Social Security and drawing income from renting
out the second floor of his well-appointed home, said Frank
Lucianna, his longtime friend and lawyer. He was not poor, not
depressed and, according to the Saddle Brook Police Department, no
longer involved in crime.
</P>
<P>
   In his 40s and 50s, Ligammari was associated with the Bonanno
crime family, the federal authorities said, but was a minor player
in the Pizza Connection case, one of several investors who put up
money for the heroin ring.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered greatly, both physically and emotionally, during
the eight years he spent in federal prison and got out in 1995, a
troubled man, Lucianna said. But, he added, Ligammari seemed to
have left the painful memories of prison life behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was that hardy, old, tough-guy type from the mountains of
Sicily,'' Lucianna said. ``They both were, and it disturbs the hell
out of me. If you told me John Gotti had committed suicide, I'd be
just as surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Pietro Ligammari lived in Massapequa, N.Y., where, by all
accounts, he led an uneventful life, Lucianna said. Ligammari was
married and had two children. He was never implicated in the Pizza
Connection case or any other crime.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man was under investigation by the federal authorities,
said the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey. And it was the
Manhattan office of the FBI, which helped prosecute the Pizza
Connection case, that initially looked into their deaths, rather
than the Newark office, only 20 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has left conspiracy theorists studying their
videotapes of ``Goodfellas'' and spinning sinister could-have-beens
late into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call the afternoon the bodies were discovered from one
of our old sources who said they'd actually been killed,'' said one
former prosecutor who worked on the Pizza Connection case. ``But
then I called an FBI guy I know, and he told me that the initial
report was a double suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way,'' he said, ``it's weird. Voluntary suicide or not.
Father and son? Very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in suicide agree. While they say that lovers will
sometimes kill themselves together and parents have been known to
kill their children and then themselves, double suicides involving
fathers and sons are exceedingly rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no other dual pact like this with a father and son,
none,'' said Dr. Andrew Slaby, a professor of clinical psychology
at New York University and a former president of the American
Association of Suicidology. ``It's a truly remarkable case,'' he
said, adding, ``if it's actually a suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Picture the scene, Slaby said: Father and son standing on the
same small chair, facing death, staring into each other's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To choose that mode of exodus,'' he said, ``would mean that
both of them would've had to create the noose and make the decision
to go at the exact same time. It's such a native thing in human
beings to preserve their children's lives that you would have to
posit that both were terribly, psychotically depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan office of the FBI closed its investigation once
the Bergen County Medical Examiner ruled the deaths a double
suicide, said spokesman Joseph Valiquette. And the Saddle Brook
police have never veered from their initial theory that the
Ligammaris killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a double hanging does seem a little far-fetched for a
typical gangland killing. Most mob hits are brazen, gory, public
affairs _ blood operas intended to make the point that next time it
could be you.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, over the last several years, a handful of fringe
characters from the Pizza Connection case have wound up dead.
Whether this is coincidence or a cold dish of revenge, law
enforcement officials who worked on the case have said they are
intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   The first to die was Edward Lino, 48, a reputed captain of the
Gambino crime family, who was pursued but never charged, said
federal prosecutors. He was found shot to death in Brooklyn in
1990, slumped over in the driver's seat of his black Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, police in Montreal discovered the body of
Joseph LoPresti, 44, a Canadian who was investigated as a financier
in the case but was also never charged. LoPresti was shot in the
head execution-style and his body was found wrapped in plastic
beside trash-strewn railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   In March, police in New York City found the body of Gerlando
Sciascia, yet a third man who was looked at in connection with the
case but never formally accused. Sciascia's body was discovered
lying on a sidewalk in the Bronx, fully clothed, with four bullets
pumped into the left side of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Giovanni Ligammari's name has been added to the list of
dead Pizza Connection alums. The veteran FBI agent who worked on
the case said Ligammari may have tried to re-enter the narcotics
trade and run afoul of its new leadership, although the agent
conceded there was no evidence to support this theory.
</P>
<P>
   Another agent from the case, who also spoke on the condition
that his name not be used, said the taint of death surrounding the
case should be chalked up to no more than the occupational hazards
of a career in organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the former prosecutor said the arrests in 1984 put on hold a
vicious internecine war, which could have heated up again now that
time had passed and defendants were slowly starting to get out of
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a group that had a lot of conflicts,'' he said. ``A
lot of people were very upset by this trial because they felt that
there were too many people compromised and too many trusted people
who gave out information.''
</P>
<P>
   While none of the dead men, including Ligammari, provided
information to the government, the agent said, the fact that some
of them were not indicted or went to prison only for short terms
could have been enough to anger the wrong people. ``There's clearly
something going on here that we don't understand,'' he added. ``But
whether it's something old or something new is definitely hard to
say.''

GRAF UPSETS PEEVISH HINGIS TO WIN FRENCH OPEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ On the verge of being undermined in a bizarre and
bad-spirited French Open final by Steffi Graf, a war horse she had
dismissed as being past her prime a year ago, top-seeded Martina
Hingis delivered an underhand serve on Graf's first match point
Saturday. The underhanded move won Hingis a temporary reprieve. But
it was only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, desperate to stay alive at the only Grand Slam
tournament she has never won and frazzled after blowing two chances
to serve for the title in the second set, tried the same tactic on
Graf's second match point. The move provoked a crescendo of hissing
from the crowd as she flubbed the serve and ran like a chastened
child to the chair umpire. When she complained that the crowd's
noise had made it impossible for her to deliver her trick serve,
Graf, hitherto immune to Hingis' histrionics, joined the
contretemps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we just play tennis, OK,'' snapped Graf. So they did, and
Graf, appearing in her ninth _ and last _ French Open final just
nine days before her 30th birthday, shocked Hingis with a 4-6, 7-5,
6-2 comeback victory. She thus captured her 22d slam singles
championship, an achievement that left her just two titles short of
Margaret Smith Court's record 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely the last time I play here,'' said Graf, who
also decided after 16 French Opens that this match was a worthy
retirement announcement, at least from the clay of Roland Garros.
``The memory should be the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   With Graf glaring at her from across the net, Hingis served a
conventional second service, a puff ball of a serve. Graf muscled
back a return that forced Hingis' parting error, a backhand that
looped beyond bounds 2 hours 25 minutes after the final, delayed an
hour by stormy weather, finally began.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels amazing; I feel French,'' said Graf about the warm
embrace she received from the same gallery that made Hingis feel
like an alien. ``This is by far the biggest, the most unexpected
win I've ever had. It was one of the craziest matches ever; it had
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It had a little too much crowd involvement for Hingis. ``A
miracle would have to happen for me to win that match,'' she said.
She had been unequal, she said, to the task of fighting Graf and
the fans. ``I let it get to me.'' In fact, Hingis was one reprimand
from a default after she received a racquet abuse warning and a
point penalty in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, instead of claiming the only missing link to her
slam resume, Hingis had to settle for being second best at the
French for the second time. Too, her record against Graf, the only
player to provoke humility in her, dropped to 0-4 in slams and 2-7
over all.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the top-ranked Swiss player vowed to return and
prove that Roland Garros, an event she won in the juniors as a
12-year-old, belongs in her slam collection. ``I don't give up
until I have this one also,'' said Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   But she did give up Saturday, once she trailed by 3-0 in the
third set. ``At this stage I had nothing to play,'' Hingis said,
``she was too strong.''
</P>
<P>
   As Graf raised her arms in celebration, Hingis gathered her
gear, left the court in tears, and had to be dragged back by her
mother and coach, Melanie Molitor, to the awards presentation.
Hingis later said she wouldn't have come back if her mother hadn't
been there to make her observe loser's protocol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in anything else like that ever before,'' Graf
said about the odd twists and turns of this final, which featured
various bursts of petulance and insubordination and ended with both
combatants in tears.
</P>
<P>
   All smiles when the match began, Hingis allowed her mental
circuitry to go haywire in the middle set. Rattled that she not
only lost the second set but had to listen to derisive hoots from
14,000 Graf-loving center court fans, she suffered a meltdown
against the impassive Graf. Up 3-2 in the second set, she proceeded
to lose six straight games before holding for 1-3 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The querulous tone of the match was reflected early on. Hingis,
after taking a 2-0 second-set lead, tried to make the officials pay
for their mistake when they called a forehand drive long in the
next game. Hingis stared in disbelief when her down-the-line
forehand was ruled out, stamped her feet when the chair umpire,
Anne Lasserre, checked the mark and agreed with the call, and
crossed over to Graf's side of the court, a territorial taboo, to
reinforce her cause. Hingis not only lost the point, she was
penalized a point for venturing into her opponent's domain.
</P>
<P>
   Already running a distant second in the crowd's sympathies,
Hingis' behavior was met with a cascade of boos, jeers and
whistles. The partisanship unsettled her as the set wore on and
Graf coolly fought her way back into the match.
</P>
<P>
   Graf held for 4-3 and almost gained a break point for 5-3 on a
wildly improvisational point where both players scrambled between
the net and the baseline. But Graf, after sending a forehand lob to
the baseline, turned what should have been a point-ending overhead
tap into a netted overhead heartbreaker. Hingis won the game, and
then broke Graf with another of her patented down-the-line backhand
arrows to go up 5-4. Now, she had the chance to serve for her first
French Open title _ and sixth Grand Slam title over all.
</P>
<P>
   But Graf wasn't in the mood to give away a championship, not at
this sunset stage of her career, and she broke the teen-ager to
level at 5-5. The German held for 6-5, and with a faint smile on
her face as she watched a Hingis forehand veer wide of the
sideline, she broke Hingis again to claim the second set, 7-5, and
even the match.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the villain proved so stressful to Hingis that she
requested a third-set bathroom break at 0-1 in order to change her
clothes, her hair and her attitude. But Graf's momentum remained
unchanged, and a 22d Grand Slam crown all but hovered above her
head as Hingis faded and faltered.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena Williams, seeded ninth, reached their first
Grand Slam doubles final as a team Saturday with a 6-4, 6-1
demolition of 12th-seeded Lindsay Davenport and Mary Pierce,
becoming the third set of sisters to contest a women's doubles
final at a slam. They meet second-seeded Martina Hingis and Anna
Kournikova in the final on Sunday. ... Peter Graf, who had taken a
distant position in his daughter's life even before he spent 15
months in jail on tax evasion charges, was in attendance at a
tournament for the first time in five years but did not sit in the
friends' box with Graf's mother, Heidi, and her coach, Heinz
Gunthardt.  &QL;

OLIVIER DEBRE, ABSTRACT PAINTER, DIES AT 79  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Olivier Debre, one of France's best-known abstract
painters of the postwar era, whose large-format works include the
stage curtain at the Comedie Francaise, died here on Tuesday. He
was 79 and lived in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Debre's form of abstract art, which he described as ``opposite
to the geometric abstraction of the Cubism of Cezanne and
Picasso,'' involved daring splashes of color applied with thick
brush strokes intended to create a mood of sensuality and poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, painting and emotion are inseparable,'' he said at the
time of his last major retrospective in Paris, in 1995 at the
Galerie du Jeu de Paume on the Place de la Concorde. ``I can only
paint with feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann
and former Culture Minister Jack Lang were among those paying
homage to Debre today. ``Rigorous, passionate, demanding, he paved
the way toward abstraction,'' Chirac said. ``His desire to convey
his message made him a great teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Debre was born in Paris into a prosperous professional family
(his brother, Michel, became prime minister under President de
Gaulle), and showed an early interest in art and architecture,
studying briefly under Le Corbusier in 1939. He held shows of his
paintings in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1940 and 1941 and in 1942
became part of Picasso's entourage.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he struck out on his own, forming part of a new
generation of School of Paris painters, who included Pierre
Soulages, Nicolas de Stael, Serge Poliakoff and Maria Elena Vieira
da Silva. He began experimenting with large-format paintings and
developed a fascination with space.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me painting is nothing more than time and color turned
into space,'' he wrote in an essay called ``Space Imagined, Space
Created.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to evoke emotion through abstraction, he created what he
called ``signes-personnages'' (figurative signs) and
``signes-paysages'' (landscape signs) that seemed to hint at
recognizable forms. He used this approach in the monumental works
for which he became most celebrated, starting with the vast
ornamental paintings he did for the French pavilions at World's
Fairs in Montreal in 1967 and in Osaka, Japan, in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s and '90s he decorated the stage curtains not only
of the Comedie Francaise but also of the Hong Kong Opera, the new
Shanghai Opera and the Theatre des Abbesses in Paris. In 1997 he
also designed the decor and costumes for a ballet by Carolyn
Carlson presented at the Bastille Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Debre is survived by his wife, Denise; a son, Patrice, and a
daughter, Sylvie.

REAL ESTATE: AS NEW YORK BUILDINGS RISE, SO DO THEIR RENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN S. OSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Money was not the main problem for Andre Abucham, a
23-year-old from Brazil, when he went apartment shopping in
Manhattan a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is working in a training program at Salomon Smith
Barney for under $30,000 a year, Abucham was able to rent a
one-bedroom midtown apartment at the Sheffield on 57th Street off
Eighth Avenue for $3,000 a month. His father, who owns a civil
engineering company in Sao Paulo, is helping with the rent.
</P>
<P>
   If builders had to rely on parental largesse to help tenants
rent in any of the new luxury buildings rising in midtown Manhattan
these days, the renting process would be slow indeed. But they do
benefit from the prevalence of two-income households when they seek
rents that stretch the levels previously obtained in the locations
of some of the new projects.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation that it can attract higher-income professionals
has entered into the calculations of Rose Associates in launching a
residential project called the Madison Belvedere, a building that
is a departure for its immediate neighborhood in size as well as
market ambition. It is a 48-story tower in the middle of the block
between 29th and 28th Streets, east of Fifth Avenue. The entrance
will be on 29th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a transitional neighborhood between the Flatiron
District and midtown,'' said Rose Associates president Adam Rose.
He said he refers to it facetiously as NoFlaWeMu (north of the
Flatiron District and west of Murray Hill). ``We believe it will
eventually fill in with other new buildings,'' he said. Commercial
brokers would call the area the Midtown South office district, and
in fact office growth has helped give zip to the residential
market.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Associates has already found that it is getting rents
averaging $47 a square foot per year (about $2,450 to $2,750 a
month for a one-bedroom apartment) upon vacancy for the handful of
rental apartments it still owns a few blocks away at Madison Green,
the condominium it built in 1983 in what was then the untested
market at 23rd Street off Madison Square Park, now called the
Flatiron District.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the company will go on the market at $47 to $48 a
square foot at the Madison Belvedere in July. Bringing in a
``high-end'' apartment with expensive finishes, Rose will offer
one-bedroom apartments in a rental range of $2,400 to $3,200 a
month. The one-bedrooms _ in six varieties, with and without
balconies _ account for 54 percent of the apartments. The 79
two-bedroom apartments will rent from $3,800 to $5,500 a month, and
the 99 studios from $1,850 to $2,350.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Associates is by no means alone in the '90s in finding a
slightly offbeat location for a new residential building and then
attempting to demonstrate that it can command rents that are higher
than the norm in the area.
</P>
<P>
   With the healthy economic climate that has prevailed over the
last few years accompanied by a strong stock market, the developers
have been successful so far. Yet there are voices of caution as the
inventory of new buildings reaches the market in a steady flow, and
price resistance is reported by management groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Zucker Organization has made a specialty of choosing
locations where major builders have not ventured. Two recent
examples are Soho Court, at Elizabeth and Houston Street, which
came on the market three years ago, and CD 280, on East Second
Street between Avenues C and D.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company has gone into construction in another unusual
location, Broadway between Worth Street and Catherine Lane, two
blocks north of Chambers Street. It will be a 16-story building
with 147 apartments plus stores, and a parking garage for 114 cars,
for which a special permit was obtained. The main entrance will be
on Worth Street. Renting will start in February or March, with
occupancy in 10 or 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The percentage of people who can afford to pay $45 a square
foot is very small,'' said Donald Zucker, principal in the company.
``Once you're down to $40, apartments are like hen's teeth.'' At
$45 a square foot a year, a typical one-bedroom, with 700 square
feet of space, would rent for $2,650 a month. At $40 a square foot,
it would rent for $2,300 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of new buildings coming on the market,''
Zucker said. ``We may get back to the point where we're selling
condominiums again.'' Selling rather than renting is a last resort
for an investment building company, whose business is to hold
property longterm and build up equity for future projects. But in
an overbuilt market, it is the path many builders take.
</P>
<P>
   The Brodsky Organization concentrated on the Lincoln Center area
when it began building a large inventory of rental apartments. Now
it runs a total of 2,200 rentals in four properties in the area.
Its latest midtown project is One Columbus Place, with 729
apartments in two towers that share a large lobby, between 58th and
59th Streets at Ninth Avenue. It opened in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Rotkoff, director of leasing for the Brodsky Organization,
said she handled about 400 re-rentals a year in Brodsky buildings.
Typical rents for a vacancy at present are about $1,800 for a
studio apartment, $2,450 for a one-bedroom and $3,900 for a
two-bedroom. It works out to about $41 a square foot a year. At One
Columbus Place rents are somewhat higher, but ``it's hard to get
$45 a foot,'' Ms. Rotkoff said.
</P>
<P>
   In another location, the Resnick Organization said that it
completed the rent-up of the 440 market-rate apartments in the
Gershwin, at Eighth Avenue and 50th Street, only this month. The
process took 11 months and the average rent is $45 a square foot
per year, said Scott Resnick, executive managing director. ``We
have a substantial percentage of singles with incomes over
$100,000,'' Resnick said.
</P>
<P>
   And Glenwood Management, builder of the recently completed
Paramount Tower at 240 E. 39th St., says that its 464 apartments
were ``99 percent rented'' as of May, seven months after the rental
program began. Apartments tend to be larger on average than in most
new luxury buildings, so that rents, which the company says have
averaged $46 a square foot per year, tend to be higher on a dollar
basis per apartment than in most other new buildings in east or
west midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Most rents ranged from $2,800 to $5,000 a month, said Gary
Jacob, executive vice president of Glenwood Management, and most
tenants have incomes between $150,000 and $250,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Figures worked up by the Real Estate Board of New York in May
show that there are 4,000 new market-rate apartments under
construction in Manhattan for completion this year, the highest
figure since 1989, when there were 4,248 completions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got 4,000 luxury rental apartments coming on the
market, you of course have got to be a little bit concerned whether
you're going to find all the tenants you need to rent them out,''
said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, the tenant of a one-bedroom apartment renting at
$45 a square foot a year ($2,625 a month for 700 square feet)
probably should have an income of at least $150,000 a year, Spinola
said. This is a recommended rent-to-income ratio of about 21
percent, far lower than the standard 30 percent used elsewhere in
the country but an acknowledgment that Manhattan living, housing
costs aside, is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stretch,'' conceded Margaret Kuczynski, who moved in
January with her husband, Edward, and two children _ Justin, 17,
and Alena, 11 _ into a $2,850-a-month apartment at Le Rivage, Rose
Associates' reconstruction of a former office building at 21 West
St. in lower Manhattan. ``But we've been so transient until now
that I hope I die here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kuczynski and her husband, a medical researcher in
obstetrics and gynecology at New York University, had been living
part-time in a Manhattan rental for four years before they moved to
West Street. It took them two and a half years to sell a house they
owned in Coconut Grove, Fla., where they lived when Dr. Kuczynski
was working in Florida in the early '90s. The family has joined a
home-school group to educate their children at home in cooperation
with educators and other parents.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 West St. apartments are generally larger than Rose's
midtown apartments, and they also have unusually high ceilings.
Prices are considerably lower on a square-foot basis than they are
in midtown, reflecting both competition from other buildings and
the deep tax abatement that the city put in effect to stimulate
residential conversions of obsolete office buildings in the
financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Apartments at Le Rivage went on the market last year at about
$35 a square foot a year ($2,550 for a 900-square-foot one-bedroom
and $3,650 for a 1,150-square-foot two-bedroom), and rose to $37 a
square foot toward the end of the nine-month renting period ($2,700
for the one-bedroom and $3,850 for the two-bedroom), Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial standards that new renters must meet reflect the
developers' sensitivity to the affordability issue. Besides needing
a good credit record, incoming tenants generally must show an
annual income of anywhere from 40 to 50 times the monthly rent,
with different managements holding to different standards. Rose
Associates is using the 48 multiple, said Jack Levy, senior
managing director for rentals and sales.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the renter of a $2,745-a-month 725-square-foot
one bedroom on the 30th floor of the Madison Belvedere, for
example, would have to show an annual income of $130,000. To rent a
1,250-square-foot two-bedroom apartment on the 42d floor for $5,075
a month would require an income of $243,000.
</P>
<P>
   Levy presides as rental director over an inventory of 3,000 Rose
Associates apartments, and witnesses a turnover of about 600
apartments a year. Almost all the new renters of two-bedroom
apartments have incomes over $180,000 a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, almost all the new renters come in as free-market
rather than rent-stabilized tenants, usually because the building's
10-year Section 421a tax abatement has already expired. In pre-1985
Section 421a buildings, apartments are deregulated when the
regulated tenant moves out. In post-1985 Section 421a buildings,
apartments are deregulated after 10 years even with the regulated
tenant in place.
</P>
<P>
   In buildings that were converted to co-ops or condominiums, all
rental apartments are decontrolled after a vacancy, and in
pure-rental buildings they are decontrolled if the first rent after
vacancy exceeds $2,000. Two-thirds of the Rose Associates rental
inventory is now free market, and one-third remains
rent-stabilized, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   On average, 20 percent of the free-market apartments become
vacant every year, and probably three-quarters of the re-rentals
each year are of apartments that were already deregulated before
the vacancy. ``People's lives change,'' Levy said. ``Some people
are sharing and they later want their own home. Other people decide
to buy an apartment, or a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the issue of affordability, the Madison Belvedere
represents architecturally a style of building that is gradually
being phased out in Manhattan _ the straight tower behind a
street-level plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The Madison Belvedere is on a 21,000-square-foot lot in a zone
that with no bonuses would have allowed only 220,000 square feet of
construction on the building lot itself. But the project got a
bonus for its 12,700-square-foot public plaza (though not the full
20 percent that zoning allows, since that large a plaza was
impractical) and also additional development rights from
neighboring properties _ the Carlton Hotel and two other buildings.
It also got a bonus of 9,300 square feet for including four
apartments for low-income tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting 48-story project has 348,000 gross square feet of
space and is built to a floor-area ratio, or FAR, of 11 on its
zoning lot, less than the 12 FAR allowable. The floor-area ratio of
the project to the property on which it stands, however, is 16.6.
</P>
<P>
   The architect is the firm of Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron,
with James Davison, a senior partner, as design architect. The
building's landscaped public plaza, facing 28th Street, has been
designed by Thomas Balsley of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the last of its genre,'' said Davison. The ``tower
in the park'' style, in conjunction with unrestricted transfers of
development rights from adjacent lots, sometimes lends itself well
to extremely tall buildings, sometimes resembling an intruder in
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The tallest of all has gone into construction on First Avenue
between 47th to 48th Streets north of the United Nations complex.
The Trump Organization is building a condominium there that is to
be 861 feet tall to the top of its squared-off superstructure. It
will have 72 floors, many of them with ceiling heights of 10 or 13
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission (and Adam
Rose's cousin), alluded to this project in a speech last April in
which he condemned the ``trail of exceptions, caveats and
interpretive gymnastics'' that tower-in-the-park zoning had
spawned. He said that a new set of bulk regulations would soon be
proposed to respond to this problem, while still allowing zoning to
provide for growth and change.
</P>
<P>
   The Madison Belvedere will be 454 feet tall from street level to
the main roof (and 554 feet to the top of its decorative crown).
Among new buildings at or near completion, only Glenwood
Management's Paramount Tower is in its height class. It is 51
stories high _ 526 feet to the main roof and 567 feet to the top of
its superstructure. For zoning purposes, ``height of the building''
traditionally means the height to the main roof.
</P>
<P>
   For Rose Associates, the $150 million Madison Belvedere marks
another step in what might be called an overhaul of the residential
inventory. The company undertook a major co-op conversion program
in the early '90s, converting nine buildings and selling, in the
first two years, about 600 apartments for about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion effort required new investment in old buildings
and ultimately cost as much as it brought in during those years,
said Rose, who led the campaign with his cousin Amy Rose, a
managing director of the company. Rose Associates has kept the
management of all these buildings, even though they are now
controlled by the residents. It has continued to sell
renter-occupied apartments upon vacancy of a regulated tenant, but
still holds 900 apartments in these buildings. ``The cash flow from
our ongoing sales fuels our new development,'' said Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, 40, succeeded his uncle, Daniel Rose, now vice chairman of
the company, as president last December. His father, Frederick
Rose, continues as chairman, taking a hands-on role in new
construction.

HOME COOKING HELPS KEEP KANSAS TOWN ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOLDIER, Kan. _ The sign set up in the middle of Main Street
here had a simple, chalked message:
</P>
<P>
   MEMORIAL MEALS
</P>
<P>
   8 - 4
</P>
<P>
   FREE WILL
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, on Memorial Day weekend, that sign, the 600
people it drew and the resultant profit accounted for about 6
percent of this town's annual budget -- $1,500 added to $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's comparable to Kansas City, Mo., with its $881 million
yearly budget, having citizens pass the hat for about $52 million
and hand it over with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   But then this was Soldier, population 200, and semifamous
hereabouts for the victuals it offers up on Memorial Day weekend at
its white-painted community center.
</P>
<P>
   The food? All you wanted. Chili dogs and sandwiches, salads and
fruits, cinnamon rolls and cookies, and lemonade, coffee and tea.
Plus tables covered with pies and cakes. Name a kind and it was
there.
</P>
<P>
   The cost? Those eating decided. That was what ``free will''
meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one man come in who'd brought a whole flock of people,
'' said Lena Baxter, who helps put on the get-together. ``He left
$150. Said it was a bargain at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one year we had a whole bunch of bikers. Nice folks.
Happy to have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, from as far away as Nebraska; Wichita, Kan.; Kansas City,
Mo.; and Oklahoma, leave $5 or $10 and go away more than satisfied.
Little wonder. It's all home cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Soldier's growing renown as a gastronomic destination started in
1981 when Karl Biester died. Biester had loved the little city park
next to the community hall. Members of a women's civic group called
the Soldieretta Unit decided to help his widow, Lucile Biester,
raise money for a modest shelter house with a table where people
could visit, maybe have a picnic, get out of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that started it,'' said Baxter. ``That first year we just
made a few hundred dollars. But that was enough. We got it built.''
</P>
<P>
   That shelter became a catalyst. Pretty soon another civic
organization, the So and So Club, was involved. Then the Lions
Club. People found out they could do something.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Lynn Reschick, a farmer who calls Soldier ``a Walton
kind of place,'' it was about time. That there was anybody left at
all in Soldier as the 20th century entered its last decades seemed
to defy common sense.
</P>
<P>
   In 1874, grasshoppers denuded the crops. In 1883, a tornado
ripped the town to shreds. In 1915, a disastrous flood on nearby
Soldier Creek ravaged the town. In 1934, a fire set by a faulty
kerosene stove consumed all but two or three businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it was some fire,'' said Henry Pugh, now 86. ``Burned down
almost the whole town. Both sides of Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the bank shutting its doors during the Depression,
young people leaving for big cities, the old Kansas Central
Railroad abandoning its tracks, and the closing of the schools with
consolidation in 1969, and what was left in Soldier was a
tavern/lunch counter, a feed store and a post office.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, said Reschick, the two churches -- Methodist and Christian
-- that have always been here.
</P>
<P>
   Right from the first, those planning the meals had noticed
something about Memorial Day or, as some still call it, Decoration
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Every year people came back to Soldier and the surrounding
communities -- Delia, Bucks Grove, Circleville, Whiting and
Netawaka -- to tend the graves in a half-dozen little cemeteries
where their loved ones are.
</P>
<P>
   Not just a few came -- hundreds showed up.
</P>
<P>
   They brought flowers. Decorating the graves would start Thursday
and proceed through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That custom is still alive in 1999. The Soldier cemetery last
weekend was carpeted with flowers from one end to another. It
looked like a kaleidoscope.
</P>
<P>
   And while some who came were young, the majority were middle-age
and older. Some used canes; a few needed walkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we had all these people coming home,'' said Baxter, whose
husband ran Soldier's long-departed gas station for years. ``They
needed something to eat. And what they really needed was a place
with facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the restaurant and tavern, but it's not open on
holidays. And Holton is 17 miles. People want to stay here, you
know, to visit, to see people they haven't talked to in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we thought, why not have food and raise some money?''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the 1934 fire played a part. When Soldier's City Hall
burned, there was a modicum of insurance money. With it and what
other money could be scraped up, residents built a large community
hall that could double as a place for City Council meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Architecturally, the building on the east side of Main was
undistinguished -- flat-fronted, plain, but it was amazingly deep.
There was lots of room inside, perfect for a sit-down dinner and a
hedge against bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   The flooring was hardwood, a seeming extravagance now but an
absolute necessity in the mid-1930s. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``People went to dances then,'' Pugh said. ``That was what we
did for entertainment. I remember the Saturday afternoon we
finished, and the floor on one side still lacked about a foot of
meeting the wall. Didn't matter; we had a big dance that night
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, with the passage of more than half a century,
the community hall showed some wear and tear. Its rehabilitation
became the focus of those putting on the Memorial Day meals.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the hall has been rewired,
air-conditioned and painted; a new furnace was installed; and the
restrooms were redone. That may not sound like much for big-city
people, said Baxter, but without the meals it wouldn't have been
done at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is amazing,'' said Ida Nadeau, Soldier's
mayor. ``I'm a very organized person. Everything has to be
scheduled, planned for and figured out in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the meals, they're running around, asking who's going to
do this and who'll bring that, who'll be behind the counter and how
many pies do they need. It goes on like that right up to the edge,
and then you're sure it'll be a disaster. And then, somehow, it all
falls into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau said that besides the money raised for the town, always a
worry in rural Kansas, the Memorial Day activity kept the residents
on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just down from here we had a lot with a building on it that
was falling down, just a ruin,'' she said. ``That was two years
ago, and people who came for Memorial Day noticed. Didn't complain.
But there was talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we'd gotten the building torn down, but the lot
still looked raw. People noticed that, too. This year the lot is
all cleaned up and graded, and people have really said how nice the
town looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau says those who come back don't exert pressure. But, she
adds, there's a certain truth in the old saw about how people seem
to spiff things up when company is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if they're staying to eat.

LIFE WINS OUT FOR TEEN HIT BY TRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Live or die _ it was the choice of a lifetime
for Joy Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The quandary came to the teen-ager late in the day or maybe the
night of April 13 _ she does not really remember, because of the
pain and shock and the bright lights she could not see and the
chatter she could not understand.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment in this honor student's young life, dying did not
seem to be a terrible thing.
</P>
<P>
   A train had struck a car carrying her and four friends home from
Belton High School. The crash punctured both her lungs and
fractured seven ribs. She was bleeding internally. Her left leg was
broken. Her eyes were black.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I had to do was let myself go...just take one step...it
was that close,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange now to think about it, but...I know it would have
been OK for me to die that day.''
</P>
<P>
   She describes, essentially, a fork in the road. Had it been her
choice alone, she might not have been around weeks later to sit in
her living room in her family's rural Cass County home and tell
this story.
</P>
<P>
   But in a blurry place just beneath where doctors worked to save
her life, Joy thought of the parents who gave her life and the
babies she might someday bear.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents tell a story about how love and prayer can pass
through hospital walls and find a way into a young girl's soul.
</P>
<P>
   When Joy finally awoke, her father was at her side. She did not
tell him about her journey or how far she had gone. His look told
her he probably already knew.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Joy used sign language _ which she had learned while
performing in a school production of ``The Miracle Worker'' _ to
ask about the four other teens in the car.
</P>
<P>
   They were OK, he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Joy then asked about her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's asleep on a couch in the waiting room,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   Joy signed: ``Is she comfortable?''
A nervous day
</P>
<P>
   When Joy Jackson tells how the train looked that day, she points
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just...right there,'' she said. ``Big and tall, like a
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, April 13 was a nervous day for Joy, a sophomore at
Belton High School. She _ a budding photographer _ had a job
interview at 3:30 p.m. at a portrait studio in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there after school would be tight. To give herself a few
extra minutes, Joy hitched a ride home with friends. There were
five teens in the car: Elizabeth Aldridge, 15; Catherine Smothers,
15; Melissa Schult, 16; and the driver, Michael Walker, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Most lived in a rural Cass County subdivision just off Holmes
Road.
</P>
<P>
   The youths were talking school gossip when the car slowed nearly
to a stop at the crossing on 183rd Street near Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   That's when somebody screamed. Joy Jackson, riding in the front
passenger seat, saw the train just before impact.
</P>
<P>
   The northbound freight picked up the car and swung it 360
degrees before slamming into it a second time.
</P>
<P>
   One girl was knocked to the trunk. The teens scrambled from the
car. Melissa and a neighbor who had run to the scene pulled Joy
from the burning vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The car soon exploded.
</P>
<P>
   After investigating the accident, authorities said the rail
crossing, marked only with crossbucks, was dangerous because of the
lay of the land and spring weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Cass County, Kansas City Southern Railway and the
Missouri Department of Transportation visited the site recently.
They will decide whether to close the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Mills, a Cass County commissioner, said Friday that the
county might consider installing stop signs at all rail crossings
that lack lights and arms.
</P>
<P>
   `She looked so bad'
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jackson, a computer-software contractor, was fidgety that
day at work. He knew his daughter had the job interview and was
nervous about her driving on the wet roads.
</P>
<P>
   He called home a little after 3 p.m., but Joy was not there.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, she still had not arrived.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:45 p.m. Joy's brother told him there had been an accident.
He knew no details but told his father to call another parent who
was at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   A Cass County deputy took the phone and told Jackson that Joy
had been critically injured and taken by helicopter to St. Joseph
Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jackson called his wife before he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joy has been in an accident,'' he told her, his voice
breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Jackson, who worked in a doctor's office, fainted and
dropped to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   When they saw Joy in the hospital's emergency room, her face was
bloody, cut and bruised. Air escaping from her punctured lungs had
swollen her body. A respirator kept her breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes were black _ and fluttering.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked so bad, I didn't know if she would make it,'' Brian
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the waiting room, Marie Jackson heard an erroneous
news report that one of the teens in the accident had died.
</P>
<P>
   She did an accounting of those in the car _ and decided the
fatality must be Joy.
</P>
<P>
   She ran down the hall and barged into the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't come in here!'' someone yelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she alive _ I have to know!'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Jackson, yes, she's alive. We're working on her. You have
to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   For eight hours the parents, along with friends and family,
prayed as doctors worked to stabilize Joy.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacksons wanted good news. The doctors would say they were
doing what they could.
</P>
<P>
   Joy is the couple's middle child. Alan is 22, Jonathan is 14.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, in the quiet of night, Brian Jackson pondered life
without his daughter. What would her death do to his family? How
would it change his own life? He wasn't sure he could recover.
</P>
<P>
   He knew she was in great pain, and wondered whether she would
give up.
</P>
<P>
   He asked God to give her strength to fight and to let her know
that too many people would suffer if they lost her.
</P>
<P>
   It was after midnight when doctors finally reported she was
stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her later that God spared my life that night, too,''
Brian Jackson said.
No regrets
</P>
<P>
   Joy Jackson is convinced she is alive today because she made a
conscious decision to live.
</P>
<P>
   The three weeks or so in the hospital, including 10 days in
intensive care, were not fun. She faces still more surgery and
weeks of therapy on her injured leg.
</P>
<P>
   She never made it back to school this year, except for a brief
appearance on the last day. Friends do not call as often as she
would like, and she sometimes feels left out.
</P>
<P>
   She cannot run or play the sports she loves.
</P>
<P>
   A train whistle scares her.
</P>
<P>
   But she certainly has no regrets about her choice. In fact, she
has a higher value for life now, especially little things such as
taking a shower, walking or sleeping on her side.
</P>
<P>
   ``And just doing this,'' she said one day last week.
</P>
<P>
   She was sitting in a recliner and looking out the window toward
trees and lawn. A breeze rustled her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Maxie, the family dog, lay in her lap.

MORE BUSINESSES KEEPING THE SABBATH HOLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOYCE SMITH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A small but growing contingent of businesses
is deciding to keep the Sabbath holy.
</P>
<P>
   Hobby Lobby, a chain of arts and crafts stores, is risking an
estimated $100 million in sales this year by closing its stores on
Sundays to give employees a day off for family time and worship.
</P>
<P>
   Seven area Hobby Lobby stores started closing on Sunday on
Mother's Day, May 9. About 350 area employees are affected by the
change, which the company announced to shoppers through ads and
signs on its store doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give this day back to our employees and
customers,'' said Bill Hane, vice president for advertising at
Hobby Lobby headquarters in Oklahoma City. ``The company is based
on Christian principles and honoring the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobby Lobby is not alone. The national Chick-fil-A chain closes
all its stores Sundays, as does the Franklin Covey Co. chain. A
Godfather's Pizza in Liberty, Mo., also closes Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend closing to observe the Sabbath is not limited to stores
reflecting the Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   When Harvey Jacobson opened a kosher grocery nine years ago,
Jacobsons' Kosher Foods in Prairie Village, Kan., he decided to
keep the Jewish Sabbath holy by closing on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the grocery business Saturday was the big day; there was no
way you would close,'' Jacobson said. ``But in the Jewish religion
work is not permitted on Saturdays. After seven days a week, it's a
pleasure. It's my God-given day off.''
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the company has decided to swim against the
capitalistic stream and risk sacrificing profit in the name of
principle.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, such closings also help businesses attract
employees in a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it a lot,'' said Angela Hill, who has worked at Hobby
Lobby for two-and-a-half years. ``I go to church and get to be with
my family. It's a day we're all home together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Farmer, a Hobby Lobby customer from Overland Park, Kan.,
likes the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer to spend Sunday with our family, not shopping,''
Farmer said. ``And I kind of admire them for having some values.''
</P>
<P>
   Some retail experts say that closing on Sundays will cost sales
and customer good will.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Melaniphy, president of Melaniphy &AMP; Associates, a market
analyst and site selection company in Chicago, said: ``There might
be some public relations to be earned in Salt Lake City, but they
don't have much to gain in Chicago, Los Angeles or New York. Sunday
is a day when people have time to shop. The loss is greater than
the savings. Sales have gone up at Hobby Lobby's competitors since
the Sunday closings.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of competing companies, such as Michaels, which
has five area locations, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that Sunday has become a big shopping day _
malls are open fewer hours Sunday but draw more customers an hour
than on Saturday, the week's busiest day _ but Hobby Lobby and
others say they are winning over customers by embracing a
17th-century idea.
</P>
<P>
   Blue laws, so called because they were written on blue paper,
were the means by which the Puritan colonies restricted nearly all
Sunday retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those laws remained in effect until the late 1960s and
early 1970s, when state legislatures began phasing them out or
turning the decisions over to counties.
</P>
<P>
   Car dealerships in many markets still are closed Sundays.
Missouri's blue laws still prohibit the sale of motor vehicles on
Sundays. Although they are not required by law to do so, about 75
percent of Kansas dealerships in the area also are closed Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   It is also common for mom-and-pop operations to be closed
Sundays to give the owners a break. The Hawthorne Plaza shopping
center in Overland Park, where about half of 40 operations are
closed Sundays, is a good example. Most are locally owned and
operated.
</P>
<P>
   Most shopping centers require tenants to keep regular mall
hours, which include Sunday hours. Slim profit margins and
increased competition lead many stores to offer daily service.
</P>
<P>
   Chick-fil-A, the fast-food chain based in Atlanta, has refused
to open on Sunday, even though most of its stores are in malls.
Shopping centers such as Topeka's West Ridge Mall allow Chick-fil-A
to close Sundays because its sales for a six-day week often are
higher than sales at other food court operations open seven days a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a common practice when we opened in 1946 to close
Sundays, but what's unique is that we continued the practice,''
said Don Perry, spokesman for Chick-fil-A, which has more than 840
locations and reported sales of $799 million in 1998. The chain
does not have any Kansas City area locations.
</P>
<P>
   Truett Cathy, Chick-fil-A's founder, grew up in a poor,
hard-working family and always looked forward to rest and worship
on Sundays. He wanted the same benefit for his employees when he
opened his first Dwarf House restaurant near Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're introducing Christian principles into the workplace, and
we're blessed as a result,'' Perry said. ``We've had sales
increases for 31 years, and for the last five or six years we've
had double-digit sales increases.''
</P>
<P>
   As a privately held company, Hobby Lobby has more leeway to
decide its operating hours. The company has slowly introduced
Sunday closing so the financial effect would not be felt at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sales aren't our primary goal,'' Hane said. ``It's a
matter of principle, not profit. We're one of the fastest-growing
and most-profitable hobby stores, and we work very, very hard at
what we do. But we're here to honor God.''
</P>
<P>
   Customer calls have been 10-to-1 in favor of the change,
although some customers have complained about having their normal
shopping pattern interrupted, Hane said.
</P>
<P>
   Hobby Lobby said that Kansas City sales had increased since the
Sunday closings started and that the company expected to reach its
goal of $1 billion in sales in 2001. Part of the company's sales
help support several ministries, including Bible distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Another area business closed on Sundays is the Godfather's Pizza
in Liberty, thought to be the only restaurant in that chain to
close on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible makes it very clear that it's the Lord's day and he
will bless you for it,'' said David Crowdus, who owns the
restaurant with his wife, Kathy.
</P>
<P>
   While other Godfather's locations post their busiest days from
Friday through Sunday, the busiest days at the Liberty Godfather's
have shifted to Thursday through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday closing cost the restaurant a recent order of 200
pizzas for a graduation party. Sales, however, have increased more
than 300 percent since the couple bought what was a struggling
corporate-owned store in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Franklin Covey Co. closes its 125 retail stores on Sunday,
including two in the Kansas City area. It has built its business on
helping people set priorities with day planners and other
organizational tools.
</P>
<P>
   People juggle different roles _ spouse, parent, employee,
volunteer _ that they have to fit into seven days, said Debra Lund,
spokeswoman for Franklin Covey in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are searching to find some kind of balance between work
and home,'' Lund said. ``Sunday is a great day for retail, but we
wanted to give them one day when they didn't have to focus on
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The day off pays off tenfold, Lund said, because employees are
more refreshed and dedicated when they return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Hobby Lobby's Hane agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's driving our performance is good customer service,'' he
said. ``Sunday is one of the worst days for customer service,
because no one is in a good mood about working on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the retail experts who frown upon Sunday closings say the
practice could help businesses attract and retain top employees in
a tight labor market. Unemployment in the Kansas City area recently
has been about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unemployment rate is so low it's hard to get anyone in
your door to apply for a job,'' Crowdus said. ``Then to find good,
reliable workers is even harder. Closing Sundays is unusual,
especially for the restaurant business. So this is wonderful for
our kids.''

REAL ESTATE: A $1.5-BILLION RENEWAL OF A CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ This city has bulldozed architectural masterpieces and
burnished them. Never before, however, has it set aside a 16-story
landmark for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what happened to the McGraw-Hill Building, an Art
Deco tower that used to stand at 520 North Michigan Ave., just
across the Chicago River from the Loop. Today, carved into some
4,000 carefully labeled pieces, it sits in a warehouse not far from
the Cook County jail.
</P>
<P>
   No previous experience with landmarks quite prepares a visitor
for the sight of an entire building on wood pallets, stretching
horizontally rather than vertically, farther than the eye can see,
over more than two acres of floor space _ a rippled, Cubist ocean
of limestone, cast stone and pink granite.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, 98 percent of these pieces will
be used to clad the principal facades of an entirely new structure
at No. 520, a 310-room Grand Bay Hotel that is to be completed late
next year. It will adjoin the entrance pavilion of a
260,000-square-foot Nordstrom department store that is now under
construction and is to open in September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time something on this scale has been done in
Chicago,'' said Christopher Hill, commissioner of the Planning and
Development Department. ``We're very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The new hotel will have two more floors than the former
McGraw-Hill Building, but these will be set back far enough so as
not to be visible from across Michigan Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, to the man in the street, it will look exactly
like the old 520 Michigan Avenue _ except cleaner,'' said John
Buck, chairman and chief executive of John Buck Co., which is
developing the site in partnership with Morgan Stanley Real Estate
Funds.
</P>
<P>
   The dismantling and re-erection of a designated landmark is
itself an appropriately brazen Chicago tale, but it is only one
part of an astonishing transformation by Buck Co. of nine blocks
west of Michigan Avenue into an enormous mixed-use district called
North Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy on shopping, dining and entertainment, North Bridge will
strengthen a growing east-west commercial axis that runs from Navy
Pier to State Street and beyond, across the tony Michigan Avenue
retail precinct. ``By way of analogy, where Times Square meets
Fifth Avenue,'' Buck said.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and the end of next year, North Bridge is to get
three new hotels with a total of 902 rooms, a five-level
DisneyQuest virtual theme park, an ESPN Zone sports theme
restaurant, a northern outpost of Joe's Stone Crab restaurant of
Miami Beach and three parking garages with 2,113 spaces.
</P>
<P>
   All told, almost $1.5 billion is going into North Bridge: $530
million for current construction projects and $300 million for
tenants' completion of their spaces, with $630 million already
invested in the stores, hotels, offices, theaters and apartment
tower developed or renovated by the Buck Company.
</P>
<P>
   Buck spent nearly a decade trying to convince Nordstrom that
North Bridge was not too far south of the fanciest stretch of
Michigan Avenue, known as the ``Magnificent Mile.'' He argued that
Ohio and Ontario Streets, which run through the district, are an
important corridor since they connect to the Kennedy Expressway
(I-90 and I-94).
</P>
<P>
   But the giant Seattle retailer had other requirements that were
seemingly impossible to meet simultaneously: very large floor areas
and a Michigan Avenue entrance. Buck owned a site large enough to
suit Nordstrom, but it was a block west of Michigan Avenue. And the
McGraw-Hill Building stood in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't modify the building to accommodate new uses,''
Buck said. ``We were stopped dead in our tracks until we could
solve the 520 Michigan problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Completed in 1929 to designs by Thielbar &AMP; Fugard, the
McGraw-Hill Building was one of a series of small limestone towers
_ each fairly modest on its own, but extraordinary as an ensemble _
that once characterized Michigan Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Resembling a truncated version of Eliel Saarinen's unbuilt but
influential design for the nearby Tribune Tower, the McGraw-Hill
Building claimed as its distinguishing feature two sets of panels
carved by the sculptors Gwen Lux, who also worked on Radio City
Music Hall, and her husband, Eugene Van Breeman Lux.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from the zodiac and Greek mythology adorn the panels,
including a gentle-looking Taurus, a stressed-out Atlas struggling
with the world on his shoulders and a haughty, high-cheekboned
Diana who could almost pass for Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the city's best collaborations of sculpture and
architecture,'' the Commission on Chicago Landmarks declared in
1995 when it recommended the McGraw-Hill Building to the City
Council for designation.
</P>
<P>
   Buck was compelled to make a deal with city officials. ``We
didn't fight the designation,'' he said, ``but they gave us the
right to dismantle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismantling began last November and was completed two months
ago. The extra cost for disassembling and re-erecting the facade is
about $9 million, said Greg Merdinger, a principal in the John Buck
Company.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the project is not likely to set a precedent.
``It's a nice solution and they've done a great job but I don't see
it as a model,'' said James Peters, deputy commissioner in the
landmarks division of the planning agency. ``I can't think of many
places, except Fifth and Madison Avenues, where the retail market
is so high that it would make this feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters stepped gingerly as he spoke, threading his way in the
warehouse among _ and occasionally across _ limestone panels up to
14 feet wide and 10 inches thick; some plain, some fluted; some
deeply carved, some lightly incised, all of them labeled with metal
tags. Taurus, for example, is piece No. G61-25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad walking on that stuff,'' Peters said, leaving
Helios behind.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the limestone panels came off the old structure with
relatively little serious damage. ``We're not in a situation where
we have to repair the carved areas, so we don't have someone
learning Gwen Lux's technique,'' said Michael Sullivan, the senior
vice president of Anthony Belluschi Architects, designers of the
new 520 Michigan Ave. building.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Nordstrom entrance on Michigan Avenue will take the form of
an 80-foot atrium sandwiched between 520 Michigan and an existing
Marriott Hotel. Shoppers will reach the department store itself
through a four-level retail arcade and a bridge over Rush Street.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the salvaging of the facade will
yield a credible simulacrum of the landmark or merely an awkward
hybrid. And there is no telling yet whether the effort will
ultimately be worth the considerable political and financial
capital that was required to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   Another landmark battle is brewing three blocks away, on a block
just outside the North Bridge project area, where two significant
remnants of Chicago's artistic and social history still stand: the
Medinah Temple and Tree Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in 1913 for the Chicago chapter of the Shrine of North
America, a Masonic fraternal organization best known for its
children's hospitals and circuses (and for the fact that its
members wear red fezzes), the Medinah Temple is an auditorium
cloaked in Moorish fantasy, with delicate filigree and horseshoe
arches. Its corner towers once had onion domes and crescent
finials.
</P>
<P>
   Tree Studios is a two- and three-story artists' compound built
in stages between 1894 and 1913 on what was once the backyard of
Judge Lambert Tree, a civic leader and the great-grandfather of the
model Penelope Tree. Its facade bristles with fanciful sculptural
touches _ like a palette with paint brushes on one of the chimneys
_ attesting to its creative purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artists who lived or worked there were J. Allen St.
John, illustrator of the ``Tarzan'' books; Andrew Rebori, a Chicago
architect; John Franklin Storrs, sculptor of the Ceres statue atop
the Chicago Board of Trade; Alson Skinner Clark, an Impressionist
painter, and actor Burgess Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a repository of so much passion, searching, hard work and
creativity,'' said Barbara Koenen, a project manager in the city's
Cultural Affairs Department, which is organizing a show, ``The Art
of Tree Studios,'' this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The State Street frontage of the Tree Studios is already a
landmark, but the designation does not include its annexes on Ohio
and Ontario Streets, nor the inner courtyard. The Medinah Temple is
not a landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The Shriners own the entire block and have contracted to sell it
for at least $20 million to the developer Steven Fifield, chairman
of the Fifield Companies. Until recently, he planned to replace the
temple with an apartment tower, while maintaining at least the
State Street facade of Tree Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, a movement to designate the entire studio and the
temple _ which would apparently frustrate Fifield's plans _ is
quickly gaining ground. Even Mayor Richard M. Daley has stepped in
to say that the Medinah Temple is a ``very special building'' and
that ``sometimes you need an oasis in big cities.''
</P>
<P>
   The landmarks commission is to take up the Tree Studios question
this month, to be followed by a consideration of the Medinah
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Because the commission has not acted, neither Hill nor Jack
Guthman of Shefsky &AMP; Froelich, a lawyer representing Fifield and
the Shriners, would comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Barton Faist, an artist and gallery owner who has lived in
Tree Studios for 17 years, was under no such restraint in urging
preservation. ``If they don't care about Tree Studios,'' he said,
``they don't care about Chicago history _ or art, for that
matter.''

KANSAS CITY CHURCH SPONSORS GAY PROM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It was planned with flashing strobe lights,
glittering tablecloths and even a theme: ``Studio 54 Forever.''
Just like any other prom.
</P>
<P>
   Except some women rented tuxes. One man went shopping for a
gown. Guys asked guys, and women invited women.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's prom at midtown's Metropolitan Community Church
was the first gay prom in the Kansas City area, organizers said.
From 50 to 100 youths were expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   It was organized by Passages, a social and support group for
gays, lesbians and other youths between the ages of 14 and 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted an event where the atmosphere is very affirming, not
that thin gruel of tolerance,'' said Bruce Hall, a Passages board
member who helped organize the event. A gay prom, he said, allows
youth to experience ``the same opportunities and the same
traditions'' as their peers without fear of insults or physical
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Gay youths need occasions to feel positive about themselves,
said Kansas City psychologist and Passages board member David
Donovan. They face crises from taunts in school to evictions from
their homes, he said. One study found gay youths were more than
five times more likely than peers to be targets of school violence
or harassment. Another survey found that gay and bisexual male
teens were seven times more likely to attempt suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Many Passages youths said they were afraid to bring a same-sex
date to their prom. Others were barred entry. Saturday night was
their time to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Gay proms are traditions in several cities, including Des
Moines, Iowa; Springfield, Mo.; and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Passages members say more youths are confronting their sexuality
in an era with gay politicians and out-of-the-closet sitcom
characters. Passages started in 1990 with about seven teens and has
since grown to 50 who attend Sunday meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Gay youths still face challenges in school, notably during prom
season. Many local school districts do not have policies
restricting prom dates or dress. Some public schools, such as those
in St. Joseph, Mo., do have such rules. That angers civil rights
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment rights of free expression allow all public
school students to attend their proms with a date they chose and a
manner of dress in keeping with their sexual orientation, said Dick
Kurtenbach, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Kansas and Western Missouri. Excuses that gay couples will
disrupt a prom, he noted, ``could have applied not so long ago for
an interracial couple who attended.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Gallatin, Mo., one student's planned prom dress became a
problem. Before his senior year, B.J. DeWeese told family and
friends that he was gay. In the Daviess County town, DeWeese became
a familiar sight wearing high-heeled shoes, ``skorts'' and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   As prom approached, DeWeese was summoned to school offices.
</P>
<P>
   There, school officials asked him if he was planning to wear a
dress to prom. He was. If he arrived like that, they told him, he
would be turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' said DeWeese, 19. ``All by myself, defending
myself. Not knowing any school policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mickes, Gallatin High School's attorney, said the school was
within its rights. He said the Supreme Court had allowed public
school officials to restrict students' dress and activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, students get confused about what their
constitutional rights are. Their constitutional rights are to go to
school. Not to be third trumpet in the band. Not to be starting
quarterback. Not to go to the prom,'' Mickes said. ``Those are
privileges.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWeese skipped his prom, but went dress-shopping before
Saturday night.

MEETING WITH NATO COMMANDER STALLS AS SERBS STUDY CONDITIONS OF
DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS headline, lede; CHANGES throughout)  (rk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER and DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ After meeting for more than five hours with
NATO officials on the border of Kosovo, Yugoslav military officers
failed Saturday to agree to the terms of their withdrawal from the
southern Serbian province, saying they needed more time to check
with leaders in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Five senior Yugoslav military officers came here Saturday to
meet with NATO officials and to review and sign the terms for their
withdrawal from Kosovo after 10 weeks of bombardment by the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials had expected the meeting to seal Yugoslavia's
capitulation and to mark the end of a decade of wars that have
dismantled the country. They insisted that there would be no
negotiations over the details of the military agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO agreed to meet again on Sunday after most of the
Yugoslav delegation went back across the border into Kosovo late
Saturday afternoon to consult with their leadership and did not
return.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting two hours, the head of the NATO delegation, Lt.
Gen. Michael Jackson, left. Officials declined to say exactly which
issues most concerned the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delegation has asked for more time to consult with higher
authorities in Belgrade,'' a NATO spokesman, Lt. Col. Robin
Clifford, said. ``We have in the interest of seeking a swift
resolution to this agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Russian delegation was invited to attend, but did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and the Parliament in
Belgrade had already accepted NATO's terms to end the airstrikes on
Thursday after meetings with a special Russian envoy and the
president of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Though alliance officials would not provide specifics of the
document presented, the military agreement would allow NATO troops
to enter Kosovo as early as this week, a humiliation for
Yugoslavia's military.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, alliance officials said the document spells out how
and when Serbian troops are to leave Kosovo, the routes NATO troops
are to use to enter the province, and the troops and equipment to
be used in maintaining peace there.
</P>
<P>
   They also said it requires the Yugoslav army to remove or
provide information on the land mines with which it has seeded the
province. And unlike the military annex to the peace accord that
ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, this document is a separate
military agreement that goes into effect as soon as it is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Before NATO troops enter Kosovo, however, Serbian forces must
demonstrate within 24 hours that they are indeed withdrawing. Only
then, said a alliance spokesman, Trey Cate, would the alliance call
a pause in the bombing, which has continued despite the impending
accord. The first of 16,000 NATO troops would enter Kosovo on the
heels of the withdrawing Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature abhors a vacuum,'' Cate said, ``so we'll be following
pretty closely behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO would reserve the right to resume bombing if the Serbian
forces fail in any way to abide by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Two sedans carrying the Yugoslav officials arrived here two
hours late for their 9:00 a.m. appointment with the NATO
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The delay came when the Yugoslav delegation, waiting across the
border less than one-half mile away, raised questions with a NATO
official about several details of the meeting, including their
insistence that the modest roadside cafe NATO had leased for the
meeting was not in a sufficiently neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that this was an attempt to postpone Saturday's signing,
NATO officials immediately solved the problems ``at the highest
levels,'' Clifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the hundreds of reporters waiting outside, the Yugoslav
officials then entered the restaurant, near the site where railway
cars had only recently disgorged some 60,000 dispirited Albanians
who had been evicted from Kosovo by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, Jackson, commander of NATO forces here, presented
the military agreement to Gen. Obrad Stevanovic, assistant
secretary of the Interior, and Gen. Blagoje Kovacevic, representing
the Yugoslav general staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav delegation sat on one side of a U-shaped table
across from General Jackson, who is British, and two top NATO
officials, including one American officer.
</P>
<P>
   Four brigade commanders from Italy, France, Germany and Great
Britain sat behind the men and were joined by at least 20 other
NATO officials. The meeting was put together so hastily that the
place cards were blank for the Yugoslav delegation because Belgrade
was unable to confirm who would represent the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   As they read the document line by line on the green-covered
tables, representatives of the two sides regularly excused
themselves to walk out of the restaurant and use secure
walkie-talkies to call headquarters. First a Serbian general, then
Jackson himself, strode out of the hilltop cafe to speak in private
about matters of interpretation and translations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless the atmosphere in the somber dining room was ``very
professional,'' according to Clifford, the NATO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a military agreement, Milosevic is not required to
sign the document, allowing NATO to avoid further negotiations with
the Yugoslav leader, who was indicted for war crimes last month by
an international tribunal. Nor were any other members of
Milosevic's government who have been indicted sent here from
Belgrade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MORE)
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NATO officials completed writing the military
agreement, which is a revision of the military annex to the accord
negotiated in February in France, according to a NATO spokesman.
NATO officials then sent the document to the Yugoslav government
and settled on Saturday's meeting. For extra insurance, NATO
commanders confirmed the appointment late Friday night with the
Yugoslavs after the North Atlantic Council had approved the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels Saturday, the NATO spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said
Jackson had full authority to lay down detailed withdrawal terms to
the Yugoslav commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firstly, they have to commit themselves, and Yugoslavia, to a
phased and rapid withdrawal of the Yugoslav ground forces,'' Shea
said. ``This means that all personnel, all organizations with a
military capability, must start to withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``This would involve, of course, units from the
regular army, but also armed civilian groups, national guards,
border police, army reserves, military police, the intelligence
services, police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, local special
riot and anti-terrorist police, and any other groups or individuals
that will be designated by General Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also means that as these military and police forces leave,
they will have to stick to a firm schedule, using designated
assembly areas and designated routes, and designated areas that
will have to be vacated,'' he added. ``The withdrawal of the
Yugoslav armed forces must be completed within seven days from the
entry into force of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav forces would also have to agree to withdraw all
their aircraft, air defense radars and communications systems,
surface-to-air missiles, and anti-aircraft artillery ``very
quickly,'' Shea said, so that allied planes could safely carry out
reconnaissance missions during the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers would also be expected to see to it that the
Kosovo Liberation Army is disbanded and disarmed, though Maj. Gen.
Walter Jertz, a spokesman for the allied military command said
Saturday that this was ``a difficult issue.''
</P>
<P>
   British forces will be the first to enter Kosovo, according to a
NATO spokesman, an acknowledgment of their leading role in the
peacekeeping force, which will be led by Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The British, French, German, Italian and American forces will
each establish a zone of command in Kosovo, NATO officials said.
Those sectors will divide the province like slices of a pie. All of
these forces will enter with armor, including tanks and armored
personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   One NATO official said the United States will use Apache
helicopters during the first phase of the entry. ``It will send a
strong message that we are serious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the rough outline of the military agreement, NATO
forces will have the right to prevent any disruptions to the peace,
whether by Serbian forces or troops of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
They will also have to contend with the problems of booby traps
left by the Serbs, especially in the houses and shops of the
Kosovar Albanians who have fled over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   The five sectors will also include soldiers from other NATO and
non-NATO countries to police the peace agreement for years to come,
according to NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops hope to establish a ``safe and secure environment''
in advance of any return of the more than 500,000 Kosovar refugees
waiting in camps here and in Albania. At the same time, they will
be searching for the tens of thousands of Kosovar Albanians who
have hidden in the hills and abandoned villages after being thrown
out of their own homes and are believed to be in desperate need of
food, water and medical attention.

REPORTER DISCUSSES ETHICAL QUESTIONS SURROUNDING LEWINSKY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WINSTON ROSS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When Michael Isikoff learned about Kenneth
Starr's secret investigation of Monica Lewinsky, Starr's staff
begged him to keep it quiet _ at least for a day. It's a request
many journalists who cover politics confront.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a request many journalists automatically would deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `No way,' '' said Isikoff, Newsweek's investigative
correspondent. ``That's a no-brainer. In a case like this, with a
highly politicized atmosphere, it was not even a question of
holding off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Isikoff thought about it and realized that if he tipped off
President Clinton, Vernon Jordan and Lewinsky to the hunt, he'd
spend the rest of the weekend writing about their reaction to his
phone calls. The idea is to stay out of the story, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Isikoff obliged, and Starr saw his window. He sped up the
investigation during the next 24 hours and confronted Lewinsky.
Isikoff was a part of the story, like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical decisions such as this were what made the Lewinsky story
difficult to report, Isikoff told 900 journalists Saturday at the
1999 Investigative Reporters and Editors Conference at the Kansas
City Marriott Downtown. The conference ends today.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the most infamous presidential scandal since
Watergate, Isikoff said he realized it was futile to agonize over
every ethical decision.
</P>
<P>
   His challenges were those any reporter would experience wading
through the muck toward truth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of Monica and Clinton and Starr and the whole saga
was first and foremost a story,'' Isikoff said. ``There's a reason
we call what we write stories. They are events and things that
happen that we find interesting. We get in real trouble when we try
to extrapolate lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   But the questions that emerged also were interesting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   How much should reporters write about the private lives of
public officials? When and how can they let themselves become part
of the story? Should they protect sources who lie?
</P>
<P>
   These are questions Isikoff said he was left with as the
Lewinsky story fades from the public spotlight. And they are the
questions journalists should consider in everything they do, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Lewinsky debacle, many Americans said the
president's personal life was no one's business, Isikoff said.
Journalists never blanketed their front pages with tales of John F.
Kennedy's tawdry affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But those reports eventually leaked, and people began to realize
that Kennedy's private life did have an effect on the public,
Isikoff said. After that, it became more acceptable to look into
what presidents and other public figures do when they're not
working.
</P>
<P>
   Isikoff said he realized Clinton's personal life was also
relevant to how he ran the country. His actions with Lewinsky
reflect who he is, and people needed to know about them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the circumstances that govern,'' Isikoff said. ``What we
had was a continuing pattern of recklessness. ...It ultimately came
to a culture of concealment.''

 &HT;    YUGOSLAV GENERALS BALK AT SIGNING PEACE SETTLEMENT AS SERBS
SHELL ALBANIAN REFUGEE TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    EDS: Optional trim at 800

<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia The three-day-old Kosovo peace settlement hung
in the balance Saturday night after a delegation of senior Yugoslav
generals balked at signing a detailed military withdrawal plan
drawn up by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Serb forces shelled a northern Albanian border town
crowded with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Talks were to resume Sunday morning at the border town of
Kumanovo, the site of a NATO air base in Macedonia. Tanjug, the
state-run Yugoslav news agency, quoted unnamed sources who said an
agreement might be signed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials tried to put a favorable spin on the Yugoslav
delegation's overnight delay in signing the so-called ``military
technical agreement'' that the allies regard as one of the most
crucial steps before peace can begin to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   British Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, a NATO spokesman, said
Saturday's talks had been ``constructive'' and ``positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each point of the military technical agreement has been
discussed word by word, line by line and sentence by sentence,'' he
told reporters. ``What we now have is a full understanding on both
sides as to (its) content . . .and what it actually requires the
Yugoslav delegation and the Yugoslav armed forces to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the Serb shelling of the
Albanian border town of Kruma would complicate Sunday's resumed
talks. Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe reported that eight shells had exploded in Kruma, located
about nine miles from Kukes and about five miles west of the
Yugoslav border. The number of casualties was not immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
   OSCE spokesman Andrea Agneli said relief workers and townspeople
in Kruma had fled into cellars. Agneli said that three Serb shells
hit the nearby village of Nikoliq, injuring three young women.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have often shelled Albanian border areas, where rebels
from the Kosovo Liberation Army are trying to move arms and
fighters to continue their battle for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO air strikes entered their 75th day early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and allied pilots continued to hammer at Serb positions
near Kosovo's border with Albania, where fighting between Serb
forces and units of the Kosovo Liberation Army continued to rage.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon insisted the strikes would
continue until Serb forces begin pulling out in earnest from
Kosovo. ``That hasn't yet started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the bombing could end shortly after a pullout begins,
but added: ``Nothing like that is going to happen as long as the
Serbs refuse to move.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what caused the delay in signing
the military technical agreement.
</P>
<P>
   By one account, the Yugoslav delegates said they needed
clearance from their superiors before they could accept NATO's
proposed date for starting to deploy American, British, French,
German, Canadian and other nations' peacekeepers inside war-torn
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, heading the NATO delegation, has
insisted that the NATO peacekeepers must begin crossing the Kosovo
border very soon, perhaps within the next 48 hours. ``There has to
be the avoidance of a vacuum,'' as one officer close to Jackson put
it.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a quick agreement in the military-to-military
talks, NATO has begun rushing peacekeepers into Macedonia. They
already were on alert to move into Kosovo in the next few days.
Among the contingents arriving at Macedonia's main airport Saturday
was a planeload of German tank troops aboard a transport plane.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's military talks took place at a roadside cafe called
``Europa 93'' several hundred yards inside Macedonia, along the
main highway where tens of thousands of Kosovar refugees trudged
toward exile in refugee camps earlier this year. On a hillside
above the cafe are six fresh graves of refugees who died in a
cramped, makeshift refugee camp that at one point
</P>
<P>
   this spring swelled to 60,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   On a mountaintop overlooking the cafe, Serbian snipers have
sometimes been spotted peering down on refugee columns. But there
were no snipers in evidence during the military-to-military talks.
</P>
<P>
   After realizing that the Yugoslav delegation would not sign the
document Saturday evening, a NATO staff member could be seen
walking off to his car carrying two armloads of rolled-up oversized
military maps. Another staff aide carried a thick sheaf of plastic
overlays for the maps, which were apparently meant to inform the
Yugoslavs of the precise details of
</P>
<P>
   which routes Yugoslav troops were to use in exiting Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place around a large square table in the first
floor of the cafe. On one side sat Jackson and his interpreter.
Opposite sat the two top Yugoslav delegates, Col. Gen. Blagoje
Kovacevic, the assistant chief of the Yugoslav Army general staff,
and Col. Gen. Obrad Stevanovic, the deputy minister of interior.
</P>
<P>
   On a third side sat ``observers,'' including U.S. Air Force Lt.
Gen. ``Doc'' Fogelsong from NATO headquarters and two Finnish
military representatives of Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who
negotiated Thursday's apparent peace breakthrough. The fourth side
was occupied by note-takers.
</P>
<P>
   Another 25 lower-ranking aides, mostly on the NATO side, sat
around the outside of the room listening.
</P>
<P>
   For unexplained reasons, there was no Russian delegate at
Saturday's session, despite the critical role played by Russian
</P>
<P>
   envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin in convincing Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic to give in and allow foreign peacekeepers into Kosovo in
exchange for a halt in NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The session was called for 9:30 a.m. but didn't start until noon
because the two sides had trouble agreeing on the exact place and
configuration of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After five hours and ten minutes of discussions, the six
Yugoslav generals insisted that they needed further instructions
from Belgrade. Stern-faced and ignoring shouted press questions,
they sped away into Kosovo in a procession of six Mercedes sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Still expecting the session to conclude by sundown Saturday,
NATO spokesman Clifford emerged from the cafe at 5:15 p.m. to say,
``All that is required now is for one or two small points of detail
that the Yugoslav delegation wish to consult back to
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade. They have gone off to go and do that. We expect them
back here within one hour.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour expired. Then Jackson, the British general leading the
NATO delegation, got a phone call, apparently from a low-ranking
Yugoslav official at the Yugoslav border crossing several hundred
yards north the roadside meeting place.
</P>
<P>
   Four NATO officials, led by Fogelsong in his combat flight suit,
sauntered past a cluster of about 150 journalists. As they ambled
up the road toward the Yugoslav border post, Fogelsong joked that
he was on his way ``to find out what's happening in the Cleveland
Indians game.''
</P>
<P>
   When the four returned, they gave no hint that anything about
the talks was amiss. Fogelsong again bantered to the journalists
about baseball, then returned inside the cafe apparently carrying
the message that the Yugoslavs weren't willing to continue the
meeting into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 8 p.m., NATO spokesman Clifford once again stood
before a microphone in the cafe parking lot to announce that the
talks had been adjourned until 8:30 a.m. Sunday.

served more time in jail before acquittal than he probably would

ultimately cleared of taking favors from companies that did
business with the Agriculture Department. Blackley, 48, has not

lawyer says, under a statute that has spawned boundless
multimillion-dollar investigations that have gone on for years.

business with the Agriculture Department. Blackley, 48, has not
been as fortunate. He has been a target of special prosecutors, his
lawyer says, under a statute that has spawned boundless
multimillion-dollar investigations that have gone on for years.

NATIONAL WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL WOULD GIVE VETERAN A SENSE OF
CLOSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a faraway shore 55 years ago today, Donald McKee
came face to face with death. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was a 20-year-old medic attached to the 29th Infantry that
was being chewed to pieces on the beaches of Normandy. It was a
scene of unimaginable chaos and carnage: burning tanks, beached
boats and bodies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When McKee waded ashore at twilight on June 6, 1944, the air was
thick with smoke and the cries of the wounded. The injured were
stacked on litters; the dead still lay in the wet sand where they
had fallen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day to remember,'' said McKee, 75, a retired chemical
engineer from Silver Spring, Md. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now he hopes that a patch of greenery along the capital's Mall
near the Lincoln Memorial will soon provide the type of remembrance
already enjoyed by veterans of Korea and Vietnam, but that has long
eluded the soldiers of World War II. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some states have World War II memorials. McKee helped erect a
tribute in Maryland. Missouri and Kansas have memorials to veterans
of all U.S. wars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drive to build a national World War II memorial passed
another hurdle last week when its preliminary design got a
thumbs-up from one of several federal agencies that determine where
memorials go in the capital and how they look. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million project still needs final design approvals and
the blessing of the interior secretary. It also could use an
additional $50 million in private donations since the budget is
only halfway there. The pace of contributions has picked up ever
since Tom Hanks, who starred in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' an
Oscar-winning film about D-Day, became the fund-raising campaign's
national spokesman this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In April, for instance, the campaign received about 3,600
pledges. In May, after Hanks' television ads started running, the
number shot up to 35,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he gets on TV and makes a pitch, we end up with a
flurry of phone calls,'' said Mike Conley, spokesman for the
American Battle Monuments Commission, an independent federal agency
that is building the memorial. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barring unforeseen roadblocks in an undertaking that has been
anything but trouble-free, construction could begin next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But with only 6.3 million World War II veterans left, and with
more than 1,000 dying every day, supporters are getting anxious. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is ticking,'' Herman Harrington, a veteran and an
American Legion official, said at a public hearing last week. ``I'd
like to see as many of my old comrades as possible join me when we
have the groundbreaking ceremony.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The memorial is to be built on a 7.4-acre section of the Mall
that has been the source of much of the controversy. It is planned
for the foot of the Reflecting Pool, thereby intruding on the vista
between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, two of
the capital's most prominent symbols. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the site is perfectly appropriate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it is the nave of our cathedral,'' said Charles
Atherton, secretary of the Commission of Fine Arts, an independent
federal design review agency. ``If you compare it to Westminster
Abbey, with all its great national heroes, our Mall is something
akin to that. ``It's a very, very special place. A lot of people
were concerned about putting the memorial in the middle of it, that
it's not the right thing to do. We're just as convinced it's the
only thing to do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The design also has fevered some of the opposition. It involves
rebuilding the pool, adding fountains and surrounding it with a
large plaza. Two granite memorial arches would stand at the north
and south entrances, along with curvilinear ramps to provide
access. Fifty-six stone pillars representing all the states and
territories _ symbolizing the unity of the nation during the war _
would embrace the plaza. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There also would be ceremonial steps that would double as an
amphitheater for ceremonies, flags, sculpted American eagles,
laurel wreaths and inscriptions. A key element would be a ``sacred
precinct'' with cascading waterfalls and a cenotaph commemorating
the sacrifice, a light of freedom arising out of a crater and a
Wall of Freedom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest design is the result of several revisions after the
fine arts commission and another design review agency, the National
Capital Planning Commission, had rejected earlier versions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to finally come up with a visual statement that
is powerful and commensurate with the significance of World War
II,'' said architect Friederich St. Florian, former dean of the
Rhode Island School of Design. ``What we are trying to do is that
somebody who would come to visit the memorial, say 100 years from
now, will really understand that this was the generation of
Americans that lived in the mid-20th century that upheld the ideals
and principles of the nation like it never has happened before.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opponents see little that they like. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a conglomeration of parts; some are triumphant; some are
funerary,'' said Judy Scott Feldman, an art and architectural
history professor at American University. ``It's confusing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Feldman, who serves on the Committee of 100, the oldest citizens
historic preservation group in Washington, told last week's public
hearing that through the use of eagles, wreaths, fire and large
stone arches, the design unwittingly employed architectural devices
popular in the Nazi regime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the right symbols for the World War II
memorial,'' she said. ``This is not how we want to commemorate that
era.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the memorial as it is now envisioned seems on a glidepath
toward final approval.
</P>
<P>
   That is welcome news to former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, a wounded
World War II veteran who is co-chairman of the fund-raising
campaign. To the Kansan, the memorial stands for ``peace, strength
and victory, but freedom more than anything. That's what I hope it
would say.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For McKee, whose two Purple Hearts offer testimony to his own
sacrifice half a century ago, it means: ``After 50-some odd years,
we've got closure, which we've never had before. It was probably
the most catastrophic event that took place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognition is long overdue.'' &QL;

AT HOME COLUMN: GIVING AIR AN AIR OF CLEANLINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some people, spring means washing windows, scrubbing floors,
discarding junk, hosing down lawn furniture and airing out the
house. But spring is also a good time to air out the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are oblivious to the fact that indoor air is often
loaded with contaminants,'' said David Johnston, president of
What's Working, a consultant to the construction industry based in
Boulder, Colo. ``Even in the cleanest houses there are
microparticulates floating around, like animal dander, unburned
hydrocarbons, pollen, mold spores, bacteria and even dust-mite
feces.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, who specializes in environmentally friendly
construction, said that in addition to those things, most houses
have at least some airborne gases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds and all sorts
of petroleum derivatives,'' he said, explaining that such
exotic-sounding gases come from the most ordinary sources:
adhesives, cleaning products, solvents, paints, particle board,
furniture, carpeting, nail polish remover and even shirts and suits
just back from the dry cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   And then, he said, there are substances tracked in from the
outside: pesticides, herbicides and whatever else might be attached
to the bottoms of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Johnston said, one of the most significant ways to
reduce exposure to airborne contaminants is to improve air quality
in the homes. ``There are some obvious first steps,'' he said,
``like having a good doormat, or, better yet, taking your shoes off
before entering the house.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, it is usually prudent to hang clothes just
back from the cleaners outside the house with the plastic bags
removed. ``That lets the cleaning fluid left in the clothes
evaporate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is also wise, he said, to use a spring cleanup to get rid of
old cleaning products, paints, solvents and other chemicals
typically stored and long forgotten under sinks and in cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Such steps, of course, are aimed at removing the obvious sources
of indoor air pollution. There are also some less-obvious sources
of airborne pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe what we find in some ductwork,'' said
Steve Wolfson, president of Environmental Cleaning Systems, a duct
cleaning company in Valley Stream, N.Y. ``We've gone into some
houses and taken out a couple of pounds of debris.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said that in houses with central heat and
air-conditioning systems that use ductwork to distribute air
throughout the house, the homeowner must regularly change the
system's air filter. In most cases, however, homeowners use
relatively inexpensive filters that are found in home centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pick up maybe 15 percent of the contaminants passing
through them,'' Wolfson said. ``The rest ends up as debris in the
ducts or comes right out the other end.'' Debris in ductwork, he
said, can become a breeding ground for mold and mildew and other
bacterial contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, Wolfson said, is to have the ducts professionally
cleaned and install a filter that will prevent them from getting
dirty again. A professional duct-cleaning company, he said, will
typically use a rotating brush on a hose attached to a vacuum unit
with a high-efficiency filter vented outside the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the brush is rotating the debris is being vacuumed out
and none of the bad air comes back into the home,'' he said, adding
that cleaning the ductwork in an average two- or three-bedroom
house would cost around $150. For about $50 more, he said,
duct-cleaning companies will also treat the inside of the cleaned
ductwork with an anti-bacterial spray to kill any mold or mildew
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to keep clean ducts clean, Wolfson said, is to let
only clean air inside. And that can best be accomplished, he said,
by investing in an electrostatic filter. Such filters use an
electrical charge to trap particulate contaminants on the filter
surface. And rather than replacing them every month _ the average
life span of ordinary filters _ electrostatic filters can be
cleaned with a garden hose and then reinstalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should last a lifetime,'' Wolfson said, adding that there
is a price to be paid for quality: cardboard filters cost about $2,
compared to $70 to $100 for a high-quality electrostatic filter.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Wilson, publisher of Environmental Building News, said that
another way homeowners can reduce airborne contaminants indoors is
to eliminate the sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all kinds of junk living in our houses,'' Wilson said,
explaining that most indoor-air-quality experts recommend using
area rugs _ or better yet, leaving floors bare _ instead of
installing wall-to-wall carpeting. Newer carpets can emit chemical
gases, he said, adding that most carpets sold today carry emission
information on their labels.
</P>
<P>
   But even old emissionless carpets can provide a hiding place for
all sorts of tiny biological nasties. ``A major portion of the
problem with indoor air pollution is antigenic material,'' said Dr.
Terry Gordon, an associate professor of environmental medicine at
the New York University School of Medicine in Tuxedo, N.Y. ``What
we're finding now is that cockroaches and dust mites might be
contributing to a lot of asthma.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon explained that while roaches and dust mites are
themselves too heavy to become airborne, their ``digestive
by-products'' are light enough to become suspended in the air.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, people who live in areas where roaches are
a problem should do everything possible to eliminate the source of
the infestation and to get carpeting, bedding and upholstered
furniture as clean as possible. It might also be worth the
investment, Gordon said, to purchase a high-quality room air
cleaner that can scrub both solid contaminants and harmful gases
from the air.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Berriman, president of Berriman Associates, a commercial
air-cleaning product distributor based in the Briarwood section of
Queens, New York City, said consumers should do their homework
before buying an air cleaner. ``There are two basic kinds of
air-cleaning machines,'' he said: ``passive and active.''
</P>
<P>
   Passive air cleaners, Berriman said, generally draw air through
the machine, where the air is filtered to remove the pollutants and
then ejected back into the room. Active air cleaners _ typically
called negative ion generators _ emit electrically-charged
particles that become attached to the pollutants, which then fall
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pluses and minuses to each,'' Berriman said,
explaining that the most important thing consumers need to know
when purchasing a stand-alone air cleaner is that different tests
are used to rate different machines.
</P>
<P>
   A passive air cleaner that is rated as 90 percent efficient
using the Atmospheric Dust Spot procedure, he said, would only
achieve an efficiency rating of 60 percent using what is known as
the DOP test, a method named after an abbreviation for the
substance dioctylphthalate, which is used in the test because it
evaporates to produce particles that are all exactly 0.3 microns in
size.
</P>
<P>
   And while both testing methods are valid, he said, consumers
should read labels carefully when comparing the efficiency of
different models to make sure that the same testing procedure was
used.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, Berriman said, consumers should look for an
air cleaner that can produce about six full air changes an hour
using a high efficiency particulate arresting filter.
</P>
<P>
   Berriman said that homeowners who want a passive air cleaner
should look for one that can produce six full air changes an hour
using a High Efficiency Particulate Arresting (HEPA) filter, which
is 99.97 percent effective in removing particles as small as 0.3
microns in size.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the market for an active air cleaner _ or negative ion
generator _ should find one that does not produce ozone as a
by-product, because of health concerns associated with that
substance.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, he said, a machine that would adequately filter
a 400-square-foot room with an eight-foot ceiling would cost about
$400. (The formula for calculating the size of the machine needed
for a given area can be found on Berriman's Web site at
www.berriman-usa.com)

HOME COOKING HELPS KEEP KANSAS TOWN ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOLDIER, Kan. _ The sign set up in the middle of Main Street
here had a simple, chalked message:
</P>
<P>
   MEMORIAL MEALS
</P>
<P>
   8 - 4
</P>
<P>
   FREE WILL
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, on Memorial Day weekend, that sign, the 600
people it drew and the resultant profit accounted for about 6
percent of this town's annual budget -- $1,500 added to $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's comparable to Kansas City, Mo., with its $881 million
yearly budget, having citizens pass the hat for about $52 million
and hand it over with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   But then this was Soldier, population 200, and semifamous
hereabouts for the victuals it offers up on Memorial Day weekend at
its white-painted community center.
</P>
<P>
   The food? All you wanted. Chili dogs and sandwiches, salads and
fruits, cinnamon rolls and cookies, and lemonade, coffee and tea.
Plus tables covered with pies and cakes. Name a kind and it was
there.
</P>
<P>
   The cost? Those eating decided. That was what ``free will''
meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one man come in who'd brought a whole flock of people,
'' said Lena Baxter, who helps put on the get-together. ``He left
$150. Said it was a bargain at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one year we had a whole bunch of bikers. Nice folks.
Happy to have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, from as far away as Nebraska; Wichita, Kan.; Kansas City,
Mo.; and Oklahoma, leave $5 or $10 and go away more than satisfied.
Little wonder. It's all home cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Soldier's growing renown as a gastronomic destination started in
1981 when Karl Biester died. Biester had loved the little city park
next to the community hall. Members of a women's civic group called
the Soldieretta Unit decided to help his widow, Lucile Biester,
raise money for a modest shelter house with a table where people
could visit, maybe have a picnic, get out of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that started it,'' said Baxter. ``That first year we just
made a few hundred dollars. But that was enough. We got it built.''
</P>
<P>
   That shelter became a catalyst. Pretty soon another civic
organization, the So and So Club, was involved. Then the Lions
Club. People found out they could do something.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Lynn Reschick, a farmer who calls Soldier ``a Walton
kind of place,'' it was about time. That there was anybody left at
all in Soldier as the 20th century entered its last decades seemed
to defy common sense.
</P>
<P>
   In 1874, grasshoppers denuded the crops. In 1883, a tornado
ripped the town to shreds. In 1915, a disastrous flood on nearby
Soldier Creek ravaged the town. In 1934, a fire set by a faulty
kerosene stove consumed all but two or three businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it was some fire,'' said Henry Pugh, now 86. ``Burned down
almost the whole town. Both sides of Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the bank shutting its doors during the Depression,
young people leaving for big cities, the old Kansas Central
Railroad abandoning its tracks, and the closing of the schools with
consolidation in 1969, and what was left in Soldier was a
tavern/lunch counter, a feed store and a post office.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, said Reschick, the two churches -- Methodist and Christian
-- that have always been here.
</P>
<P>
   Right from the first, those planning the meals had noticed
something about Memorial Day or, as some still call it, Decoration
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Every year people came back to Soldier and the surrounding
communities -- Delia, Bucks Grove, Circleville, Whiting and
Netawaka -- to tend the graves in a half-dozen little cemeteries
where their loved ones are.
</P>
<P>
   Not just a few came -- hundreds showed up.
</P>
<P>
   They brought flowers. Decorating the graves would start Thursday
and proceed through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That custom is still alive in 1999. The Soldier cemetery last
weekend was carpeted with flowers from one end to another. It
looked like a kaleidoscope.
</P>
<P>
   And while some who came were young, the majority were middle-age
and older. Some used canes; a few needed walkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we had all these people coming home,'' said Baxter, whose
husband ran Soldier's long-departed gas station for years. ``They
needed something to eat. And what they really needed was a place
with facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the restaurant and tavern, but it's not open on
holidays. And Holton is 17 miles. People want to stay here, you
know, to visit, to see people they haven't talked to in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we thought, why not have food and raise some money?''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the 1934 fire played a part. When Soldier's City Hall
burned, there was a modicum of insurance money. With it and what
other money could be scraped up, residents built a large community
hall that could double as a place for City Council meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Architecturally, the building on the east side of Main was
undistinguished -- flat-fronted, plain, but it was amazingly deep.
There was lots of room inside, perfect for a sit-down dinner and a
hedge against bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   The flooring was hardwood, a seeming extravagance now but an
absolute necessity in the mid-1930s. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``People went to dances then,'' Pugh said. ``That was what we
did for entertainment. I remember the Saturday afternoon we
finished, and the floor on one side still lacked about a foot of
meeting the wall. Didn't matter; we had a big dance that night
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, with the passage of more than half a century,
the community hall showed some wear and tear. Its rehabilitation
became the focus of those putting on the Memorial Day meals.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the hall has been rewired,
air-conditioned and painted; a new furnace was installed; and the
restrooms were redone. That may not sound like much for big-city
people, said Baxter, but without the meals it wouldn't have been
done at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is amazing,'' said Ida Nadeau, Soldier's
mayor. ``I'm a very organized person. Everything has to be
scheduled, planned for and figured out in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the meals, they're running around, asking who's going to
do this and who'll bring that, who'll be behind the counter and how
many pies do they need. It goes on like that right up to the edge,
and then you're sure it'll be a disaster. And then, somehow, it all
falls into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau said that besides the money raised for the town, always a
worry in rural Kansas, the Memorial Day activity kept the residents
on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just down from here we had a lot with a building on it that
was falling down, just a ruin,'' she said. ``That was two years
ago, and people who came for Memorial Day noticed. Didn't complain.
But there was talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we'd gotten the building torn down, but the lot
still looked raw. People noticed that, too. This year the lot is
all cleaned up and graded, and people have really said how nice the
town looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau says those who come back don't exert pressure. But, she
adds, there's a certain truth in the old saw about how people seem
to spiff things up when company is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if they're staying to eat.

KLAN USES SOFTER RHETORIC IN EFFORT TO EXPAND MEMBERSHIP IN
MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBERLY, Mo. _ Ina Boon stood at the church lectern and, like a
sage schoolmarm, shared some lessons from her years in civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People lamented that many African-Americans today thought
the struggles for civil rights were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had already climbed the rough side of the
mountain,'' the St. Louis woman said Saturday. ``We thought we had
it made.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the Klan decided to revisit us and let us know we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people gathered at the Second Baptist Church to
protest plans for a Ku Klux Klan unit near Moberly, 35 miles north
of Columbia. Fliers distributed by the Klan have energized
opponents statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The fliers are part of an effort by some Klan groups to move
into the political mainstream. Facing competition for members, the
groups disavow the Klan's history of lynchings and cross burnings.
</P>
<P>
   The fliers certainly don't read like the type of material
normally associated with the Klan. They are free of racial slurs.
Instead, they list the group's positions on immigration, foreign
aid, gun control and education.
</P>
<P>
   They end with a plea to reclaim America's ``white Christian
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts say the softer rhetoric hides deep-rooted bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, many Moberly residents want no part of the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want one message from my lips to be heard,'' said state
Rep. Steve Gaw, a Moberly Democrat who is House speaker. ``Hate has
no place here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klan has thrived in Missouri since the 1860s. In 1871, the
governor was forced to use the militia to quell Klan terror in
southeast Missouri. By the 1920s, Klan newspapers were common, and
some political candidates acknowledged membership.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in the 1920s, the Klan had more than 1.5 million
members nationwide. The Southern Poverty Law Center estimates that
various Klan groups now have only 5,000 members in about 160
chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Two organizations that monitor hate groups report Missouri
chapters in St. Louis, Humansville, Leslie, Mountain Grove, Nixa
and Overland. The groups list no Klan chapters in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Robb, the group's national director, said the group was
expanding in mid-Missouri at the request of two members. He refused
to reveal the membership in Moberly or statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Robb is well known to those who monitor hate groups. He split
with national leaders and formed a smaller group, the Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan. He says his group is the largest, a statement
disputed by monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Robb is rarely seen in the Klan's traditional white hood. He is
more likely to appear in a business suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made a real effort to portray himself as part of the
kinder, gentler Klan,'' said Mark Potok, a spokesman for the
Southern Poverty Law Center who monitors hate groups nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, the Klan adopted a stretch of highway near St.
Louis, joining other groups that pledge to pick up litter. The
state Department of Transportation is trying to deny the
application in court.
</P>
<P>
   A former Robb associate also tried to underwrite ``All Things
Considered,'' a National Public Radio program, on KWMU-FM in St.
Louis. The station blocked its attempt in court. A Klan leader
testified that the group wanted to reach a highly educated
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Robb's writings on Moberly show a willingness to soften the
Klan's rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no time nor interest in hating black people or anyone
else of color,'' he wrote. ``Our interest is with our people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a flier, however, he wrote: ``By the time (our children)
reach adulthood, they are an obedient slave to the ideas of
race-mixing, globalism, homosexuality, abortion and dozens of
Marxist-based, liberal schemes meant to artificially lift
non-whites to a higher level of western civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he said: ``We're in a race war. It's not one
that occurs on streets with people shooting at each other. It's
occurring in the courts, in business. It's a very one-sided war
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who monitor hate groups say Robb's soft words mask the
deep hatred of minorities that other Klan groups express more
overtly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may portray a more benign image, but the rhetorical games
they play are merely a face for the same old style of bigotry,''
said Devin Burghart of the Center for New Community, which monitors
hate groups in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ratliff, state director of the NAACP, puts it more bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leopards never change their spots,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in mid-Missouri and the Department of Justice, which
monitors hate crimes statewide, report no recent violence connected
to the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Robb said his group wanted to acquire influence in Missouri
through political office. He said he would encourage ``sleeper''
candidates, who run for office without disclosing Klan membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are common, ordinary folks,'' Robb said. ``They
are not terrorists. If people are concerned about somebody driving
down the street and attacking them, they shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where the danger lies, Burghart said. He worries that
residents might become inflamed by Klan rhetoric and turn to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Burghart said, the Klan's presence could push
Moberly residents of all races to come together.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the NAACP chapter in Moberly was in danger of folding.
But the recent controversy drew one of the best turnouts in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good community,'' said Arthur Gross, a longtime
black resident. ``It's like you're taking backward steps. It's hard
to believe that it's 1999 and you still have hate groups around. We
won't stand for it.''

THE INJURED DESERVE TO BE THE ENVIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the radio the other day I heard a man say how, now that the
Kosovo nightmare is near an end, there would have to be a Marshall
Plan for the Balkans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of damage has been done, he rightly noted. And it
will need to be repaired if the people in that fractious corner of
the world are to begin to learn to live together, if not in
harmony, then at least without savaging one another. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But now let's speak of conditions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly help -- generous help -- is owed to those countries in
the region that have borne the principal burden of the humanitarian
emergency, Albania and Macedonia chief among them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the reconstruction effort, of course, must be in
Kosovo, where the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and his
political and military cohorts unleashed a frenzy of terror and
destruction that has claimed thousands of lives and sent a tragic
multitude of refugees fleeing the region. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many, perhaps most, have nothing to go back to. Homes and
villages have been blasted or burned. Murder has taken their loved
ones. Torture and rape have scarred the survivors. Their most
intimate possessions have been ripped from them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There even are reports of Serbs turning on their longtime
Albanian neighbors, joining in the pillage. As nearly as can be
said of any population today, they have lost everything --
property, trust, their hope of a reasonable future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, insofar as it is possible, let us set out to restore the
Kosovar Albanians' prospect for safe and decent lives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, put in place international peacekeepers to guarantee
their protection. Evict, forcibly if necessary, those who usurped
their lands and goods. Then set to work to reconstruct their
shattered world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Build each family a house, finer than it had before, and furnish
it sufficiently. Build schools. Build hospitals. Provide them the
means and machinery _ tractors, harvesters, seed, fertilizer and so
forth _ to restore their economy. Give whatever resources and
technical aid are necessary to ensure that that happens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a word, make those who have suffered in this affair the envy
of those who injured them. The task is large and will cost
something, but it is not unimaginable. For the numbers are not so
great. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The job could be done several times over for less than this
little war has cost, and far less than we have spent in other parts
of the world trying to impose civility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what of the Serbs? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After all, it will be argued, not all of them were guilty. Not
all of them supported Milosevic -- not at the outset, anyway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombs and missiles have destroyed buildings and bridges,
and shattered the infrastructure across much of Serbia. Who will
remedy all this harm? Why should a whole people be made to pay for
the crimes of a few? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer, not wholly satisfactory but perhaps the best
available, is that people have always paid a price for allowing
themselves to be ruled by wicked and unprincipled men. And the man
who authored this ordeal still rules in Belgrade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So not one cent, I would hope _ not of my tax money anyway _ to
make the Yugoslav Serbs whole! Not until the other and more urgent
work is finished. And not until Milosevic, his cronies and all who
took part in this barbarity have been brought to trial and made to
pay for their crimes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then will be soon enough to consider what might be done to help
Serbia repair the ruin it called down upon itself. &QL;

NOT ALL SAY FED WILL RAISE INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street's rising anxiety over the prospect of higher
interest rates may be roiling both the stock and bond markets for
no rational reason. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The concern began to mount last month when the Federal Reserve's
monetary policy panel adjourned by announcing it was leaving
interest rates alone but signaling a bias toward a boost rather
than a cut. The caveat meant continuing signs of inflation would be
met with an increase in the short-term rates controlled by the
central bank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets have been in a tizzy ever since. Stock
prices have been choppy, and many bond yields are at their highest
levels in more than a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the May reading of the index of the National Association of
Purchasing Management showed a substantial gain Tuesday, this
measure of manufacturing health was at its highest level in 19
months. What really disturbed the financial markets, though, was
the index component that tracks prices paid, which also surged to
its highest point since October 1997. The markets read this
development as ammunition for Fed inflation hawks advocating a rate
increase. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the Fed's announcement, however, is being overdone,
says Merrill Lynch analyst Jack W. Lavery. He noted in a recent
commentary that although the Fed had indicated a bias toward
tightening monetary policy 15 times since 1996, it subsequently had
raised rates only once after signaling such bias. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tame hourly earnings figures, a minute growth in the
employment cost index and continued vigor in productivity portend a
neutral Fed conclusion,'' Lavery advised. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the inflationary threat itself, Brian Wesbury says anyone
worried about it should check out what the price of gold has been
doing lately. Wesbury, chief economist for GKS&AMP;T Economics in
Chicago, says gold's price decline over the last month is more than
ample confirmation that deflation remains a greater danger than
inflation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At midweek, gold was trading just under $265 an ounce, which
represented a drop of about $25 since early May and put its price
at a 20-year low. Because gold is traditionally a barometer of
inflation anxiety, its continuing swoon reflects lack of real-world
concern about inflation, Wesbury told clients in a recent
advisory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is so despite explanations by some analysts focusing on the
effects of planned gold sales by the Bank of England and others.
Gold's slump has nothing to do with any announced sales, Wesbury
contends, because its price decline represents a problem of too
little demand instead of an anticipated supply glut. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wesbury concurs with Lavery's view that conventional wisdom has
gone too far in anticipating a rate increase by the Fed. In fact,
he says, a strong dollar, weak commodity prices and a relatively
high federal funds rate indicate monetary policy is too tight
instead of too loose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The continued strong growth of the gross domestic product aside,
Wesbury says if Fed policy were too loose, other indicators
wouldn't be as weak as they are. He says weakness in retail sales
and durable-goods orders, for instance, are significant signs of
slowing growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes Wesbury the boldest of contrarians. He's
brave enough to predict that the Fed's next move will be a rate cut
instead of the boost that conventional wisdom is expecting. &QL;

TALKS ON DETAILS OF PULLOUT BEGIN AS BOMBING CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Underlining the haze between war and peace in
Yugoslavia, NATO had its peacekeeping chief for Kosovo detail peace
terms to Yugoslav military leaders throughout the day Saturday,
then rained bombs and missiles on Yugoslav military targets at
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are expected to resume Sunday in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   For more than five hours, British Lieutenant General Michael
Jackson, who commands some 16,000 NATO forces in Macedonia,
delivered the terms for an orderly and verifiable pullout of 40,000
Serbian forces from the war-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   The plan requires Yugoslavia's military to begin its pullout
within 24 hours of an agreement and complete it in seven days. Once
NATO has evidence Serb forces are withdrawing, it will suspend its
10-week-old bombing campaign of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Without final approval of the conditions Saturday by the
Yugoslav military, NATO launched new attacks on Yugoslav positions
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night in Kosovo and other parts of Serbia. Yugoslav
forces shelled the Albanian border town of Kruma, a base for the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. There were no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman in Brussels privately questioned why Belgrade,
which has lost many troops during the 74-day air campaign, would
prolong the suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Such questions arose when the Serbian delegation arrived three
hours late for the meeting. Late in the afternoon, the Serbian
officials asked for an additional hour to confer with Yugoslav
leaders in Belgrade, according to Lieutenant Colonel Robin
Clifford, a NATO spokesman. After more than two hours of delay, the
talks were suspended for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford, a British officer, said it was ``a very constructive
day of very positive talks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each point of the military-technical agreement has been
discussed word-by-word, line-by-line, sentence-by-sentence,''
Clifford said. ``What we now have is a full understanding . . . on
what it actually requires the Yugoslav delegation and the Yugoslav
armed forces to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman David Leavey did not signal a
breakdown in the talks. ``There's obviously a number of very
important, very detailed elements of compliance that need to be
gone over between the two militaries,'' he said, `` and that's what
we're in the process of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesmen said the Yugoslav delegation of senior army and
police officers pored over maps of Kosovo as Jackson gave
instructions on how they should extricate their forces from the
province. One aim was to coordinate timetables and routes so that
NATO pilots would not fire on the withdrawing Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was held at a roadside cafe called Europa, near the
border checkpoint at Blace where more than a quarter of the 800,000
ethnic Albanians forced from Kosovo have crossed into Macedonia.
Participants were served a lunch of cheese and spinach pastries,
and they took one 10-minute break to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Despite signs that a cease-fire might be imminent, there was no
pause in NATO's air campaign. NATO flew more than 500 sorties and
struck at least 130 targets in Kosovo and Yugoslavia, alliance
officials in Brussels said.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth consecutive day, there were no bombing raids in
the Yugoslav capital. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon would not
confirm NATO intentionally was sparing Belgrade during the Blace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said a halt in NATO's bombing depended
on the Serbian military agreeing to Jackson's instructions and
beginning the withdrawal. ``NATO will not stop the bombing campaign
until we see concrete evidence of them withdrawing,'' Shea said.
``It is all up to the Serbs. They know what they have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the Pentagon had no evidence a pullout was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said Saturday that while the White House
was hopeful about ending the war, ``caution is the watchword.''
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``has broken his promises in
the past,'' Gore said on CNN. ``We want to see the facts on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic still has made no public comment to explain why he
sued for peace and accepted nearly the same terms offered before
the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Shea stressed that the Blace meeting was ``not a negotiating
session, not a place for haggling or equivocation . . . not a place
to discuss the size or the positioning of the conference table.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place for decision and action,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shea, Jackson demanded that Yugoslav military
leaders agree to the following measures in order for the bombing to
stop:
</P>
<P>
   --The phased and rapid withdrawal of all Serb ground forces,
including the regular army, armed civilian groups, national guards,
border, military, and antiterrorist police, and intelligence
services.
</P>
<P>
   --The dismantling of Serbian air forces and air defense systems
inside Kosovo, including the swift removal of all aircraft, radars,
surface-to-air missiles and antiaircraft artillery.
</P>
<P>
   --The disclosure of information on the location and types of
land mines in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a multinational peacekeeping force of 50,000 is
building, Bacon said, and five NATO countries, the United States,
Britian, France, Germany, and Italy, are preparing to police
specific sectors of Kosovo. They will face the challenges of
demining, setting up an infrastructure for their own troops, and
then helping get the ethnic Albanians to their homes by rebuilding
roads and bridges, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulk of the boots on the ground will be Marine boots,'' he
said, noting that the first wave of US Marines will begin arriving
in Greece Sunday and head toward Macedonia Monday. The British are
sending 12,000 soldiers, the United States 7,000, the French 6,500.
Others will come from Italy, Germany, and a number of non-NATO
countries.
</P>
<P>
   No Russian military officials took part at the Blace meeting,
though they were invited. Russian troops are expected to be
included among the Kosovo peacekeepers, but NATO and Russian
officials have not yet agreed on the size of the force or who will
command it. ``NATO has made it clear we want a unified command
structure,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Moscow, Victor Chermomyrdin, the Russian envoy who helped
broker the peace deal, said Saturday no Russian peacekeepers would
be under NATO command. ``If NATO countries participate there . . .
they will be led by NATO itself,'' Chernomyrdin told Russian
television. ``As regards Russian participation, we will never be
under NATO. Never. This is ruled out.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, a spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army told CNN
the rebels view Russia as a Serb ally, and they would not agree to
keep the peace if Russians were commanding their own forces in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to cooperate with NATO,'' said Pleurat Sejdiu, a
political representative for the KLA. ``We very much welcome the
single command. We will not accept a separate command of Russian
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Sejdiu said the KLA, which has been fighting for Kosovo's
independence, also was anxious about the political consequences of
the peace deal. ``There will be a political struggle now that the
military struggle has ended,'' Sejdiu predicted. ``Nobody can think
the Albanian struggle for independence stops here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Serb forces leave Kosovo, NATO is counting on the KLA
rebels to disband, put down their weapons, and turn into a civilian
police force. Under the terms of the agreement in Rambouillet,
France, which KLA representatives signed earlier this year but the
Serbs did not, the rebels were to demilitarize, give up most of
their arms and stop wearing their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Shea urged the KLA to renounce violence and abide
strictly by the alliance's orders for ending the war or face NATO's
firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Major General Walter Jertz, a NATO military spokesman, confirmed
ongoing fighting between Serbian forces and the KLA along the
Albanian border. Jertz called the disarming of the KLA ``a separate
issue, and it's a difficult issue,'' in reaching a peaceful
settlement of the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon noted that once ethnic Albanian refugees begin returning
to Kosovo, it may not be ``happy place'' for the Serbian minority
that lives there. ``I don't think Serbs will want to stay there,''
Bacon said. ``I think they'll want to return to Serbia.''

HOT RANGERS PITCHING HELPS TEXAS SIZZLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The center of the baseball universe this weekend is not Yankee
Stadium and it certainly isn't Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, the Texas Rangers and
Arizona Diamondbacks are hotter than the weather outside in the
most exciting battle of division leaders on the interleague
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who have added impressive pitching to their usually
fierce offense, came into Friday night with a nine-game winning
streak, their longest in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson took a no-hitter into
the seventh inning and won 11-3, the Rangers are threatening to run
away with the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for the Angels, who are sniping at manager Terry
Collins from last place in the division. But it's also trouble for
the Dodgers, who play host to the Rangers in a three-game series
beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally doing what people said we could do in spring
training,'' said third baseman Todd Zeile, the former Dodger.
``Early on we were hanging on with offense. We'd lose the
low-scoring games or outslug the other team to win. These nine
games, we've shown that our starting pitching is good and our
bullpen is outstanding. As a result, if we're within striking
distance after five innings, we feel we're within striking distance
of a win.''
</P>
<P>
   During the winning streak, the Rangers beat Minnesota 3-2 on
Sunday and Kansas City 3-1 on Tuesday. Those marked the first two
times the Rangers won a game scoring less than four runs. They were
0-11 when scoring less than four runs last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very important,'' said outfielder Roberto Kelly,
another former Dodger. ``Eventually we're going to run into a team
with good pitching and they won't let us score seven or eight runs.
We've got to find little ways to score.''
</P>
<P>
   One often overlooked sign of a winner is beating the teams you
are expected to beat. The Rangers are 7-1 against Minnesota. The
Dodgers are 0-3 against Pittsburgh and the Angels are just 2-4
against Detroit and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice for the Rangers to have MVP Jose Gonzalez, who had 10
homers in May; Rafael Palmeiro, who returned to the club this year
and is among the league leaders in average (.360) and homers (15);
and Ivan Rodriguez, who ended a 20-game hitting streak Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest improvement, however, has been the starting
pitching, which had a very credible 4.04 ERA during the streak. As
a result, the Rangers are starting to feel much better about their
rotation. Going into the winning streak, Rangers starting pitchers
had a 7.00 combined ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are plenty good enough,'' manager Johnny Oates
said. ``Our guys are as good as anybody's guys, it's a matter of
going out and doing what they are capable of doing. They may not
have a 3.90 ERA at the end, but it's going to be good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning streak gives the Rangers a little room in the West
and general manager Doug Melvin doesn't feel the pressure of giving
up premium prospects in a trade for a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, they were in a late-season struggle with the Angels
for the AL West title. At the trade deadline, they sent top
prospect Fernando Tatis to St. Louis for pitcher Todd Stottlemyre
and shortstop Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Texas made the playoffs but was swept by the New York Yankees in
the first round. Stottlemyre then left through free agency and
signed with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   When the team got off to a slow start this year, there were
feelers made to acquire pitching. But the price always was the
same: outfielder Ruben Mateo, the new kid on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro Martinez, David Cone, they're not available,'' Melvin
said. ``I haven't asked lately, but those kind of pitchers aren't
available, even if you said Ruben Mateo. You have a short list of
No.1 starters; then I'm not sure there's a huge difference between
what you call No. 2, 3 and 4 starters in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be something better, but the cost might not make
sense. You keep digging holes if you give up young players.'' &QL;

SEATTLE HURT: NO MARTINEZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mariners play in San Diego this weekend, then onto Colorado
beginning Monday, meaning a six-game stretch without DH and cleanup
hitter Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Although this past week the Mariners reached 100 homers faster
than any team in major-league history, Martinez's loss will hurt
the lineup. He no longer plays in the field and will be limited to
pinch-hitting duties for a week.
</P>
<P>
   And Seattle pitchers are bad enough pitchers, let alone hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interleague play hurts us more than some teams, because we
have an every-day DH and he's a huge part of our offense,''
Mariners manager Lou Piniella said. ``We lose our cleanup hitter
and get a pitcher hitting for six games? That's not a good trade
for us.'' &QL; 
DL FOR ARROYO
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rolando Arroyo was the Tampa Bay Devil Rays first
All-Star. Now the club has done him a favor by putting him on the
disabled list. The reason is mild tendinitis in his pitching
shoulder, but he is not bad enough physically to lose 5 mph off his
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say he has lost his competitive edge. In 302/3 innings
at Tropicana Field this season, Arrojo is 0-5 with 52 hits _ almost
two per inning _ and 30 earned runs, an 8.80 ERA. His problems at
home go back to last season, going 1-9 there since July 2. &QL; 
SIGNABILITY
</P>
<P>
   Using compensation picks for Albert Belle and Robin Ventura, the
White Sox were able to claim five of the top 23 pitchers in the
draft, according to ratings by Baseball America, and six of the top
33 overall.
</P>
<P>
   They are saying it was a better draft than 1997 when they
selected Crescenta Valley and UCLA left-hander Jim Parque, now in
the big leagues. The only question is whether they can afford to
sign their top picks. It took six months for the Sox to sign last
year's top choice, right-hander Kip Wells, who eventually received
a $1.495 million bonus. They failed to sign Detroit Tigers
right-hander Jeff Weaver after drafting him in '97 but have since
slashed the major-league payroll. &QL; 
RAPPING HIS MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   The song players choose for their walk to the plate has caused
some problems at Yankee Stadium. New outfielder Tony Tarasco's
selection was a rap song from the soundtrack of ``Belly'' by Hype
Williams that contained several obscene references _ and were
clearly audible to fans Tuesday in his at-bat. When Tarasco batted
in later innings, the music had been changed to a Backman Turner
Overdrive song. The club later said the PA attendant was on his
first day on the job and would be disciplined. &QL; 
HIGH AND TIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Jaret Wright's surprise when the Indians right-hander
entered AL president Gene Budig's office Tuesday to discuss
recently hitting Boston's Darren Lewis and Detroit's Tony Clark
with pitches near or on the head. At the meeting was Hall of Famer
Bob Gibson, who intimidated batters throughout his career with St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, a consultant to Budig, was reportedly there to talk to
Jaret about pitching inside _ a how-to lesson, so to speak. The
meeting took place before Wright's next start, against the Red Sox.
He didn't pitch inside and was shelled for eight runs on nine hits
in 32/3 innings. &QL; 
TOUGH SPOT
</P>
<P>
   The ``personal situation'' that forced Red Sox right-hander Mark
Portugal to leave the club last week was an offshoot of a messy
divorce. According to a report in the Providence Journal, the
source of Portugal's problems center on visitation rights for his
children, who live in Barrington, R.I. Part of the reason Portugal,
36, signed with the Sox was to be closer to his kids. Portugal
cleaned out his locker after Monday's 8-7 victory over Detroit and
talked to teammates about retirement but announced Friday he will
stay with the team. Now in his 15th season, Portugal signed a
one-year, $3-million deal with Boston in December. &QL; 
FINALLY
</P>
<P>
   Toronto manager Jim Fregosi, commenting on NL umpiring crew
chief, Frank Pulli, using a TV replay Monday to overturn,
correctly, a homer for the Marlins' Cliff Floyd:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say anything because Frank lives right down
the street from me (in Tarpon Springs, Fla.) and I don't want him
burning anything in my lawn. I will say that Frank's wife isn't
going to be happy with the fine he's going to get. She's tougher
than him.... Has better vision, too.''

TAKING AIM AT VALENTINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Angels' Terry Collins is lucky. He is just disliked by a few
players on his team. Mets manager Bobby Valentine appears to be
hated by just about everyone in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So says his center fielder, Brian McRae, who places part of the
blame for the Mets' eight-game losing streak on the way opposing
teams get charged up for the Mets, based on their personal dislike
for Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   McRae is incensed with the way Valentine is rotating five
outfielders: himself, Bobby Bonilla, Rickey Henderson, Roger Cedeno
and Benny Agbayani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys, when they come to the ballpark expecting to play
and don't, their whole day is ruined,'' McRae said. ``And when they
don't expect to play, and do play, they start panicking. It's
easier when you know what's going on on a day-to-day basis. This
game is hard enough to play without having other things on your
mind to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of grit that the Mets took into this weekend's
series with the crosstown Yankees. Saturday was considered the
biggest day in New York sports history with the Yankees/Mets game,
the Belmont Stakes with Triple Crown implications and an NBA
Eastern Conference final game between the Knicks and Indiana
Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's the price we pay for playing in New York,''
closer John Franco said. ``Going up against (David) Cone and El
Duque (Orlando Hernandez) and Roger Clemens... that's like facing
John Smoltz and Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux on the last weekend of
the season last year.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Mets lost all of those games. &QL; 
D'BACKS STINGING
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Matt Williams and Jay Bell were the first teammates to
hit at least 15 homers in the first 50 games of a National League
season since Hank Aaron and Rico Carty did it in 1975. Bell also
was the first in the NL to reach 50 runs, on pace to score 153
runs. That would rank 10th in major-league history. Babe Ruth has
the record with 177 in 1921. Lou Gehrig scored 167 in 1936, the
last time anyone has scored as many as 152. Ted Williams had 150 in
1949. &QL; 
RED LETTER DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati went into interleague play on a 5-1 roll as part of a
12-game road trip. The rest of the trip includes games against
beatable Kansas City and Minnesota. The Reds took two of three from
Florida and swept New York for the first time at Shea Stadium since
July 7-9, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the (opponents') records, you say, `We can
handle this club,''' manager !boldJack McKeon said. ``But still,
road wins are road wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds won 10 of their last 12 away from home heading into the
weekend and are right behind the Cubs in the early wild-card race.
Overall, they had won 13 of their last 17 games and were five games
over .500 for the first time since the end of 1995, when they won
the NL Central. &QL; 
IS A PATTERN FORMING?
</P>
<P>
   For the seventh time in eight years, Colorado selected a pitcher
in the first round of the draft _ Jason Jennings from Baylor. The
exception was Todd Helton in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The others haven't exactly been success stories: '92: John
Burke, now retired after being a bust; '93: Jamey Wright, now in
the minors; '94: Doug Million, who died from an asthma attack after
underachieving in the minors; '96: Jake Westbrook (traded to
Montreal in the Mike Lansing deal); '97: Mike Mangum (traded along
with Westbrook) and '98: Matt Roney, who underwent surgery to
repair a torn labrum one day before this year's draft. &QL; 
BIG BROTHER
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs had five fans arrested last weekend for throwing Oh
Henry! bars onto the field during a game against St. Louis.
Throwing the candy had become a tradition in Montreal after Henry
Rodriguez hit home runs. The five fans are to appear in court later
this month on charges of disorderly conduct, and the Cubs could use
video from new surveillance cameras as evidence. The cameras were
installed because fans in the bleachers at Wrigley Field had become
more rowdy than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will pay their fines for them because it's a rule they
probably didn't know,'' Rodriguez said. ``You have to let the fans
know what the rules are and they'll follow the rules.''

DID AIR POWER ALONE FORCE MILOSEVIC TO YIELD?

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a strange development, but President Clinton might end up
best-remembered as the first leader in history to win a war with
air power alone.
</P>
<P>
   Most military analysts have long held such an achievement to be
impossible. Bombing can wear out and soften up the enemy, the
argument goes, but ultimately, only troops on the ground can push
an army out of occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after suffering 72 days of NATO bombing, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic surrendered as close to unconditionally as
anyone might have imagined. And he did so without a single NATO
soldier firing a shot from the ground or any troops amassing on his
borders.
</P>
<P>
   A debate will probably rage for months or years over just which
pressures led Milosevic to cave. The outcome of this debate could
have dramatic consequences, well into the next century, for the
contours of global diplomacy, the perception of American power, and
the structure of the American military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that strategic bombing _ punishment of the
Serbian population _ did the deal here,'' said Robert Pape,
professor at Dartmouth College, whose book, ``Bombing to Win,''
demonstrated that air power by itself has never won a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it did work, you're going to see a lot more use of air
power, because it's really easy to punish populations, and you
don't lose any American lives,'' Pape continued. ``You could get
rid of the Army, a lot of the Navy, and just use cruise missiles to
blow up power plants. This will be the US Air Force's world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape and other analysts, for now, are holding back from such a
judgment. For one thing, it is not entirely clear that air power
did win all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, US and NATO officials say, the Kosovo
Liberation Army grew a lot stronger _ so much so that its raids on
Serbian military positions forced Serb troops to come out of hiding
and fight. As they did so, US A-10 attack planes suddenly appeared
overhead and pummeled Serbian tanks, armored personnel vehicles,
and artillery.
</P>
<P>
   If this one-two punch was what tipped the balance of power, it
nonetheless puts a new twist to the traditional concept of
``combined-arms'' warfare. The idea used to be that air power would
assist the troops on the ground. Now, it seems, ground troops serve
as little more than feints to bring the enemy out in the open, and
force him to concentrate into target-packets for the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, military specialist at the Federation of American
Scientists, thinks both types of air warfare _ bombing the Serbian
troops in Kosovo and the various targets in Belgrade and other Serb
cities _ took their toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite possible that Milosevic would have been content
letting his 19-year-old draftees get slaughtered in the field, if
everything was fine at home,'' Pike said. ``He might have been
content if he was doing well militarily in Kosovo, despite all the
destruction in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when he was getting degraded everywhere _ when everything
was going against him _ then that's when he had no choice but give
up,'' Pike continued.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Arkin, a former US Army intelligence officer and a
consultant to the United Nations, said, ``The main thing is that
Milosevic failed to achieve his objective _ which was to wait it
out till the NATO coalition collapsed. That didn't happen. The war
ended because Milosevic didn't outlast the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Arkin said, all of NATO's fine-tuned strategies
concerning which targets to hit, and in what order to
``choreograph'' the destruction, had no effect whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter what we bombed,'' Arkin said. ``It just
mattered that we bombed. It was sheer repetition, sheer brute
force, and Milosevic finally concluded it wasn't going to stop.
Before people say we need more cruise missiles or more smart
weapons, they might want to consider _ this is not calculus, this
is mystery. It is utterly unclear what it was about the bombing
that forced Milosevic to capitulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few dispute that it was bombing _ and, from the point of
view of what NATO contributed to the fight, bombing alone _ that
won the war. And that is what could change not just the way people
think about warfare but also the way the world conducts it.
</P>
<P>
   John Keegan, the eminent military historian, admitted in
Thursday's London Daily Telegraph that he was ``wrong'' to think
bombing would not be enough to win. When he first began to realize
this, he wrote, ``I turned the thought around for a while and
looked at it from several directions, rather as a Creationist
Christian might have done on being shown his first dinosaur bones.
I didn't want to change my beliefs, but there was too much evidence
accumulating to stick to the article of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan sees the war as a victory not just for air power but for
the ``New World Order'' that President Bush declared after the Gulf
War. ``If Milosevic really is a beaten man, all other would-be
Milosevics around the world will have to reconsider their plans,''
Keegan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the planes that bombed Serbia into submission took off
from distant aircraft carriers, some from the continental United
States. ``What that means is that there are now no places on Earth
that cannot be subjected to the same relentless harrowing,'' he
continued. ``What that implies . . . is that no rational ruler will
choose to commit the crimes that have attracted such punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion here is that, just as British gunboats once
sailed by distant lands and imposed order by threatening to shell
the harbor, now American B-2 bombers will fly over distant lands
and impose order by threatening to drop smart bombs on their power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts shudder at this possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot A. Cohen, professor at the Johns Hopkins School for
Advanced International Studies and author of the US Air Force's
five-volume study of the air war against Iraq, said of Keegan's
view, ``That would be a very dangerous lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen continued, ``Yes, in a sense, air power won. We threw
everything we had at a country whose gross domestic product is
one-15th the size of the US military budget, and after 72 days and
a lot of mess-ups, we succeeded. Maybe that's our future. But to
draw sweeping generalizations for air power _ that's a big mistake.
In 20 years' time, if we're up against the Chinese, it's a
different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also cautioned, ``Other people react to these sorts of
things.'' If Western leaders suddenly conclude that knocking out a
country's power plants is an effective technique of foreign policy,
then various foes might figure out ways to destroy power plants
here.
</P>
<P>
   And what if Westerners never really discover what pushed
Milosevic over the edge?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's true that bombing did it all I want to know that it's
true, I want to know the world has changed,'' Pape said. ``Maybe it
is true, maybe it's a new world now. But if it's not and we think
it is, we're going to learn a lot of false lessons, we're going to
make a lot of bad mistakes.''

CHARISMATIC, INJURED AT BELMONT, IS THROUGH AS A RACE HORSE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ It wasn't the type of picture Bob Lewis and D.
Wayne Lukas had wanted nine hours earlier, when they gathered their
friends for a group photograph in front of Barn 10 on the
backstretch of Belmont Park. At 8:45 a.m. the owner and trainer
were full of hope. Their horse, Charismatic, was one and a half
miles and 11 horses away from making history as the 12th Triple
Crown winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to get one of these at 5:28 p.m.,'' Lukas
said determinedly, at the time believing they would reconvene for a
winner's-circle photo to top an anticipated Charismatic sweep on
Saturday of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the
Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, what Lewis and Lukas witnessed was an unexpected,
horrible image. Shortly after Charismatic finished third to Lemon
Drop Kid and Vision and Verse, Charismatic's jockey, Chris Antley,
pulled up his horse just beyond the wire and then leapt from the
horse's back. He fell on his seat, scrambled to his feet and began
rubbing Charismatic's left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The horse that had run five races in the last 63 days at the
highest level of the sport was limping as he boarded an ambulance
and was fitted with a pressure cast. The verdict was as swift as
Antley's reaction to his horse's discomfort _ X-rays determined
Charismatic had a lateral condylar fracture of his left front leg.
It was a complete fracture with the bone broken to the outside, as
well as a vertical fracture in his lateral sesamoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is through as a race horse. We expect him to be fine as a
stallion,'' said Dr. Larry Bramlage of the American Association of
Equine Veterinarians as he announced Charismatic would require
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure speculation, but it probably happened before the
wire. It's the type of injury that happens and they continue on
before they pull up. They try to run through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley, who found the perfect engine to drive his comeback from
depression and weight gain in the onetime claiming horse, sensed
his horse was in trouble as Charismatic barreled down the
staggering Belmont stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse from the outside came to us,'' he said of Lemon Drop
Kid, ``and passed us. At that point I rode just enough to hang on
for third. I had stopped whipping. Heading for the finish he
suddenly dipped underneath me and I could tell he was in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   In their box seats, Lewis and Lukas' disappointment at being
thwarted in the history books was suddenly washed over with
concern. Antley's face was ghostly, and tears streamed down his
face moments after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke down right after we crossed the wire,'' said Antley,
sobbing. ``He gave us a lot. He gave America a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, whose horse Silver Charm was beaten here two years ago by
Touch Gold and denied the Triple Crown, also was visibly shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only concern right now is Charismatic,'' Lewis said. ``We
hope to God he is going to be fine. We accepted the accolades in
Louisville and Baltimore and today was just one of those things
that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a heart-wrenching end to a day that began with so much
promise when Charismatic welcomed the daylight to Long Island with
an easy stroll on the Belmont track at 5:17 a.m. With Lukas on a
pony next to him and the exercise rider Joanne McNamara on his
back, Charismatic seemed eager to take on his rivals and bring home
a bonus of $5 million for his owners.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, perhaps he was too eager. Lewis said Charismatic had
been a bit agitated in the morning. ``Wayne said he was ready to
run, that he was a little upset that he could only walk this
morning,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Charismatic didn't leave that eagerness to run in
the barn. Instead of tracking the front runners early in the race,
as he did brilliantly to win the first two legs of the Triple
Crown, Charismatic dueled the filly, Silverbulletday, for the first
one and a half miles of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe he ran away with her,'' said Silverbulletday's
rider, Jerry Bailey, of the early pressure from Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I could see his horse was kind of rank. I looked over and
he was trying to pull him back but he couldn't get him back.''
</P>
<P>
   The great-grandson of Secretariat had captured the public's
imagination because of his modest background and his fondness for
hard work and the feed tub. He escaped from the claiming ranks
where he could have been bought for $62,500 back in February when
Lukas decided to bear down on his training and racing schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week, we talked about how maintenance-free this horse was
and how durable he is,'' said Lukas, whose training accomplishments
include unprecedented earnings of $200 million and a record 19
Eclipse Award winners. ``It's racing, and these things happen and
we have to deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians here indicated Charismatic's injury was a freak
accident, but that probably won't discourage critics of the
trainer, who believe Lukas is too hard on his horses in his search
for victories _ he has 12 _ in the grueling Triple Crown races. His
integrity and horsemanship were savaged when Union City, a horse
some believed was not sound, fractured a leg during the 1993
Preakness Stakes and did not survive.
</P>
<P>
   Other breakdowns by Lukas stars have followed; the 1994
Preakness winner, Tabasco Cat, was retired with a leg injury at the
age of 4; the 1994 champion juvenile filly, Flanders, broke a bone
in the Breeders' Cup and was retired; the 1995 Preakness winner,
Timber Country, strained leg tendons and was retired on the eve of
the Belmont, and the 1995 Kentucky Derby winner, Thunder Gulch,
fractured a cannon bone in his foreleg five months after the Derby
at the Jockey Club Gold Cup and was also retired. In 1996, his
Derby winner, Grindstone, was injured and retired before the
Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was subdued and had adopted an all-business approach early
in the day of his run at history. He was downright somber by the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a victory photo, the Lewis-Lukas camps were looking
at X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   The fragile nature of horse racing had again taken much of the
air out of the day.

YUGOSLAV LEADER RECEIVED CONTRADICTORY ADVICE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Did Leposava Ristic have to die?
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old grandmother was working the fields when NATO
bombs peppered the rural countryside of Donji Neradovac in southern
Serbia last Monday morning. She died where she fell, on the land
her family has farmed for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepted
a deal that was not even as good for him as the one he could have
had 11 weeks ago, before NATO warplanes laid waste his country,
killing hundreds of innocents like Ristic, and before he was
indicted on war crimes charges for overseeing the expulsion of
800,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO and Yugoslav generals huddled  &UR; yesterday &LR;  on the
Macedonia-Serbia border, working out the logistics of a Yugoslav
withdrawal from Kosovo, it remained unclear why Milosevic suddenly
capitulated to NATO's demands. Milosevic has yet to make a
statement or address the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview  &UR; yesterday &LR; , a member of Milosevic's Cabinet
and one of his closest advisers described a fierce debate between
those who urged Milosevic to fight NATO to the end and those who
urged him to cut the country's losses.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being someone Milosevic listens to, Bogoljub Karic is
one of the richest men in Yugoslavia. A millionaire businessman, he
said he accepted a Cabinet position to steer his country toward a
free-market economy and away from its isolationist policies. For
the last month, Milosevic listened as Karic and other influential
Serb businessmen argued that the battered Yugoslav economy could
take no more.
</P>
<P>
   Karic credits Milosevic with making ``a courageous decision'' to
end the war. He said the debate was ferocious when members of
Milosevic's inner circle reviewed their options May 27, the day the
international war crimes tribunal announced it had indicted
Milosevic and four of his deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Karic said he had been arguing for acceptance of the principles
outlined by the Group of Eight nations, which would allow foreign
peacekeeping troops into Kosovo under the auspices of the United
Nations. He said Vojislav Seslj, the deputy prime minister and
leader of the ultranationalist Radical Party, argued for all-out
war, urging Milosevic to enlist the Christian Orthodox church
hierarchy to call ordinary citizens to arms.
</P>
<P>
   Karic said it was an emotional debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One archbishop from Kosovo called me a traitor,'' said Karic,
who is from Kosovo. ``I hugged him and kissed him and told him this
is the only way Kosovo will stay in Serbia. The Radicals said that
NATO will get tired, that there will be an uprising by the people
to go into Kosovo, but these were delusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Karic said that before Milosevic was indicted, the government
had been leaning toward pushing for a peace deal based on the
principles of the Group of Eight, which consists of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations plus Russia. He feared that Milosevic
would feel cornered by the indictment, which he called provocation
from some Western powers who wanted the war to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the indictments were announced, we expected a negative
reaction by our leadership,'' Karic said. ``It was a very rough
night. We were looking at total isolation and total war,
annihilation. But President Milosevic ignored it and extended his
hand in reconciliation. He surprised the whole world. We now have
to grasp the opportunity and bring about total stability in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   By the next day, May 28, when Russian envoy Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin arrived here to meet with Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president had already decided to seek a deal based on the G-8
principles, Karic said. Chernomyrdin returned five days later, this
time with President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, and by Thursday
 &UR; afternoon &LR;  Milosevic had formally agreed to the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Karic's version of events portray Milosevic in the kindest of
lights, as a leader who swallowed his pride to save his people from
more suffering. But Karic rejects suggestions that Milosevic should
resign for the good of his people, even though the United States
and European Union have said they will not pay for the
reconstruction of Yugoslavia as long as Milosevic is its leader.
</P>
<P>
   He called Milosevic a ``moderating influence'' on the likes of
Seslj, who has vowed to quit the governing coalition and bring down
the government rather than allow foreign troops into Kosovo. Karic
said the West should rebuild the shattered country ``without
preconditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the West may find it hard to believe Karic's version,
that Milosevic magnanimously accepted defeat to save his country
from further suffering. This, after all, is a leader who started
four wars in 10 years and lost them all, causing untold suffering
in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and finally Kosovo, while the
standard of living for Yugoslavia's 10 million people sank as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   The government here insists it has guaranteed that Kosovo will
remain part of Yugoslavia, and that by holding out for more than 70
days of bombing it made sure that the United Nations, not NATO,
would oversee the postwar administration of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But given the damage done to the country's infrastructure,
including 41 bridges that have been destroyed, it was an enormous
cost to pay for some political cover. None of the Western allies
wanted Kosovo to become independent or join a greater Albania in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   There are other explanations for why Milosevic suddenly
capitulated. One aide to a Yugoslav Cabinet minister said that the
entire country faced being without electricity within two weeks if
the war carried on.
</P>
<P>
   A politician says that Milosevic and his Cabinet finally
realized that the Russians, who had been sticking up for them and
chastising NATO for its bombing campaign, were getting nowhere with
NATO. Given its own financial mess, Russia needs the West more than
it needs Yugoslavia, this theory holds.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that Milosevic's health is deteriorating. Rumors that
he suffered a stroke have been stoked by his recent appearances on
television, in which the left side of his mouth appears droopy and
his left arm appears lifeless. Karic, however, said Milosevic's
health is good and had nothing to do with his decision to take the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But there were other cracks in the carefully cultivated image of
national unity. In Nis, headquarters of the Yugoslav Third Army,
which was hunkered down in Kosovo, conscripts were refusing to
report to their units. Last week, 24 reservists were arrested in
Krusevac for refusing to report for duty, just a week after there
were several days of protests against the war in that town. In
Cacak, a group of residents was arrested after organizing antiwar
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than follow Seslj into Kosovo to fight for the province
that contains religious and heritage sites important to them, more
Serbs were beginning to ask why they were enduring daily bombings,
blackouts, water outages, and lines for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   It is unknown how many Yugoslav soldiers and police were killed
in Kosovo. The commander of the Third Army in Kosovo, General
Nebojsa Pavkovic, said about 1 percent, or 1,800, of his 180,000
men had been killed by the airstrikes. NATO estimates the figure at
three times that. There were near-riots in some towns in southern
Serbia when coffins of soldiers came home en masse three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why their president allowed their country to be
bombed when he could have got just as much by giving in sooner,
some Serbs tell a variation of the same joke: A group of cannibals
surrounded Milosevic, telling him they would eat him unless he gave
them $3 million, dug a mile-long trench, or drank a bucket of
manure. Milosevic began digging, but gave up just short of his
goal. He drank as much of the manure he could stomach, but didn't
finish it. Finally, he handed over the $3 million.

REBUILDING KOSOVO A DAUNTING TASK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is called a DART squad, a small group of American
disaster-relief specialists now being assembled to go into Kosovo
as Serb forces retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The Disaster Assistance Response Team, under the auspices of the
Agency for International Development, will investigate one of the
biggest mysteries of the war: the fate of a half-million ethnic
Albanians who have been hiding in the hills and forests of the
devastated region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there may be hundreds of thousands of people with
inadequate or no access to food or medicine,'' Harriet Babbitt,
acting director of the agency, said in a telephone interview. ``For
all the problems of the refugees now in Albania and Macedonia, none
have been hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from ending with the conclusion of the military conflict in
the Balkans, humanitarian-assistance operations will need to expand
dramatically in the weeks ahead to cope with the internally
displaced people of Kosovo. At the same time, aid agencies will
continue to care for refugees in Albania and Macedonia who remain
fearful of returning, plus those who will begin trickling back into
Kosovo but have little or nothing to return to.
</P>
<P>
   So devastated is Kosovo, with 80 percent of the homes destroyed,
according to UN officials, that most relief officials doubt that
many of the refugees will be repatriated before winter. An
estimated 443,000 refugees are in Albania, 248,800 in Macedonia,
and 70,000 in Montenegro. Since early April, another 75,000 have
been sent to other countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the International Rescue Committee began
high-altitude air drops of high-energy rations for refugees
displaced within Kosovo. When Serb forces shut down their
antiaircraft batteries in Kosovo, as the NATO conditions demand,
these missions will expand and be flown at low altitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those refugees who have come out who were internally displaced
have been in worse condition than those who just left their
homes,'' said Babbitt. ``We are looking at a two-track operation as
the settlement goes forward. It is going to be a huge
undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   It is just one of the upcoming costs in a sea of costs,
estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, that will be part of
the disaster-relief, peacekeeping, and rebuilding effort for the
war-ravaged province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning,'' said Anwyn Hurxthal, an official
with Oxfam America, a Boston-based humanitarian operation active in
the Balkans. ``Our concern is that as the media spotlight moves on
to other things, people will relax and think the problem is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Kosovo price tag, billions more will be needed to
reconstruct the rest of Yugoslavia and the economically battered
nations surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky is really the limit,'' said Chris Helman, a senior
analyst with the Center for Defense Information, a Washington think
tank. ``The US is looking to shift the burden to its European
allies, but whether they will sit still for it is highly
doubtful.''
</P>
<P>
   At least verbally, European leaders are stepping up to the
plate. Romano Prodi, incoming president of the European Commission,
said last week the European Union would need to allocate $6 billion
a year for the next five years to Balkan rebuilding. Other European
officials spoke of the continent's moral obligation to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe will have to be generous in assistance to reconstruct
civil life and civil society in the Balkans,'' said Chris Patten, a
British official who is joining the European Commission and has
been mentioned as a possible successor to Javier Solana as civilian
chief of NATO. Patten met with Globe editors on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the European Union should also be ``much more
fervent and positive'' about enlarging its membership in order to
help elevate the economic status of the nations of southeastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With the fighting winding down, Helman and other analysts said
money originally appropriated for Operation Allied Force can be
redirected to the 50,000-member peacekeeping force that will soon
enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Kosiak of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments, a Washington research group, estimated that the cost
of deploying the 7,000 US troops in the peacekeeping force will be
$2 billion to $3.5 billion a year. For the next year, that could
easily be covered by the unused portion of the $10.9 billion in
emergency Defense Department funding that Congress approved last
month, said Kosiak. Half of that money was for the war; the rest
was for military pay raises and construction projects. The 72-day
air war, said Kosiak, would have eaten up $1.7 billion to $2.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is there for peacekeeping,'' he said. ``Beyond that,
if you assist Yugoslavia, one could find billions of dollars' worth
of problems to fix.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO said its missiles and bombs have destroyed 34 highway
bridges in Yugoslavia, 11 railroad bridges, and 57 percent of the
country's oil reserves. Factories are in ruins, power plants have
been crippled, and both military and civilian structures destroyed
in the air war. Yugoslav officials said the country needs $100
billion to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall insist on the international community, especially
NATO and the United States, paying for what they have destroyed,''
said Goran Trivan, a member of the ruling Socialist Party's
executive committee, last week.
</P>
<P>
   But US and European officials have made clear that as long as
Slobodan Milosevic remains in power, the West will not help rebuild
the nation. And even if Milosevic steps down or is overthrown,
reconstruction of the country is likely to have a lower priority
than aid to Kosovo and the nations surrounding Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At the NATO summit in Washington in April, officials agreed to
create an assistance fund for southeastern Europe. In part, this
was to reward Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, Albania, Croatia,
Bosnia, and Hungary, which cooperated with NATO throughout the
conflict. In part, it was to cover the financial losses arising
from the cutoff of vital highway and waterway trade routes through
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard a lot of discussion of a Marshall Plan for
southeastern Europe,'' said Helman, of the Center for Defense
Information. ``They are thinking of tens of billions of dollars.
But it hasn't been very specific yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding is the crucial step in winning the peace, he added,
just as the rebuilding of Japan and Germany was successful in
creating good will after World War II. The record was not as good
after the Vietnam conflict, he said, which had a murkier outcome.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen which pattern Kosovo will fit.

BRITISH COLUMBIA PREMIER STIRS UP HORNET'S NEST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ Start with the bad boy premier of British Columbia, a
politician whose polls are in decline, whose administration is
dogged by mismanagement, and whose home life has lately been
disrupted by search warrant-wielding police investigating links
between government and gambling interests.
</P>
<P>
   Add an obscure military facility whose lease is about to expire.
</P>
<P>
   Heap on Pacific salmon, then stir in Western Canada's resentment
of federal politicians back east. Add environmental groups. Stir in
a dollop of natural Canadian antipathy toward the big American
neighbor. Then a pinch of well-heeled homeowners along Georgia
Strait, the spectacular waterway between Vancouver Island and the
mainland, fretting that big naval warships represent a hazard to
their sailing yachts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, season with scare talk about nuclear weapons. Careful
now! The merest insinuation is enough to make the stew a real
attention-grabber.
</P>
<P>
   That's the latest recipe from Glen Clark, British Columbia's
pugnaciously anti-American premier.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's political fortunes are drooping these days as British
Columbia's economy falters and critics accuse his administration of
incompetence and worse. In Canada, there's a time-honored tactic
for situations like his. Blame the Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   The premier is threatening to boot the US Navy from the Nanoose
Bay torpedo test range, where for decades American and Canadian
military researchers have fine-tuned weapons for undersea warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The test range is a Canadian military facility, but legal
ownership of the seabed belongs to British Columbia. Since the
facility was opened in 1965, Ottawa has leased the 75 square miles
of open water and a 300-acre islet.
</P>
<P>
   That lease expires on Sept. 4, and Clark insists he will give
the heave-ho to the Navy unless the United States makes some big
concessions to British Columbia on salmon catches and, in the
latest wrinkle, nuclear warheads that might or might not be carried
aboard US war vessels entering Georgia Strait.
</P>
<P>
   He has got their attention in Ottawa and Washington. Infuriated
by Clark's antics, and fearful of damage to the US-Canada military
alliance, Canada's federal government is making threats of its own,
to seize the seabed and lands of Nanoose Bay and make them federal
property.
</P>
<P>
   That has some British Columbians talking secession. Many in the
province are already deeply disaffected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by itself, the expropriation of provincial land by Ottawa
would be an extremely provocative act,'' said Jim Fulton, executive
director of the Vancouver-based David Suzuki Foundation, an
environmental group. ``But to do so solely to allow Americans to
keep testing their weapons in our waters is an incredible affront
to public sensitivity. There are real safety issues here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of it all is the US Navy, which uses the Nanoose
Bay range for sea trials of sub-killing weaponry, most notably the
deadly MK-48 torpedo, and has more than $100 million invested in
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 31,000 torpedo runs conducted at Nanoose Bay over
the years have involved nonexplosive dummy warheads or electronic
simulations. The idea is to test not the bang but guidance systems
and other high-tech equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clark is tying the future of the base to the health of
British Columbia's salmon fishery, and to a ban on nuclear weapons.
The premier wants Americans to slash catches of Pacific salmon, a
hot-button issue with the province's fishermen, who have long
claimed that the US fishing fleets are devastating stocks of
Chinook salmon and other species.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter dispute appears close to resolution, with the US and
Canada last week announcing a new treaty to conserve the depleted
stocks and more equitably divide the catch between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But should salmon peace come, Clark has another card: Canadian
dislike of American military might, especially nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the premier proclaimed that unless the United States
publicly pledges never to send submarines or surface ships bearing
nuclear warheads to Nanoose Bay, there will be no renewal of the
test range's lease.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear-armed US warships or subs rarely enter Canadian waters,
and as a general rule, the Navy does not keep nuclear weapons
aboard surface vessels, attack submarines or naval aircraft,
according to a Navy spokesman. But it's unlikely Washington would
agree to Clark's condition, which goes against a basic US military
policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear
weapons aboard any vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's drumbeat on Nanoose Bay has become an embarrassment for
Canada's federal government. This is not the first time the cocky
premier has rocked the boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Clark egged on British Columbian fishermen who for
three days blockaded an American ferry and more or less held its
passengers hostage in the port of Prince Rupert. Meant as a protest
against US salmon policies, the action was an extremely serious
violation of international law, one that had President Clinton
fuming and the US Senate demanding a military response.
</P>
<P>
   Canada these days is trying to combat its image in Washington as
an unreliable ally. The United States has made no secret of its
irritation with the neighbor's sharp cuts in defense spending, and
has repeatedly warned that Ottawa has to shoulder a more equitable
burden in NATO and other alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Ottawa last month announced it would
seize the Nanoose Bay seabed rather than continue discussing
Clark's ``red herring'' demands on the testing range.
</P>
<P>
   ``That base will remain open,'' said Canadian Defense Minister
Art Eggleton. ``It is vital. If we cannot get a resolution . . .
expropriation will be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   That's tougher talk than Ottawa usually employs in the sensitive
realm of federal-provincial relations. There is already much
antagonism toward Ottawa in British Columbia, which, like other
Western provinces, complains Canada is dominated by Ontario and
panders too much to separatist French Quebecers.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, antagonism toward Ottawa's perceived coddling of
Quebec has ignited a real, if still tiny, Quebec-style secessionist
movement in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is no separatist. But he realizes no Western politician
ever lost votes kicking Ottawa and the United States. ``We have to
be tough with the Americans. . . . And we are going to keep out
nuclear warheads,'' he said.

LAST SLAM TITLE NOW IN REACH FOR INKSTER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RON SIRAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ Juli Inkster looked amazingly fresh in the
suffocating heat as she climbed the slight hill to the seventh tee
at Old Waverly Golf Club, her eyes darting immediately to the green
where yet another pin was tucked in a remote corner. But try as
they might, tournament officials could put no pin out of Inkster's
reach in Saturday's third round. And try as they might, no one
might be able to keep her from finally winning the U.S. Women's
Open on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a masterly display of shot-making and composure on another
100-degree day here, Inkster started the front nine with
consecutive birdies, ended it with two more and punctuated the
round with a brilliant 8-iron from 138 yards to three feet on No.
16. A 67 on top of rounds of 65 and 69 put Inkster at 15-under-par
201 after 54 holes, four strokes ahead of Kelli Kuehne and Lori
Kane. Sherri Turner was another stroke back, and no one else was
within six strokes of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I keep playing the way I am playing. ... .'' Inkster said,
her voice trailing off as she contemplated becoming, along with Pat
Bradley, one of only two women to win the modern career grand slam.
``I think this is my tournament. All the pressure is on me. This
course lets you play aggressive, and I think that helps my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but the Old Waverly layout could make for a wild
Sunday shootout in what has been an uncharacteristic Open birdie
barrage, a result of bermuda grass rough that failed to grow to
full length because of an unusually cold spring and greens softened
by nearly three inches of rain in the two days before competition
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there is at least another 64 out there,'' Kane
said after she rallied from a shaky start, in which she made bogeys
on the second and third holes, to shoot a 71 to be at 205 along
with Kuehne. ``I like the position I'm in. I'll just try to make as
many birdies as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, who lost the United States Open to Patty Sheehan in a
playoff in 1992, won the Nabisco Dinah Shore twice, the du Maurier
Classic and the McDonalds LPGA Championship once each _ all before
1990 and the birth of her first daughter. A victory here would
complete the career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to think about birdies when you don't have
to think about diapers,'' said Inkster, whose daughters Hayley and
Cori are now 9 and 5. ``I have confidence in my game and confidence
in my family. I need to shoot 2 or 3 under tomorrow. I can't see
throttling back.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was cooler than Inkster on a day when the temperature hit
102 degrees, and only Turner with a 68 made much of a move. The
defending champion, Se Ri Pak, slipped back with a 74 to be at 212,
and the U.S. Women's Amateur champion, Grace Park, continued her
impressive run with a 73 to be at 210.
</P>
<P>
   If there is anyone else mustering up the kind of magic and sense
of destiny Inkster has on her side, it is Kuehne, the 22-year-old
two-time U.S. Amateur champion whose foundering two-year
professional career burst to life in the last month. She missed
several short putts _ one from 30 inches on No. 15 _ and still shot
a 70 to earn a pairing with Inkster on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the expectations will be on her tomorrow,'' Kuehne said.
``I'm the underdog. No one thinks I'm going to win. There is no
pressure on me. But I will have to shoot 67 or 68 to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, her father, Ernie Kuehne, shuffled along
mopping the perspiration from his brow, gazed out at his diminutive
daughter and growled in a Texas drawl that sounded right at home as
it hung in the hot Mississippi air, ``Maybe the princess has grown
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but even the Kuehnes seemed to feel the sense of destiny
for Inkster that hangs heavy over this tournament. Later,
contemplating the four-stroke deficit his daughter faced, Ernie
Kuehne said, ``Face it, this is Inkster's Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is, or perhaps the shrewd father was cleverly laying
aside a mountain of pressure from his daughter's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a tough day tomorrow,'' Inkster said. She knows.
She's been there before.

CITY SLICKERS ON SAFARI: LIONS AND TIGERS, OH MY!  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably know little about tracking leopards, warding off
mosquitos, even handling a rifle (for protection only, of course),
much less an elephant's eating habits (300 pounds a day).
</P>
<P>
   But you can learn these things and also the fundamentals of what
it takes to be a safari guide in a four-day, three-night camp for
adults run by the prestigious Sabi Sabi game reserve in Skukuza,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There are no more great hunters, at least not among the safaris
that now beckon tourists shooting cameras instead of guns. But the
thrill of the chase, as well as the intellectual breadth acquired
by learning to read nature and wildlife signs, are available to
campers, from Boomers to seniors.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat: You cannot write home for care packages. There is no
canteen, no once-a-week movies. Phone privileges? What phone?
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Ranger Training Experience, this program
accommodates from four to seven people at a time. Corporations such
as South African Airways regularly send small groups to the
15,000-acre Sabi Sabi, in the northeast part of the country
alongside Kruger National Park, to try to develop a spirit of
interdependence. ``Team-building,'' it is called.
</P>
<P>
   But you can do this if you are simply a camper longing to lose
yourself in a somewhat comfortable primeval experience, or learn
the tricks of the tracking trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have one hour of the Discovery Channel, you have to live
here six months,'' said Witas Mathe, a senior guide who also
conducts safaris at Sabi Sabi's three reserves.
</P>
<P>
   In the three nights, you still get a rich taste of an exotic
outdoor life. In your outsize tent built for two, you can look out
at night (if you dare) through the mesh ``window'' or simply cover
it up by lifting the Velcro screen. By the time your first night
falls, you will be attuned to the sounds and roars of the bushveld.
</P>
<P>
   Some things you do not have to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for an elephant to come into your tent,''
Mathe said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is comforting when your guide has a gun as he
arrives at your tent at 6:30 in the morning for your first day. If
you need a shower, there is an ingenious contraption: an overhead
pail with a spigot attached to the bottom that allows you to cover
yourself with water, like watering a plant. And, oh, yes, you draw
the water yourself in the bucket from a nearby well.
</P>
<P>
   As for a bathroom, well, you should have a sense of humor about
this: a raised platform, containing a toilet seat, overlooks the
African bush. It actually affords a pretty good view of the
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, when you are off with your guide, the first things
you'll be aware of are life's simple pleasures: the smell of the
grass, the tweet of the birds, those rustling sounds _ ominous?
benign? you will find out _ from the bushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you look after the environment,'' Mathe said, ``the
more it looks after you.''
</P>
<P>
   You will meet the ubiquitous guarri tree, a sort of life force
of the bush. This tree, you will learn, lives symbiotically with
man, animals and other trees.
</P>
<P>
   Break off a twig, and use it as a toothbrush. Its sap, say the
guides, kills bacteria that lurk in your mouth. Or you can brush
its leaves on your arms and legs and it wards off mosquitoes. Watch
for lions under the tree, though. They enjoy sleeping there since
it is a mosquito-free area. The large cape buffalo also come to the
guarri to rub against it and rid themselves of bugs.
</P>
<P>
   In your first moments in the bush, you follow in the footsteps
of the guides, soaking up their knowledge and natural instincts.
Guides at the various reserves are really remarkable people, part
zoology and botany professor, part fervent ecologist, part New York
City cab driver in their mad dashes through the bush to catch up to
the animals.
</P>
<P>
   By walking, you learn the difference between trees and the
different smells of plants. And you can tell when an elephant has
torn up the place recently when the scent of broken trees and
bushes wafts your way.
</P>
<P>
   When elephants strip the bark off a tree, and it dies, the
skeletal remains are a perfect home for vultures; they have
unobstructed views of the area. ``The tree,'' Mathe said, ``will
die. But the vultures will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Walks are followed by sit-down lectures, instruction in driving
the Land Rover (some shrubs bounce back when you drive over them,
others you learn to go around) and how to shoot a .458-caliber
rifle. In extreme cases, a warning shot will redirect the animal to
another path.
</P>
<P>
   The evenings, meanwhile, are filled with information about the
sky and the stars and animals' nocturnal habits.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, you are looking as well as listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stars,'' Mathe said, ``can also communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   You learn to use all your senses, which levels the playing field
somewhat. Now you can see the animals. They have probably seen you
all the while.
</P>
<P>
   By the third day you are tracking, looking for animal spoors,
leaving the protection of the vehicle to track on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The cost per person is about $600 for the three nights, meals
included. Further information can be obtained by calling (800)
524-7979. &QL;

NBA PREPARES FOR WHEELING, DEALING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA draft is little more than three weeks away
and two things are already certain. This year's rookie class does
not have a clear-cut No.1 player and there will be an unprecedented
amount of wheeling and dealing by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The teams with the top seven picks in the draft are all willing
to trade away their choices, either to acquire some veterans or in
an attempt to move up.
</P>
<P>
   With so many possibilities for change, it might be foolish to
try to predict how the draft will pan out, but here's a first look
anyway at how the lottery picks might unfold.
</P>
<P>
   1. Chicago, Lamar Odom, SF, Rhode Island: The Bulls love the
idea of having an athletic scorer who could play at least three
positions. But they are worried about Odom's off-court problems and
don't want a bad citizen. Those fears will disappear when it comes
time to make their selection.
</P>
<P>
   2. Vancouver, Steve Francis, PG, Maryland: This is where the
action starts. The Grizzlies are advertising this pick for sale and
want a power forward. Duke's Elton Brand is too short (6-7, 6-6?).
Francis would be a great combo guard pairing with Mike Bibby, but
somebody else will move up here and snag him.
</P>
<P>
   3. Charlotte, Baron Davis, PG, UCLA: The Hornets are also
fielding offers. But they need a flashy point guard and Davis would
blend in perfectly with Eddie Jones, Elden Campbell and Anthony
Mason. It is hoped he won't be influenced by Campbell's and Mason's
sullen personalities.
</P>
<P>
   4. Clippers, Corey Maggette, G/F, Duke: They are praying that
Francis or Davis is still available. If not, it's dilemma time. Do
they reach for a point guard and take Andre Miller or Jason Terry?
Do they trade the pick?
</P>
<P>
   If they keep it, the roster is so depleted that the
best-available player route is the way to go. Maggette could be the
Vince Carter of the draft and the Clippers need some excitement as
they move into the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   5. Toronto, Elton Brand, PF, Duke: The Raptors are trying
everything they can to move into the top three. Don't bet against
them succeeding. In the meantime, someone else will be happy to
take Brand.
</P>
<P>
   6. Minnesota, Richard Hamilton, SG, Connecticut: Kevin McHale
wants to move up, too, and will grab a point guard so he can sign
and trade Terrell Brandon. But should the Wolves fail to move up,
they'll re-sign Brandon and then add Hamilton as a scoring threat
to ease the burden on Kevin Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   7. Washington, Wally Szczerbiak, PF, Miami, Ohio: The Wizards
want a scorer and will break the Cavaliers' hearts by drafting
Szczerbiak, who is likely to move up with a few good workouts in
the next two weeks. If the Grizzlies had guts, they would take him
at No.2.
</P>
<P>
   8. Cleveland, Jumaine Jones, F, Georgia: The Cavs are worried
about the injury to Zydrunas Ilgauskas, and with Szczerbiak off the
board, they need someone to rebound and score. Jones is capable of
playing inside and outside.
</P>
<P>
   9. Phoenix, Jonathan Bender, PF, Picayune, Miss., H.S.: The Suns
don't need a guard or scorer, they need a fleet player with height.
Time to roll the dice on the 6-10 Bender, this year's prep darling.
</P>
<P>
   10. Golden State, Jason Terry, PG, Arizona: The Warriors need a
point guard and shooting guard. Terry is both and is an above
average defender. No chance he'll ever choke P.J. Carlesimo,
either.
</P>
<P>
   11. Cleveland, Ron Artest, SF, St. John's: The Cavs are looking
to trade this pick and the talent is getting slim. The only player
left capable of helping their anemic offense is Artest.
</P>
<P>
   12. Toronto, Andre Miller, PG, Utah: If the Raptors couldn't get
their point at No.5, they cross their fingers that the underrated
Miller drops down this low.
</P>
<P>
   13. Seattle, William Avery, PG, Duke: The Sonics need someone to
back up (replace?) Gary Payton and here's the fifth point guard to
go in the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Dead air: No one's ever really accused NBC's Ahmad Rashad of
being anything more than a shill for Michael Jordan, but somebody's
head should roll for his embarrassing interview with the Spurs'
Sean Elliott after Elliott hit a miraculous 3-pointer to win Game 2
of the San Antonio-Portland playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Rashad droned on with several questions for Elliott but never
found the opportunity to ask Elliott about the 3-pointer, which was
the biggest shot of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody plugged into Rashad's earpiece should have demanded the
question be asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Czar dethroned: Mike Fratello thought he was a hot commodity
entering this week, while coaching the Cavs and hearing rumors he
was a candidate for the Nets job.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cleveland owner Gordon Gund popped into a staff meeting and
asked for a word with Fratello. Minutes later, he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs wanted to make a clean sweep in management after
kicking GM Wayne Embry further upstairs and replacing him with John
Paxson. Fratello's slowdown style also didn't endear him to Gund,
who was nervous about attendance slipping.
</P>
<P>
   Philly Pike? The Sixers are considering using their $2 million
salary exemption for Clippers free agent Eric Piatkowski, in an
attempt to improve their outside shooting.
</P>
<P>
   What did you expect? New York coach Jeff Van Gundy's tenuous job
security has not drawn sympathy from Indiana coach Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have known better than to go into New York and
coach,'' Bird said. &QL;

A VISIT TO WALLY'S WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those of you posing as hardcore basketball fans, but still
unfamiliar with the name Wally Szczerbiak, should please leave this
column immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, beat it. You're an imposter, and should find yourself
a nice page covered with soccer or horse racing. We'll wait while
you thumb your way out of here.
</P>
<P>
   The pretenders are gone. Back to Szczerbiak. OK, while you're
familiar with Wally - a lottery-listed forward from Miami of Ohio -
unloading his name in conversation could be tricky.
</P>
<P>
   It's three syllables, folks. The first one is ``Zir,'' which is
how you - as a teenager - addressed your old man: ``No, Zir, I have
not been drinking.'' The second syllable is ``B,'' which was your
algebra grade after unleashing those art-class skills on the letter
D. The final syllable is ``ack,'' the same sound that flew through
your lips during your sister's first attempt at meatloaf.
</P>
<P>
   Right, Szczer-bi-ak. He's the rascal who dropped 43 points on
the Washington Huskies in the sunrise of March Madness (his
teammates combined for another 16, but Miami still won).
</P>
<P>
   Wally, known as ``World'' to his relentlessly clever college
pals who discovered National Lampoon's ``Vacation'' at Blockbuster,
worked out for the Clippers on Friday at USC's Lyon Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was 90 minutes of running, jumping, running, shooting,
cutting and running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a typical day,'' said Szczerbiak, a self-made player who
finds this pre-draft selling process enjoyable. ``When I first got
to Miami, I never dreamed I'd be in this position, so I'm having
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the second stop on his ``World'' tour - the first
interview was in Toronto - with an all-comers audition scheduled
for Thursday in Chicago and trips lined up for Charlotte,
Washington and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The point-guard prowling Clippers, who have the fourth pick in
this month's draft, could use it to secure the dead-eye small
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak does have the endorsement of Clippers' power forward
Maurice Taylor, although each thumbs up from Mo wears a caveat. Mo
also talks up UCLA's Baron Davis, and Rhode Island's Lamar Odom,
among others. We are led to believe that Taylor thinks his team has
FOUR lottery picks instead of just the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Mo was winding down from his regularly scheduled workout
when Wally showed up to impress the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can shoot the blood out of the ball,'' Taylor said of
Szczerbiak. We believe shooting the blood out of the ball is a fine
thing, and that it suggests the Portland Trail Blazers were
shooting turnips in Friday's loss to the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the skinny on Wally:
</P>
<P>
   He isn't. Skinny, that is. He's a self-described
``late-bloomer'' who was thrilled to be offered a scholarship by
Miami, then began a weight-room siege in his desire to become a
pro. It worked. After averaging 24 points per game as a junior, he
was selected to play for the U.S. team at the 1998 Goodwill Games.
Wally subsequently stole the show, and inspired several NBA talent
hounds to believe they'd just discovered the next great sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   We're not sure if Wally has enough quickness to be great, but
his jumper is as deadly as dime-store cologne. Combine that with
240 pounds of weight-room victory and the combination may be even
more incongruous than a vanity plate on a Harley.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak frequently has been compared to Tom Gugliotta of the
Phoenix Suns, but Googs goes 6-foot-10, while Wally might be 6-7
after a collision with Don King's barber. While he can do business
inside, his game is more comparable to that of former NBA star Kiki
Vandeweghe.
</P>
<P>
   He probably won't average at least 20 points per game for seven
seasons in a row, like Kiki, but the Cleveland Cavaliers are said
to be willing to package their two lottery picks (8 and 12) to move
up and draft him.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, Chicago Bulldog Jerry Krause is another
vigorous Szczerbiak fan, and may be more than willing to offer up
that first overall pick to slide down a bit and select Wally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care where I end up,'' Szczerbiak said. ``I
just want to play for a franchise that wants to win and has great
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to hear my name called on draft night.''
</P>
<P>
   And if NBA commissioner David Stern remains a bigger hoops fan
than those other clowns, he may do justice when pronouncing the
kid's name.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead Corey stories
</P>
<P>
   According to sources beyond our control, it took more than a
newspaper column to inspire Duke freshman Corey Maggette's leap to
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a replay on that one: While the Blue Devils were in
the Windy City (Maggette's hometown) to compete in the Great Eight,
the lively swingman came upon a newspaper list of the nation's
hottest draft prospects and saw his name at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Then, before making his decision to leave Duke, word reached
Maggette that Krause was threatening to draft him - regardless of
where the Bulls landed on lottery day.
</P>
<P>
   June 30 should be a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead No Magic healing
</P>
<P>
   With Doc Rivers expected to be hired as head coach and Julius
``Dr. J'' Erving looming as executive VP, you'd think the Orlando
Magic will be able to manage a very important Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway Deal.
</P>
<P>
   One popular swap would be conducted with two-guard starved
Phoenix; the Suns shipping Gugliotta (a fine player who doesn't
have the wheels to help maximize the push tactics of Jason Kidd) to
Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Their salaries ($8 million and change) are salary-cap friendly,
but Penny does have the option of holding his breath for the
league's prevailing maximum deal.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead The rap on Rip
</P>
<P>
   Richard ``Rip'' Hamilton, a dandy shooting guard who led UConn
to the national championship, is making it difficult for teams with
early draft calls to fall in love with him.
</P>
<P>
   See, Rip hasn't hired an agent or anyone else who can expedite
those pesky individual workouts. He still could go in the top five,
but not getting up-close-and-personal could drop Hamilton a notch
or two.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, his replacement at UConn is expected to be 6-10 Ajou
Ajou Deng, a redshirt freshman defined by Huskies coach Jim Calhoun
as a ``6-foot-10 version of Reggie Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun should know; he coached the Lewis, the late Celtics
star, at Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   We still think Portland's Greg Anthony should have made the
league's ``All-Defensive'' squad. It's obvious that by walking on
the court, he instantly becomes a threat to the offense of both
teams. ... Former Lakewood High and USC star Duane Cooper had a
fine season in Greece, and could be taking his point-guard skills
to an NBA camp near you. ... If the Knicks slip past the Pacers and
into the NBA Finals, Coach Jeff Van Gundy figures to join Gregg
Popovich of the Spurs as championship-round coaches who didn't play
in the NBA. The last time two pedigree-lacking coaches hooked up
was 1981, when Bill Fitch's Boston Celtics defeated the Houston
Rockets, coached by Del Harris. ... According to a rumor we might
have made up, Phil Jackson won't coach the Knicks unless the
venue's name is changed to Madison Triangle Garden.

STANFORD OUSTS USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ It wasn't like the USC baseball team came into this
thing with an aura of invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Trojans were the defending national champions and the
preseason No.1 team in the country. But there was the awful start,
and the injuries and the suspect pitching depth.
</P>
<P>
   But even USC figured it was at least evenly matched with
Stanford when the two teams began their NCAA super regional series.
The answer was no. The Cardinal's pitching turned out to be better.
But not by much.
</P>
<P>
   USC's season ended Saturday with a 5-3 loss to the host Cardinal
in front of 3,742 sun-soaked fans at Sunken Diamond. Stanford
(48-13) advanced to the College World Series, which begins Friday
in Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (36-26) were left guessing by Cardinal sophomore
pitcher Justin Wayne, who struck out 12 and allowed just five hits
in eight innings. Wayne and sophomore Jason Young, Friday night's
Stanford starter who pitched a complete game 1-0 victory, combined
for 22 strikeouts in the two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we ran into outstanding pitching,'' USC head coach
Mike Gillespie said. ``It's a real credit to their pitching for us
to be held down like this. We can swing it. We can be an offensive
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, ironically, began the season with a brand-new set of
starters. Head coach Mark Marquess said he figured then that
pitching was the Cardinal's weakness. Now it is the strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go to Omaha with two hot pitchers,'' Marquess
said, ``and we've got that.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's pitching was almost as good, and good enough to win
against most every team the Trojans played this season. Senior
right-hander Justin Lehr gave up six hits and five runs in six
innings Saturday, and Stanford advanced to the CWS with just eight
hits in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitching was just as good, if not better,'' said USC
catcher Eric Munson.
</P>
<P>
   But even Munson, a first-round pick by Detroit in last week's
draft, grudgingly admitted Young and Wayne were tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shut us down,'' said Munson, who hit his 15th homer in
the sixth that made it 5-2. ``Good pitching will shut you down, and
they did that over the last two days. Our bats got cold at the
wrong time.... (Young and Wayne) didn't throw too many hittable
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   USC and Stanford weren't strangers; they split six games this
season. Munson said, ``It's not like we didn't know what were
facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they know what was coming, they couldn't solve Wayne,
who struck out 14 in a win over the Trojans in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wayne) was just throwing his fastball by guys,'' Stanford
catcher Damien Alvarado said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, just as it did Friday night, made the most of its
rallies, leaving only three runners on base. The Cardinal hit
back-to-back doubles when it scored three runs in the third and
back-to-back triples in the seventh when it scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   USC broke a 12-inning scoreless streak against Stanford in the
fourth when Seth Davidson tripled with one out and scored on
Dominic Correa's bloop single. But the Trojans didn't get very many
solid hits against Wayne, just as they hadn't against Young the
night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, for those two guys to be throwing like they are,''
Alvarado said, ``is super.''
</P>
<P>
   Super pitching for a super regional.

 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is the full-service stockbroker going the way of the
dodo bird?
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch's announcement on Tuesday that it would capitulate
to the on-line trading frenzy by offering do-it-yourself investors
$29.95 Internet trades later this year looked to some people like
the beginning of the end of the tradition that Merrill represents.
</P>
<P>
   Any corporate announcement that reverses decades of business
practice and entrenched philosophy, as this one did, is
breathtaking. Sure enough, investors knocked down brokerage stocks
on the news. Fears that Merrill's embrace of on-line trading and
its deep-discounted commissions would hammer profits drove the
American Stock Exchange's Securities Broker/Dealer index down 5.4
percent the day the news broke. The index ended the week down 8.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are right to be concerned about profitability at
brokerage firms. The $29.95 trades to be offered by Merrill Lynch
are well below the firm's current commission schedule and no doubt
the first salvo in what may devolve into a nasty price war.
</P>
<P>
   Net profit margins at brokerage firms _ currently around 6
percent, according to the Value Line Investment Survey _ will be
much lower in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But any celebration ofthose celebrating the death of the
full-service broker isare premature. Although the number of
old-fashioned brokers will surely dwindle, and those left will have
thinner wallets, many will survive, even thrive. The practice of
buying and selling stocks with the help of a human being is not
going to be supplanted by the click of a mouse just yet.
</P>
<P>
   This is certain, however: Brokers who do not provide value to
their customers are an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lay-up business _ sell 1,000 shares of a $50 stock for a
$500 commission _ is going away,'' said Shad Rowe, who runs
Greenbrier Partners, a money-management firm in Dallas. ``People
don't have to pay for no-brainer trades anymore. But brokers who
can truly represent their customers? Their value goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line investing has a lot going for it. The beauty of the
Internet, of course, is that it often eliminates the middleman and
thereby cuts costs for consumers. It also allows Americans to
pursue one of their quintessential delights: the do-it-yourself
gig.
</P>
<P>
   Buying and selling stocks on line has the added appeal of
providing investors with the sense that they are in the midst of a
high-stakes game.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these people may not want a broker to interject herself
between them and the action because that dilutes the rush. After
all, people who frequent the craps tables in Las Vegas don't
usually ask others to throw the dice for them.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that the world of investors is in the process of
dividing into those who want help and those who don't. Still, the
trial and error that usually surrounds any do-it-yourself effort
will prove much more painful in investing than it would in, say,
plumbing or wallpapering.
</P>
<P>
   It's much harder to fix an investment that went awry than to
have a professional come in and correct a mangled drain pipe or
rehang some paper.
</P>
<P>
   An argument can also be made that now, more than ever, investors
need help sorting through the cacophony emitted by CNBC, Internet
investing chat rooms and the growing number of publications devoted
to financial issues.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, with American families more time-starved than ever
before, it seems strange that the interest in do-it-yourself
investing should surge just now.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the investor enthusiasm for on-line trading is a result
of the lengthy bull market. When stocks are going up, it's easy to
have success in the market as a do-it-yourselfer. On-line trading
aficionados have not yet had to endure a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the market starts requiring that people spend a lot
more time watching over their investments rather than just looking
at the paper and seeing that their Internet stock went up, people
will have to work on figuring out why a stock's not working,'' said
Seth Novatt, managing director at CIBC Oppenheimer in New York.
``There are many people who won't want to spend the time doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that investing on one's own is alluring, of
course, is that many investors have been burned by full-service
brokers. But all brokers are not the smirking pickpockets that
on-line brokers' advertisements portray. Many are honest and
hard-working, and bring years of experience and professionalism to
bear on their clients' behalf. (Full disclosure: From 1981 to 1984,
this columnist was a stockbroker at Dean Witter Reynolds in New
York.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is, people want advice from
experienced people who have been in the business,'' said David
Eidelman, a money manager at Eidelman, Finger &AMP; Harris in St.
Louis. ``A broker may call me up and say, `Did you notice this
stock has been slipping?' or point out something I didn't think of.
The extra commission I pay that broker is more than made up by the
service he provides.''
</P>
<P>
   Money managers say that a full-service broker must perform many
duties if he wants to earn higher commission rates. Here is a list
of what the pros say investors have a right to expect:
</P>
<P>
   _ Honesty.
</P>
<P>
   _ Perspective. An alert broker cannot help but learn from the
market, a school of hard knocks to be sure. Sharing these lessons
with clients can help them from having to learn the hard way on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discipline. A good broker helps assess the risk in an
investment, playing the devil's advocate on a stock that may look
attractive or a bond with an alluringly high yield.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expert editing. A professional broker will help delete stocks
that look shaky or inappropriate from a portfolio and will keep a
client diversified.
</P>
<P>
   _ Error protection. A computer will not keep clients from making
dumb mistakes _ buying a stock that was supposed to be sold, for
example. A trustworthy broker will, and will also keep customers
from making trades with costly tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   _ Superior execution of trades. A good broker will work a
customer's NASDAQ or option trade, for example, squeezing between
bid and asked prices or watching for other ways to save an investor
one-eighth or one-quarter of a point.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grading of a firm's research analysts. An honest broker will
give her customers the benefit of her experience, separating the
amateurs from the pros.
</P>
<P>
   _ Independent research. A hard-working broker will check out
rumors or tips, using bona fide sources of information that are
relatively independent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good investment ideas that are off the beaten track.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the broker provides all of these services but
consistently loses money for his clients, he should be fired.
Making money is the goal, after all.
</P>
<P>
   A result of Merrill's on-line initiative will certainly be an
increased focus among the customers of full-service firms on the
costs levied and the benefits provided by their brokers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good thing. If brokers don't perform, they will be
bounced, either by their clients or by their firms. No matter how
painful it is in the near term, survival of the fittest is long
overdue on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokers are going to have to adjust their philosophy as well
as their commissions,'' said Rod Fadem, a broker at Oppenheimer &AMP;
Co., in Clayton, Mo., who has been in the business since 1960.
``The philosophy must be `everything for the customer first.'
Investors need to have someone on their side.''

CRASH CAUSES SEEM CLEAR, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The deadly crash of American Airlines Flight
1420 in Little Rock will go down in aviation history as one of the
easiest accidents to figure out, federal investigators said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the mysterious, essentially unsolved crashes of Trans
World Airlines Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island, N.Y., and
USAir Flight 427 near Pittsburgh, the Little Rock crash has
relatively obvious answers. Investigators have suspected since
shortly after arriving in Little Rock that the crash was a clear
case of poor judgment combined with bad weather and a chain of
unfortunate contributing factors.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonnell-Douglas MD-82 jetliner touched down in a severe
thunderstorm at Little Rock National Airport, ran off the end of
the runway, hit a steel structure supporting runway lights and
broke in two.
</P>
<P>
   As the left wing ruptured, fuel spilled from the wing-mounted
tanks, ignited, and sent a fireball through the plane. That blaze
contributed significantly to some of the nine deaths and 82
injuries among the 139 passengers and six crew members on board.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, salvage crews continued to dismantle the charred
plane, loading its two engines onto a flatbed trailer and preparing
the wings and fuselage for removal. The wreckage will be taken to a
hangar at the Little Rock airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are parts of the plane now that are obviously being
covered by wreckage that we'd like to be able to get to when we
lift the wreckage _ things we haven't yet seen,''said Matthew
Furman, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, a memorial service was held for James Harrison,
21, a student at Ouachita Baptist University who was returning from
a choir trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a service where we healed some of our hurt,'' said
crash survivor and fellow student Misha Perkins. Tears and laughter
punctuated the private service attended by about 200 in the small
town of Royal, southwest of Little Rock, Perkins said. ``I know
James is not worse off; we may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services for the eight other victims are scheduled this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Although it will be at least a year before the National
Transportation Safety Board rules on the cause of the crash,
investigators believe that high winds from the thunderstorm at the
northwest corner of the airport played the largest role in the
accident _ by essentially pushing the speeding jet off the runway
as the captain tried desperately to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot error, aviation safety experts say, will eventually be
written as the primary factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did a guy with 9,000 flying hours, who was one of the
airline's chief pilots, make the decision to land when he had been
warned of rapidly deteriorating weather, the presence of
potentially deadly wind shear at the airport, and wind gusts of
more than 50 mph?'' asked David Stempler, a Washington aviation
attorney and executive director of the Air Travelers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the bigger question is, if a pilot with this much training
and experience would make this kind of mistake, what can we expect
of pilots with less experience with airlines that don't have
training programs as good as those of American Airlines?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will never be able to ask the pilot why he decided
to land. Capt. Richard Buschmann, 48, a 20-year veteran flier for
American, died instantly as his side of the cockpit slammed into
the steel light stanchion.
</P>
<P>
   His co-pilot, Michael Origel, who joined the airline in February
and is still on probation, hasn't been able to shed any light on
the captain's decision, either, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in the hospital Friday, where he is recovering from
a severely broken leg and other injuries, Origel told investigators
that he and the captain never discussed diverting to one of the two
alternate airports in the aircraft's flight plan: either returning
to the point of departure, Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, or continuing
for another 45 minutes to Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps this was a case of a senior officer showing a green
co-pilot how it is done, and the co-pilot being afraid to speak up
because he is on probation for his first year and that senior
officer is one of the people with influence over his career,''
Stempler said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that factor is one they are focusing on in
their review of cockpit resource management and human factors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the indication of pilot misjudgment and weather factors,
investigators and aviation safety advocates will want other
questions answered if the industry is to learn from this accident.
</P>
<P>
   Among them:
</P>
<P>
   Would a high-tech Terminal Doppler Weather Radar system have
given the pilots better information about the location of the
thunderstorm so that they might have decided not to chance the
landing?
</P>
<P>
   Because of its light commercial traffic and relatively small
size, Little Rock National Airport doesn't have this high-tech
radar that was developed by the Federal Aviation as a direct result
of the deadly 1985 Delta Air Lines Flight 191 crash at D/FW
Airport, which was blamed on a severe thunderstorm. D/FW got the
radar in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame the FAA for that,'' said Michael Boyd, an aviation
consultant with The Boyd Group in Golden, Colo. ``The reality is
that if there was equipment that could have given the captain
information that would have prevented this crash, then the FAA is
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Could a soft concrete substance like that used off the ends of
the runways at New York's Kennedy Airport have prevented the crash
of Flight 1420 by safely bringing the plane to a stop as it left
the runway, in much the same way that a mountain highway's
runaway-truck lane stops a truck with its soft gravel?
</P>
<P>
   Would breakaway runway-light supports, like the breakaway light
and sign poles being installed on many highways, have kept the
plane from breaking up as it came to a stop?
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that, although the breakup caused the deaths
and injuries, it also probably saved dozens of lives. As fire
consumed part of the wrecked plane, survivors poured out of the
cracks in the fuselage because most of the emergency exits were
jammed. The high survivor count _ 136 people lived through the
ordeal _ was attributed to their ability to exit the aircraft
quickly through those breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Was there miscommunication between the pilot and co-pilot as to
who would arm the wing-mounted ground spoilers that are triggered
by the airplane's nose wheel making contact with the runway after
touchdown?
</P>
<P>
   The spoilers, which help push the plane down onto the runway by
decreasing lift, and help slow it down by inducing wind resistance,
did not deploy as Flight 1420 landed, NTSB investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Origel told interviewers that he thought the captain had pulled
the lever in the cockpit to arm the spoilers during the approach to
landing, but American Airlines officials said that arming the
spoilers is the duty of the nonflying pilot _ in this case, Origel.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the failure to use the spoilers would not in
itself normally have prevented an MD-82 from stopping safely on a
7,200-foot runway such as the one at Little Rock, said George W.
Black Jr., the NTSB member coordinating the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on a jetliner once whose spoilers didn't deploy on
landing, and I'm still here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the aircraft was having a hard time stopping because of
the high winds from the storm and water on the runway from the
heavy rain, the spoilers might have helped soften the final impact,
investigators said. As it was, the plane left the runway at about
100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   So even though investigators do not face the kinds of deep and
mysterious questions that continue to baffle investigators of the
TWA and USAir flights, there is still a lot of work to do on the
Little Rock crash, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an easy one to investigate, though,'' he said. ``It's
not in the swamp (like the Valujet crash), it's not in the Atlantic
Ocean (like the TWA crash), and it's not in Guam where nobody
speaks English (like the crash of a Korean Air Boeing 747 in
1997).''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the crash of TWA 800, whose cause is suspected to be
an explosion of unknown origin that blew up the center fuel tank,
and the crash of USAir 427, whose cause is suspected to be some
kind of rudder malfunction that investigators and other experts
cannot agree about, Flight 1420's demise seems to be a rather
clear-cut and easily discernible case of pilots continuing a flight
into weather that was not safe for even an airplane as large as the
111,000-pound MD-82, the experts say.

PARK'S OUTBURST SPURS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The spike mark on the left thigh of Tim Belcher
was not the work of a crazy man, the Dodgers say.
</P>
<P>
   What they said under their collective breath after a
fifth-inning fight between Belcher and Chan Ho Park led to a
bench-clearing brawl Saturday afternoon was that they are praying
it is the turning point in their disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   Although Park was ejected and faces a certain suspension for the
scissors kick he threw Belcher after the two met on Park's
sacrifice bunt, the Dodgers fed off the frenzy for a 7-4 victory
over the Angels in front of 44,779 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the way the club responded to the brawl with a
five-run sixth inning that was capped by Devon White's grand slam.
Or the way the bullpen limited the Angels to two hits in four
innings after Park was tossed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the way the usually docile Dodgers came together in the
post-game clubhouse. Kevin Brown yelled across the room as Park
emotionally tried to explain his case: ``Just tell them what
happened and leave it at that. There is no need to say anything
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Eric Young said Park did what he had to after Belcher
insulted him by saying ``Shut up and get the (expletive) back to
the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was protecting a teammate with $105 million words, the way
the team hoped he would when they signed him last year. Young
simply was saying the Dodgers will not be pushed around, which has
happened plenty this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no telling where something like this can lead a
team,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels obviously saw the incident differently. They thought
there was no provocation. Belcher simply tagged, then briefly held
Park after fielding his sacrifice along the first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   First Park threw a forearm that smacked Belcher in the left side
of the head. Then he left his feet and kicked Belcher with both
legs. Play was halted for several minutes as both benches emptied.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires agreed with the Angels, allowing Belcher to remain
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need to get into the altercation from my
standpoint,'' said Belcher, who issued a statement. ``I respect the
umpires for leaving me in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Angels catcher Matt Walbeck, who gave his team a 4-0 lead in
the fourth with a grand slam of his own, said that being on the
bottom of a huge pile for several minutes must have drained Belcher
(3-5).
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only physically, but mentally, too,'' Walbeck said. ``That
was crazy what Park did, he could have really hurt him with his
spikes. I think it was a lot for Tim to go through and then come
out for the next inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher clearly was not the same pitcher in the sixth. Jose
Vizcaino, who hit a game-winning homer Friday night, opened with a
single. Gary Sheffield, who later hit a two-run homer, reached on a
base hit to right.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was laboring when Raul Mondesi smacked an RBI double
into the left-field corner and Eric Karros walked to bring up
White.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the ball to sink to Devo, but it just stayed up,''
Walbeck said. ``It's the same pitch we called in the fourth and he
grounded to short to end the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Park had been replaced by left-hander Onan Masaoka (1-1), who
pitched the sixth inning to earn his first major-league victory.
Jeff Shaw pitched the ninth for his 14th save and second in two
days.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said it was unthinkable that one
pitcher could be ejected and the other allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   He also thought the ill feeling started in the fourth inning
when Park threw two pitches behind the head of Angels second
baseman Randy Velarde. In the fifth, Park threw behind Velarde
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he swings his body in his delivery, he doesn't always
have the best control,'' Johnson said. ``Those pitches were not
intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for any Angels players to believe that. On July 2,
1997, at Anaheim Stadium, both benches cleared but no punches were
thrown when Park nearly hit then-Angel Tony Phillips with a pitch
up and in.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Johnson said Belcher probably gave Park a little
squeeze instead of throwing at him in retaliation for Velarde. Park
said he couldn't back down. ``When you do that, the other team
looks at you as soft and you can't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft? Another word came to mind with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pure stupidity on his part,'' closer Troy Percival
said. ``Belcher was just doing his job and (Park) acts like he's
never been on a field before. What he did was just plain stupid.''

DISCOVERY CREW GETS CRAFT READY FOR END OF MISSION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle &HT;    With threats of rain and high cross winds at their Florida
<TEXT>
landing site, the Discovery astronauts late Saturday forged ahead
with preparations to end their successful, 10-day mission to the
international space station.
<P>
   After a fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, Discovery
was scheduled to touch down at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in
Florida at 1:03 a.m., CDT, today, only the 11th night landing in 94
shuttle flights.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the astronauts were to begin their descent, flight
control teams were closely watching the skies around Kennedy for
rain showers and monitoring wind velocities, factors that could
force a wave-off. There was a second opportunity to land in Florida
at 2:38 a.m., CDT, before the four-man, three-woman shuttle crew
would have to wait until early Monday to try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an event I've been looking forward to for a long
time,'' said Discovery commander Kent Rominger, a veteran astronaut
who was anticipating his first opportunity to guide a shuttle onto
the runway as its skipper.
</P>
<P>
   His crew included pilot Rick Husband, flight engineer Ellen
Ochoa, mission specialists Tammy Jernigan and Dan Barry, Canadian
astronaut Julie Payette and Russian cosmonaut Valery Tokarev.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, the shuttle astronauts accomplished the last
of their mission objectives, the deployment of a glittering student
science satellite called Starshine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out there,'' Payette informed mission control as the
beach-ball-size satellite sprang from Discovery's cargo bay at 2:31
a.m., CDT, in response to her remote commands from the shuttle.
``It was a fantastic sight.''
</P>
<P>
   The 86-pound aluminum sphere was covered with nearly 900 small
mirrors polished through the efforts of 25,000 schoolchildren from
18 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Starshine should remain in orbit at least through January,
flashing every few seconds as it crosses the sky at dawn and dusk.
The unpowered satellite was deployed at an altitude of 240 miles
and in an orbit that should make its transit visible to observers
on the ground between northern Canada and the tip of South America.
</P>
<P>
   Student observers plan to record its passage as part of an
educational project to teach them about the sun's influence on the
Earth's atmosphere. Atmospheric drag will gradually cause the
satellite's orbit to sink to about 60 miles. At that point, it will
plunge to earth, burning up harmlessly in the atmosphere, said Gil
Moore, a former Utah State University physics professor and
aerospace engineer who organized the project over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ground observers in Maryland sighted the satellite shortly after
it was deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could not have been a better deal,'' said Moore. ``We are
tickled. We invite everyone in the world to track this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   More information about the educational project, including times
to view the satellite as it crosses the sky, are available on the
Starshine homepage on the Internet at: www.azinet.com/starshine.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's flight was the first of five planned for NASA
shuttles this year. It was the second of 45 missions planned as
part of a multinational effort to assemble a new space station over
the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle astronauts delivered two tons of supplies for the
first resident crews that are expected to begin arriving in March.
They also repaired the station's satellite communications and
electrical power generation systems.
</P>
<P>
   The unstaffed outpost is orbiting the Earth at an altitude of
246 miles.

<P>
   Low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (20-150 parts per
million) can cause irritation of the eyes and headaches upon
contact; slightly higher concentrations or prolonged exposure to
lower levels lead to impaired vision and balance, loss of memory
and death.
</P>
<P>
   A brief exposure to 500 parts per million leads to headaches,
dizziness, diarrhea, bronchitis and pneumonia, and exposure of
800-1,000 parts per million can be fatal after 30 minutes.

   ``If you're listing the effects of even higher concentrations,

TOXINS FROM BELMONT SCHOOL SITE SPREAD TO NEIGHBORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - High levels of a foul, poisonous gas have been
detected around houses adjacent to the Belmont Learning Center, and
residents in the area say the problem grew considerably worse after
construction crews graded the nearby property for the nation's
costliest high school.
</P>
<P>
   A noxious smell, similar to rotten eggs, pervades several
residential streets on a hill north of the complex. The nauseating
odor is strongest _ and most dangerous _ at a three-story wooden
house on Edgeware Street perched above Belmont's football field.
</P>
<P>
   State, county and independent environmental inspectors said the
odor is hydrogen sulfide, a colorless gas that attacks the central
nervous system and can be lethal if inhaled over a prolonged
period.
</P>
<P>
   Since hydrogen sulfide is a natural, hazardous byproduct of
petroleum, the gas has probably been emitted in small quantities
around the site of the $170 million school, which sits above the
Los Angeles City Oil Field, for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But residents said the stench worsened as excavation and
construction at Belmont went forward. State officials halted all
new construction at the site in February amid a cloud of
environmental concerns that escalated the controversy that has
dogged the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here 60 years, and the smell of gas is so bad now.
It was never this way before,'' said Vernia Ferrer, who lives on
Edgeware Street with her 91-year-old husband, Edward.
</P>
<P>
   The hydrogen sulfide problem is the latest to surface in a
continuing Daily News investigation of environmental concerns that
threaten completion of construction of the school, which was sold
as a bold, new experiment in public-private partnership with Kajima
construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Among the disclosures are revelations of lax practices that
allowed oil-contaminated dirt to be mixed with good soil during the
site's grading and documentation of the severity of the problems
associated with the old, shallow oil and gas field that sits below
the site.
</P>
<P>
   State and Los Angeles Unified School District officials have
opened an investigation into these problems.
</P>
<P>
   The hydrogen sulfide problem prompted LAUSD officials to confer
with the state Division of Oil and Gas and the state Department of
Toxic Substances Control to determine if excavation of tons of soil
at Belmont may have exacerbated the seepage around nearby homes.
</P>
<P>
   State Oil and Gas officials are investigating whether the vapors
are coming from an improperly abandoned oil well or a natural vein
of oil that runs under the Belmont site and surfaces near the
homes. The investigation, which began last week, is expected to be
completed within a few days and include exact toxicity measurements
of hydrogen sulfide in the area, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents summoned the city Fire Department and County HAZMAT
workers 10 days ago, and officials determined that levels of
hydrogen sulfide in the air did not present an escalating health
danger or need to evacuate the area.
</P>
<P>
   But that same day and in later tests, Dr. Bernard Endres, an
independent petroleum engineer, measured hydrogen sulfide levels in
the soil outside the Ferrers' house at deadly levels, 348 parts per
million.
</P>
<P>
   Endres, a lead investigator on the infamous methane explosion on
Fairfax Avenue during the late 1980s, said removal of more than 40
feet of soil and clay at Belmont during site preparation, along
with the addition of a layer of clean soil, likely changed
migration patterns in an unconsolidated layer of sediment between
the natural vein of oil and the school site.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results from the state-mandated new battery of
environmental tests at Belmont have found a few low readings of
hydrogen sulfide and one isolated high reading of 3,300 parts per
million coming from a very deep vapor boring, according to the
state Department of Toxic Substances Control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soil movement and construction at Belmont may have influenced
(the apparent increase of hydrogen sulfide in the area.) But it
wouldn't be surprising if it's unrelated to Belmont and related to
only the oil field,'' said Angelo Bellomo, the top environmental
consultant on Los Angeles Unified's School Safety Team.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bellomo, district officials are not distressed
about the levels of hydrogen sulfide detected thus far at Belmont
and are waiting for the remaining results before devising a
remediation plan.
</P>
<P>
   If mitigation is necessary, Bellomo said, an active system of
blowers and vents, which state inspectors already say will be
necessary to ventilate explosive methane gas rising from the site,
can be designed to treat and release hydrogen sulfide into the air
without adverse health effects.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, has asked the county
Department of Health Services to conduct an evaluation of the
neighborhood to determine if levels of hydrogen sulfide and
ailments associated with the poison have increased since August
1997, when excavation began.

CHARISMATIC LOSES CROWN, CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Charismatic found out Saturday that the line
between immortality and mortality is as narrow as a thoroughbred's
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   One moment, he was battling for the lead, only the Belmont
Stakes homestretch and a couple of long shots standing between him
and the Triple Crown. The next, he was hobbling across the finish
line third behind upsetter Lemon Drop Kid and tough Vision and
Verse, and Charismatic was being wrestled to an urgent halt by
jockey Chris Antley.
</P>
<P>
   Events unfolded rapidly in the emotional swirl that followed:
Antley jumping off the colt and feeling the 3-year-old's legs for
injury; the boyish rider dissolving in tears in a friend's hug;
veterinarians and a horse ambulance rushing to the scene in front
of 85,818 silent fans; the rush back to trainer D. Wayne Lukas'
barn to have X-rays taken; the attempts of Belmont Park officials
to describe the injury and soothe a worried public.
</P>
<P>
   And then, amid a collective exhale, the announcement that
although Charismatic's left foreleg fracture is serious enough to
end his amazing racing career, barring complications it should not
be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged about what I just heard,'' Lukas said
after the X-rays were developed. ``He had a good run. It's
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid's photo-finish victory was celebrated by owner
Jeanne Vance and her husband Laddie Dance _ then unaware of
Charismatic's injury _ by trainer Scotty Schulhofer and jockey Jose
Santos and by the few fans who cashed $61.50 win tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But the excitement that had attended the $1 million race and the
third Triple Crown bid in three years was gone, hauled away in a
horse van.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would feel a lot better if this didn't happen,'' said
Schulhofer, whose other Belmont victory, with Colonial Affair and
Julie Krone in 1993, was marred by the fatal breakdown of favorite
Prairie Bayou.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, surprisingly close to the filly Silverbulletday's
quick early pace, apparently took his fateful step when he bobbled
noticeably about two strides from the wire. By then he had already
faded to third after taking a brief lead on the turn for home.
</P>
<P>
   Antley said, though, that he'd felt a sensation ``like the air
going out'' beneath him with about one-quarter mile to go in the
1{-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   Antley's quick action to pull the horse up was credited by Lukas
and veterinarians with preventing further damage and perhaps a
fall. But as it was, Charismatic had injuries described technically
as a displaced condylar fracture of the cannon bone and a cracked
sesamoid bone.
</P>
<P>
   In layman's terms, he has a vertical break of the large bone
above the ankle, leaving bone fragments that will require surgical
repair, and a break in a smaller bone alongside the ankle. The skin
did not break.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians said Charismatic was placed in an air cast before
walking into the ambulance, and was fitted with a hard splint when
he returned to his stall in Belmont's barn 10. He was given
tranquilizing and anti-inflammatory medicines. ``He's in
distress,'' said Dr. Stephen Selway, the vet who examined the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner. ``He's just hiding it, like
most horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgery could be performed at the track as early as today. ``It
looks like a three-screw job,'' Selway said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Bramlage, a Lexington, Ky., veterinarian who serves at
major thoroughbred racing events as spokesman for the American
Association of Equine Practitioners, said precisely when the injury
occurred was ``pure speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bramlage said it would be ``hard to make the case'' that the
injury was brought on by Charismatic's extraordinary schedule,
which had him racing five times in nine weeks and working out
heavily as he rose from a Santa Anita Derby also-ran to within 1{
lengths of the 12th Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went almost a mile and a half,'' Bramlage said. ``If he had
some kind of (physical) problem before that, he couldn't have done
that.... It's just an unfortunate accident.''
</P>
<P>
   This was, on paper, merely the latest Triple Crown near-miss,
the seventh since Affirmed completed the most recent sweep of the
3-year-old classics in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, finally the bettors' favorite, proved his
superiority over the horses expected to challenge him,
Silverbulletday (a tired fifth) and Derby and Preakness runner-up
Menifee (a never-close eighth).
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't beat Lemon Drop Kid, who'd been winless in
stakes-level competition since winning the Belmont Futurity in
September, his 3-for-10 career record including a ninth-place
finish in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Did the injury keep Charismatic from a place on the roster of
racing's immortals? How good could he have gone on to be? We'll
never know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were prepared for not winning,'' said Bob Lewis, who, with
his wife Beverly, owns Charismatic. ``But not this way.''

ONLINE TICKET SALES GIVE SCALPERS UNFAIR ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marc Scapa really likes the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   So crazy is the 33-year-old telemarketer for the rock 'n' roll
band that he recently rose before dawn, walked to a local
Ticketmaster outlet and for four hours waited at the head of a
small line to make sure he'd have first crack at seats for the
Eagles' New Year's Eve show at the soon-to-be-built Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had other things like rent and food to pay for, but I was
going to buy that ticket,'' Scapa said.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster's computer had other ideas. Despite a cashier's
repeated attempts, the only tickets still available seconds after
they went on sale were priced at $500 or more, well beyond Scapa's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he learned, was that sales of tickets over the
Internet had almost instantly drained the pool of lower-priced
seats. And many of those likely went to scalpers who with a few
clicks of a mouse could scoop up hundreds or even thousands of
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame the Ticketmaster staff,'' Scapa said, ``but
people like me got sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to popular sports and cultural events have always sold
fast. And fans have always griped about scalpers abusing the system
at the expense of the little guy. But with the speed and
convenience of the Internet, industry officials say, the process
has been taken to a new level. A sales process that once played out
over several hours or even days now can occur in a few blinks of
the eye.
</P>
<P>
   And the trend is growing just as the summer concert season
approaches its peak. With the likes of Ricky Martin, Tom Waits,
Blondie, Bob Dylan and the Dixie Chicks all touring in the weeks
ahead, the information superhighway is sure to leave thousands of
fans dusted on the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Ticketmaster Online-City Search Inc. reported a
dramatic increase in online sales for the first quarter of 1999.
The company sold $60million worth of tickets in the three-month
period, which on an annualized basis represents about 10 percent of
Ticketmaster Corp.'s total 1998 sales. It also was a 275 percent
increase over the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the online ticket seller, the nation's largest,
said the rapid growth will likely continue. ``Market forces are
dictating a shift in distribution,'' said Robert Perkins, the
service's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, it has gotten that much harder for
non-computer users, who still form the bulk of the buying public,
to secure seats to high-demand events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scalpers have the advantage,'' said Joe McLaughlin, co-founder
of Seattle-based BuyandSell.com, an Internet auction site.
</P>
<P>
   While most customers still buy their tickets in person or over
the telephone, scalpers are buying tickets online in lots as high
as a given event allows. As soon as they've completed one
transaction, the scalper will generally start over, usually with
another name, address and credit card number. ``So how do you know
if someone's a scalper or not?'' McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, scalpers have found in the Internet a ready means to
distribute their goods.
</P>
<P>
   Auction sites like eBay.com and Ubid.com provide a forum that
electronically brings buyer and seller together to negotiate a
price. In the case of opening day of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace,'' tickets with a face value of $8.50 were sold on
eBay for as high as $40, a 370 percent markup. Seats at some
popular sports events sell for $1,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Some professional ticket brokers say the phenomenon is
overblown, that the Internet is merely the latest boogeyman to draw
blame from disappointed fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too simplistic an answer that the Internet is entirely to
blame,'' said Brian Lercel, a salesman at Barry's Tickets in
Encino. ``I'm sure some brokers are buying tickets online, but you
come across some of the same difficulties as with the old system.
There's busy signals, you can't get your order to go through. It's
more convenient but it's not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster said it does its best to discourage scalping of all
types. By screening purchases by name, mailing address, credit card
number and other data that it said must be kept secret, the company
tries to weed out the blatantly profit-minded.
</P>
<P>
   But restrictions are different for each event and are ultimately
dictated by the organizers themselves, according to Perkins. If the
Staples Center sets a limit of three, five or 12 Eagles tickets per
customer, that's what Ticketmaster will try to enforce. If no limit
is set, scalpers can literally buy out the house.
</P>
<P>
   There have been attempts to address the online scalping issue
specifically.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin's BuyandSell site sets a ceiling on each ticket put
up for sale. The first bidder to reach that target walks away with
the goods, he said. ``Scalping is bad for fans, so we're not going
to let you go way out of the ballpark, charging $300 for a $30
ticket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, artists themselves have stepped in. Billy Joel
has made a practice of reserving seats in the first several rows at
his concerts that roadies then fill with fans pulled from the
nose-bleed sections. John Mellencamp sets aside a portion of all
tickets to his concerts for members of his official fan club.
</P>
<P>
   Scapa, McLaughlin and others say that ticket outlets should
likewise reserve a portion of tickets for walk-up and telephone
customers, at least in the first hours of sales. At a minimum, they
argue, venues for popular events should consider lowering limits on
how many tickets each customer can buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that irks me is that this isn't just about the
Eagles. Pink Floyd's going to play and I heard Jimmy Buffet might
be coming,'' Scapa said. ``I want to prevent what happened to me
from happening to others. I never got a ticket.''

NATO BRASS SET TERMS OF PULLOUT PLAN; YUGOSLAV DELEGATION TAKE TIME
TO TALK WITH BELGRADE 
 

</HEADLINE>
 MAIN-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
BRUSSELS, Belgium _ A NATO military chief Saturday laid out
detailed Kosovo withdrawal demands for Yugoslav commanders, but the
critical session was continued until today needed to consult with
officials in Belgrade.
<TEXT>
<P>
   NATO officials said they saw nothing inherently worrisome in the
delay, although chances that the allied air campaign against
Yugoslavia might be called off today, as some had predicted,
appeared to be dimming.
</P>
<P>
   After a five-hour session in a Macedonian cafe 200 yards from
the Kosovo border, leaders of the Yugoslav delegation told Gen.
Michael Jackson, the Briton who heads NATO's rapid reaction force,
that they needed to talk about details of the pullout plan with
authorities in their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, NATO officials said the talks would resume Saturday
night, but after a recess of about three hours, the Yugoslavs'
request for an overnight delay was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, in the interest of seeking a swift resolution to
this, agreed,'' said Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, an alliance
spokesman. He said that until then, it had been ``a constructive
day of very positive talks.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the withdrawal plan presented to
the Yugoslavs by Jackson spelled out details of the timetables,
routes and assembly points NATO wants all Yugoslav forces in Kosovo
to abide by as they depart. Shea said it was unclear if NATO
political leaders would decide to make public the complete plan.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford said that as a result of the session, ``each part of
the military-technical agreement has been discussed word by word,
line by line and sentence by sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we now have is a full understanding on both sides as to
the content of the military-technical agreement and what it
actually requires the Yugoslav delegation and the Yugoslav armed
forces to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting and then the delay came as questions intensified
about Russia's role in the international force that will police
Kosovo. A foreign-ministers' session scheduled for today in Germany
to finish drafting a U.N. Security Council resolution mandating the
multinational force was canceled because the Kremlin has yet to
agree on a chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   NATO had invited Russia to send representatives to the
withdrawal planning conference in Macedonia on Saturday, but no one
from the Moscow regime showed up.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's political arm, the North Atlantic Council, is standing by
at alliance headquarters in the Belgian capital to review the
Yugoslav responses and Jackson's view of the Serbs' intentions. If
satisfied that Milosevic's forces are prepared to carry out the
withdrawal plan the Yugoslav leader agreed to on Thursday, the
council can order a halt to NATO's air bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that from the time NATO puts the agreement into
effect, Yugoslav forces will have seven days to complete the
pullout. He said Yugoslav planes and air defense systems, including
radar, also must be removed from the province.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said NATO expects the forces to withdraw well into Serbia
and not be repositioned in Montenegro, another anti-Milosevic
province of Yugoslavia. Still under discussion, the spokesman said,
is whether NATO troops moving into Kosovo can pick up Serb
officials who, like Milosevic, have been indicted as war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire will trigger the initial deployment of what
eventually will be approximately 50,000 international troops to
oversee the return of more than 800,000 ethnic Albanians who have
fled or been driven from Kosovo. The international force, which
could be in Kosovo for years, will be heavily reliant on soldiers
from NATO nations but also is to include Russians, who as fellow
Slavs have historic and emotional ties to Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said NATO members ``have to
recognize the realities that the Russians are not going to go back
to their Parliament and say we have put our troops under NATO
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what they will do _ and what they have done in Bosnia _ is
reach an agreement by which you do have a unified chain of command
of which Russia is a part and cannot operate independently and
separately,'' Cook said in a BBC interview.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is seeking to guard against a deployment of the KFOR (for
``Kosovo force``) that would leave Russian troops in control of
areas, including Orthodox Christian religious sites, of special
interest to Serb nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about differentiated zones. That's very
clear,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, British military officials discussed
for ``outline'' purposes a map showing how the major elements of
the international force, including U.S. troops, would be stationed
geographically in Kosovo. The planned position of the Russian
forces was not shown.
</P>
<P>
   Shea refused to be drawn out on the point, contending: ``It's
our intention to have soldiers in every village and on every street
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Saturday, NATO airstrikes continued, focusing on Serb
armed forces in Kosovo. The alliance will ``remain fully vigilant''
and ready to resume the bombing if there is a breakdown in the
withdrawal plans, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to beef up again in case something happens,''
said NATO military spokesman Walter Jertz.
</P>
<P>
   NATO sought to keep the pressure on Milosevic even as Jackson
met with the Yugoslav officials because, Shea said, ``one thing
that we've learned is that we cannot take his (Milosevic's) word
for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to emphasize this is not a negotiating session,'' Shea
said as Jackson went over the detailed plan with the Yugoslav
representatives. ``Those troops have to pack their bags and leave
without delay, and certainly without a last fling of ethnic
cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Shea also called on the Albanian Kosovar
rebels to stand down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the Kosovo Liberation Army to exercise restraint and
not to attempt to take advantage of the situation,'' Shea said. He
said NATO forces ``will not tolerate any hindrance to their
mission.'' He predicted the international force will be so strong
that ``people will be inclined to cooperate with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said Serb troops would have the right to defend
themselves if attacked by the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz said NATO will soon discuss the ``difficult issue'' of
disarming the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   While the KLA calls for independence from Serb-dominated
Yugoslavia, NATO nations have refused to endorse a breakaway. The
current peace plan dropped an earlier proposal for a Kosovo
independence referendum in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said, however, NATO has ``not backed off from the
fundamental goal of reaching autonomy'' for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let's allow the people to eat bread and live under one
roof first, then worry about the more political aspects later,''
Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO-Yugoslav leadership meeting, in the Europe Cafe at
Blace, Macedonia, began about three hours late, apparently because
of Yugoslav concerns about lack of security at the site. The lead
Yugoslav officials were the army deputy chief of staff, Blagjoe
Kovacevic, and the Serb deputy interior minister, Obrad Stefanovic,
who is also a police general.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the recess, Clifford said: ``The delegation has
asked for more time to consult with their higher authorities in
Belgrade over the content of the military-technical agreement.''

   LOS ANGELES: into a new one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Kaufman &AMP; Broad is building a 75-unit project
just north of the Foothill Freeway. None of the homes, which range
in price from about $190,000 to the mid-$200,000 range, have been
completed, but 22 have been sold. Leon Swails, president of the
company's greater Los Angeles operations, said the current sales
rate is about two homes per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really pleased with that. It's a really brisk pace for
us. We could very easily be out of there by the first week of next
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman &AMP; Broad buys land that has already been approved for new
housing developments and is currently looking for more sites
throughout the Valley. The company declined to provide specific
locations.
</P>
<P>
   But if company officials can find the land and build the houses,
they won't have any trouble selling the product as long as the
economy stays strong.
</P>
<P>
   Demand is such that builders haven't advertised extensively and
can rely on word-of-mouth or passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people that are buying here are from Sylmar or San
Fernando, so I don't have to go into a spiel about the neighborhood
because they already know about it,'' said Kaufman &AMP; Broad sales
representative Ronald Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Some families, like the Santamarias, are so keen on buying a new
home that they are willing to put up with several months of
inconvenience. The family has already sold its home in Canyon
Country and is prepared to live in an apartment while they decide
which property to buy and then wait for it to be finished.
</P>
<P>
   They have already put down a deposit on a home at Mountain Glen
but are now leaning toward one of the Kaufman &AMP; Broad models
because the lots are bigger.
</P>
<P>
   They also checked out about 30 properties in the Santa Clarita
resale market but could not find any deals. ``I like the area in
Santa Clarita, but the homes are very expensive. It's a sellers
market and they don't want to negotiate,'' Silvia Santamaria said.
</P>
<P>
   And buying a new home today, even one in a tract with existing
homes nearby, is almost like getting a custom home.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers can select a variety of floor plans and options like spa
tubs, balconies and kitchen islands. Some even come with three car
garages.
</P>
<P>
   First-time buyers Lamar Shamburger, a computer analyst, and
Doria Braggs are planning a June 12 wedding and getting ready to
buy their first home.
</P>
<P>
   The houses they have seen in Sylmar look like nice places to
start their life together, agreed Shamburger and Braggs, who have
set a budget of $180,000.
</P>
<P>
   They too, are determined to make their first purchase a new
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving into a house for the first time, and we can do
what we want with it,'' said Braggs, a Lake View Terrace resident.
</P>
<P>
   Added Shamburger, ``We're still looking, but we've seen things
we like so we'll probably put an offer in soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Further to the West in Granada Hills, Porter Ranch Development
Co./S&AMP;S Construction Co. is getting ready to start on two projects
totaling 255 homes that will be pricier that those in Sylmar.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-home Villagio project opened for preview last weekend,
and homes go on sale this weekend. Prices are in the $400,000 to
mid-$500,000 range. Later this summer, the 200-home Renaissance
development goes on line. Those prices have not been set yet, said
Randy Tasch, the company's sales manager for the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Porter Ranch Development still has more than 1,000 acres it can
develop, the biggest single chunk of entitled property left in the
Valley. The company has been building homes in the Valley since the
mid-1980s, and the prices of their new homes have climbed between
15 and 20 percent over the last 10 years, Tasch said.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, expects that the homes built this summer will be sold
before they are finished.
</P>
<P>
   And Tasch agreed that this is the biggest surge in new home
development since the 1980s. But it is nothing like what was
happening back then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-eight and '89 were uncomparable. They (buyers) were
lining up 1,000 deep. I don't know if we'll ever see that again,
but now the demand for new housing out there is tremendous,'' he
said.

NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION AT HIGHEST PACE IN 10 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With their three children in tow, Frank Santamaria
and his wife, Silvia, spent a recent Sunday afternoon browsing
through model homes, marveling at the spacious kitchens and big
yards. It's become a familiar ritual.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Canyon Country, a community north of Los
Angeles, have been house-shopping for three months and were
revisiting a new Kaufman &AMP; Broad track north of the Foothill
Freeway in the Sylmar community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley
that they had checked out several times before.
</P>
<P>
   They know that the market is tight, which means sellers hold the
upper hand when it comes to negotiating price. But the Santamarias
are determined to make their next house a new one, even if it means
leaving the comfortable confines of the Santa Clarita Valley for
the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple case of math and money management as the family
tries to make its $230,000 go as far as it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get more house here than you can get there,'' said
Frank Santamaria, a salesman at a local Ford dealer. ``The area
makes a difference, but we want to get a nice house.''
</P>
<P>
   While the San Fernando Valley's resale housing market is in the
midst of a boom, the new home building market also is gathering
steam. Building pads are being graded and new homes are springing
up throughout the Valley at a pace not seen in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   This new product spans the entire price range, from homes
considered affordable _ the high $100,000 range _ to palatial
estates with seven-figure price tags. And while it can't be
classified as a boom, the gain is significant when compared to the
recent past.
</P>
<P>
   New home building in the Valley is now running 30 percent ahead
of what was taking place several years ago, said John Kennedy, the
Los Angeles City Planning Department tract supervisor for the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   New home construction is a cyclical business, and there have
been gains of this magnitude before. But the current one is the
biggest since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Since the economy remains strong, this resurgence has some legs
under it, but geography dictates that it cannot last forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big demand as long as the economy and interest
rates stay the way they are, so I can foresee this lasting for
months if not years. But at some point we are going to run out of
dirt, at least for large developments, anyway,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   He notes there is a big demand for new homes that can put their
owners closer to jobs in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these are sold out as they are coming out of the
ground. There is a certain urgency at the time of final inspection
on these houses because people are waiting to get in,'' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the north and west ends of the Valley have been
hot spots for new construction. But in this latest burst, the
activity has moved east into Sylmar and Tujunga.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy estimated that about 770 homes are under construction at
various sites across the Valley, including smaller tracts of just a
handful of homes in existing neighborhoods on the Valley floor.
</P>
<P>
   And there are some big projects under way, too.
</P>
<P>
   As Hubbard Street winds its way into the low foothills of the
Angeles National Forest, the demarcation line between urban sprawl
and wilderness, Wilshire Builders of Santa Monica is hammering,
sawing and grading away on what will become a 467-home development,
Daybreak at Mountain Glen. Nature will be the neighbor next door.
</P>
<P>
   Prices start in the $190,000 range and top out at about $240,000
at what will eventually become a private, gated community with a
common pool and recreation area.
</P>
<P>
   The company broke ground last July on the first phase of 150
homes, and business has been brisk. So far, 29 homes have been sold
on a pre-build basis, or more than 20percent of the first phase
allocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well above our expectations,'' Howard Press, the
company's vice president, said of interest in the new development.
</P>
<P>
   The lots average about 4,000 square feet and, as in the case
with other new home developments, buyers will pay more for bigger
lots and better views. Down payment requirements can be tailored to
meet the needs of individual buyers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been in the works for ``well over 10 years,''
and the economic factors have finally fallen into place for
development to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing today is a lot of appreciation for new
homes. We're seeing demand outstrip supply. And our prices are very
competitive for what's going on in the rest of the San Fernando
Valley,'' Press said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the traffic is from first-time buyers or families that
own a home and simply want to move into a new one, he said.

WHITE'S SLAM IS OVERLOOKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It hardly will be remembered that Devon White won
Saturday's game over the Angels with a grand slam. The 7-4 Dodgers
victory will permanently be stamped with the fight between pitchers
Chan Ho Park and Tim Belcher that led to a bench-clearing brawl.
</P>
<P>
   But White's sixth-inning shot, the seventh grand slam of his
career, could not have come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   At age 36, White is not having a very good year. The Dodgers
signed the center fielder to a three-year, $12.4 million contract,
but since the first week of the season, when he batted .500 (10 for
20), White had been hitting just .218 (31 for 142) entering the
Angels series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see Devo come through like that,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``He is a big part of this ball club
and we need him.''
</P>
<P>
   White, who played his first six seasons with the Angels, had two
hits in Friday's 5-4 Dodgers victory. He now is batting .259.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things happen in the course of a year,'' said White, who
batted .279 with a career high 22 homers last season. ``Good
players end up fighting through it. I don't think I have to prove
anything to anyone at this point in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice thought, but with pressure to win this season, the
Dodgers are keeping an eye on everyone. When White missed seven
games in mid-May with a strained right hamstring, some in the
organization were worried about his durability.
</P>
<P>
   But with Eric Young missing playing time and Mark Grudzielanek
and Todd Hollandsworth on the disabled list, injuries have been a
concern all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problem this year has been everyone wants to go up
there and hit the grand slam every night,'' White said. ``The guys
have been feeling the pressure and they want to be the one to end
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Park slammed: Not only is Park expected to receive a three-game
suspension for his fifth-inning fight with Belcher, he now has tied
a major-league record by allowing four grand slams this season.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Walbeck's fourth-inning slam tied Park with Detroit's Ray
Narleski (1959), Philadelphia's Tug McGraw (1979), and Seattle's
Mike Schooler (1992).
</P>
<P>
   Park previously gave up two grand slams to the Cardinals'
Fernando Tatis (April 23) in the same inning and one to Arizona's
Travis Lee on April 12. The major-league record for grand slams
allowed in a career is 10 by Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: White's grand slam was the first by a Dodger since
Raul Mondesi hit one May 31, 1998, vs. Cincinnati. White leads all
Dodgers in that department. Gary Sheffield is second with five....
Sheffield hit his 12th homer of the year in the seventh and
finished the game 2 for 4. In his last 25 games, Sheffield is
batting .354 (34 for 96).... Catcher Angel Pena had two more hits
and is 4 for 8 in the series, raising his average from .133 to .261
(6 for 23). He also threw out Todd Greene attempting to steal to
end the sixth.

KNICKS BEAT PACERS, 92-91  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Larry Johnson was all alone on the left wing with the
ball in his hands, the clock ticking down and the anxiety of an
impossible situation cascading on his sculpted shoulders. And at
that instant, he remembered what it was like to be in this
position. To be the star, to be the go-to man, to be the one to
pull off miracles.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, the former All-Star from Charlotte had
willingly put his ego aside as he deferred to Patrick Ewing and
then to the newer, hipper Knicks who came along. But without the
injured Ewing Saturday night, and without a lift from either
Latrell Sprewell or Allan Houston, it was all on Johnson for Game 3
of the Eastern Conference finals at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   There had been 11.9 seconds left when the inbounds pass was
tipped by Indiana's Jalen Rose and ended up in Johnson's hands on a
broken play that was meant for Houston. Johnson stared into the
eyes of Antonio Davis, head-faked him, then slipped to his left on
the perimeter. As Davis grabbed the waist of Johnson's shorts,
Johnson let go of a high, spinning 3-pointer that was gulped down
by the net like a smooth drink with 5.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   And then the whistle. Davis was called for the foul, and an
elated Johnson had to gather himself from the emotion of his
game-tying shot and deliver a free throw. He nailed it for an
unthinkable 4-point play to win Game 3, 92-91, and reinforce the
fact that nothing is impossible for the Knicks. As the Garden crowd
showered Johnson with cheers, he made the ``Big L'' sign with his
elbow and danced in the right corner of the floor. Amid the mayhem,
the Knicks grabbed a 2-1 lead in the four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit it, it doesn't sink in until the game ends,''
Johnson said. ``Then it's like, `Oh, my.' And there's Spike Lee
coming at you. And the Garden crowd. Wow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I thought it was good when I let it go. It felt
right, and then there was contact. I just wanted to get it off. But
as good as it feels, you can't go and celebrate too much. You can
have a great win, a great shot and still lose the series, 4-2. The
main thing was, we hung around and hung around.''
</P>
<P>
   They've done it the whole series. Twice now, the Knicks have had
the big-shot makers, not the Pacers. Twice now, they have turned
fourth-quarter deficits into game-winning situations down the
stretch. That's usually Reggie Miller's job in a series like this.
But after Johnson's play, Miller was traced around the court by
Houston, and Mark Jackson was forced to toss up a desperation jump
hook that bounced off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd seen a lot of things,'' said Miller, who was 4
for 9 shooting and scored 12 points in an arena where he has been
known to devastate the Knicks. ``We had a 3-point lead, and you
think the worst thing you can do is tie. I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's 4-point play made all the feelings of despair over
Ewing's season-ending injury disappear for a night. But he was not
alone in the way he delivered. Even though Sprewell and Houston
combined to shoot 12 of 36 from the field, there was Marcus Camby
to hover over the paint for dunks, keep balls alive with taps and
come up with key stops on defense. Camby ended the night with 21
points off the bench
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the biggest play of the game was with 1:44 to go,
and we are up, and Marcus came flying in for a rebound, and three
of our guys are standing there,'' Indiana Coach Larry Bird said.
``Nobody went after him. We made a lot of mistakes down the stretch
and it cost us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Marcus was the best player out there. He had a
phenomenal game.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was right there with Camby. Time and time again, this
man built for the low post came up with uncanny 3-pointers, like
the one from 30 feet that tied the game at the end of the first
quarter, and the one that banked in to put the Knicks ahead, 75-71,
early in the fourth. Johnson had 26 points and hit 10 of 18 shots,
including 3 for 6 from 3-point range. The last was a sight even
Coach Jeff Van Gundy had never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the shot, and we had no timeouts,'' Van Gundy said.
``He had the shot. And with that emotion, the hard part is to make
the free throw. I've never seen a 4-point play that won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' defense put them in position for the wild comeback.
Rik Smits, preying on a Knicks team without Ewing to answer his
offense, gave the Pacers an 89-81 lead with 3 minutes 21 seconds
left. They scored just 2 more points from there as the Knicks
scraped away _ using a 3-pointer from Chris Childs, a layin by
Sprewell _ until it was 89-88 with 13.8 seconds left after Camby
hit two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers' first points since the 3:21 mark came when Jackson
was fouled and put at the line with 11.9 seconds remaining. He
delivered both free throws and forced the Knicks to hit a 3-pointer
just to tie. They did better than that, as Johnson sent the crowd
into an unreal frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   All night, the low-post vacuum Ewing left was filled by Johnson,
who wheeled inside for layups around everyone from Derrick McKey to
Dale Davis. He was in such a groove that he even popped a
buzzer-beating  &QC; 30-foot jumper to tie the game at the end of the
fist quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was a live body for putbacks, as well, but more than
anything, he gave them a plan with Sprewell and Houston off their
shooting game. Houston also had five first-half turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks stayed in the game and even nudged ahead, 34-27, with
4:30 left in the half on fast breaks and second-chance points from
an active Camby. But once Johnson sat down, there was chaos in the
half-court offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers just hummed along, and made up a 7-point
second-quarter deficit by scoring on their last 10 possessions of
the half to take a 47-42 lead. The main element of their run was
Smits. After fumbling around a game Chris Dudley, he started to
spring outside and bury his high-arching jumper.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 feet 4 inches, no one could stop him as he scored 14 points
in a row in the final 4:35 of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Things were different in the third quarter. Van Gundy broke from
his habit of not tinkering with his starting lineup and started
Camby for the third. And it made all the difference. He was
everywhere, jumping into the action from the start by taking a
steal by Charlie Ward and then soaring from the free-throw line for
a jam.
</P>
<P>
   He followed that up with a flurry of points, rebounds and
defensive stops to help the Knicks regain the lead four minutes
into the quarter on his fast-break dunk.

ANGELS DECRY PARK'S ACTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Chan Ho Park and Tim Belcher took the baseball
term ``pitchers' duel'' a little too literally Saturday afternoon
at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The fight between Park and Belcher -- precipitated by what Park
called an excessively hard tag by Belcher -- included an elbow by
Park, a curse word from Belcher, a forearm to the chin by Park and
then an attempt by Park to throw a martial arts kick.
</P>
<P>
   As a crowd of players piled on the dueling pitchers, Belcher
threw a few punches at Park's head, none landing with much force.
And that's too bad, the Angels said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was, `What is this?' '' Angels shortstop Gary
DiSarcina said. ``Is this the new Dodger Blue? It was karate chop
Blue. From the looks of it, (Park) must not be an intelligent
person when it comes to playing the game. Whether it's because of
where he's from, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I saw kicking in a fight was after my older
brother took a Barbie Doll away from my younger sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn was first on the scene and
initially tried to restrain Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when you get into a brawl you've got a reason,''
Vaughn said. ``The whole time, I was screaming `What is going on
out here?' I know some of their guys over there, and we were
laughing, we couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were some light-hearted comments about the incident,
the general feeling in the Angels clubhouse was one of disbelief
and disdain for Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pure stupidity on (Park's) part,'' closer Troy Percival
said. ``Belcher was doing his job and (Park) acts like he's never
been out on the field before. Ask their (Dodgers) players. I'm sure
they don't condone what he did. It was just stupid. He shocked
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said catcher Matt Walbeck, whose
fourth-inning grand slam went to waste in the Angels' loss. ``All
of a sudden they started fighting. Fighting is one thing, but when
spikes start flying ... That was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher refused to talk to the media after the game but issued a
statement through an Angels spokesman:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to get into the altercation from my
standpoint. But I do respect the umpiring crew for leaving me in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was not injured in the fight except for being spiked on
his left thigh and a bruise on his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins said was as baffled as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be one thing if Tim had knocked some guys down,'' he
said. ``Park already knocked Randy (Velarde) down a couple times,
but Tim didn't respond. He went out and pitched his game. That's
it.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina will have X-rays on his left forearm Wednesday and if
they show the bone has healed as expected, he could be cleared to
begin a rehabilitation assignment by Thursday, probably at single-A
Lake Elsinore.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina hasn't played all season after breaking a bone in the
forearm Feb. 21 when coach George Hendrick accidently hit him with
a fungo bat. DiSarcina continues to take batting practice and field
ground balls in pregame workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One good thing I've got going for me is I've got a lot of the
soreness out of the way because I've stayed with the club and I've
been taking ground balls every day,'' DiSarcina said. ``The only
thing I need to do right now is adjust to game speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Sheets, acquired just before the start of the season in a
trade from the Padres, has done adequately as DiSarcina's
replacement. Sheets is hitting .226 with three homers, 23 RBIs and
eight errors. But Collins says DiSarcina can't be replaced for what
he does for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take anything away from the guys we have in
there,'' Collins said. ``But Gary's one of those guys whose energy
spreads. The way he plays the game, the way he says something on
the bench. His presence in our lineup is important.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina likely would need at least two weeks on a rehab
assignment before he's ready to play with the big league club.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Omar Olivares' strained left hamstring was sore
Saturday, one day after he injured it while trying to beat out an
infield grounder in Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first did it I thought I'd be able to go back out
there,'' Olivares said. ``But there was a little knot. I didn't
want to risk it and maybe tear the muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainers won't know until sometime today or tomorrow how severe
the strain is, but Olivares is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure it won't be bad,'' he said. ``Maybe I'll miss
one start, if that.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares' next scheduled start would be Wednesday in San
Francisco. If he can't go, Collins said he'd likely choose a
replacement from his bullpen. The two likely candidates are Scott
Schoeneweis and Mark Petkovsek.
</P>
<P>
   The A.L. West is a bad division? The numbers don't say so. Based
on the combined records of the teams in each division (going into
Sunday's games), the A.L. West is the best division in the American
League and second best in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The A.L. West is 12 games over .500, the A.L. East is even and
the A.L. Central is 17 games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   In the National League, the N.L. Central is 23 games over .500,
the N.L. West is one game over .500 and the N.L. East is 19 games
under .500.
</P>
<P>
   Any question that the American League is a hitters' league? The
Angels began the day ranked No. 2 in the league in ERA (4.32) and
No. 1 in fielding percentage (.985) yet were in last place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the offense ranked No. 12 in runs per game (4.6) and
No. 11 in batting average (.263).

SCHMID TRIES TO MOVE AROUND PIECES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ It was only a matter of time before Sigi Schmid
started tinkering with the Galaxy's future.
</P>
<P>
   This is a person who had 19 straight winning seasons and three
NCAA championships at UCLA before taking over for Octavio Zambrano
five games into the Galaxy season. He's gone 3-3 since to run
L.A.'s record to 5-6, but a league-low seven goals prompted some
personnel changes over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the signing of New Zealand midfielder Simon
Elliott, and recently, the trade of Welton to Miami in exchange for
New York/New Jersey midfielder Roy Myers; all part of a three-team
MLS swap that also included sending Eric Wynalda from San Jose to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Myers joined the team Friday and Schmid expects him to see
valuable minutes this afternoon when the Galaxy plays host to
Kansas City (1-9) at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up a quality player (Welton) to get a quality
player,'' said Schmid. ``In Roy, we get someone to play the right
side of our midfield. I think he will do well in there with Simon
and Mauricio (Cienfuegos).
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we needed more creative play out of our midfield and I
think Roy will make those final passes for us on a consistent
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   These moves create another decision for Schmid _ does he leave
Clint Mathis on the front line with Cobi Jones and Carlos
Hermosillo (who returns Monday)? Or does Mathis return to his old
role as an attacking midfielder?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if Clint is playing well, we'll find spots for him,''
said Schmid. ``He's been struggling a little lately but Clint's an
awfully talented player. Eventually, though, I think Clint's best
position is when he's not on the front line. I think he's a better
attacker coming from the midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, though, we'll just have to see how all the pieces fit
when we get everyone together and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is returning from a tough 2-1 shootout loss to
Columbus last week. The Crew scored in the 88th minute to tie the
match, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my most frustrating loss since I've been here,''
admitted Schmid. ``We had a lead, played reasonably well and missed
other chances we should have had. So, after all that, to squander a
lead in the late minutes was really tough. Late in the game Clint
was one-on-one and Cobi was one-on-one and we got nothing out of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have to start finishing those opportunities if
we want to put these teams away.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid is convinced his players will work through the struggles,
particularly his stagnant offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it something that's starting to eat at them? Yes,'' said
Schmid. ``But they want to crack this open as much as anybody. I
think the key to this team is that they haven't lost their
composure or their willingness to turn this around.''

 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His silver hair glinted in the sun, and a tear
glistened in his eye. At the commencement ceremonies for Albert
Einstein College of Medicine last week, Robert J. Lopatin looked
like any of the proud fathers watching their children start medical
careers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopatin's hair was covered by a cap, and his body by a gown.
He was not there to cheer the medical school graduates. At the age
of 55, he was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Lopatin is the oldest graduate in the school's history _ he is
older than the school, which was founded in 1955 _ and one of only
about a dozen medical school students in the country to have
graduated at 55 or older, according to the American Association of
Medical Colleges. At an age when some doctors are hitting the links
or contemplating who should take over their practices, Lopatin, who
spent almost three decades in the garment industry, is just getting
started in his profession.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, he has more in common with his professors, quite a
few of whom are younger than he is, than with his fresh-faced
fellow students. But as unusual as Lopatin seems, he may also be
the face of the future in a society with ever-increasing longevity.
If women are becoming mothers in their 50s, why not mint doctors at
that age?
</P>
<P>
   As a student at Stuyvesant High School, Lopatin said, he thought
of ``nothing else'' but being a doctor. But at Columbia College,
where he was in the class of 1965, he packed away his dream,
instead joining his father in the garment business upon graduation.
Together, the two ran Evelyn Pearson Inc., a manufacturer of
women's clothing that eventually employed 400 people.
</P>
<P>
   Lopatin said he was happy in the industry. The garment business
got in his blood, so much so that he still reads Women's Wear Daily
religiously.
</P>
<P>
   But as garment production shifted to cheaper factories abroad,
Lopatin found himself more importer than manufacturer, a change
that did not suit him. So in 1990, he and his father sold the
business. Lopatin stayed on for a year as a consultant. Then he was
a free man.
</P>
<P>
   He took classes: Shakespeare, Latin, calculus. ``To me, taking
time off means look for the nearest registrar's office,'' he
explained somewhat sheepishly. He never married or had children, so
there were few constraints on his time. He signed up to be an
interpreter at the United Nations (he speaks six languages). He
went on an archaeological dig in Belgium (he had earned a master's
degree in art history while working at Evelyn Pearson).
</P>
<P>
   And then, in August 1992, a conversation with a medical student
reawakened his long-dormant yearning to be a doctor. He began
pestering New York University to let him enroll in premed classes _
classes that were starting the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'm not going to take you _ you're not going to get
into medical school,''' recalled Graham Underwood, the school's
assistant dean for preprofessional advisement. Lopatin persisted;
the next day, he was in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not recommend it for the normal person,'' Dean
Underwood said. But by all accounts Lopatin is not a normal person.
The decades have done nothing to dim his curiosity, his drive, his
love of learning, his eagerness to please.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anything Bob does he excels at, except for sports,''
said Chuck Meyer, Lopatin's college roommate at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Lopatin again defied expectations by being accepted at Einstein,
which is in the Bronx. (His interviewer there had also attended
Stuyvesant _ 10 years after Lopatin.)
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lazar, the assistant dean at Einstein, said the school
looks for students with different perspectives. And Lopatin's
determination impressed him, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's the type of guy who's going to retire in
nine years,'' Dean Lazar said.
</P>
<P>
   So Lopatin packed up one life _ putting paintings and books in
storage and subletting his apartment _ and began another. For the
four years of medical school, he has lived on campus, in a studio
apartment where artworks line the walls.
</P>
<P>
   With his gold rimmed glasses and loafers, he already looks very
much the doctor, when in fact he is just beginning his residency in
the Bronx, at Montefiore Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   There is a decent argument to be made that Lopatin's space would
have been better used by a younger student with prospects of a
longer career. But Dean Lazar said he suspects the quality of
Lopatin's career may outweigh its brevity.
</P>
<P>
   And Lopatin said he believes that his age enhances the quality
of his care. Patients, he said, trust him, and life has given him a
wisdom to help them through their pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a young doctor, but I'm an old person,'' he said. ``I've
lost that youthful feeling of immortality.''
</P>
<P>
   His own father died a protracted, painful death while he was in
medical school. When Lopatin was accepted at Einstein, his father
told him he would not live to see him finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put myself in his mind, how a person could live day by
day facing death,'' Lopatin said. ``It's central to my work right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   As the son tried on his cap and gown last week, he stared into
the mirror, and his father stared back. Fingering the fabric of his
gown, Lopatin called his medical career a miracle. Asked where he
sees himself in five years, he was briefly silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee,'' he finally said, marveling at the notion, ``I'll be a
doctor.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending May 29 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

PARK'S ACTIONS HARD TO DEFEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park delivered a forearm
shiver and scissor kick to Angels pitcher Tim Belcher before being
restrained by catcher Angel Pena, and suddenly ``assault and
battery'' took on a whole new meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The prudence of Park's psychotic turn Saturday in the fifth
inning of the Dodgers' 7-4 win over Anaheim is open to
interpretation. If you're not in the Foxhole fighting in Rupert
Murdoch's battalion, what Park did seems indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   From far afield of the slings and arrows, Park's argument
sounded preposterous. So what if Belcher fielded Park's bunt and
applied a little extra mustard to his tag? And what if Belcher
answered Park's plaintive challenge _ ``Whassup?'' with this
poisoned dart: ``Shut up and get the (expletive) back to the
dugout''?
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't strike this civilian as just cause to turn around
and fire to maim with the forearm and the foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He challenged me. I was just protecting myself,'' said a
non-contrite Park.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, he retaliated so swiftly, so violently, Belcher was
fortunate to escape with only a bruised left forearm and a mottled
left thigh. Truth to tell, the fresh blemish on his record was
probably what hurt the proud, 13th-year veteran the most.
</P>
<P>
   Until Park attacked him and cleared both benches, Belcher was
the one on the offensive. He had shut out his former team through
the first four innings, limiting them to three harmless singles. He
took the mound in the fifth with a 4-0 cushion that catcher Matt
Walbeck had provided via a grand slam off Park in the top of the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher didn't look like the same pitcher after the players
repaired to their respective corners and Park was ejected and the
game resumed. His fourth pitch to the next batter, Eric Young,
skittered past Walbeck. Young flied out to end the inning, but the
chink in Belcher's armor had been exposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, the Dodgers burned Belcher for five runs, four on
one mighty swing by Devon White. At that point, Belcher was
relieved of the ball without having retired a batter in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   So the Dodgers lost Park and won the game. The sacrifice bunt
that set off the fireworks? To his teammates, that was nothing
compared to the sacrifice he made for machismo. Listening to them
talk, it seemed they thought he was more deserving of a slap on the
back than the slap on the wrist that probably will be forthcoming
from the National League office.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher ``was pretty much handing it to us,'' Young said.
``There has to be an order of respect out there and Chan Ho felt
like he was being disrespected. If he's fired up and wants to go
out there, I'm going to be right behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand: You won't find any Dodgers choosing Sister Sledge's
``We Are Family'' as their at-bat song. But even with as many
individual agendas as there are on the Dodgers, everyone apparently
can agree on this: The warriors' code of honor is to be strictly
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, they had Park's back in the clubhouse after the game.
That's no small thing. Just ask the Angels how hard it can be to
put up a united front. Until Randy Velarde lobbed his verbal
grenade in the Angels clubhouse, the Dodgers' room was the greater
minefield of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Not Saturday, anyway. Pitcher Kevin Brown was quick
to come to Park's defense when reporters crowded around the South
Korean and clamored for answers.
</P>
<P>
   In his second language, Park was asked the same question a dozen
different ways:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, Brown had heard enough. From his locker
across the room Brown's voice _ the steely staccato of a clubhouse
leader _ rang out:
</P>
<P>
   ``Just tell them what happened,'' he told Park. ``Tell them your
opinion and be done with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Park saw Brown less as the team's starting ace
than a reliever who had just gotten him off the hook. ``Thank you,
Kevin,'' Park said, with a nod in Brown's direction.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a $100-million man to see the Dodgers need to
hold Park's hand through the fire. When his confidence gets singed,
they all get burned. Last year he overcame an early crisis of
confidence to set career highs in wins, starts, strikeouts and
innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   This year Park has been able to control his fastball about as
well as his agent. Which is to say not very well at all. The
pitcher is in the final year of his contract and his agent made the
negotiations very public, which put less pressure on the Dodgers
front office than on Park himself.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how two years ago Raul Mondesi became the first Dodger
in franchise history to hit at least 30 home runs and steal 30
bases?
</P>
<P>
   Park is on pace for a double of his own. So far this season he
has surrendered four grand slams and incited two brawls. At this
rate, he'll easily establish a franchise-first in bases and benches
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get right,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. Those
words sounded less convincing than these: ``We need him.'' &QL;

HAROLD GRUMHAUS, EX-CHIEF OF CHICAGO'S TRIBUNE CO., DIES AT 96 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Fla.)   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold F. Grumhaus, a former executive of the Tribune Co. who
began his career as a loyal lieutenant of the legendary publisher
Robert R. McCormick and later helped dismantle some of his
conservative mentor's political and managerial legacy at the
company and its flagship newspaper, died May 29 at his home in
Naples, Fla. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Grumhaus, who joined the Tribune Co. as head of the insurance
department in 1934, moved seven years later to a job in the
production end of the business. Among his duties were labor
relations, which became a crucial area when trouble developed with
the International Typographical Union in 1947 and 1948.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent account in The Chicago Tribune, the
resulting strike forced early deadlines on the newsroom,
contributing to one of the best-known bloopers in newspaper
history. Instead of waiting for most of the election returns, the
editors decided to declare Thomas E. Dewey the winner of the 1948
presidential race in time for the strike-imposed deadlines. At a
subsequent victory rally, the real winner, Harry S Truman,
gleefully brandished the ``Dewey Defeats Truman'' early edition
headline.
</P>
<P>
   When McCormick, who was universally known as ``the Colonel,''
died in 1955, according to Clayton Kirkpatrick, The Tribune's
former editor, ``he left his possessions, including The Tribune _
he was very careful about it _ so that the people he considered his
trusted lieutenants would be in charge.'' One of those lieutenants
was Grumhaus, then the production manager.
</P>
<P>
   Grumhaus occupied a variety of executive positions in four
decades with the company. He became business manager in 1960, when
executives of the Tribune Co.'s two largest newspapers _ The
Chicago Tribune and The Daily News in New York, whose first
publisher was Joseph Medill Patterson, McCormick's cousin _ had
major roles in the company. In a reorganization led by Grumhaus,
Kirkpatrick said, Chicago Tribune executives gradually assumed most
authority over corporate strategy. (Today, The Daily News is
independently owned.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Grumhaus became general manager of The Tribune, and two
years later he became president of the Tribune Co.. In 1969, he was
appointed publisher of The Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkpatrick, who became the paper's editor shortly thereafter,
said Grumhaus backed him in making disputed decisions to split with
the McCormick legacy, such as removing political cartoons from the
front page.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Grumhaus was named chairman and chief executive of the
company. He resigned as publisher in 1973 and as chairman and chief
executive a year later. Three years later, he resigned as a
director. He later moved to Florida with his wife, Helen, who died
in 1984. He married Margaret Austin Rodgers of Naples, Fla., in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his second wife, Grumhaus is survived by a son,
David of Lake Forest, Ill.; a sister, Evelyn Parker of Clearwater,
Fla.; eight grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.

A GROWING CITY IS COUNTING ITS DECIBELS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Roberto Cabrera has a $3,000 stereo in his
1990 Toyota Corolla, including a separate 600-watt amplifier just
to make that big bass speaker boom.
</P>
<P>
   So Cabrera might want to start worrying about a new city policy
that rests on the following formula: SPL (EQ) 20 log P in db over
Po, where Po (EQ) 0.0002 microbars. On second thought, maybe
Cabrera doesn't have all that much to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Stamford, a small city that has become a magnet for corporate
headquarters, is escalating the fight against big-city noise.
Starting this month, the police have taken over the Health
Department's job of applying anti-noise laws to everything from the
garbage trucks that announce their presence at 4 a.m. to the clubs
that spill music and shouting into the street, to the young men
with the slammin' jams in their cars, like the ones Cabrera
installs at Elm Street Car Stereo and Security.
</P>
<P>
   But noise in Stamford and in a lot of other places is expressed
in more ways than the city's formula for measuring sound pressure
level (SPL) in decibels (db). Noise is a social and cultural issue,
to hear Stamford officials explain it with some delicacy, because
certain types of people make a lot of noise and other types call up
the mayor to complain.
</P>
<P>
   For years, these two types lived happily distant from each
other, but in the last 20 years, Stamford has not only grown by
more than 10,000 people, it has also attracted many former
suburbanites who moved to luxury condominiums and high-rise
apartments downtown. Now the exuberant sounds that one kind of
person makes run smack into the fury of another kind of person who
expects a little peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stamford has had a resurgence of high-rise apartments, and
more and more people are deciding they want to live downtown,''
said Stephen DeVito, the deputy chief of police. ``So now you don't
have the blue-collar or working-class people downtown anymore; you
have very upscale rentals and condominiums attracting a different
kind of person that has a different kind of expectation for the
government and their police.''
</P>
<P>
   People like, say, Agnes Fairchild, who was born in Stamford but
spent most of her life in the suburbs until she moved into a
retirement complex on Grove Street nine years ago. Her apartment
includes a little balcony overlooking the streets below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that it's summer, the motorcycles are out, and when they
zoom up the gas, it's enough to split your eardrums,'' she said.
``Then the cars with the loud radios come along with their windows
down, and it sounds like drums in the street at 11 o'clock at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching a loud car or motorcycle under the law is going to be
tough, DeVito said. The rules say that before a $99 ticket can be
written, the police must have sound measurements with and without
the offending noise, so most noisemakers on wheels get off with
only a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do with a moving vehicle,'' DeVito said. He
added: ``We can still pull them over and _ I don't want to use the
word pressure, but I guess pressure is the right word _ we say,
`Look, you're too loud.' Most people are very cooperative, but God
only knows what they do when they get around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   But the police figure that other noisemakers will be easier to
act against, including the garbage trucks and another phenomenon of
Stamford's extraordinary growth: night life.
</P>
<P>
   Before Stamford had high rises, it had blue laws that separated
bars by at least a quarter mile, ensuring that bars and their noisy
patrons would be scattered.
</P>
<P>
   The blue laws are long gone, and with the increase in downtown
residents, Stamford has developed a jumping night life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, when I started, there were three clubs
downtown,'' said Edward Barrero, the owner of Apple's Bar and Grill
on Atlantic Street. ``Now there are 17 bars and clubs right in this
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrero said he has been the subject of only one noise
complaint, for a radio blaring after hours. As for the police
cracking down, he said he was not too worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, Stamford has a little night life, which is
good for the city,'' he said. ``And with night life, you have to
expect a little noise.''

   Brain Storm
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Dooling. Picador USA, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of this clever, densely packed thriller is a St. Louis
lawyer who is assigned to defend a despicable criminal and becomes
involved with a brain researcher with an explanation for
everything. ``Here is a whodunit that achieves a comic fugue-state
mastery of the language of our sexually charged, violent,
technocratic society,'' Colin Harrison wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   To End a War
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Holbrooke. Modern Library, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   The American diplomat in charge of the 1995 Dayton peace
accords, which resulted in a halt in the fighting in Bosnia, tells
his story through anecdotes, withering strategic analysis and sharp
portraits of the wily Balkan leaders and timid NATO military
commanders involved in the talks. His ``engaging, witty and
dramatic account,'' which was selected by the editors of the Book
Review as one of the best books of 1998, is also ``an impassioned
plea for Washington to use the military might at its disposal to
intervene when societies break down,'' Chris Hedges wrote here last
year. In Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in
Bosnia, by Chuck Sudetic (Penguin, $14.95), a Croatian-American
journalist who covered the war for The New York Times follows
several generations of a Muslim family near Srebrenica, where
Bosnian Serbs massacred several thousand Muslims in 1995. Last year
our reviewer, Tom Gjelten, called this ``a narrative so rich and
strong it not only describes the crime but dares to explain it and
does so with eloquence and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Jones's Diary
</P>
<P>
   By Helen Fielding. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This comic novel follows a 30-something Brit who vows to lose
weight, control her drinking and basically get a grip on herself as
she struggles with demeaning dates and disastrous dinner parties.
``The book is a compilation of memorably silly moments in the life
of a hapless Everywoman,'' Elizabeth Gleick said here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Hacienda: A Memoir
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa St. Aubin de Teran. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The British author was 17 years old when she married an unstable
Venezuelan aristocrat and moved to his Andean estate. Out of her
nightmarish marriage came a 1982 novel, ``Keepers of the House,''
and this lyrical nonfiction account, which is also an affectionate
portrait of a lost world and its people. The result is ``a
transfixing performance,'' Michael Upchurch wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Place
</P>
<P>
   By Grace Metalious. Northeastern University, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   It may not seem as naughty today, but this lurid novel about a
New Hampshire town, with its deflowerings, suicides and other dark
goings-on, ruffled a lot of feathers when it was first published in
1956. ``Sinclair Lewis would no doubt have hailed Metalious as a
sister-in-arms against the ... bourgeois pretensions of allegedly
respectable communities,'' Carlos Baker wrote here.
</P>
<P>
   Tecumseh: A Life
</P>
<P>
   By John Sugden. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   The great Indian leader was a proud, charismatic warrior who
envisioned a pan-Indian alliance and helped defeat an American
invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. Last year our reviewer,
Barry Gewen, called this ``a richly detailed, utterly scrupulous
account that is as poignant as it is informative _ for Tecumseh
seems to have been doomed from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ibis Tapestry
</P>
<P>
   By Mike Nicol. Vintage International, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This novel's narrator is a South African writer who receives a
dead man's laptop computer and gets pulled into an underground
world of gunrunning. ```The Ibis Tapestry' plays skillfully with
truth and fiction to portray the landscape of a nation undergoing
revolutionary change,'' Erik Burns wrote here last year. Home
Ground, by Lynn Freed (Story Line, $14), focuses on a theater
family whose internal dramas provide a metaphor for apartheid-era
politics. ``What is extraordinary about this book is its
perspective,'' Janette Turner Hospital wrote here in 1986.
``Freed's guileless child-narrator takes us inside the neurosis''
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Last Voyage of the Karluk:
</P>
<P>
   A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster
</P>
<P>
   By William Laird McKinlay. St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author was a meteorologist with a 1913 expedition to chart
the Arctic region that resulted in disaster: the ship sank early
on, and the few survivors were stranded on a barren island for six
months. In 1977 our reviewer, Alix Nelson, called this a tale
``written with a grace, modesty and power that are the measure of
the man.'' Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea, by Gary Kinder
(Vintage, $14), chronicles the sinking of a gold-laden paddle
steamer in a hurricane off the Carolina coast in 1857 and the
effort in the 1980's to recover its treasure. ``The author writes
beautifully _ historical and technological reporting of a high
order, as suspenseful and deft about the doomed steamer as the
salvage vessels,'' John Maxtone-Graham wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   A World Away
</P>
<P>
   By Stewart O'Nan. Owl/Holt, $13.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island circa 1943, a troubled family plays out its
summer of discontent, complete with adultery and an unraveling
marriage. Last year our reviewer, Timothy Foote, admired the
novel's ``intricately overlapping streams of consciousness that
rove back and forth, creating past and present with fleeting hints
about the characters' lives.''

WHEN WORDS DON'T FIT THE EMOTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ What can you say at a moment like this?
</P>
<P>
   That's always been horse racing's quandry, from Ruffian to Go
for Wand to Prairie Bayou, from one televised tragedy to the next.
</P>
<P>
   What can you say when a popular racehorse is hauled off the
track in a van and the public wants to know why?
</P>
<P>
   The sport still hasn't quite figured that one out, nearly a
quarter century after Ruffian's ghastly breakdown in the 1975
``Battle of the Sexes'' match race with Foolish Pleasure mortified
a nation.
</P>
<P>
   That was proven again late Saturday afternoon, even as
veterinarians worked over Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner
Charismatic in a Belmont Park barn, even as the colt's 17-race
career was declared as over as his Triple Crown bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day!'' enthused Laddie Dance, husband of
Belmont Stakes winner Lemon Drop Kid's owner Jeanne Vance, in the
winner's circle _ because nobody had told him about the serious
injury to Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   And so began the whole sad circus of people tripping over their
tongues.
</P>
<P>
   We heard a TV interviewer trying not to gather information but
to comfort jockey Chris Antley.
</P>
<P>
   We heard Antley's voice quaver as he prematurely eulogized
Charismatic: ``He's given America a lot...''
</P>
<P>
   We heard the president of Visa, which sponsors the $5 million
Triple Crown, claiming to feel no qualm about the corporation's
association with racing on such a bitter day: ``You hate to see
that,'' Carl Pascarella said of the breakdown. ``(But) it's
something you have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   We heard trainer D. Wayne Lukas using the same cold language to
describe his reaction: ``It's racing, these things happen, and we
have to deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, as reporters scrambled for details of the trauma to
the bones surrounding Charismatic's left front ankle, we heard
veterinarians offer conflicting reports of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   To Dr. Larry Bramlage, the Lexington, Ky., veterinarian who
served as spokesman for the American Association of Equine
Practitioners, it was a clean fracture of the shin bone and a crack
of the smaller sesamoid bones, the former requiring ``urgent'' not
``emergency'' surgery and the latter likely to heal itself.
</P>
<P>
   To Dr. Stephen Selway, of the Belmont Equine Surgical Clinic,
both sets of bones were ``shattered,'' a considerably more
frightening image.
</P>
<P>
   Both men indicated Charismatic's 17-race career was over.
</P>
<P>
   But to Dr. Jim Hunt, identified vaguely in a track hand-out as
``veterinarian,'' the healing of the sesamoids ``will determine
whether or not he comes back to race.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of voices, a lot of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the racing industry has been trying to correct this
problem, believing the best public-relations policy in these
situations is full and clear disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Bramlage serves in the job of ``on-call physician'' for the AAEP
_ a fancy way of saying he's in charge of telling the writers and
broadcasters what the heck happened.
</P>
<P>
   The role was created in the wake of the jarring incidents
involving Go for Wand (broke down in the 1990 Breeders' Cup
Distaff, and destroyed), Mr Brooks (fell in the 1992 Breeders' Cup
sprint, and destroyed), Union City (broke down in the 1993
Preakness, and destroyed), and Prairie Bayou (broke down in the
1993 Belmont, and destroyed).
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have a sort of love of horse racing,'' Bramlage said.
``It's very important... to get you the information as quickly and
accurately as we can so the first news story has got the right
stuff in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice try.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is somewhere in here: Charismatic is seriously hurt
but lucky it wasn't worse. He's in discomfort but not agony. His
life is not in danger. He'll have surgery today and more will be
known then about the possibility of complications.
</P>
<P>
   And in here: A sport that believes it's on the way back up might
be facing another crisis of public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   What can you say then?
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved what he was doing out there (Saturday),'' Bramlage
said of Charismatic when the veterinarian was asked what he'd say
to people who think racing is cruel. ``He wanted to run on. I think
if you just look at those animals running and how they thrive on
that sort of athletic competition, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to know further, come visit us in Lexington. They
race among themselves in a field. All the colts will be out and
they're seeing who's the fastest. Horses are physiologically and
psychologically !ital!running!off! animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Well said by a man who loves horses, loves racing and finds no
contradiction in those emotions.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple at a moment like this. &QL;

JONES QUIET AS HE MULLS IRVIN'S FATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jerry Jones is gladly dodging minicams and headlines. ...
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry willingly eats dust while the Stars steal both the
media show and hearts. ...
</P>
<P>
   When this is happening, then obviously bad times, bad P.R. and
still-to-come hard decisions have descended upon the Valley Ranch
bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a wide range of emotional moments for the Cowboys. It
has been a spring and early summer of reaching the lowest of lows
with the stupid death of Mark Tuinei, followed by the continuing
stupidity of Leon Lett, followed by the ongoing comedy of Nine-Toed
Deion.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, keep praying to the football gods that Deion
Baybee can make it back in time for another Pro Bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a fraudulent subject, however, this morning's sermon
will center on what has become the most intriguing football debate
of the Cowboys' off-season.
</P>
<P>
   What to do about Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's feelings have been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Do you care? No. Do I care? No. Should Jerry care? Yes. And
here's why:
</P>
<P>
   The word got out last week from Irvin's agent _ and Steve
Endicott is a good one _ that Michael was pouting. Since then,
there has been double talk about whether Irvin wanted to be traded,
requested to be traded, would accept a trade, etc.
</P>
<P>
   None of that matters.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin is 33 years old, is coming off an awful season, and will
count $3.2 million against somebody's 1999 salary cap. Nobody wants
Michael Irvin. Except maybe the Cowboys, and that's questionable.
Jones did attempt to trade Irvin before the April draft.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, this story has received about as much play as what
Jones will eventually do with Nine-Toed. Typical of the national
response was this opinion in a Denver newspaper last week:
</P>
<P>
   ``So, the cocaine Cowboy, Michael Irvin, wants to be traded
because he doesn't get the ball enough in Chan Gailey's offense.
Yadda ... yadda ... yadda. Be like the other Mike \RJordan\S, kids,
not this loser.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Irvin set himself up for that kind of rip job, and
unfortunately, his off-the field past has become his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But what's going on at the moment is not about any Gailey
offense. Instead, it centers squarely on what Jones views as
Michael being ``fair,'' and what Michael views as Jones being
``fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of them have a good argument.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the Irvin side:
</P>
<P>
   The dynasty days of the '90s made Jones what he has become _ the
most powerful owner in the NFL. That dynasty happened for a lot of
reasons, but there can be no argument the three central players in
the success were Irvin, Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   This trifecta became the backbone of a team NFL historians will
always rank among the league's greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Jones has repeatedly rewarded Aikman with financial
riches, even when his performance no longer deserved it. The same
goes for Emmitt. In fact, it goes double for Emmitt. Jones did not
forget what they meant to him personally when it came time to reach
into his hip pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Like Smith two years ago, Irvin appears to be fading as a
player, plus his contract has only a year remaining. But if Jones
did it then for Emmitt, why not ``reward'' Michael, the undisputed
emotional leader of the Cowboys' glory days? And while we're at it,
only Aikman and a few others ever equaled Irvin in hardball
intensity combined with adherence to the total team concept.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry, you owe him plenty.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the Jones view:
</P>
<P>
   With his off-the-field escapades and his high-profile
personality, Irvin eclipsed even Lawrence Taylor in causing
irreversible damage to an NFL franchise.
</P>
<P>
   If Irvin dare uttered ``do you know who I am?'' to Jones, Jerry
could give him about two hours worth of heated reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, it has been an ongoing process of Irvin creating
trouble, trouble, trouble for the Cowboys, and for Jones. And
remember, the last incident was only last summer, with the
neck-slashing in Wichita Falls. Even the reputation of new coach
Gailey was stained a bit in the coverup that followed.
</P>
<P>
   But through it all, going back to that Irving hotel room, Jones
has stood by Irvin. To a fault, Jerry protected him, coddled him,
covered for him, probably even lied for him _ anything it took,
Jerry was there for Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's best friend in the world has been Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Based on everything, should Irvin now be volunteering to play
for free? Not a bad idea, frankly.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, you owe him plenty.
</P>
<P>
   So see there _ what Jerry does with Michael, and what Michael
does with Jerry, is as intriguing a question as I've seen lately in
the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder there's the perception Jones has suddenly become
media-shy. Actually, he's just got some deep thinking to do.

PACE FAVORABLE TO LEMON DROP KID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Lemon Drop Kid, the grandson of Seattle Slew, who
won the 131st Belmont Stakes, took advantage of the fast pace set
by the filly Silverbulletday and pressed by favored Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-1 winner mounted an eighth-to-first rally on the outside
to beat Vision and Verse by a head as Charismatic faded to third,
breaking down at the wire, and Silverbulletday was virtually eased
to seventh in the 12-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a killer pace, but you just hate to go eyeball to
eyeball early in the race,'' said Jerry Bailey, who let up on
Silverbulletday in the stretch. ``She was beat and I didn't want to
kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-mile fractions _ 23 3/5 seconds, 47 4/5, 1:12, 1:36
2/5 and 2:01 4/5 _ and the 2:27 4/5 final time for 1 { miles were
among the fastest in recent Belmonts. So it was puzzling that
jockey Chris Antley let Charismatic race so close to the pace,
having rallied from seventh in the Kentucky Derby and 10th in the
Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said it appeared Antley had trouble restraining
Charismatic. It's also possible Antley was afraid to let
Silverbulletday set an uncontested pace.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid trainer Scotty Schulhofer said he was surprised
Charismatic was near the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was happy when I saw (that),'' Schulhofer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont victory was the second for Schulhofer, whose
Colonial Affair won in 1993, and the first for jockey Jose Santos
and owners Jeanne Vance and her lyrically named husband Laddie
Dance. The owners, who live in Maryland and Florida, are racing
veterans who once owned a breeding share in Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see that (Belmont in 1973) because I was crying so
hard,'' Dance said. ``I cried harder after this one.''
</P>
<P>
   His reaction was not to Charismatic's injury but to his horse's
unexpected victory. Lemon Drop Kid ran ninth in the Kentucky Derby
and third in the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``His Peter Pan set him up nicely for this,'' Santos said. ``You
always need a good trip and he got that today. The filly and the
others set a pretty quick (pace) for him to make a run at.''
</P>
<P>
   At the turnstiles: The Belmont Park crowd of 85,818 set a track
record, exceeding the 82,694 who watched Canonero II fail to
complete a Triple Crown in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The undercard: D. Wayne Lukas had two Belmont Park winners in
the bag before the big race, including Yes It's True, who captured
the Riva Ridge sprint for 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The other major winner: Yagli in the Manhattan Handicap on turf,
giving Bailey one of his four winners.
</P>
<P>
   Over there: Oath won the English Derby at Epsom Downs on
Saturday as Beat All and transplanted California rider Gary Stevens
finished an unthreatening third in the $1.7 million race.
</P>
<P>
   Oath is trained by Henry Cecil, uncle of California trainer Ben
Cecil, and owned by The Thoroughbred Corp., which had Patience Game
in the Belmont.
