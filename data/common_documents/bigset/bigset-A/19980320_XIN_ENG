<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Moves Up to New High in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The impact of the Asian
economic crisis cut into the U.S. economy in January, pushing the
U.S. trade deficit up to an all-time high of 12 billion U.S.
dollars, the Commerce Department said Thursday in a report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. overall deficit in goods and services picked up 10.5
percent from a revised December figure of 10.9 billion dollars,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The January deficit was the worst showing since the final
quarter of 1987, when the deficit in goods and services averaged
more than 12 billion dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
In goods alone, the 18.8 billion dollar deficit was an all-time
high, surpassing an 18.17 billion dollar imbalance in January
1997. However, this goods deficit was offset somewhat by a 6.75
billion dollar surplus in services.
</P>
<P>
The monthly deficit reflected a 2.6 percent drop in U.S.
exports of goods and services, which dipped to 77.28 billion
dollars, reflecting a big 1.8 billion drop in sales of U.S.
aircraft abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports were down one percent to 89.33 billion
dollars in January, in part reflecting a lower foreign oil
bill. Energy imports dropped 13 percent to 4.81 billion dollars
with the price per barrel of crude oil dipping to 14.42 dollars,
compared to 16.21 dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
For January, the U.S. deficit with South Korea rose to 856
million dollars, more than double the December level. The deficits
with Indonesia and Thailand, two other countries hard hit by the
crisis, were also up in January.
</P>
<P>
For the newly industrialized countries and regions of Asia,
including South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, the
U.S. deficit rose to 2.2 billion dollars, the biggest imbalance
since a 2.4 billion dollars deficit in July 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with Japan actually shrank in January by 14.7
percent to 4.38 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit for all of 1997 rose to 113.7 billion
dollars, the worst showing in nine years. If the trade imbalance
kept the monthly growth pace of 12 billion dollars for all of
1998, the deficit this year would shoot up to a record 144 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Brokerages Cut Work Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Layoffs caused by the deepening
financial crisis have forced South Korean securities firms to lay
off some 2,100 employees this year, the Korean Securities
Association said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of February, the country's 36 securities companies
dismissed 2,145 out of 25,087 registered in January.
</P>
<P>
It said there was also a 10.6 percent reduction in personnel,
or 2,981 persons, from among the 28,068 employees registered in
October 1997, before the financial crisis. The crisis was triggered
by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Ranks-and-filers account for the bulk of the reduction with
1,352, while managers just below board directors numbered 84.
</P>
<P>
The association attributed the dismissal to the implementation
of items in the agreement signed between South Korea and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) last December in order to
qualify for a bailout loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world, has
been in a financial crisis since late 1997, which saw the nation's
per capita income fall to 9,400 dollars from the previous year's
10,548 dollars.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's economic situation is estimated to be
deteriorating this year as the country, under the agreement signed
with the IMF, has to completely restructure its economy, close
ailing financial institutions, open its markets and lay off
thousands of workers.

potential for further economic cooperation with Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, she told

development.''
</P>
<P>
She noted that Zimbabwe was going through a transition phase,
and emerging as a market with potential for further economic
cooperation and trade.
</P>

''I see that as an opportunity for further growth, since I am
convinced that the Netherlands and Zimbabwean business
communities have a lot to offer to each other,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> London Prison Officers Stage Walkout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 prison officers at
Wormwood Scrubs in west London staged a 45-minute walkout Thursday
in protest against "a lack of support from local management."
</P>
<P>
The protest was sparked off by an official inquiry into
allegations that inmates there had been systematically abused.
</P>
<P>
Senior official at the Prison Officer's Association Mark
Freeman said they were concerned that innocent officers were being
put under suspicion by the brutality claims inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The officers returned to work after prison governor Mike Gordon
promised their concerns would be addressed, Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said claims of maltreatment of
prisoners were "very disturbing."
</P>
<P>
The official Prison Service inquiry began Thursday into
allegations of brutality and racial abuse at Wormwood Scrubs, a
jail holding up to 1,370 prisoners who are awaiting trial,
sentencing or assignment to another prison.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry was ordered after lawyers for 11 of the prisoners
produced a lengthy dossier alleging brutal beatings and racial
abuse. One inmate said he had been beaten every day for a month,
and more than 20 officers were accused of brutality.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Inflation Slightly Up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Consumer inflation in the
U.S. moved up by a tiny 0.1 percent in February thanks to dropping
energy prices, the Labor Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The small growth in February in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
followed no change in January, the first month in four years
without an increase, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Thus, inflation has virtually disappeared so far this year
after sinking to 1.7 percent in 1997, the lowest rate since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices plunged 2.2 percent in February in the wake of
January's 2.4 percent decline, the steepest in seven years. The
price of gasoline dropped 3.4 percent at the pump last month and
has fallen 10.8 percent in the past five months. That sent the
price 21.3 percent lower than its November 1990 peak during the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Fuel oil, natural gas and electricity prices all fell sharply
in the month.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe the energy price decline is due to a
number of reasons which include reduced demand from financially
troubled Asian countries, unusually mild weather associated with
El Nino and the OPEC nations' decision to maintain production.
</P>
<P>
In February, food prices also were lower. Fresh vegetable
prices tumbled 7.2 percent, the most in four and a half
years. They were recovering from a 7.9 percent increase in January
when El Nino's rains drowned crops in California.
</P>
<P>
However, price increases outside of the volatile food and
energy components have accelerated a bit this year. They rose 0.3
percent in February, the most in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
For the year so far, they're moving at a 2.8 percent annual
rate, compared with a 32-year low of 2.2 percent for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
During February, airline fares went up 3.2 percent, and
tobacco, up 2.9 percent from January and 10 percent from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The prices for personal computer equipment fell 5.8
percent last month on top of a 3.1 percent decline in January.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report by the labor department, the country's
first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose by 9,000 to
308,000 last week.

<HEADLINE> More Tobacco Export Earnings Expected in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's export earnings from
this year's tobacco crop will exceed last year's mark of seven
billion Zimbabwean Dollars (about 400 million U.S. Dollars), a
cabinet minister said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This will be gained despite fears that world prices might fall
due to the collapse of currencies in Asia and litigations against
cigarette manufacturers in the United States, Lands and
Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said.
</P>
<P>
He said ''market reports'' indicated that demand for tobacco
would increase by between 1.5 and 2 percent due to reduced
production of the crop in other major growing areas.
</P>
<P>
Kangai was speaking at a press conference to mark the start of
this year's tobacco selling season which opens on March 31, the
Zimbabwean News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
However, there were fears that world tobacco prices could fall
by between 5 and 10 percent due to the Asian currency crisis and
the litigations in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
But Kangai was optimistic that the country would surpass last
year's earnings from an estimated crop size of 220 million
kilograms of flue-cured tobacco and seven million kilograms of
burley tobacco.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Exports, Imports Drop in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Both exports and imports fell in
Canada in January, Statistics Canada reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Exports fell by more than 1 billion dollars (700 million U.S.
dollars) or 4.3 percent in January, wiping out gains achieved in
December.
</P>
<P>
"While every sector lost ground, a sharp decline in automobile
and energy exports was the leading factor in the overall slump,"
the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Imports also fell, off 3.6 percent or 909 million dollars in
the month.
</P>
<P>
"Every sector contributed to the decrease, but the main
culprits were energy products, automotive products and machinery
and equipment," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In January, the country's trade balance was 1.7 billion
dollars, down 241 million dollars from December 1997, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the ice storm in Quebec and eastern
Ontario had a minimal impact on merchandise trade.
</P>
<P>
Production slowdowns in the United States and temporary
closures of some assembly lines contributed to Canada's auto parts
exports decline in January.
</P>
<P>
A decease in coal exports to Japan was responsible for much of
the slow energy exports, which tumbled by 10.7 percent in the
month, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
On the import front, energy product imports dropped 19.8
percent in January to normal seasonal levels following December's
sharp gain.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, imports of trucks and other motor vehicles
declined for the third consecutive month as a result of reduced
demand by Canadian consumers.

OTTAWA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Canda's telecommunications giant
Northern Telecom Ltd. (Nortel) has agreed to buy a startup U.S.
Internet equipment maker for 290 million U.S. dollars, said
reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts-based Aptis Communications Inc. has no
revenue but could push Nortel ahead in the race down the
information highway, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"This deal is a home run," said Glenn Falcao, Nortel's general
manager of public data networks.
</P>
<P>
"If we had waited until the company had revenue, I couldn't
have afforded it," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move pushes Nortel ahead of such competitors as Lucent
Technologies Inc., which have alliances with access equipment
makers that focused on seeling to companies.
</P>
<P>
The purchase is the second major acquisition in the past four
and half months for Nortel's data networks division. In November,
it bought Broadband Networks Inc. for 586 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nortel has been looking for ways to improve its portfolio of
products that move data on to the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Free of Polio: WHO Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa has been declared
a polio free zone following successful immunization programs
which have seen not a single polio case reported in the region in
the past four years, a WHO official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Malick Samba, Regional Director of World Health
Organization (WHO) for Africa, said the region benefited greatly
from WHO immunization programs under which 55 million children
below the age of five years were immunized in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the success of the programs to the stability
prevailing in the region which made the movement of drugs easier.
</P>
<P>
However the WHO official said the disease is yet to be
eradicated in central and western Africa due to civil strife and
lack of good infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"This limits access to health facilities as many people are
displaced as a result of the civil wars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the disturbances in the two regions, he expressed hope
that the disease could be eradicated by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He added African countries could help curb the incidence of
infectious diseases by investing more into the vaccination of
children.

<HEADLINE> Friend Says Willey Asked Her to Lie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A friend of Kathleen Willey
said Willey asked her to lie to a reporter about U.S. President
Bill Clinton's alleged sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Julie Hiatt Steele has released an affidavit saying Willey
never told her Clinton had made unwanted sexual advances in 1993
when Willey visited the White House, but called her in 1997 to ask
her to tell Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff she had done so.
</P>
<P>
Steele said Willey told her to say that she had been "upset,"
"humiliated," "disappointed" and "harassed" after the November 29,
1993 meeting with the president in the Oval Office. Willey had
gone to the White House to ask Clinton for a paid position in his
administration, because she and her husband were facing financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Steele said she agreed to help Willey, whom she had known for
two decades, even though she said Willey never told her any of
those accusations earlier.
</P>
<P>
Steele's lawyer released the sworn statement Wednesday night,

two countries and the general situation in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Tsohatzopoulos said that the two

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Mission
in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) and the International Police
Task Force (IPTF) are making progress in their work, according to
a new report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the first phase of
police restructuring is finally nearing completion and the police
in eight out of the 10 cantons have been inaugurated. However,
restructuring in the other two Croat-dominated cantons is being
held up by issues of a purely political nature," the U.N. chief
said.
</P>
<P>
Reporting that in Croat-majority areas, there are blocks to
implementing recent election results and refugee returns, he said
that efforts are being made to "make it clear to Croat authorities
that political obstacles to the implementation of election
results, refugee return and police reform cannot be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the UNMIBH plans to set up three
special police units to deal with public security management,
organized crime and drug control. In order to staff these units,
the secretary-general recommended increasing the IPTF's total
staff by 30 posts, to 2,057.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also called for an increase of 26 additional
UNMIBH professionals to facilitate judicial reform in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Okeys Land-mine Ban Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean parliament
Thursday ratified the convention prohibiting the production, use,
stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines, the Zimbabwe
News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the convention as he moved for its adoption,
Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said its aim was to prohibit the
manufacture, stockpiling, use, sale and transfer of all
anti-personnel land mines which any country might possess.
</P>
<P>
"Signatories to this convention undertake to renounce,
prohibit the use of and destroy all anti-personnel mines," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The parties further undertake to cooperate and assist each
other in the implementation of the provisions of this
convention," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the convention would positively impact on
Africa's social advancement and economic development since it
sought to rid the continent of anti-personnel mines which were a
menace to human beings and animals.
</P>
<P>
He said in Africa a lot of potentially productive land was not
utilized because it was heavily infested with anti-personnel
mines.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi assured the house that the provisions of the
convention would not prejudice the security of this nation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, he said, stood to gain from this convention in that
financial donor assistance for de-mining projects could be
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe, as current chairman of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), had already endorsed willingness to actively
participate in the Ottawa Process concerning the land mines.

<HEADLINE> Peace, Harmony Essential for Economic Cooperation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz stressed here Thursday the necessity of peace and
harmony to promote economic cooperation in the south Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot ignore the political realties. If political
relations do not move forward, economic relations cannot move
forward," Aziz said while speaking at the concluding session of
the 2nd Economic Cooperation Conference of the South Asian
Association for Regional Conference (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
Aziz emphasized that if political relations move forward,
economic relations can move ahead at much faster pace.
</P>
<P>
The success of regional cooperation have led to the need of
intensifying the cooperation among the south Asian nations, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of SAARC, Aziz said, reflected the desire of
the people of this region to collaborate their efforts in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, however, pointed out that the progress is still low.
</P>
<P>
The minister was happy to note that the efforts at
intra-governmental level are being supported and supplemented by
the business community through the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC member states were passing through a crucial age of
economic and social development, said Aziz, adding that "most of
us have relegated the polices of controls and regulations of the
past in favor of deregulations, liberalizations and
privatization."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, President of the SAARC Chamber of
Commerce and Industry Kantikumar Podar expressed his concern over
low volume of regional trade which consisted only three percent of
the global trade.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized facilitation of communication linkages to meet
the requirement of expanding trade and commerce between the SAARC
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The flow of goods and services in SAARC is currently
constrained by a tremendous lack of infrastructure and
communication linkages between our countries," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Podar said that currently SAARC states had extremely limited
border posts for rail and road movement. Shipping and air links
are also inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The two-day second SAARC Economic Cooperation Conference began
here Wednesday. The Conference, which was organized by the SAARC
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, attracted more than 100
delegates from the seven SAARC states.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the delegates held working sessions and
seminars on matters concerning strengthening regional trade,
protection and promotion of investment and developing tourism.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of its kind was held in India in November,
1996.

<HEADLINE> Angola Starts Collecting Weapons From Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan national police is to
launch a national education campaign to mobilize the citizens to
hand in weapons in their possession to the government starting
from Thursday or today.
</P>
<P>
Fernando da Piedade, Commander of the National Police Force,
said at a press conference that the weapon confiscation move is
to be finished by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Those who refuse to hand over their weapons should be forced
to do so by the end of the month, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Over 8,000 weapons have been collected by now, and 2,405 of
them were collected in Luanda Province, which helped strengthen
the security of the capital, Piedade said.
</P>
<P>
The 8,605 weapons confiscated include cannons, machine-guns,
anti-tank rockets and land mines, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the bodyguard squad of Jonas Savimbi, leader
of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), Piedade said, the 400 bodyguards would have uniforms and
equipment different from the national police, and that they are
only supposed to guard Savimbi's security, not to be involved in
keeping public order, nor to check civil vehicles on roads.
</P>
<P>
As the security in the capital has been guaranteed, UNITA
leaders could not have any danger there, he said, adding that
UNITA elements who have arrived in the capital have not come
across any danger, neither would its leaders.
</P>
<P>
The collection of weapons from citizens is one of the major
tasks in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the nearly two decades of civil war, many weapons have
flowed into the hands of common citizens. It is said that most of
the Angolan families have weapons in their houses.

<P>
HARARE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 academics from
Africa are in Harare to attend a one-day symposium organized by
the African Association of Universities (AAU) which will discuss
selected issues on higher education in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The AAU was formed in 1967 after it was realized that African
universities were facing serious financial problems which impeded
educational progress.
</P>
<P>
Membership of the the AAU is currently at 140 out of 180
universities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Their aim is to revolutionize the universities management and
financial practices to make the most of their limited resources
in order to curb the social effects which has on the tertiary
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Participants will be discussing issues which include
communication culture within a Nigerian University, gender
differences toward the study of mathematics at university level
and alternative strategies for the determination of unit costs
and guidelines for a performance audit.
</P>
<P>
Opening the symposium, Zimbabwean Higher Education and
Technology Minister Ignatius Chombo said higher education
colleges were faced with stark choices.
</P>
<P>
"They have to sustain the current levels of funding tertiary
institutions which are not matched by immediate returns in
economic terms," Chombo said.
</P>
<P>
"Over the years the AAU has provided collective leadership in
the promotion of African higher education, the appreciation of
the challenges that higher education faces and the quest for
solutions," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Reported Summit with Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday denied that there have been
arrangements for an Israeli-Palestinian summit in Europe next
week.
</P>
<P>
After his talks here with visiting Austrian Chancellor Viktor
Klima, Netanyahu told a joint news conference that he has not
received invitation from the United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to meet her or Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Albright was trying to arrange a
meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat in a bid to revive the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been stalled since
March, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told reporters that what is more important in
advancing the peace process is not "mechanism" but "substance".
</P>
<P>
"The substance is that Oslo (Accord) was from start a deal of
land for security ... but what we found in last four years was
that increasingly Oslo became a deal of 'land for nothing'," he
complained.
</P>
<P>
Israel has conditioned its next withdrawal from the West Bank
on the fulfillment of Palestinian commitments to curb terror
groups in the territories. The PNA, on the other hand, accused
Netanyahu of trying to retreat from signed agreements and evade
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Klima, who is here ahead of Austria's assumption of the
rotating presidency of the European Union (EU), said that Austria
recognizes Israel's rights to "live within the safe borders" as
much as it recognizes the Palestinian rights for self
determination.
</P>
<P>
He added that the EU's economic assistance to the Palestinians
is also beneficial to Israel, noting that improvement of the
Palestinians' living conditions would strengthen the stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian chancellor received warm welcome from Netanyahu,
two days after Israel turned cold shoulders to British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, who had insisted on visiting the
controversial Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem despite Israeli
anger.
</P>
<P>
Cook said his visit there was intended to send a message that
the EU is concerned about the Jewish settlement expansion in the
occupied territories, a move bitterly opposed by the Palestinians
and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Cook's stance was seen as an attempt to apply an "even-handed"
approach toward Israel and the Arabs in settling conflicts in the
region. The U.S. and its western allies have come under attack for
their double standards.
</P>
<P>
Britain currently exercises the EU presidency. Netanyahu said
Israel is ready to work with the EU during the next presidency,
which will be taken over by Austria in July.

CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid left here for Paris Thursday to attend a
meeting of the Francophone countries to seek closer cooperation
with them, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Abdul-Meguid said he will confer with
French President Jacques Chirac and French officials on the
Mideast peace march, the U.N.-Iraq agreement, the Comoros Islands
crisis and the latest developments in Somalia.

They will also delve into the Lockerbie crisis within the

The U.S. and Britain had demanded Libya extradite two suspects

killed 270 people. The ICJ, however, ruled earlier this month that
it had jurisdiction to decide on where the two suspects will stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid was invited by former U.N. Secretary General

MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- An agreement on joint
implementation of several oil and gas projects in Iran has been
reached between Russia's gas giant Gazprom, the Zarubezhneft
foreign trade firm and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC),

<P>
NEW YORK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- New York's Board of Education
has unanimously approved a decision to outfit 560,000 elementary
students in this largest U.S. school system in uniform, board
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The voting took place Wednesday night, the officials told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which will become effective in fall 1998, "will
allow students to focus on their studies and not worry about an
incident based on their clothing," board member Ninfa Segarra
said.
</P>
<P>
The uniforms, which will cost 100-120 U.S. dollars, will be
designed with the help of students and parents.
</P>
<P>
Financial aid will be available to families needing help, the
board said in its decision.
</P>
<P>
The provision affects all pupils from the kindergarten to the
fifth grade in the elementary school.
</P>
<P>
The Unified School District in Long Beach of California became
the first public school system of the United States to require
school uniforms for its 63,000 elementary and middle school
students in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Investigations showed that success was immediate in the
district with suspensions falling dramatically and fights being
slashed in half.

<HEADLINE> Blair Criticized Over Formula One Outing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
was criticized Thursday for failing to register a free trip to the
British Formula One Grand Prix in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee,
responding to a complaint from a Conservative MP, ruled that Blair
should have registered the outing to the Silverstone circuit in
July 1996 in the register of members' interests.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the prime minister accepts the decision," Blair's
spokesman told reporters. "We accept that the visit should have
been registered."
</P>
<P>
Blair, being a leader of the opposition party, went to the
Grand Prix with his wife and children at the invitation of
Federation International de l'Automobile (FIA) President Max
Mosley. But he left after the start of the race and did not
declare the hospitality -- which would have cost him 300 pounds a
head had he paid for it.
</P>
<P>
The committee said it backed the view of parliament's standards
watchdog Sir Gordon Downey, who investigated the complaint against
Blair, that the visit should have been registered.
</P>
<P>
A committee report said the trip would be included in the next
register.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Global Tuberculosis Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) warned of a "global threat of tuberculosis" Thursday, urging
the world community to make more efforts to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we face a real global threat," Dr Carlyle Guerra de
Macedo, chairman of the WHO committee on TB, told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts, meeting in London this week to discuss the TB
crisis, said that as progress in TB control stalled in countries
worst affected by the epidemic, the WHO would not achieve its
target of controlling the disease by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
After examining in detail the progress of 22 high incidence
countries towards meeting the WHO global targets for TB control,
experts found that a lack of progress in 16 key countries is
hampering attempts to prevent a TB catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
The 22 countries being reviewed account for 80 percent of the
global TB burden and are targeted to cure 85 percent of new
infectious cases and detect 70 percent of these cases by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned that if control of the disease is not
strengthened soon, by the year 2020, nearly 1 billion more people
will be newly infected, among them 70 million will die from the
illness.
</P>
<P>
Latest studies show that the number of people infected with TB
worldwide has reached its highest level in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the WHO, each year 100 million people
become infected with TB, of whom 10 million get sick and 3 million
die.
</P>
<P>
TB is responsible for one in seven adult deaths, killing more
people than malaria and AIDS combined.
</P>
<P>
The recent emergence of multi-resistant TB in both the
developed and developing world and the rising incident of HIV, of
which TB is an accompanying symptom, pose a serious threat in the
absence of concerted worldwide action, experts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia started on Thursday
the national surveys on health and nutrition as well as economic
and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the central statistics authority of
Ethiopia at a press conference here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy general manager of the authority Samia Zekeria said the
survey will be undertaken in selected districts, resident
councils and peasant associations in all national regions.
</P>
<P>
She said close to 1,400 data collectors and 300 supervisors
have already been deployed to the regions to undertake the
surveys expected to be finalized in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
With regards to the health and nutrition survey, Samia said
the survey will assist pertinent policy makers to closely inspect
the implementation of programs drawn with a view to improving the
nutrition and health conditions of the general public.
</P>
<P>
She said it also helps identify the health and nutrition
problems the public face in addition to helping assess the impact
of projects previously carried out in the areas.
</P>
<P>
She said the survey on economic and social welfare focuses,
among other things, on the education, health, and income status
of the public at large and the availability of development
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has the third largest population in Africa except
Nigeria and Egypt. The growth rate of gross domestic product on
the average during the 1992-1996 reached about 6 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Ministry of
Water Resources issued a statement on Thursday calling for a
sustainable use of water resource.
</P>
<P>
In the statement issued to mark the World Water Day to be
observed on Sunday, March 22, the ministry said that the water
resource should be utilized economically as it is a scarce
natural resource.
</P>
<P>
This year's World Water Day will be observed internationally
under the theme of "Ground Water -- the Invisible Resource".
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the day is a good opportunity to
consider the volume, distribution and utilization of subterranean
water in the country and make the public aware of such issues.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that it is necessary to develop research
capacity, quality drilling technology and pertinent institutions
with an eye to utilize the ground water resource adequately and
sustainably in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics available, 97.5 percent of the world
water is saline while the remaining 2.5 percent is found in the
form of ice and underground water and only 0.3 percent of the
world water is potable.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of the world population now have no access to
clean water. And every year various water borne diseases kill
about 25 million people, most of whom are in the developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> NASD, Amex Reach Agreement on Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Association of
Securities Dealers (NASD) and the American Stock Exchange (Amex)
have reached an agreement to a merger that would join the nation's
second-largest and third-largest U.S. securities markets, board
members of the two securities markets confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deal promises to revive the Amex with 100 million U.S.
dollars in new technology and allows the NASD to offer an
alternative system to the Nasdaq Stock Market, the No.2 market.
The NASD also gains a solid foothold in options trading.
</P>
<P>
"The combined organization will create a market of markets,"
NASD Chairman Frank Zarb told reporters Wednesday. "This is a
major plus for the investor."
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the agreement, the two markets will share a
common technology but will remain separate entities under the NASD
umbrella. The Amex will become a subsidiary of a newly created
NASD Market Holding Co., home to both the Nasdaq Stock Market and
the Amex.
</P>
<P>
Zarb said that he would continue as the chairman of the NASD,
while Richard Syron, chairman of Amex, would continue as chairman
of the Amex subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
Listed companies will have a choice of two vastly different
market structures: the Nasdaq's computer-driven dealer system and
the "open outcry" Amex.
</P>
<P>
The benefits will be in technological transparency more than
ever before, and better quality trades at lower cost, Zarb said.
</P>
<P>
But the agreement is a preliminary one and the definitive deal
could come within a few weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- In spite of the financial
crisis in East and Southeast Asia, a number of top multinational
companies remain confident about the region's economy, according
to results of a study released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A worldwide survey of leading multinational companies jointly
conducted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
development (UNCTAD) and the International Chamber of Commerce
found that the region remained a destination for foreign direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
The results are based on a survey, which was conducted in
mid-February in the middle of the financial crisis in the region.
Of the 500 companies polled, 198 responded. The UNCTAD said the 40
percent response rate was "impressive."
</P>
<P>
One in four companies polled said that it planned to increase
direct investments over the short and medium terms, while 62
percent said they were continuing their existing plans. Almost all
of the companies covered by the survey gave a thumbs up for a
long-term investment prospects. A large 81 percent of them said
the prospects remained unchanged, and 13 percent said they had
improved.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNCTAD, responses were remarkably consistent,
both by main business sectors and also by home regions: Europe,
North America, Japan and developing Asia. An overwhelming majority
of respondents from each of the region and the main sectors
reported that their long-term views remained unchanged.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian president Frederick
Chiluba said here Thursday that Angola remains a friendly and
sister country to Zambia despite misconception and mistakes that
could have been made by nationals of either country.
</P>
<P>
He said the Angolan delegation currently in the country is
free to go ahead and find out the truth in order to have a better
impression of the situation on the Zambian side of the common
border.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said he believes in correcting any wrongs it has
committed if any, to maintain good relations with Angola.
</P>
<P>
A six-member Angolan delegation is in Mongu in western
province for a meeting following Angolan ambassador Manuel
Augusto's charges that Zambians are supplying arms to Angola's
rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Early this month the Angolan ambassador to Zambia told a news
briefing here that some Zambians have been supplying weapons to
the UNITA rebels through Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambian territory is used in many ways by these
Zambians who support UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He said his country will try in its own ways to ensure that
Zambian territory is not used by the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He described the situation in Zambian-Angolan border as
serious saying the border is almost under the control of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
But Chiluba last week denied that his government has any
involvement in the supply of arms to any country.
</P>
<P>
He said "we are a very peaceful and friendly nation and we
have no capacity to give arms to UNITA."
</P>
<P>
After Angola's independence in 1976 the UNITA fought a civil
war of about 20 years against the government. Although the two
sides signed the Lusaka Peace Accord in 1994 peace has not
prevailed yet all over the country.

<HEADLINE> Butler Sees "New Spirit" of Cooperation From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations chief arms
inspector Richard Butler said Thursday that he saw a "new spirit"
of cooperation from Iraq and was encouraged by this new spirit.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, made the
remarks before leaving the U.N. headquarters in New York to Vienna
and Baghdad for talks on special arrangements of arms inspections
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached last month between U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Iraqi leadership on weapons
inspections in Iraq, Iraq will allow U.N. inspectors to enter its
eight "presidential palaces." But the inspections will be made
jointly by the UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency
based in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Butler told reporters that he had sent an inspection team to
have a look at some places which Iraq had declared sensitive and
blocked the inspections in the past.
</P>
<P>
The team "met with a degree of cooperation" from Iraq, Butler
said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the "`new spirit' currently does not extend to
knowing everything the UNSCOM wants to know.
</P>
<P>
Butler said that his commission would like to learn more on
Iraq's biological weapons capacity.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of Butler's trip to Vienna and Baghdad is to
arrange arms inspections in Iraq's "presidential palaces."
</P>
<P>
The inspections of the palaces are expected to begin next week
if Butler's talks with Iraq leaders are going well, the U.N.
official said.
</P>
<P>
Butler said that he hoped his commission would finally be able
to say that "there's nothing bad or prohibited" in the
"presidential palaces."

MAPUTO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican government signed a
memorandum of understanding with three foreign companies to
survey and explore the natural gas in southern Mozambique on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prospecting efforts in Temane of the southern Inhambane
province will cost an estimated amount of 60 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum, ARCO of the United States, SASOL
of South Africa and ZARARA of the United Arab Emirates will begin
prospecting natural gas resources in Temane this year.
</P>
<P>
John Kachamila, Minister of Mineral Resources of Mozambique,
together with the representatives of the above mentioned
companies signed on the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
As arranged in the memorandum, six wells will be drilled in
Inhambane province and wells will be drilled in the central
province of Sofala so that the gas fields and oil fields there
can be surveyed and explored.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Minister Kachamila said that there
is enough natural gas in the region of Temane to be provided to
any of the three companies.
</P>
<P>
SASOL has shown its willingness to buy the natural gas
produced there. But it's necessary to build a gas pipeline
leading to South Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of German police were
mobilized Thursday to protect a cross-country transport of nuclear
wastes which is likely to trigger off a new wave of anti-nuclear
protests in the coming few days.
</P>
<P>
A special train carrying three containers of nuclear wastes
departed from a nuclear power plant in the southern German state
of Bavaria Thursday afternoon and is due to pick up three more
nuclear waste containers from another power plant in the
neighboring Baden-Wuerttemberg state.
</P>
<P>
Under heavy police protection along the railway lines, the
shipment is due to be transported to a nuclear waste depot in the
northern German town of Ahaus.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear waste transport has become a big headache for German
police and local authorities in recent years because it has always
triggered massive protests and sometimes violent blockade by
anti-nuclear activists who called on the government to close down
all nuclear power plants in the country.
</P>
<P>
A similar transport of six nuclear waste containers last year
required 30,000 police to provide protection and cost the
government some 61 million dollars in total.

<HEADLINE> Annan Brings No New Proposal on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan will not carry any new proposal on Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon in his upcoming visit to Lebanon, the United States
Ambassador in Beirut Richard Jones said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jones's remarks came amid Lebanese media's massive speculation
that the U.N. chief will take a new plan on the Israeli
withdrawal from its occupying south Lebanon during his maiden
tour to the Middle East since he took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
After holding talks with Lebanese Deputy House Speaker Elie
Frizli, Jones said, "I think Annan's visit to Lebanon is very
important, but I do not think he will carry any new proposal on
the south."
</P>
<P>
In fact, he added, Annan's visit is more like a fact-finding
mission.
</P>
<P>
Jones also denied that British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
had carried a new initiative on the south during his brief visit
Wednesday to Lebanon, the last leg of his regional tour.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador stressed the European mediation did not
contradict the U.S. efforts aimed at reviving the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to make a visit to Lebanon on Friday at a
time when Israel is launching a campaign to market its proposal
to conditionally withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has flatly rejected the offer, saying Israel should
implement the U.N. resolution 425 and pull out of the south
without any conditions.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Briefs SLA Chief on Withdrawal Intent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Thursday briefed commander of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanese Army (SLA) Antoine Lahad on Israel's intent to withdraw
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Lahad that Israel wants to pull back troops from
south Lebanon in accordance with the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Israel's promise to guarantee the safety of the
SLA's some 2,000 soldiers and their families in the event of a
pullout. The SLA has been helping Israeli troops to exercise
control over the self-styled "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops, Netanyahu emphasized, will remain in south
Lebanon before a security arrangement is worked out with Beirut
for the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel has proposed to pull out from south Lebanon if the
Lebanese government agrees to guarantee the security of northern
Israel by curbing cross-border attacks by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, however, has rejected the proposal, maintaining that
the U.N. resolution 425, which was passed after Israeli troops
invaded Lebanon in March 1978, calls for an immediate and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Lahad has voiced his support for Israel's unilateral withdrawal
from south Lebanon; but some SLA members have threatened to turn
their guns against Israel if their safety can not be ensured.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of Israeli media, Israel and France are
holding talks on the possibility that SLA top officers go to
France if Israel quits south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon views SLA members as traitors and a Lebanese court
sentenced Lahad in absentia to death two years ago for
collaborating with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli cabinet will on Friday review
reports presented by senior army and intelligence officers on the
political implications of a unilateral withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli inner cabinet has reached a consensus that Israel
should not go ahead with the proposed pullback unless the Lebanese
government is willing to rein in guerrillas of Hezbollah, or Party
of God, and other Muslim forces, which are fighting against the
Israeli occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the 1,100-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985, allegedly to protect its northern areas
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
preparing to announce changes on Friday in U.S. policies toward
Cuba, U.S. officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be made following broad-ranging consultations
aimed at finding ways in which the U.S. can assist the Cuban
people without re-energizing the (Cuban) government, a U.S.
official said.
</P>
<P>
The administration has planned to resume direct flights between
the United States and Cuba and also to permit direct remittances
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. officials said key elements of U.S. policy toward
Cuba, including an economic embargo and the Helms-Burton law that
seeks to discourage foreign investment on the island, would remain
in force.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Court Finds 5 Policemen Guilty of Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish court on Thursday
sentenced five police officers to seven and a half years each in
prison for beating death a journalist, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court in the western Afyon province acquitted
six others due to lack of evidence, according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The body of Metin Goktepe, a 27-year-old reporter working for
the daily Evrensel, was found in a park in Istanbul, the largest
city of Turkey, in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The night before, Goktepe and hundreds of others were detained
at a sports hall following the funeral of an armed and
ultra-leftist militant. Goktepe was covering the funeral, which
later turned into a mass protest.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that Goktepe was beaten severely by police for
hours until he lost consciousness, adding that the reporter was
chosen by police because he worked for a leftist newspaper.
</P>
<P>
When his body was found, police concluded that Goktepe died of
a falling from a wall. They denied any responsibility for his
death.
</P>
<P>
The trial of eleven Turkish policemen lasted for months and
the first hearing was held one year after the incident and
was moved from one location to another, apparently in an
attempt to reduce public attention.
</P>
<P>
Goktepe's family members were not satisfied with the court
verdict, saying that they found the sentence "not severe enough
for murderers".

<HEADLINE> House Representatives Reportedly Plan to Examine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A White House spokesman
Thursday described as "premature" reported plans by Republican
leaders to examine evidence collected by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich of the House of Representatives, and
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, both Republicans, have
reportedly agreed to send a team of House members to study Starr's
evidence and weigh the question of possible impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said the White House
would like to see similar "anticipation and interest" demonstrated
on the raft of policy questions languishing on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
"There is so much on this nations agenda that this Congress
does not directly address," he said, citing education, child care,
health care and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Since there are "months and months until this becomes a real
live question," McCurry said, "why not work on the questions right
now... of concern to the American people?....It's premature."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commenting on the Washington Post's report Thursday
outlining their plan to examine Starr's evidence, Gingrich and
Hyde Thursday issued a joint statement saying no procedural
decisions will be made on impeachment proceedings against Clinton
until Starr makes a "referral of information to the House of
Representatives."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the two intend to proceed "in a slow and
cautious manner" because the fairness and credibility of any
congressional investigation is "paramount."
</P>
<P>
The Post said a small bipartisan panel would examine Starr's
evidence on the Clintons' 1980s Whitewater financial transactions
and more recent allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction
of justice by the president.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Fresh Row Emerges Between Nigeria, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The faceoff between Nigeria and
Liberia which has been under water for some time seems to surface
as a Nigerian general has risen to condemn the Liberian police's
brutal treatment of his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Major General Timothy Shelpidi on Thursday described
the recent harassment and detention of three Nigerian journalists
by Liberian police in Monrovia as an orchestrated attempt to
humiliate the people and government of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A contingent of heavily armed Liberian national police last
Saturday stormed a hotel in Monrovia and arrested three Nigerian
journalists. The acting director of defense information Col.
Godwin Ugbo and some officials of the Nigerian government
suspected that some of them were carrying drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians at that time were on their way back from a
ceremony marking the restoration of Sierra Leone's President
Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
"The bestiality and brutality exhibited by the Liberian
national police is a clear manifestation of an orchestrated and
calculated attempt to victimize and humiliate the people and
government of Nigeria," said Shelpidi, who is the chief of the
west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
That manifestation of anti-Nigerian sentiment was a
culmination of "previous campaigns of slander and naked abuse to
the people and government of Nigeria", the ECOMOG force commander
said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that his country, in the spirit of a peacekeeping
mission, has exercised restraint in the face of naked teleguided
aggression, warning that "enough is enough".
</P>
<P>
Lamenting "we have been provoked, humiliated and brutalized
for too long", Shelpidi stressed that ECOMOG's silence should not
be misconstrued as a sign of weakness or cowardice.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG chief also firmly denied the allegation that some
of the Nigerian journalists were carrying drug with them.
</P>
<P>
However, Liberian Information Minister Joe Mulbah said
Shelpidi's comment on the issue came as a "shock" and "threat" to
his government.
</P>
<P>
As the the commander of a sub-regional force, Shelpidi "should
not be speaking for the Nigerian government," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"If Nigeria is not satisfied with Liberia, such comment should
come from the ambassador or directly from the Nigerian
government," he argued.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the police suspected some
individuals had drugs with them and decided to inquire. In the
process, they took away some people who were involved. Later the
police director intervened and the men were released.
</P>
<P>
"It is to our surprise that Shelpidi came all heavily and was
threatening us," Mulbah said, quoted by the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The fresh row between Nigeria and Liberia, however, does not
come as a surprise to many observers as it has been reported for
long that Liberian President Charles Taylor does not like
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG was sent to Liberia in 1990 when
Taylor's warring faction had taken over most part of the country
during the civil war the former warlord launched in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Although ECOMOG helped create an environment conducive for
Taylor to become the President, Taylor began to ask the force to
leave his country shortly after his inauguration last August.
</P>
<P>
He also barred ECOMOG to use Liberia for attack against the
military junta in neighboring Sierra Leone and opposed ECOMOG to
be involved in the restructuring of the Liberian army he
previously agreed.
</P>
<P>
It is still early to predict the effect of the new row between
the two countries, but the hostile posture of the Taylor
government has been seen as one of the major reasons for ECOMOG's
planned move of its headquarters from Monrovia to Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> New Discoveries Show Birds Descend From Dinosaurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Two new discoveries of ancient
creatures have provided strong support that birds descended from
dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
Reporting Thursday in the British scientific journal Nature, a
group of American researchers said that they have found in the
Gobi Desert of Mongolia skulls of turkey-sized animals, which had
features of both bird and dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
The species, living 70 million years ago, could walk on two
legs and had important characteristics normally seen only in
birds, wrote scientists from the American Museum of Natural
History and George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
However, the creature also had long necks and tails, which are
unseen in any bird living today and their forearms ended in a
single, blunt claw resembling that of dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
Another piece of evidence, which appeared in the latest issue
of the American journal Science, was a 65-million-year-old fossil
of a raven-sized bird.
</P>
<P>
Discovered on the island of Madagascar, the bird also shared
features, such as a slashing claw, with meat-eating dinosaurs
living in the same period, said researchers from the State
University of New York, the United States.

<HEADLINE> German Policeman Killed in Operation to Protect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A policeman was killed by a passing
train early Friday morning in Germany during operations to protect
a controversial shipment of nuclear waste against anti-nuclear
protests.
</P>
<P>
The policeman was hit by a passing train and died of head
injuries hours before a special train carrying six containers of
nuclear waste from two southern German nuclear power plants was
due to pass the site near Wuersburg.
</P>
<P>
The radioactive waste is due to be transported to a storage
depot in Ahaus near the Dutch border.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, another policeman was injured Friday
morning when hit by a car which failed to follow orders to stop
for a security control near Ahaus.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand policemen were involved in security operations
to protect the latest nuclear waste transport which started
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Police said that demonstrations so far had been peaceful and
there had been no violent clashes. But shortly after leaving an
interim depot in the southern German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg
in the evening, the nuclear waste train was held up temporarily
when three anti-nuclear activists chained themselves onto the
tracks to try to stop the transport.
</P>
<P>
According to German media reports, about 2,500 demonstrators
have gathered in Ahaus where the nuclear waste is due to arrive
Friday evening. Some 150 protesters who defied a police ban on
demonstrations had been taken into custody temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear waste transport has become a big headache for German
police and local authorities in recent years because it always
triggered massive protests and sometimes violent blockade by
anti-nuclear activists who called on the government to close down
all nuclear power plants in the country.
</P>
<P>
A similar transport of six nuclear waste containers last year
required 30,000 police to provide protection and cost the
government some 61 million dollars in total.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges State-owned Businesses to Do a Better Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
today urged that all key state-owned enterprises should actively
expand their markets, accelerate their restructuring and help
ensure the fixed economic growth rate of 8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The key state-owned enterprises play decisive roles in the
national economic enhancement, said Wu when meeting with business
executives attending a management training course in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Facing great tides of scientific and technological development
throughout the world, leading officials from the key state-owned
enterprises should particularly master knowledge concerning
advanced science and high technology and improve their management
ability, said Wu, who also is a member of the Political Bureau of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
High business officials without enough knowledge cannot follow
world trends and give their companies the edge on worldwide
competitors, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
All the important state-owned enterprises must unswervingly
carry out reform measures set by the central authorities,
especially this year, the first in China's ambitious three-year
attempt to save those crumbling businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wu encouraged them to do good jobs this year.
</P>
<P>
Since late February, the State Administrative College has
organized the training course for 87 students, the second
initiated by the State Council.

</P>
<P>
The league, which has been expanded from 12

<HEADLINE> Beijing Marks 150th Anniversary of "Communist Manifesto" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Beijing held a seminar today to
mark the 150th anniversary of the publishing of the "Communist
Manifesto" written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.
</P>
<P>
Scholars attending the seminar concluded that no work in
mankind's history has had such far-reaching impact on humankind,
which should be attributed to its in-depth criticism of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
World history and human societies have experienced drastic and
deep changes since the publishing of Marx's "Manifesto." The great
revolution in modern scientific technology has especially changed,
and is altering contemporary economic social life and the world
situation, they said.
</P>
<P>
During the current crucial cross-century stage, China -- in its
creative course of building mechanisms of a socialist market
economy and realizing socialist modernization -- will face a
series of historic problems which its predecessors had never
encountered, they emphasized.
</P>
<P>
China must not dogmatize Marxism and solely rely on its
doctrines or its specific conclusions, scholars said, but instead
must treat Marxism with scientific attitudes, which is required by
Marxism to further develop it.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Bijian, vice president of the Party School of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China(CPC), stressed
that the Deng Xiaoping Theory is Marxism in contemporary
China. The new wave of Deng Xiaoping Theory studies within the
whole CPC is the best commemorative activity marking the 150th
anniversary of publishing the "Communist Manifesto," they said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is also being held to mark the 180th anniversary of
the birth of Marx, and a ceremony for the publishing of a
commemorative version of the "Communist Manifesto."

David Martin here today.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on Hong Kong and European Union issues.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Tung briefed Martin on the latest developments
in the HKSAR, including the budget, focus on quality education and
the upcoming legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law has set up a 10-year timetable for elections
both for the chief executive and for the legislature," Tung said,
adding, "The first Legislative Council (in the HKSAR) to be
elected in May this year will have 60 members, all of whom will be
elected directly or indirectly."
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong people would also have an increasingly larger
voice in the selection of the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law provides that further democratic evolution after
2007 would depend on the wishes of the people in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Martin expressed his support to Hong Kong in lobbying for
visa-free access for HKSAR passport holders. The European
Parliament official, who visited the Immigration Department
Thursday, said he was impressed by the fool-proof system of the
issue of HKSAR passports.

<HEADLINE> 1,107 Nominations for EC Subsector Elections Received in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The nomination for the Election
Committee (EC) subsector elections ended here Friday with a total
of 1,107 nominations received.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Constitutional Affairs Bureau said that the
bureau was pleased with the number of nominations put forward for
the elections scheduled on April 2.
</P>
<P>
The response in some subsectors in which the number of
candidates well exceeded the number of seats available was
particularly encouraging, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 800 seats which make up the Election committee, 77 will
be filled by ex-officio members comprising Hong Kong deputies to
the National People's Congress and members of the Provisional
Legislative council, 40 seats will be filled by nominees from the
religious subsector and 683 seats will be returned by election in
the remaining subsectors.
</P>
<P>
Due to the number of candidates from Hong Kong members of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference is equivalent to the number of the allocated seats, so
the nominated 60 Hong Kong members of the CPPCC will be members of
the Election Committee without election.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called on the registered voters to cast their
votes during the Election Committee subsector elections on April
2. About 96 polling stations have been identified. Polling will
last 15 hours from morning till night.
</P>
<P>
Returning officers will draw lots on Saturday to determine the
order of names of candidates on ballot papers and to allocate
designated spots to candidates for putting up election
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
The first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region shall be composed of 60 members, with 20
returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections,
10 by the Election Committee and 30 by functional
constituencies.

<HEADLINE> hke032068#-#- Philippine Stock Exchange Open to Company Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange
(PSE) is opening up its door for registered companies to go public
in order to raise the capital required for their expansion
programs, the Philippine News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Interested companies which are faced with financial problems
can now look forward to listing with the exchange so that they
will have the opportunity to make use of the privileges.
</P>
<P>
The PSE earlier initiated a move to prepare companies for
medium-term listing in the stock market even before they actually
make the decision to go public.
</P>
<P>
Jose Fernando Alcantara, vice president for business
development and information group of the PSE, was quoted as saying
this move is in anticipation of the opportunity for firms to go on
initial public offerings, considering that the Asian currency
crisis has already stabilized.
</P>
<P>
As a step in the right direction, the PSE will host a forum on
March 24 on how companies engaged in the electronics industry can
list with the exchange.
</P>
<P>
At present, the PSE is composed of three existing boards, with
179 active members.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the PSE came out with a study that will list at least
972 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to its SME Board.
</P>
<P>
The SME Board will comprise 33 percent from the manufacturing
sector, 24 percent from the wholesale and retail trade, 21 percent
from financing, insurance and real estate and 22 percent from
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
But companies seeking to list with the SME Board must have a
minimum authorized capital stock of 40 million pesos (1.1 million
U.S. dollars) with a 25-percent paid-up capital to be qualified
for listing with the exchange.

<HEADLINE> Steady Growth Predicted for China's Auto Production, Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China will need 1.65-to-1.75
million automobiles this year, according a market projection
recently issued by the department in charge of the automobile
industry.
</P>
<P>
The projection was made on the basis of the performance of the
Chinese market last year and factors such as the economic growth
rate and the abandonment of obsolete automobiles.
</P>
<P>
According to the prediction, China's auto production this year
will reach a historic high, an annual production of 1.7 million
vehicles. This will be an increase of more than 8 percent over
last year's figure of 1.57 million.
</P>
<P>
Auto imports in 1998 are expected to hit 60,000, 20 percent
more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the different types of automobiles, cars and minis (with
engines under 1.0 liter) appear the most promising.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the demand for cars between 1991 and 1996
achieved an annual growth of 38 percent. This year's demand is
predicted to reach 550,000, up 20 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The projection attributes the bright prospects to the rapidly
developing taxi service sector and rising individual demand.
</P>
<P>
A continued growth is expected in the demand for minis because
of their popularity as taxis; the preference of individuals,
businesses and government agencies; and government encouragement.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of mini sales this year are 520,000-to-550,000.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Urged to Retain High Pork Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine hog farmers on Friday
strongly urged the Presidential Tariff Commission to maintain the
30 percent tariff on pork until the year 2003 to give them time to
be competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
"Should there be any modifications, we recommend a 30-percent
duty until the year 2003 to give time for the industry to cope
with present currency and economic crisis," the National
Federation of Hog Farmers said Friday in a position paper
submitted to the commission.
</P>
<P>
The federation stressed that should the 30-percent tariff on
pork be reduced, this will place the hog industry in a
disadvantage against much cheaper foreign products.
</P>
<P>
Hog raisers have expressed serious concern over the impact of
any tariff modifications at a time when feed materials such as
corn and corn substitutes are imposed with high tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The situation for the hog raising industry is aggravated by the
unstable local corn supply with the continuing decline in
production.
</P>
<P>
Hog raisers said any reduction or unification of tariffs on
meats will make them uncompetitive with foreign producers due to
lack of safety nets.

</P>
<P>
The Check Standard on Excellent Chinese Tourism Cities, which

of Kigoma to witness the repatriation of some Congolese refugees,
United Nations officials said.
</P>
<P>
During their two-day visit, jointly organized by the offices
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
the World Food Programme (WFP), the dignitaries will have a
first-hand impression of the difficulties in refugee assistance
program including trucking food, medicine and other supplies to
the refugee camps in the region.
</P>
<P>
Members of the delegation include delegates, ambassadors and
high commissioners from the European Union, Canada, Italy, Japan,
Sweden, the United States as well as senior officials from the
UNHCR, the WFP and Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Polluted Air Falls into Moderate Range </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The air quality in Beijing has
improved slightly in the March 13-19 period from moderate
pollution levels two weeks ago, according to the latest air test.
</P>
<P>
The air pollution index for the period is 192, which is graded
as third-level air quality. The major pollutant was suspended
particles, according to the fourth weekly air quality report
released today by the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Results of the previous three reports showed lingering major
pollutants such as nitrogen and oxygen compounds which were the
main sources of pollution.
</P>
<P>
The increase of suspended particles in the air was mainly
caused by winds from the north in recent days, said one official.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has released its weekly air quality report since
Feb. 28 to inform residents of environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
The first report showed a level of 206 and the second was 203,
both indicating moderate pollution.
</P>
<P>
China's National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA)
classifies air quality in five grades, with an index of under 50
representing good environmental conditions. Relatively good
conditions are 50-100; slight levels, 101-200; moderate levels,
201-300; and serious pollution, 300 or above.
</P>
<P>
China has 33 cities which release weekly air quality reports,
including Nanjing, Shanghai, Dalian, Xiamen and Lanzhou.

<HEADLINE> China, Austria to Expand Air Links to Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and Austrian
governments are expected to sign an agreement within the first
half of the year on expanded air transportation between the two
countries, according to Ernst Laschan, Austrian Commercial
Councillor to China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here Wednesday, Laschan said
Austrian Airlines has stepped up its consultation with the Civil
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) to extend all of its
Vienna-Beijing flights to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He said they expect to extend the flights to better handle
increasing passengers traffic between China and the
Austrian capital.
</P>
<P>
At present, of the three weekly fights between China and
Vienna, two connect Shanghai and Vienna via Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Since a direct air link between China and Austria was
established three years ago, tourist exchanges between the two
countries have flourished, said Sun Nijia, who is in charge of
international tourism in the China Travel Service Head Office.
</P>
<P>
He said all of China's major travel agencies have taken tourist
groups on package tours to Austria and that this central European
country has become an attractive destination for Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Tourism also serves as a channel for cultural exchanges between
China and Austria, Sun said, adding that the tour of China's
Central Nationalities Orchestra to Vienna was a great success, and
helped introduce the Chinese culture to the world.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Brader, Austrian Airlines General Manager for the
People's Republic of China, said his country holds various
cultural activities every year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the flights between Shanghai, Beijing and Vienna,
Austrian Airlines Group also has two Hong Kong-Vienna flights each

<HEADLINE> Israeli Inner Cabinet Discusses Lebanon Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Key members of the Israeli
cabinet, also called the inner cabinet, met Friday morning and
discussed the proposed Israeli troop withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The inner cabinet ministers were briefed by Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces
(IDF) Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak about the military situation in
South Lebanon and discussed various proposals concerning the IDF
withdrawal from South Lebanon, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO)
said.
</P>
<P>
No decisions were made during the cabinet meeting and the
inner cabinet decided to further discuss this issue after two
week's time, it added.
</P>
<P>
The inner cabinet consists of Prime Minister, Defense Minister,
National Infrastructure Minister, Education, and Industry and
Trade Minister.
</P>
<P>
While the inner cabinet was in session, the "Four Mothers"
group demonstrated outside the Prime Minister's office, calling
for the IDF withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This group was set up several years ago by four mothers whose
sons were killed while in service in South Lebanon. The group
calls for IDF pullout from South Lebanon. Its name remains
unchanged although more mothers had joined this organization.
</P>
<P>
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and a key cabinet
member, announced during a TV interview on March 13 that he
supports a unilateral, gradual IDF withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Sharon stressed, however, that any attacks launched from
Lebanon into Israeli territory after IDF pullout would be met
with severe retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Sharon submitted his proposal to the cabinet on March 15 and
the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee of the Knesset
(parliament) examined all proposals concerning the IDF withdrawal
from South Lebanon the next day.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on March 1 that Israel
would pull out its troops from South Lebanon under the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 provided Lebanon reaches
security arrangements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted the resolution in 1978,
asking Israel to withdraw from South Lebanon unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in 1985
in South Lebanon to protect its northern security and faces
strong resistance from local military groups, such as Hezbollah,
since then.
</P>
<P>
IDF's proposed withdrawal from South Lebanon has become a hot
topic again in Israel. Some people said that IDF should pull out
from the security zone because more and more IDF young soldiers
have lost their lives there and the IDF could protect the
country's northern security just inside the Israeli territory.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, nine IDF soldiers were killed inside
the security zone and a total of 112 IDF officers and soldiers
lost their lives there last year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Drafts Bill on River Systems Cleanliness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has drafted an
Irrigation and Drainage Bill on river cleanliness which will be
enforced in all states, Drainage and Irrigation Department (DID)
Director-General Keizrul Abdullah said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bill drafted by the DID would, among others, encourage all
the sectors involved to practise self-enforcement and
self-monitoring to ensure the cleanliness of the river systems in
the country, he told reporters after opening a workshop on
hydrology here.
</P>
<P>
The bill would complement the existing laws especially the
Environment Quality Act (Amendment) 1996, which stresses more on
enforcement, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Irrigation Area Act 1953 and the Drainage
Works Act 1954 also overlook the environmental aspect.
</P>
<P>
The official hoped that the state governments would approve the
bill for enforcement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
There are 150 river systems in the country, he said, calling
for shared responsibility of the government, developers,
industries and the public on river cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
Keizrul said the workshop being held here aims to share and
understand the hydrological or water cycle data among countries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the database for all the information would be placed at
the Regional Humid Tropics Hydrology and Water Resources Center
for Southeast Asia and the Pacific here.
</P>
<P>
The four-day workshop is jointly organized by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the
DID and sponsored by the Japanese, Malaysian and Indonesian
governments.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHOUSHAN (Zhejiang), March 20 (Xinhua) -- Just after it
destroyed 10,000 old spindles, the Zhoushan Textile Mill in the
city of Zhoushan in east China's Zhejiang Province, is joining 17
other state-owned enterprises in forming a share-holding group.
</P>
<P>
The mill is one of the first to join Zhejiang's campaign to
shrink the textile industry and the issuing of shares is expected
to give it a chance to rebuild itself, vary its products, and
expand the market.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Zhejiang Hongsheng Group, it will have a
combined capacity of 3,000 tons of fibre products annually and a
annual sales of 200 million yuan. Other products will include
electronic components and decorative materials.
</P>
<P>
This is the only way for the mill to modernize and increase its
profits, according to Su Weiping, a mill official. The ambitious
Su expects the new group to be one of 1,000 large enterprise
groups in China.
</P>
<P>
He says Zhoushan will destroy 18,000 old cotton spindles and
lay off 680 workers, and the remaining 20,000 or so
spindles will be used to produce special silk.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province will destroy 340,000 spindles in the coming
two years, a central government goal, and lay off 30,000
employees, sources say.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry has been plagued by overproduction and
chronic inefficiency in recent years, but an effort is being made
by central authorities to reduce its bloated size.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) -The Inspector General of
Police of Tanzania has warned policemen against misusing
firearms, saying the tendency has eroded public confidence in the
good image of the police, local newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Insepector General of Police Omar Mahita, who is on
a five-day visit of the south-western Iringa Region, told local
policemen that it was urgent to curb the increasing incidents of
firearmes misuse.
</P>
<P>
"Firearms should be sparingly used as the last resort
otherwise the police force will enter into unnecessary conflicts
with the public," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month Policemen opened fire at rioting muslims in Dar es
Salaam, killing two and injuring a dozen in the first bloody
confrontation since independence in 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Mahita urged the policemen to perform their duties according
to orders as well as by the ethics of their profession.
</P>
<P>
"Being a policeman is a professional job, like an engineer,"
he said, claiming that the police force has started recruiting
qualified people to increase its efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Mahita promised that each region would be fully equipped
with sufficient communication facilities and motor vehicles to
reinforce the patrol beat.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Urged to Remove Curbs on Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Nairobi Stock
Exchange (NSE), Jimmah Mbaru, has urged the Kenyan government to
remove restrictions still imposed on foreign investors at NSE,
the Daily Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Mbaru as saying Thursday that allowing
foreigners to fully participate in the local stock market would
improve the liquidity of the market.
</P>
<P>
Since the government allowed foreign investors to participate
in the local market, he noted, some 2.4 billion Kenyan Shillings
(about 40 million U.S. Dollars) have been invested by foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The standing restrictions limit foreign investors to 40
percent share of locally controlled companies with an individual
investor only allowed a maximum of five percent of the share
ownership.
</P>
<P>
Mbaru said that since 1992 the NSE turnover had increased from
10 million Dollars to 100 million Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the growth in turnover had been boosted by the
adoption of privatization by the Kenyan government as part of the
structural adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, he added, eight companies have been privatized
through the NSE, injecting 360 million new shares into the
market.
</P>
<P>
Mbaru made the remarks while receiving the directors of Simba
Fund, one of the portfolio investors at the exchange.
</P>
<P>
The directors led by Chairman Timothy Lancaster are in Nairobi
for a board meeting of the fund which has earmarked 120 million
dollars to invest in emerging stock markets of Sub-Saharan Africa.

SHANGHAI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai United Holding
Co. Ltd., which was set up in 1981 in the textile business as the
first overseas-funded firm in Shanghai, has reported good results
after it was sold last June.
</P>
<P>
The company had profits of 52.6 million yuan in 1997, with 52
percent of that coming from projects that came after it was sold.
</P>
<P>
Because of general conditions in the textile industry and poor
management, the firm was mired in operational difficulties for the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
But, in June 1997, The Shanghai Industrial Investment Co. Ltd
purchased 29 percent of its shares at a price of 118 million yuan
and greatly changed its industrial and assets organization.
</P>
<P>
Those efforts paid off, and the company plans to invest more in
biochemical projects and urban construction projects over the next
two years, a company official says.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Indian Cabinet: Balanced With New Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Atal Behari Vajpayee, described
as a moderate and tolerant face of the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), was sworn in Thursday as India's prime minister, leading a
balanced coalition with a number of new faces.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee has retained the key portfolio of external affairs,
according to a communique issued late Thursday night by the Prime
Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister had to give the crucial portfolio
of finance, which he said earlier Thursday that he would keep for
himself, to Yashwant Sinha (BJP), who was finance minister in the
short-lived Chandra Shekhar government from November 1990 to May
1991.
</P>
<P>
Leading newspapers here reported Friday that the last-minute
bargaining over posts led to a delay in the announcement of
portfolios, which had been scheduled for Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The communique announced only the appointments of the 21
cabinet ministers and those of the 21 ministers of state are said
to be released Saturday, an indication of the difficulties faced
by the coalition in the allocation of ministries.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said the problem was largely with the BJP, which
remains the largest political force in the virtually concluded
general elections to Lok Sabha, the lower house of the parliament,
but failed to win a majority.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to maintain harmonious relations with its allies,
the BJP gave all the leaders of its allies positions in the
government, leaving Vajpayee little room for maneuver at the time
of ministry expansion which he had promised to do after he wins a
vote of confidence in Lok Sabha later.
</P>
<P>
As many as 27 ministers of the 43-member cabinet are new to
governance at the center though two of them had been chief
ministers in the previous governments.
</P>
<P>
Only four women were sworn in Thursday as ministers, one fewer
than the 44-member cabinet led by Vajpayee's predecessor Inder
Kumar Gujral.
</P>
<P>
It is noticeable that one-sixth of the ministers in the new
government are from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, indicating
the major role the state is playing in national politics and
administration.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said Tuesday that with all the arrangements, his
government would be stable at least for a period of time though
the opposition would always try to topple it.
</P>
<P>
On the formation of the BJP-led coalition, a Congress spokesman
said Thursday that it is simply an "internal affair" of the party
in power.

<HEADLINE> HK Press Warmly Hails Success of NPC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers Friday
warmly hailed the concluded session of the National People's
Congress (NPC) as a great success.
</P>
<P>
All local papers carried editorials or articles and photos
about the closing of the NPC session and spoke highly of the
principles and policies formulated by the session.
</P>
<P>
They also highlighted the main points of the remarks made by
newly elected Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji at a press conference in
Beijing Thursday, especially quoting Zhu as saying that the
central government will "spare no cost in defending the Hong Kong
currency's peg to the U.S. dollar."
</P>
<P>
The papers said that his remarks were full of confidence and
good humor and greatly boosted the Hong Kong people's confidence
in their future.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth National People's Congress, China's top lawmaking
body, concluded its first annual session Thursday morning in
Beijing after adopting various resolutions and having elected or
approved state leaders for a new term.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily said in a commentary that the
NPC session has won praises from people throughout China and
around the world. This successful meeting fully shows the Chinese
people's firm determination towards the 21st century, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial entitled "China's goals bound to be realized,"
Wen Wei Po described the just concluded NPC session as "important,
successful and far-reaching".
</P>
<P>
The NPC session held high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory,
put forward trans-century goals and laid a solid framework for
attaining the goals not only in politics, but also in the
formation of the leadership, it said.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao said in a commentary that the important speeches
and reports made by the state leaders during the session were
pragmatic and full of vigor.
</P>
<P>
All papers including two English-language newspapers, South
China Morning Post and Hong Kong Standard, quoted Zhu Rongji as
saying at Thursday's press conference that the Central government
will spare no cost to maintain the prosperity and stability of
Hong Kong if the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
government is in need of support from the central government in
any exceptional cases or under unexpected circumstances, and as
long as the Hong Kong government makes the request.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Economic Times said in a commentary that Zhu's
humor, boldness and confidence shown at the press conference in
Beijing were very much appreciated by many local television
watchers.
</P>
<P>
His remarks gave important messages to the Hong Kong people
that Hong Kong business people may have opportunities to
participate in the reform of state-owned enterprises and the
housing reform as well. Hong Kong can also become an international
scientific and technological center, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao Daily's editorial said the formation of the new
Chinese leadership has greatly increased the confidence of the
Hong Kong people in the country's future.
</P>
<P>
It believed that China will surely succeed in the reforms of
state-owned enterprises and its financial center as well as in
the establishment of a market economic structure under the new
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the successful conclusion of the NPC session also
boosted dealers' confidence in the local stock market.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong share prices on Thursday rose sharply 323.39 points,
or 2.90 percent, to close at 11,445.04 while turnover increased
2,313 million HK dollars (296 million U.S. dollars) to 9,023
million HK dollars (1,157 million U.S. dollars) from 6,710 million
HK dollars (860 million U.S. dollars) on Wednesday.

<P>
The Macao Daily News reported on Thursday that the Macao Blood
Donation Center collected blood from 8,009 voluntary donators last
year, more than five times the figure in 1988.
</P>

The report said that there is one donor who has given blood 50
times, and there are two others who donated 45 times and two 40
times each. There are at least 800 people who gave blood at the
center for five times.

As a result, the report said, Macao has achieved
self-sufficiency in blood supply.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has 422,000 residents on its some 23 square
kilometers of land. It has two hospitals, one privately run and

<HEADLINE> El Nino Causes $30 Million Loss on Ugandan Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Floods caused by the El Nino
weather phenomenon has caused damage of least 30 billion Uganda
Shilling (some 27 million U.S. Dollars) to roads and bridges in
Uganda, the Ugandan Minister of Works, Transport and
Communication has said.
</P>
<P>
John Nasasira, Minister of Works, Transport and Communication,
told the parliament Thursday that his ministry has a
two-phase-plan for the repairing of the damaged road system, The
Monitor reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been presented to the International Development
Agency for consideration and thorough negotiation with the World
Bank, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has agreed to provide Uganda with 30 billion
Uganda Shillings on repairing roads and bridges before the El
Nino season. But the fund is far from meeting the repairing
expenditure for only the first phase work, Nasasira said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase works is aimed at short term road network
overhaul to strengthen the classified road network and its
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Since the El Nino floods may continue till May this year, the
damage is surely to be increased, Nasasira said, citing a
prediction from meteorological department of the country.

relations with India," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We earnestly hope that our sincerity will be reciprocated in
removing the underlying causes of conflict and tension so that
durable peace based on justice and equity can be brought to our
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India, he said, stand at the crossroads at a time
of massive global transformation. "We are the inheritors of proud
civilizations but our rich potential for economic growth has
remained subdued," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added: "We have a special responsibility to step out of the
old mind set of confrontation and tension to a new outlook
enthused by the ideals of peace and development... This is what we
owe to our peoples."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister recalled Vajpayee's contribution to the
promotion of Pakistan-India relations during his tenure as India's
foreign minister in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Sharif expressed the hope that the new Indian government under
the leadership of Vajpayee "can bring forth a firm resolve to join
us in building a happier, more prosperous future for our peoples."

<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Committee on the Promotion
of Civic Education (CPCE) has produced two booklets to promote a
better understanding of the Basic Law among the young people here.
</P>
<P>
These comprise a Question and Answer booklet and a storybook,
focusing on the "one country, two systems" concept to redouble
the publicity efforts among students and youths.
</P>
<P>
A CPCE spokesman said on Friday that the government gives
top priority to the promotion of the Basic Law for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of colorful illustrations, the Question and Answer
booklet explains the important principles of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high-degree
of autonomy as defined by the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
It also explicates the background and important features of the
Basic Law, including the economy, the political system and rights
and duties of the individual of the HKSAR guaranteed under the
Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Urges Protection of Water Resource </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official on Friday called
for greater efforts to raise public awareness of the protection of
the world's "most important" resource -- water.
</P>
<P>
Adrianus Mooy, Executive Secretary of the U.N. Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP), said all
governments should mobilize "a majority of the population about
the importance of water management and conservation" and
"reinforce the urgency of addressing water problems in urban
marginal and rural areas."
</P>
<P>
Mooy made the remark in a speech marking the U.N. sixth annual
observance of the World Water Day which falls on March 22. The
theme for this year's World Water Day is "ground water -- the
invisible resource." The ESCAP launched an exhibition about the
protection of water resource in its headquarters in Bangkok to
observe this year's World Water Day.
</P>
<P>
Mooy said the theme was selected in recognition of the
following three principal gaps in ground water management: (i) the
accelerated degradation of ground water systems through pollution
of aquifers; (ii) the lack of awareness about the sustainable use
and economic importance of ground water; and (iii) the economic
implications of not resolving ground water demand and supply
management.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the world's population depends on ground water
sources for drinking water supply and for other uses. In India,
for example, nearly 50 percent of the irrigated land depends on
ground water. Almost 80 percent of the world's rural population
receive a safe supply of water only because it comes from a ground
water aquifer safe from surface pollution. If the entire world's
water supply was based on treated surface water, the cost of water
would be 20 times higher than it is now.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the importance of ground water is not
generally recognized and the protection of ground water from
pollution, particularly biological contamination, will become
critical in the coming years due to the increasing problem of lack
of adequate sanitation.
</P>
<P>
"Promotion of environmental sanitation is not possible without
a linkage with ground water quality control and protection," said
Mooy. "Furthermore, conflicting uses of ground water, such as
drinking, irrigation and industry, can only be tackled through
dialogue between all stakeholders," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mooy said ESCAP, in coordination and cooperation with other
U.N. agencies dealing with various aspects of water resources
development, management and utilization, has been assisting the
countries of this region for more than 50 years in their endeavors
in the efficient use and protection of water resource and will
continue to provide such assistance in the future.

<HEADLINE> Injured Chinese Sturgeon Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese sturgeon that was caught
in a river in Fujian Province last Saturday died early this
morning after 105 hours of futile efforts by Chinese veterinarians
to save its life.
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was a serious injury to its gills as well as
complications in adjusting to the changed environment, scientists
said after they examined the fish this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
No damage was found on its internal organs, only torn gills and
an injury to the pectoral fin and tail. There were ova inside the
three-meter-long fish, which weighed 200 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sturgeon is a rare species unique to China that is
considered to be on the verge of extinction. It is found in the
east China Sea near the Yangtze River estuary and around the
Zhoushan Islands. This one was caught by fishermen from Fujian who
were fishing in the Minjiang River on March 14.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen sent the injured animal to the Fuzhou Zuohai
Aquarium for help the following day. Its condition remained stable
for several days, experts say, but some bacterial infections began
to appear on the injured parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
Then things turned serious around 8:00 am on Wednesday as its
respiratory rate began to fall and it went into shock for a brief
period of time. Its breath stopped at 1:40 am today.

<HEADLINE> East China Gets Heavy Snowfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Some fashionable ladies in
Nanjing, the capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, were
unhappy today because of the heavy snow and chilly winds that
arrived in the night, because they have to put away their skirts.
</P>
<P>
There was ten centimeters of snow on the city's streets and
temperatures dropped below zero degree Centigrade, a 15 degree
drop from yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The city's radio and TV stations have been busy broadcasting an
urgent government notice telling various departments to get their
staff to clean up the snow in front of their office buildings, and
the City Public Security Bureau is warning motor-vehicle
drivers and pedestrians to be careful.
</P>
<P>
A heavy snowfall in late March is very rare in Nanjing,
especially one accompanied by thunder, one native of the city,
which is known for its hot summers, pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The highway from Nanjing to Shanghai has been closed for the
time being and Lukou International Airport has had many flights
delayed.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow also fell in other eastern Chinese provinces
including Anhui and Zhejiang, bringing down temperatures by 20
degrees Centigrade overnight.

<HEADLINE> China Finding Long-Buried Desert Ruins With Eye in Sky (1) (by Li Xiguang and Nie Xiaoyang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
discovered ruins of a 2,000-year-old city buried in the Taklamakan
Desert in northwestern China by using space technology.
</P>
<P>
This so-called "space archaeology" helped Chinese
archaeologists find Niya, a city that disappeared nearly 2,000
years ago in the badlands of the northwestern desert.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of walls made of reeds and towers built with
bricks made of mud from lakes coincides with a description in the
travel notes of Xuan Zang, the renowned monk traveler of the Tang
Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists at the Third International Space
Technology and Applications Exhibition say they have used
satellite remote sensing technology to look for an ancient grand
canal that has been silting up for more than 1,000 years, a
1,000-kilometer wall built by Genghis Khan (1162--1227), and even
an ancient mulberry field in the heart of the Taklamakan.
</P>
<P>
Along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, 12,202 ruins of
ancient buildings have been located thanks to the remoting sensing
technology. They date back to 770 to 476 B.C., says Liu Shuren, a
professor at a Shanghai remote sensing lab, the leader of the
investigative work.
</P>
<P>
He says that, when the satellite photos are compared with
aerial photographs of the past, it shows that the number of extant
ruins along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has decreased
20 percent in 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Economy Grows in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's economy maintains a high
growth rate in the first quarter of the year despite the sweeping
Asian financial crisis and severe natural calamities, Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said farmers in the south have harvested a bumper
winter-spring rice crop. Thanks to the mechanisms restructured by
the government, farmers are gaining profits through selling rice
at higher prices and buying fertilizer at lower cost.
</P>
<P>
The output of crude oil, gas fuel, cement, garment and textiles
continue to rise, Phan said.
</P>
<P>
Although Vietnam's total export volume is on the rise, he
added, major exports including crude oil and farm produce have
dropped.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the same period of 1997, Vietnam's export
turnover increases 12.3 percent while import turnover slips by
3.3 percent. As a result, trade deficit decreases by 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
He reminded his people that economic efficiency has not been
improved although the country enjoys a high growth, and factors
hindering the economic development are still on the way.

<P>
Liu explains that aerial photos of eastern China were taken by
American and Japanese forces 50 years ago and they indicate that
as much as 90 percent of the ruins in rural plains and cities
might have been destroyed while many in mountainous areas are
still intact.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists are also using the space archaeology
techniques for underwater research. They were used, for example,
to locate ships that sank during the Ming Dynasty (1368 -- 1644)
in the waters near the mouth of the Pearl River and for studies in
Bohai Bay. And, they have discovered more than 500 sunken ships
from different historical periods near the mouth of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
China's work in this field has caught the attention of
scientists in the U.S., France, Russia, Canada, Israel, India, and
elsewhere. At least ten archaeology programs involving satellites
are expected to be launched by various countries over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Some researchers are hoping that the great mysteries of the
Egyptian Pyramids, the Silk Road, Genghis Khan's tomb on the
Mongolian Plateau can be solved from space by using satellites and
other devices.
</P>
<P>
An international conference on scientific and technological
applications in archaeology is scheduled for China this year and
scholars predict that space archaeology will be a hot topic
there.

<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Downplaying expectations of a possible U.N. involvement in
the stalled Middle East peace process, U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan said he was not carrying any U.N. proposals to revive the
process during his current Mideast tour.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after holding talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak here Thursday particularly on Middle East peace
process developments, Libya-West crisis and situation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt will receive 197 million U.S. dollars next Wednesday

SINGAPORE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined on
profit-taking on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits
Times Industrials Index (STII) lost 19.64 points to close at
1679.11 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that players were closing their positions ahead of
the weekend, locking in profits after the market's recent run-up,
especially Thursday's rally. They added that February's non-oil
export figures were within their expectations.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 422.91 million units, valued
at 560.83 million Singapore dollars (about 348.34 million U.S.
dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 276 to 88, while 247
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd again was the most actively traded stock as it
registered a turnover of 29.09 million units. It was followed by M
Resources which had 18.47 million shares traded. MBf Capital was
next with 17.89 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
GE Life led the gainers of the day as it rose by 90 cents to
finish at 12.7 Singapore dollars. Malaya Banking 200 increased by
50 cents to end at six Singapore dollars. ASEAN Fund, KL Kepong,
and Khong Guan each gained 30 cents to close at 8.7, 3.88, and 5.3
Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>

On the downside, local property developer City Developments was
the biggest loser as it declined by 60 cents to end at 8.4
Singapore dollars. Clipsal Warrant98 fell by 35 cents to close at
30 U.S. cents, while SPH (Singapore Press Holdings) was down by 30
cents to finish at 19.5 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> PNA Calls for Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has called for an Arab summit and urged the United
States to take a more active role in pushing the peace process
forward.
</P>
<P>
PNA made this call at a cabinet meeting which was held in Gaza
Thursday night on European Union's (EU) initiative for reviving
the stalled peace process brought by British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook during his visit here earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
EU's six-point initiative demands Israel to halt all kinds of
settlement expansions in the occupied territories and urges the
parties concerned to implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet warned the Israeli government that its refusal to
implement the EU initiative would be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the cabinet also discussed the plans for the
anniversary of Land Day on March 31. Activities include
demonstrations and marches to protest land confiscations, slated
to take place in Jerusalem, Gaza and throughout the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The year-old impasse of the peace process also caused worries
among the Israeli politicians. Opposition Labor Party Chairman
Ehud Barak told the Kibubutz Artzi convention at Givat Haviva on
Thursday that Israel could find itself fighting a guerrilla war,
like the one in Bosnia, if it continues to miss the chance for
peace.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Ministry of Defense of Israel
lowered on Thursday the minimum age of married Palestinian men
eligible for work permits from 25 to 23, a move expected to
increase the number of Palestinian workers from the territories
by some 10,000 from the current 50,000.
</P>
<P>
Entry permits given to Palestinian merchants have also been
increased by 1,500, bringing the number to 13,500.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Scarcity Worsens in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The new round of acute fuel scarcity
that started to hit Nigeria early this week worsened Thursday in
Lagos, the nation's economic center, which witnessed a sharp reduction
in vehicular movement.
</P>
<P>
Transport fares increased by 100-200 percent because commerical
buses were worse hit by the shooting up price of diesel oil, which
sells for 12 Naira per liter at normal times in the city but now sold
for 31 Naira.
</P>
<P>
Long queues were seen in many filling stations despite the fact
that only few of them had fuel to sell.
</P>
<P>
The queues were also a common scene in the capital Abuja, where the
catholic pontiff, Pope John Paul II is billed to arrive for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
They have become almost a permanent feature at filling stations in
southern Enugu State, where the pope will also visit.
</P>
<P>
A recurring fuel scarcity has hit Nigeria in recent years,
crippling an economy that is already in a parlous state. Repeated
official assurances have failed to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation of about 100 million people,
is classified among the leading producers of crude oil in the world.
</P>
<P>
The scarcity is however nationwide due to the breakdown of all the
four refineries and the government has to import fuel to feed the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Petroleum Resources pledged earlier this month the
fuel scarcity could be eased by September when overhaul of one of the
refineries will be completed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Police Warned against Misusing Firearms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) -The Inspector General of
Police of Tanzania has warned policemen against misusing
firearms, saying the tendency has eroded public confidence in the
good image of the police, local newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Insepector General of Police Omar Mahita, who is on
a five-day visit of the south-western Iringa Region, told local
policemen that it was urgent to curb the increasing incidents of
firearmes misuse.
</P>
<P>
"Firearms should be sparingly used as the last resort
otherwise the police force will enter into unnecessary conflicts
with the public," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month Policemen opened fire at rioting muslims in Dar es
Salaam, killing two and injuring a dozen in the first bloody
confrontation since independence in 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Mahita urged the policemen to perform their duties according
to orders as well as by the ethics of their profession.
</P>
<P>
"Being a policeman is a professional job, like an engineer,"
he said, claiming that the police force has started recruiting
qualified people to increase its efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Mahita promised that each region would be fully equipped
with sufficient communication facilities and motor vehicles to
reinforce the patrol beat.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Arrives in Beirut on Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived here Friday morning on a
two-day visit to Lebanon in the third leg of his maiden tour to
the region since he took office in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
This is not Annan's first trip to Lebanon. As
undersecretary-general for peacekeeping operations, he had visited
the U.N. Interim Forces in South Lebanon (UNIFIL) in Aqoura, on
the Lebanese border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong UNIFIL was established in 1978 after Israel's
first invasion of Lebanon. Its mission is to help Israel
implement the U.N. resolution 425 which calls for an unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Before visiting Lebanon, Annan had denied that his trip was
concerned with offering a new peace initiative to the stalled
Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Annan is likely to have different goal for different
countries he is visiting on this trip. there was no formal
mission statement issued," said Vera Azar, information officer of
the Beirut-based Economic and Social commission for Western Asia
(ESCWA).
</P>
<P>
Annan will officially inaugurate the ESCWA's new 14-storey
building in Beirut and visit UNIFIL headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He will also hold talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
and Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz on Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer area in
South Lebanon since 1985 with the declared aim to protect its
northern villages and towns from Lebanese guerrillas cross-border
attack.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, he will meet parents of Lebanese detainees in
Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Some 210 Lebanese are detained in Israeli prisons inside its
territory or in South Lebanon reportedly because of their refusal
of collaborating with Israeli occupying forces or having
connections with Hezbollah, or party of god, the country's leading
anti-Israeli-occupation military group.

<HEADLINE> ECU Not Expected to Impact Sino-EU Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The integrity of European
currencies will have few adverse side effects on Sino-Europan
Union (EU) economic and trade cooperation, according to a recent
article in the International Trade News.
</P>
<P>
Next year's introduction of the European Currency Unit (ECU) is
expected to expand the trade within EU countries since the
integrity of the currencies will greatly weaken risks involving
foreign exchange rates and reduce trade costs in the
region. The ECU will, in fact, offer trade opportunities
for European businesses.
</P>
<P>
The complementary economies of China and the European Union also
portend bright prospects for the bilateral trade ties, according
to the daily.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to import advanced technology from Europe,
and European countries will in turn import large volumes of
Chinese products, which are highly competitive on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, increased European investments in China will
promote the further development of bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China sincerely hopes that the enhanced integrity of
currencies will be accompanied by greater openess and activity of
the part of EU countries, as well as the total elimination of EU
trade discrimination and the further development of two-way trade
conducted on an equal basis.
</P>
<P>
The rapid maturation of the Chinese market has attracted an
increasing number of foreign ventures, including European
companies. The said ventures are flocking to China in hopes of
establishing their niche in the nation's vast potential market.
</P>
<P>
The EU regards its ties with China as a major component of its
development strategy in Asia, and has adopted long-term policies
to cement Sino-EU ties.
</P>
<P>
Introduction of the ECU will in no way affect the
expansion of EU investments in China, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
However, it warns that European businesses have lagged behind
U.S. and Japanese companies in terms of investments in China, and
could easily be squeezed out of the Chinese market if they fail to
seek new opportunities geared to the new century.

<HEADLINE> S'pore's External Trade Up 7.1 Pc in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total external
trade increased by 7.1 percent in February this year on a
three-month moving average basis, with exports and imports
expanding by 10.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively, the
Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports grew by 12.2 percent while non-oil
re-exports recorded a 13.9 percent growth, the TDB said. Oil
domestic exports, on the other hand, continued to decline by 12.2
percent in February, it added.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, non-oil domestic exports recorded a robust
growth, surging by 28.1 percent following a drop of 0.9 percent in
the previous month. The TDB said that the high February growth was
partly statistical due to the shift of festive holidays from
February in 1997 to January in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the average of January and February figures, non-oil
domestic exports increased by 11.6 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
During the period, domestic exports on integrated circuits and
printed circuit boards assembled (PCBAs) continued to increase
strongly by 22 percent and 31.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
But shipment of disk drives was weak, registering a moderate
growth of 1.4 percent. In the same period, non-oil re-exports
increased by 14.7 percent, reflecting the strong growth in the US
and European Union markets, which, however, were offset by weak
performance in the Malaysian and Thai markets.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said that non-oil domestic exports increased by 12.2
percent to reach 7.1 billion Singapore dollars (about 4.44 billion
US dollars) in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports to the United States and the European
Union remained strong, expanding by 18 percent and 15.8 percent
respectively on the back of strong economic growth in these
economies, it said.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports to Japan increased by 2.3 percent in
February, the first increase recorded after 18 months of negative
growth. Nevertheless, non-oil domestic exports to Malaysia
remained weak, declining by 1.9 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil continued to be weak in February as it
declined by 12.2 percent in the face of intensified competition
from regional refineries.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports increased by 5.8 percent to reach 13.6 billion
Singapore dollars (about 8.5 billion US dollars) in February,
contributed mainly by imports of integrated circuits, PCBAs, disk
drives, parts of color television sets, radios and other products.

<HEADLINE> Schools to be Monitored on English-Teaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Ill-equipped primary schools
will not be allowed to teach English to first graders for fear
their linguistic abilities could be impaired, the Bangkok Post
quoted the Curriculum and Instruction Department as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department said that it would consult the National Primary
Education Commission to arrive at the most effective method of
teaching English.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, the department called the Education
Ministry to review its policy of teaching English to children as
young as those in prothom suksa 1 (grade 1), saying pupils at that
age can not learn a second language well since they are not
skillful in their mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
However, the Education Ministry rejected the call a day later,
arguing that it is too early to judge whether the policy is good
or bad since it has been implemented for just one year.
</P>
<P>
The department chief, Payoongsak Chandarasurin, said though he
was obliged to follow ministry policy, his department would not do
it blindly.
</P>
<P>
The department would ask the ministry to evaluate primary
school teachers to find out how many of them had sufficient skills
to teach English competently, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry would also be asked to provide training for those
incompetent, he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Intensifies Anti-TB Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Department of
Health is implementing an intensified anti-tuberculosis (TB)
campaign in more areas of the country after initial success in
pilot areas, the official Philippine News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, dubbed as "Collaboration in Rural and Urban Sites
to Halt TB," aims to identify at least 70 percent of new cases or
those positive to sputum examination, and cure about 85 percent of
the patients that need treatment.
</P>
<P>
This can be done with the early detection and cure of TB
patients that will prevent death, disability, multi-drug
resistance and transmission of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The campaign's main strategy focuses on the patients' strict
adherence to regular and complete medication for full recovery.
Treatment is supervised daily by a family member or a health
worker.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica was quoted as saying that
the community and family support is vital in controlling TB in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Health Department intensified the anti-TB campaign after a
department report revealed an upward trend in the number of
reported TB cases in the country from 1993 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's TB cases rose sharply from more than 171,000 in
1993 to nearly 278,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
TB in all forms ranks the fifth leading cause of deaths in the
country, with 60.3 percent occurring in the 15-64 age group or the
economically-productive group.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China's Dalian Company Transports More Containers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Singapore financed Dalian
Container Terminal Co. Ltd. of northeast China's Liaoning Province
has reported loading and unloading 460,000 TEUs of containers in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The company was jointly started 20 years ago by the Dalian Port
Administration and PSA Corporation Co. Ltd. of Singapore for 4
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore partner in December transferred some of its share
to Denmark-based Maersk Company, the world's leader in shipping
business.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is situated at Dayaowan Port of Dalian City,
and operates four berths built on a coastline of 1,140
meters. Water depths of the four berths range from 12.1 meters to
14 meters.
</P>
<P>
The company, equipped with sound infrastructure and advanced
equipment, is capable of handling 1.1 million TEUs of containers a
year, according to Sun Hong, deputy general manager of the joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
A score of domestic and overseas shipping companies have
extended their marine business routes to Dayaowan, while 60 other
shipping companies have set up their representative offices
there. In addition to existing container marine routes, two new
container marine routes connecting Dayaowan to the west coast of
the United States and to Southeast Asia were started last year.
</P>
<P>
Five special railway lines connecting the berths to the railway
network of northeast China have been built. Special container
train service to major northeast Chinese cities are also available
on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
The deputy general manager said his company should make greater
efforts to increase container transport and turn Dalian into a
leading center for container transport. At present, it lags far
behind Tianjin and Qingdao ports in terms of container transport
volume.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the crash of
a Boeing jet south of the Afghan capital of Kabul has risen to 45
from the initial 22, reports reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated plane operated by Afghanistan's Ariana airline
Thursday afternoon crashed into Sharki Baratayi mountain near the
town of Charasyab, 15 kilometers south of Kabul, due to inclement
weather there.
</P>
<P>

The reports said Ariana officials confirmed Friday that 45
people had been on the plane, including 10 crew and several Ariana

<HEADLINE> Urbanites in Gansu Eating Greater Range of Farm Produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- In northwest China's Gansu
Province, meat, eggs and dairy products have begun to account for
two-thirds of urbanites' grocery bills, and animal husbandry has
entered a good development period.
</P>
<P>
Gansu, one of China's five traditional livestock raising areas,
had an increase of 37 percent in per-capita consumption of meat,
eggs and milk in the past five years, while its grain production
grew by 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
This has caused animal husbandry to go from a cottage industry
to a pillar one, and the percentage of rural families involved in
the business has grown from 1.8 percent in 1993 to 8.3 percent at
present.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the output value of animal husbandry reached five
billion yuan, a third of the province's total agricultural
production. A survey of 2,091 households showed that incomes from
livestock accounted for 46 percent of their total and ranked first
among sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, meat, egg and milk output exceeded a million tons, a
54 percent increase from five years ago, resulting in a buyer's
market.
</P>
<P>
One provincial animal husbandry official says the shift comes
mainly from policies, science and technology, and from the 1,365
wholesale markets the province has opened to increase
distribution.

<P>
LISBON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Norway beat United States 4-1 in
the Algarve Cup women's soccer tournament in Lagos, Portugal, on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The victory revenged the Norwegians' 3-0 loss to the Olympic
champions in a January game in Guangzhou, China.
</P>
<P>
Marianne Pettersen opened the scoring for Norway in the 7th
minute, when she blasted from 13 meters into the left corner past
American goalkeeper Briana Scurry.
</P>
<P>
Scurry then made a fatal mistake by picking up a back-pass from
an American defender, awarding Norway an indirect free kick.
</P>
<P>
Julie Foudy of the United States blocked the first attempt, but
was given a yellow card for encroachment.
</P>
<P>
Given a second chance to deliver the free kick, Norway surged
to lead 2-0 through Hege Risse's deflected shot.
</P>
<P>
Norway's Unni Lehn scored after just five minutes into the
second half before the Americans narrowed the gap with a penalty
kick converted by Brandi Chastain in the 69th minute.
</P>
<P>
Pettersen then scored again, beating the U.S. defense from the
right and netted in close-range.
</P>
<P>
The Americans will meet Sweden for third place on Saturday
while on the same day Norway will go after the title against
Denmark.

<HEADLINE> Leprosy Cases Reduced in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Owing to the prevention program
launched by the government, leprosy cases in Mozambique have been
reduced from 19,000 in 1990 to the current 11,072, a health
official said.
</P>
<P>
Leonida Compostella, Ccouncillor with the National Leprosy
Program under the Health Ministry, revealed here Thursday that
about 15 to 20 percent lepers admitted to the clinics cannot be
completely recovered due to their late discovery and hence
delayed treatment, according to a report by Noticias Friday.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the multi-therapy applied nowadays can lead to
patients' recovery after a treatment of six to 12 months, while
it took two years for a patient to restore his health through the
monotherapy previously used.
</P>
<P>
Half of the leprosy cases are recorded in north Mozambique's
Nampula province. The other are in Niassa and Cabo Delgado
provinces in the north and Zambeze in the central part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
At present, six out of 10,000 Mozambicans are suffering from
leprosy, Compostella said, adding that the country plans to
extinguish the disease by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The country's anti-leprosy program rules that every health
center should have a professional with basic knowledge for
leprosy diagnosis and treatment and that every province has one
leprosy inspector.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the World Health Organization donates 200,000 US
Dollars each year to Mozambique for purchasing medicine for the
disease.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Dollar Sinks to Four-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar hit a
four-year low in trading with the American dollar on Friday, and
was also traded lower with other major currencies.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was traded at 0.5614 U.S. dollars Friday, the lowest
level since January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has fallen 15 U.S. cents in 18 months and by 2 U.S.
cents in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The latest drop was triggered by the Reserve Bank's statement
on Wednesday that the bank wants the monetary policy to ease more
than expected to ward off the impact on the economy from the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
A weaker dollar will boost exports, but not all people are
happy about it.
</P>
<P>
Consumers will pay more for imported products, and face the
possibility of higher mortgage rates after the sharp rise in
short-term interest rates which compound the weaker dollar.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Federated Farmers President Malcolm Bailey was
quoted by the Wellington newspaper "The Evening Post" as saying
that the dollar has fallen too far.
</P>
<P>
He noted the falling dollar is not a good thing for farmers.
Farmers want stability, which a falling currency does not provide.
</P>
<P>
John Nicholls, chief executive of the Imported Motor Vehicle
Dealers Association, said the low dollar is hurting car importers
and the market is very weak.

BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China's light industrial sector is
attempting to expand operations in developing countries in order
to gain an advantage over foreign competitors, according to

</P>
<P>
Manufacturing enterprises account for over half of the
estimated 300 offices and factories the sector has established
overseas to date.
</P>
<P>
The daily reported that the Qingqi Group has established
branches of a dozen overseas companies in more than 30 countries,

Seventeen companies founded by the former National Council of
Light Industry have also opened 17 overseas subsidiaries,
including an investment company in Cambodia, a garment factory in
West Samoa and an automobile assembly plant in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The sector's strategy for overseas investments and transnational
operations not only helps to overcome shortages of domestic
resources, but also ensures the most advantageous use of local
capital, technology and expertise, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have called for the government to improve
administration over the sector, in addition to providing expanded
macroeconomic guidance, information services.

<HEADLINE> Czech Considers Buying S. African-Made Gunships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic is
considering to buy 24 South African-made Rooivalk attack
helicopters to replace its aging Russian-Made helicopters, a
local daily Business Report said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Czech air force had requested further information on the
Rooivalk and was in talks with Denel Aviation, an aerospace
company owned by the South African government, to arrange a
demonstration of the Rooivalk helicopter, Jan Drahota, a
representative of the Czech national aerospace industry, Aero
Vodochody, was quoted as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Aero Vodochody is claimed to be one of the world's largest
jet-trainer manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"They have decided they will not modernize their Russian
helicopters and want technical details on the Rooivalk so they
can compare them against the (U.S.-made) Apache and other
helicopters on the market," Drahota said.
</P>
<P>
Aero Vodochody is one of several aerospace companies that will
bid to supply the South Africa Air Force (SAAF) with 24 lead-in
jet trainers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the SAAF sent out requests for information
to several companies, including British Aerospace, inviting bids
on the rushed acquisition program.
</P>
<P>
The companies have been given until early next month to
respond.
</P>
<P>
The SAAF has said it will cut its planned purchase of
front-line fighters from 48 to about 38 to help fund the
acquisition of trainers. A key requirement in the bids is
expected to be not only the purchase price but the long-term
operation costs.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Firm Takes over Zambia Railways' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A Swedish firm has taken over the
management of Zambia railways to lend its assistance in improving
the railways' performance, leading independent newspaper The Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a handover ceremony held here Thursday night, Anoshi
Chipawa, Zambian Communication and Transport Minister disclosed that
Zambia railways signed a two-and-half-year management and
restructuring agreement with Sweden's Hifab International Ab last
December.
</P>
<P>
The agreement follows an intense competitive bidding system
involving companies based in Sweden, said Chipawa.
</P>
<P>
He also explained that this move is designed to let Zambia
railways benefit from Swedish assistance for the purpose of
positioning the company for either privatisation, concessioning
or any other means by which it will eventually be managed in
future.
</P>
<P>
However, Chipawa said the Zambian counterparts will also be
identified to work side by side with the Swedish experts during
the specific period when they will be in charge.
</P>
<P>
The handover of management came as a result of the
deteriorating performance of Zambia railways and the strong wish
expressed by President Frederick Chiluba during his visit to
Sweden in 1994 that one day Sweden may come and assist to
restructure the state-owned railways.

in the session to hit 65.80, its lowest point since late January.
</P>
<P>
The plunge in the New Zealand dollar indicated that the
reverberations of the New Zealand Reserve Bank's decision to ease
monetary conditions by 150 basis points this week, twice the
amount anticipated by financial markets, are still being felt.
</P>
<P>
However, Stuart Moore, manager of foreign exchange trading with
Australia's St George Bank, said both the Australian and New
Zealand currencies bounced back when the yen surged upward in
afternoon trade.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the move to comments by Japan's Deputy
Minister of Finance For International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara,
who said he was gravely concerned about the yen's weakness and he
was prepared to "take decisive action".
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session at 86.12 yen
from 86.32, and at 1.2122 marks from 1.2121 marks.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares For Planetary Probes (1) By Chen Jie and Li Xiguang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist told
counterparts attending today's international meeting of space
scientists that China is currently conducting engineering
feasibility studies for lunar and Mars probes.
</P>
<P>
"China will actively participate in deep space exploration
(DSE) during the 21st century, and Chinese scientists expand
in-depth research concerning various scientific objectives and the
engineering feasibility of DSE," according to Yuan Jiajun,
vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Space Technology (CAST).
</P>
<P>
Yuan said current research includes the Space Telescope used to
observe solar activity and the proposal for introducing a
Near Earth Dual-Satellite to supplement the Cluster-2
Probes operated by the European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Near Earth Dual-Satellite will be a two system
configuration, with one satellite orbiting in the equatorial plane
with a perigee of two radius of earth (Re) and an apogee of seven
Re, with the other using a polar orbit with a perigee of 300 km
and apogee of four Re.
</P>
<P>
"The Moon will be the focus of human activity and priority
during the 21st century will be placed on DSE," said Yuan, adding
that mankind's planetary exploration will also focus on the Mars.
</P>
<P>
Yuan noted that major achievements China's space industry has
scored over the past 30-odd years of development include
successfully placing communications, meteorological, remote
sensing and retrievable satellites into orbit. "The successful
efforts have established a solid base for China to join in deep
space exploration," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China will increase international cooperation and
technology exchanges, and will continue to contribute to the
progress of deep space exploration.
</P>
<P>
CAST Vice-President Ma Xingrui said China will launch small
lunar explorers when possible and will develop other space
vehicles on the basis of retrievable satellite technology.

"The primary goal of international scientists is to enable
mankind to land in the Moon again and establish a permanent base
there," said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
He outlined the following two major steps in the process:
</P>
<P>
"The first step, between 2000-2010, will include missions to
thoroughly map the topography of the Moon, explore the internal
structure of the lunar planet, establish a base for installing
instruments, conducting scientific experiments, and developing
human life support and energy production systems.
</P>
<P>
"The second, from 2011-2030, will involve establishing a manned
lunar base which can be used for scientific research, processing
materials, transportation and mining."
</P>
<P>
A separate, but directly related, item centers on the fact that
the China Aerospace Corporation has established complete
research, design, development, production and testing systems for
space products, including launch platforms and space vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The corporation employs over 10,000 research scientists and
ranks as one world's leading space industries in space technology
related to satellite retrieval, multiple payload rockets and
geostationary satellites.

</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was present at the

country so that we do not have to spend out hard-earned foreign
exchange for treatment abroad," she said.

DHAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
framing a new electricity act to replace the old one in order to
cope with the changing situation in the power sector, a press
report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government is also contemplating setting up a new

also open the way for foreign investment in the private sector as
well as investment by local entrepreneurs.
</P>

The draft act will be discussed and debated by the concerned
authorities at different levels within a couple of months before

<HEADLINE> Comprehensive Agricultural Development Paying Off in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has made great progress in agricultural production due to
the efforts of farmers and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the province has invested
more than 10 billion yuan in agricultural development projects in
the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
To produce more farm produce, the province has imported more
than 200 high-yield varieties of fruit, vegetables, flowers and
sugarcane.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the province has invested more than 2 billion
yuan to establish processing and stock companies. And large
quantities of farm produce and processed products have been sold
abroad, as well as in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the province has also improved its
farming conditions, with irrigated land accounting for more than
80 percent of the province's total at present.
</P>
<P>
Meizhou city has set up a 13,000-hectare center for shaddock
production. And Zhaoqing city has become the country's largest center
for the production of rosin and cassia bark. About 400,000 hectares of
medium- or low-yield hillside land has been improved.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive development helped accelerate the
agricultural modernization process in the province. In 1997, the
per capita net income of local farmers surpassed 3,000 yuan, with
80 percent of agricultural produce sent to the market.

<HEADLINE> CBK Orders to Move Against Commercial Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
has ordered financial institutions to immediately relinquish
the posts of those directors or chief executives who were found
to have failed to service insider loans, Kenya Times reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The CBK Deputy Governor, Nzioki Kibua, issued the instructions
in wake of the reports that the Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB)
general manager and two directors owed the bank more than 2.6
million U.S. Dollars in unserviced loans.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued to all financial institutions by CBK
Thursday, the deputy government reaffirmed that all insider loans
to the directors and chief executives and their associates should
be fully secured and serviced regularly.
</P>
<P>
Following the instructions, three KCB directors linked to
allegedly irregular loans had reportedly been fired on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In response to press revelations, KCB confirmed Thursday that
some of its directors owed it large unsecured loans, adding that
action was being taken to recover the money and the directors
could be replaced.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has a 60 percent shareholding in KCB
which is the largest commercial bank in the east African region.
</P>
<P>
The government is scheduled to sell a 25 percent stake in KCB
next month, reducing its shareholding to 35 percent.

<P>
SHENYANG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a traditional
industrial base in northeast China, is offering overseas investors
the right to purchase property rights and operational authority
for 133 small- to medium-sized state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
The province sponsored a special Beijing fair today to present
a published list of enterprises on offer, as well as detailed
business prospectuses for each venture. Related documents list
fixed assets, as well as assets-to-debt ratios, products and
markets.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Liaoning Provincial Department of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation said that enterprises in the most
recent listing offer comparatively better conditions, with the
asset-to-debt ratios of most ranging between 70-80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The list includes the Cold Rolling and Light Gauge Sheet Plant
operated by the Benxi Iron and Steel (Group) Co. Ltd., Anshan
No.1 Chemical Industrial Plant and Nu'erhe Paper-Making Mill in
Jinzhou City.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the offering is to promote the importation of
advanced technology and funds from overseas and to revitalize
existing state-owned assets, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the great difficulties involved in
evaluating assets, tackling the debt problem and providing jobs
for workers in related enterprises.

WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Former teenager sensation
Jennifer Capriati lost her first rounder in the Lipton tennis
championships in Florida on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Capriati, a sensation five years ago, fell 0-6, 5-7 to Poland's
top player Magdalena Grzybowska, showing she still has a long way
to recapture her magic.
</P>
<P>
Capriati, ranked sixth in 1992-93 and currently 147th-ranked,
has lost seven straight matches and has been beaten in six
consecutive first rounds, with her last victory dating back to
August 1997 at the Canadian Open.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants IMF to Show More Flexibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia government wants
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to show flexibility during
negotiations on the country's reform program, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia hoped the IMF to show more flexibility especially on
issues which affect the poor, such as abolishing certain trading
monopolies, Minister of Finance Fuad Bawazier was quoted as saying
by the official Antara News Agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There are no companies at the moment willing to import the
basic commodities needed by the community while the IMf is only
allowing the National Logistics board (Bulog) to import rice. The
IMF demand must be reviewed," Bawazier said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Bawazier, private importers had difficulties in
obtaining letters of credit, fresh capital and establishing
distribution networks as required by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Bulog was the sole importer of basic commodities including
sugar and soybeans, until the government scrapped it in February
under an reform agreement with the IMF in return for a 40 billion
U.S. dollars aid package.
</P>
<P>
"Bulog will still import but it will change its status to that
of general importer, and will not be a monopoly. Once the private
companies are ready, Bulog will stop importing the basic
commodities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, Indonesia would basically implement the
50-point agreement with the IMF and would dismantle cartels and
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, not all points of the agreement will be
implemented on time. In some cases, society was not yet prepared
for the adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Bawazier also said that the government would continue to
subsidize the imports of basic commodities, especially rice, and
would accommodate the subsidy into the budget.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team led by its Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss came
here on Tuesday to discuss with the Indonesian government on
economic and monetary crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two sides took place at three different
places in Jakarta Thursday but no concrete result has been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Set to Install Garbage Incinerators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai plans to install
incinerators to tackle rising problems resulting from current
practices surrounding the use of landfills to either bury or
store garbage in the open air.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to incinerate at least 30 percent of its garbage
volume by the year 2002, according to Xu Chuanyang, director of
the Shanghai environmental protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the city to install two garbage incinerators
with daily burning capacities of 1,000 tons each and two smaller
incinerators with 300 tons daily capacities, in addition to
opening a new landfill to store resulting ash residue.
</P>
<P>
Xu noted that Shanghai's garbage volume grew by six percent
annually between 1990-1997, with last year's daily volume hitting
7,500 tons.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the highest daily volumes occur during
the summer and the traditional Spring Festival period.

ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- All 22 people on board an
Boeing 727 which crashed in bad weather south of the Afghan
capital of Kabul have been killed, reports reaching here said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Searchers found the wreckage of the plane operated by
Afghanistan's Ariana airline on Sharki Baratayi mountain near the
town of Charasyab, 15 kilometers south of Kabul, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted the Ariana Director General Hassan Jan as
saying that the plane crashed at 2:00 p.m. (10:30 GMT) Thursday as
it encountered a band of cloud, rain and sleet near the capital.
</P>
<P>
"There were 22 on board including 10 crew, who are all dead,
but we don't yet have the manifest so are not exactly sure," Jan
said before leaving Kabul for the crash site.
</P>
<P>
"It was not technical problems, just bad weather, but we have
to go down there and find the black box," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Thursday evening the aircraft, which was
on its way to Kabul from the southwestern city of Kandahar, the
stronghold of the Islamic Taliban militia, disappeared from radar

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China recorded a 128 percent
rise in international trade settlements for the first two months
of the year, despite financial turmoil in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The branch ranks a close second to the local branch of the Bank
of China in terms of foreign exchange transactions handled in
Shanghai, China's major financial center.
</P>
<P>
The growth momentum for various other indices related to
foreign exchange also continued during the first two months,
according to Sun Chiping, director of the branch's international
business department. He noted that the bank has set an ambitious
1998 target of earning 40 million U.S. dollars in profits from
overall foreign exchange services.
</P>
<P>
The branch's foreign exchange loans are expected to grow by 9.4
percent annually to between 200-300 million U.S. dollars, with
funds mainly channeled to profitable medium to large state-owned
enterprises, foreign-funded ventures, foreign trade firms and
infrastructure construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The branch has responded to increasing private foreign exchange
trading by offering 24-hour services in conveniently located
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Land Resettlement Starts in June in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will begin land
resettlement on the first farms acquired by the government in
June while proceeding with the exercise to designate and acquire
the rest of the targeted five million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Kumbirai Kangai, Minister of Lands and Agriculture, told The
Herald Thursday that although the government had not yet acquired
the whole hectares needed for the full implementation of the
program, resettlement of some of the land-hungry people would
start by about June this year.
</P>
<P>
A number of large-scale commercial farmers who had their farms
designated for compulsory acquisition had since withdrawn their
objections and some were coming forward with more land offers,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
But Kangai didn't give any specific hectares or number of
farmers who had withdrawn their objections. He urged the
government to make preparations as soon as possible so that by
June some people would be on the land, the paper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government gazetted about 1,471 farms last year for
acquisition, a move criticised by commercial farmers. The
commercial farmers were, however, given the chance to raise
reasons why their farms should not be acquired.
</P>
<P>
Kangai stressed that the government was committed to pursuing
land reforms which will improve accessibility of fertile land to
the small-holder sector.
</P>
<P>
At least 62,000 families in Zimbabwe have been resettled since
independence in 1980 but another 100,000 are still waiting for
the land which the government has been promising for the past 18
years.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Launches First Official Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has just completed its
first official auction, a step believed able to prevent corruption
in the country, the local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A 39-year-old citizen became the first successful bidder as the
buyer bought a house at the starting price of 63.14 taels of
gold. "I'm satisfied with my purchase," the citizen said.
</P>
<P>
The first auction took place on Wednesday in the Auction Center
which the Justice Department built in the Ho Chi Minh City last
December.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the Auction Center could curb corruptive
conducts when state-owned property or confiscated items are sold,
said Dao The Tran, deputy director of the center.
</P>
<P>
He said organizers who sell state property or confiscated items
usually release little information about their rules, making
corruption a possibility.
</P>
<P>
There is an increasing demand for property trading, including
private and distressed properties, Dao added, and the appearance
of the Auction Center can satisfy the demand.

<HEADLINE> Animal Bites Can Cause Nasty Infection: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Children should be told not to
let pets to lick them because animal bites can cause nasty
infections, an Australian doctor warned Friday in east Australia's
coastal city of Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
Tony Brown, emergency medicine specialist at Royal Brisbane
Hospital said that 42 different bacteria have been cultured from
human mouths.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, human bites are rare, because they are more likely
to cause infection than an animal bite.
</P>
<P>
"There's an average of five different organisms per human bite
infection compared with around two for dogs and cats," Brown told
the Second Australian Wound Management Association conference in
Brisbane, the third largest city in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The most common human "bites" occur with a punch to the face:
in other words when the knuckle comes into contact with teeth, it
has been bitten and may be at risk.
</P>
<P>
Brown said that 64 different bacteria have been isolated from
dogs' mouths.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of all dogs carry the bug Pasteurella multocida,
which can rapidly cause inflammation and a pus discharge, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
He said only 15 percent of dog bites become infected.
</P>
<P>
Fewer bugs may lurk in the mouths of cats, a total of 55 have
been found, but around half of all cat bites become infected.
</P>
<P>
"This is because the nature of a dog bite is crushing and
superficial tearing, whereas cats have sharp, pyramid-shaped teeth
and make a deep puncture wound," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
Antibiotics are typically prescribed for all cat bites, all dog
and human bites on the hand, and bites to the immuno-suppressed
such as those with diabetes and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Animal bites account for one percent of attendance at hospital
emergency departments around Australia, and most of them are for
children bitten on the face by dogs.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of bites treated at hospital are from dogs, 15
percent from cats, three percent from humans and two percent from
other animals including pigs.
</P>
<P>
"Children should be told not to let pets lick them,
particularly on the face, because it's just a direct inoculation
of potentially very dangerous bacteria," he said.
</P>
<P>
"People who are allergic to penicillin must be very careful to
avoid animal bites because any infection is going to be difficult
to treat."

<HEADLINE> SET Gets Tough With Rule-Breaking Brokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Securities
Commission and the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) have joined
hands in establishing tough penalties for brokers who offer
stock-broking commission discounts to clients, the Bangkok Post
newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the SET's efforts to provide greater
transparency and fair competition.
</P>
<P>
Rewards of up to 50 million baht (1.25 million U.S. dollars)
will be given to anyone supplying regulators with information
about improper discounts offered by local brokers and sub-brokers.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, first-time violators will be fined 1
million baht (25,000 dollars) and forfeit 10 days' worth of
commissions to the market.
</P>
<P>
A second-time violation will get a penalty of 2 million baht
(50,000 dollars) and a forfeiture of 20 days of commissions, with
a third breach penalty of 5 million baht (125,000 dollars) and 30
days of commissions.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some brokerage firms have complained that other firms
were undercutting the minimum commission rates to attract
customers, as the fall in trading volume on the SET has sharply
reduced the earnings of local brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
Some violations include charging commissions below minimum
rates, returning some fees into separate accounts and even
providing extraneous services such as golf course memberships.
</P>
<P>
SET rules call for brokers to charge a minimum commission of
0.5 percent of the transaction for general clients and 0.3 percent
for mutual funds.

the correction of salary anomalies.

as saying the minister had instructed the airline management to
meet all the demands made by the association.

The minister had also instructed them to pay the strikers
salaries for the period of the strike, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Dry Province Keen on Developing Aquatic Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province in China's dry
northwest has begun to show an interest in developing fisheries at
a time when market demand for aquatic products is rising.
</P>
<P>
The whitebait, a fish introduced from the United States early
last year, is now doing well in Liujiaxia Reservoir on the upper
reaches of the Yellow River and has yielded more than two tons.
</P>
<P>
Gansu, located in inland plateaus, has only a two-decade
history of fisheries. However, it has great potential in
developing the sector because of the 913-kilometer part of the
Yellow River running through the province, 450 other rivers and
lakes and 340 reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
It began with special and rare species of fish, and imported
whitebait as part of the effort.
</P>
<P>
Now, the province provide more than half the national total of
rainbow trout with related processed products selling well abroad.
</P>
<P>
Soft-shelled turtle is another example. Lingtai and two other
counties in the province's southern and eastern mountainous areas
are raising turtles as a local pillar industry to help farmers
rise from poverty.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Bank Unveils Capital Increase Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest
commercial bank, announced its capital increase plan, under which
some 400 million new shares will be issued to international
investors, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank was the last to announce its capital increase plan,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Local banks have been under heavy pressure to raise capital to
cope with rising bad debts and stiffer loan classification and
provisioning rules due to be announced later this month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the second largest commercial bank, Thai
Farmers Bank, said it would issue 376 million new shares in an
international offering.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that recapitalizing the banking sector over
the next several years could cost as much as 500 billion baht
(12.5 billion U.S. dollars), or up to 10 percent of the country's
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank Executive Chairman Chatri Sophonpanich said the
new shares would mostly be sold to foreign investors by Morgan
Stanley with a roadshow due to start in April.
</P>
<P>
Currently, foreign shareholding is 25 percent and if the new
offering is sold out entirely to foreigners, such shareholding
will rise to 46 percent in the bank.
</P>
<P>
Amid the liquidity crunch in the domestic economy and rising
non-performing loans, Thai commercial banks cannot get
recapitalization without foreign investors' participation.
</P>
<P>
Though the bank revealed no details about the pricing of the
new shares, Chatri said he did not believe the new shares would be
sold below current market prices, noting that the book value as of
the end of 1997 is 113 baht (2.8 dollars) per share.
</P>
<P>
Shares of Bangkok Bank were suspended Thursday afternoon before
an official announcement of the capital increase. At the time they
were 91 baht (2.3 dollars) a share.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it is too early to say whether the capital
increase would be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
They said the bank needs to boost capital funds by about 50
billion baht (1.25 billion dollars) to cover non-performing loans,
which will further rise after the Bank of Thailand tightens the
classification rule to three months of unpaid interest from six
months at present.
</P>
<P>
Under a three-month standard, non-performing loans at the
Bangkok Bank would exceed 28 percent of all loans.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, the bank had assets worth 1.41 trillion
baht (35.3 billion dollars), loans of 1.08 trillion baht (27
billion dollars) and deposits of 952.1 billion baht (23.8 billion
dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott said Thursday his country supported Romania in its
bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The U.S also hoped to further strengthen its strategic
partnership with Romania, Talbott said in a report on the new

Bucharest University.
</P>
<P>
The United States was grateful to Romania for its stance on
Bosnia, Somalia and the recent Gulf crisis, Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
Since the prosperity of the United States depended on stability
and security in Europe, the U.S. would support Romania's attempt
to gain the status its deserves in Europe and NATO, which would
always open its door to Romania, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talbott expressed the same stance towards Romania in his talks
with Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea had
talks with Talbott, in which they explored the potential for
advancing bilateral economic cooperation within the framework of a
strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Talbott's two-day visit to Romania was the last leg of a Balkan

<HEADLINE> Philippines Tightens Supervision of Banking Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has decided to take a stronger hand in supervising and
monitoring the financial condition of the banking industry
starting with the third quarter of this year, the newspaper the
Business Daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Reyes, central bank deputy governor for banking
services and supervision, was quoted as saying Thursday that
publicly-listed banks would be obliged to disclose their balance
sheets quarterly starting December.
</P>
<P>
By September, banks will be required to "mark to market" their
securities holdings traded on the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
Marking to market means determining the market value of
investments after taking note of their acquisition cost. This
procedure indicates whether a bank or an investor has been able to
profit from an investment over a certain period.
</P>
<P>
According to Reyes, unlisted banks will also be required to
make disclosure of their balance sheets gradually.
</P>
<P>
Banks' balance sheets cover all non-performing loans,
classified assets and other risk assets, as well as general and
specific reserves to comply with mandated loan loss requirements.
</P>
<P>
Marking to market, meanwhile, includes trading accounts, equity
position and securities.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said a circular on these new provisions will be issued
next week.
</P>
<P>
For the past weeks, the central bank has been issuing a series
of directives aimed at enabling the banking industry to cross the
rough patch caused by the lingering economic crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
These measures include changing the banks' reserve composition
on bank deposits and raising the minimum capitalization requisite
for all types of banks.

<HEADLINE> 200 Sri Lankan Students Suffer Water Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 students of a
school at Moratuwa in the suburbs of Colombo suffered poisoning
Thursday after drinking water from a tap in the school premises
and another on the roadside, the newspaper The Island reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 65 of the students had to be hospitalized at the Panadura
Base hospital while 150 others were provided Out-Patients
Department treatment and sent home.
</P>
<P>
Although none of the students were considered to be in critical
condition doctors were monitoring their condition. According to
doctors, the symptoms were vomiting and severe stomachache.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted school sources as saying the students had
fallen ill after drinking pipe-borne water both from the school
premises and from a roadside tap.
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources told the paper that only the students had been
affected and no one else had come to the hospital for treatment.
They suspected that the students had suffered water poisoning.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year Arrangement for Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced on Thursday its approval of a three-year
financing arrangement for Nicaragua for the equivalent of 136
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The financing, under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF), is being provided in support of Nicaragua's
economic program for 1998-2000.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of Nicaragua's strategy for 1998-2000 are
to move the economy toward sustainability of public finances and
the external sector, carry out structural reform and promote
economic growth in a bid to alleviate poverty and reduce
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to achieve a real GDP growth of around six
percent by the end of the three-year period, and bring down the
inflation rate to about five percent.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting member
countries undertaking economic reform programs to strengthen their
balance of payments and improve their growth prospects.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslovia Opposes Internationalization of Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic reiterated Thursday that Kosovo is Serbia's internal
issue and any attempt to make it an international issue is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav state news agency, Tanjug, said Milosevic made the
remarks while meeting French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee a successful dialogue on Kosovo, the international
community should give up its practice of exerting pressure on
Yugoslavia only, Milosevic noted.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic named Yugoslav Vice-Premier Vladan Kutlesic as his
"special envoy" for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, on his part, claimed their talks with Milosevic had
"made progress" toward resolving the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
He also said the statement made by Serb President Milan
Milutinovic on Thursday gave leeway for negotiating a political
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The political negotiation on Kosovo would enable Yugoslavia to
return to the international community, the International Monetary
Fund and other world political and financial institutions, and
lead to a re-arrangement of its foreign debts as well, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine stressed that as the first step to ease the tension in
Kosovo, Serb authorities should fully pull back police forces sent
to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine and his German counterpart were in Belgrade on a
one-day visit to press the Yugoslav authorities to negotiate with
the ethnic Albanians of strife-torn Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic Thursday called on the ethnic Albanian leaders in the
Serb province of Kosovo to open an unconditional dialogue with the
government without delay.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug quoted Milutinovic as saying
that the dialogue should be based on the principle of safeguarding
Serbian territorial integrity and include the question of Kosovo's
self-administration within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The president voiced his willingness to cooperate with the
U.N. Security Council while calling for the immediate
implementation of an agreement on education normalization in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the accord would be helpful to the
settlement of other issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine all voiced
their support for Milutinovic's statement, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians, forming 90 percent of the population in
Kosovo, have repeatedly rejected Serbian government invitations
for talks.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been high in Kosovo since February 28 when
Serbian police swept through region in a crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists.

<HEADLINE> China Sets up Network to Monitor Price Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China has been making efforts
to set up a nationwide computer network to monitor price
information in a bid to adapt to rapid developments in the market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Such a network is taking shape, and has begun to provide
services for the government's decision-making on macro-economic
control and for production and management of enterprises, said
Zeng Anping, director of China National Price Information Center,
at an ongoing meeting held here.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the State Planning Commission introduced a reporting
system on national price information, and a related computer
software network soon was developed. After pilot work, a national
price information monitoring system went into effect in October.
</P>
<P>
Now, the network has linked 31 provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities; 36 major cities; and 134 prefectures and
counties. The network keeps track of more than 500 kinds of
commodities and fee items ranging from the prices of agricultural
products, industrial consumer goods, and the means of industrial
and agricultural production to administrative fees and management
charges.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of local networks is also on the rise. The
Beijing Price Information Center, for example, focused on
developing a practical database, and in 1997 provided more than
10,000 pieces of price information for policy makers.

<HEADLINE> Finland-Aided Centers to Test for Newborn Baby Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Finland-aided centers to test
for newborn baby diseases have opened in Hunan, Henan and Jiangxi
provinces and the cities of Shanghai and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Health said the centers, first
of a kind in China that receive blood tests of newborn babies, are
being established to control genetotrophic and congenital
secretory diseases.
</P>
<P>
Wallac Corp from Finland provides the facilities for the
centers, and offers technical training for Chinese doctors. The
cooperative project will last three years.
</P>
<P>
The congenital diseases of newborn babies are mainly abnormal
functioning of thyroid and phenylketonuria (PKU) which hinder the
development of babies' intelligence.
</P>
<P>
During the trial period, the Hunan center has performed blood
tests for more than 7,000 newborn babies, three cases of PKU were
discovered. After a period of treatment, the three children are
doing well.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health official said China will gradually
establish centers in other provinces and municipalities.

URUMQI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 6.0 on the
Richter scale hit Artux, a city in Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous
Prefecture in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, at 21:51
(Beijing Time) Thursday, according to the State Seismological
Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
Seismologists pinpointed the epicenter of the quake at 40.2
degrees north latitude and 76.8 degrees east longitude, an area
some 100 km northeast of Artux.
</P>
<P>
No casualties have been reported as a result of the quake which
destroyed a number of houses in pasturelands near Artux.
</P>
<P>
An SSB official noted that seismologists attending a national
conference held earlier this year predicted an earthquake
would occur in the quake belt located in the southern section of
the Tianshan Mountain Range, which includes the area hit by the
said quake.
</P>
<P>
The Kirgiz Prefecture Seismological Bureau immediately
dispatched a disaster relief team to the area to coordinate rescue
and relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Seismological Bureau also sent a team to the area
to conduct investigation and assist with supervision of relief
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Increasing Industrialization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwestern China is changing the pace of industrialization as
reforms and opening up increase.
</P>
<P>
The industrial and tertiary sectors accounted for 58 percent of
the autonomous region's GDP last year, up 10 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Both industry and the tertiary sector are growing at a faster
rate than agriculture and animal husbandry, meaning that Tibet is
changing into an industrial society, according to a senior
official.
</P>
<P>
Up through the 1980s, agriculture and animal husbandry still
occupied a dominant position in Tibet's economy, and, as a result,
most machinery and consumer goods had to be transported into the
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
But, because of the reforms, especially over the past five
years, Tibet has seen great changes in its industrial sector, and
now even has a dozen of its own brand-name industrial products.

<HEADLINE> Some 7,000 Students Attend Private Schools in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian parents are paying up to
2,500 U.S. dollars a year to send their children to a growing
number of private schools.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 children or 2 percent of all students attend
private schools, the Bulgarian Association of Private Schools
announced on Tuesday at the 1998 Private School Show in Sofia.
</P>
<P>
Association Chairman Milka Slavcheva said that so far the
Ministry of Education and Science has issued 75 licenses for
private schools, but only 70 are operational.
</P>
<P>
Private schools give priority to teaching foreign languages and
computer skills to small groups of children, she said.
</P>
<P>
Almost all private schools offer students transportation,
security, medical services, sports and recreation activities.
</P>
<P>
Annual fees charged in private schools range from 550 to 2,500
U.S. dollars. The most expensive among private primary schools are
those which offer training through the whole day. They charge from
1,200 to 1,500 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The number of students attending private schools has been
constantly dropping, Slavcheva said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Ministry of Education and Science expects
about 10 new private schools will open this year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, King Hussein Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
held private talks on Thursday with visiting King Hussein of
Jordan to seek ways to break the stalemate in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry described the talks as "a
conversation that the president is going to want to keep mostly
private".
</P>
<P>
The private nature of the meeting was underscored by the fact
that reporters were not permitted as usual to attend the beginning
of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
McCurry disclosed that Clinton was making "another difficult
and complex peace negotiation effort" to revive the Middle East
peace process, which has been suspended for a year.
</P>
<P>
He said the president wanted to tap into his knowledge and "get
his personal assessment of what the parties can do at this point".
</P>
<P>
When King Hussein emerged from the White House after his
45-minute talks in the Oval Office, he declined to answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
According to a White House official, King Hussein and President
Clinton also discussed the Iraqi issue, and the king urged Clinton
to open a direct dialogue with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton refused, saying it was a U.N. matter and not for
the U.S. to engage in, the official said.

<HEADLINE> One-Fifth U.S. Middle Schools Reports Serious Crimes: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- One in five U.S. middle and
high schools reported at least one serious crime such as rape or
robbery last year, a national survey reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by National Center for Education and
Statistics under the Department of Education, found that public
schools experienced more than 11,000 fights in which weapons were
used, 7,000 robberies and 4,000 rapes and other sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of schools reported at least one serious violent
crime during the last school year. In middle and high schools,
the proportion in this category rises to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also found that crime was more common at larger schools.
One-third of schools with enrolments of 1,000 or more reported at
least one serious violent crime compared to four to nine percent
of smaller schools.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, schools in cities were at least twice as likely to
report serious violent crime as those in towns and in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was troubled over the
safety of school children.
</P>
<P>
"The threat of such violence hangs over children's heads and
closes their minds to learning. We cannot let violence, guns and
drugs stand between our children and the education they need," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The president announced on Thursday 17.5 million U.S. dollars
in new financing for school safety projects. The money will pay
for anti-crime partnerships among law enforcement agencies,
schools and community groups.
</P>
<P>
In response to the survey results, Senator Jeff Sessions,
chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Youth Violence, supported
Clinton's call and recommended more actions taken to deal with the
problems.
</P>
<P>
"Juvenile justice officials and schools must form partnerships
to remove young criminals from classrooms and make them safer
places for learning," Sessions said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Implement New Bank Reserve Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Lending rates in the Philippines
are expected to fall further next week after the central bank
implements a change in the composition of the reserve requirement
on bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
Starting Friday, the statutory reserve requirement imposed on
bank deposits will drop from 13 percent to 10 percent while
liquidity reserves will be increased from 4 percent to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the new reserve formula is 11 days ahead
of the original March 31 schedule.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said earlier that bank
lending rates are set to go down by one percentage point on March
24 as promised by the Bankers Association of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
While overall reserves will remain at 17 percent, the new
formula will reduce the cost of complying with the reserve
requirement, bankers said.
</P>
<P>
Liquidity reserves, which can be invested in government
securities, earn near-market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, statutory reserves, which are kept in banks'
vaults or deposited with the central bank, earn little or no
returns. Only a fourth of statutory reserves earn interest, which
stands at only four percent.
</P>
<P>
Prime lending rates, the rates at which banks lend to their
most creditworthy clients, have been declining since the end of
January this year.
</P>
<P>
But the lending rates were still as high as between 21 to 28
percent this month, prompting many businessmen to close down
businesses and go to streets in protest against the high rates
early this week.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that in two weeks, the central bank will consider
other measures to further reduce lending rates.

<P>
LANZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
has maintained an average 12.66 percent annual increase in GDP
over the past five years, with the volume of industrial waste
discharges rising by a mere 0.5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The province has effectively controlled environmental
deterioration and has greatly improved air conditions and water
quality in major rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
Gansu integrated environmental protection with economic and
social development plans in 1991, and at the same time assigned
governments at all levels responsibility to ecological
improvements.
</P>
<P>
The province has since allocated over 913 million yuan for 108
pollution treatment projects. In addition, governments at the
county level and above have introduced facilities to purify 76
percent of industrial wastewater and 78 percent of industrial
waste gases.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has established 34 nature reserves covering 4.83 million
ha, or 10.6 per cent of the province's total territory. Related
biodiversity projects are also operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The province has adopted some 20-odd regulations covering the
environment and resources, and has established enforcement and
inspection departments at all levels.

<P>
SOFIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) signed a memorandum on cooperation in
logistics support here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Deputy Defense Minister Roumen Kunchev and Robert
Zweerts, general manager of the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency
(NAMSA), signed the document which will enable closer cooperation
and provide the official groundwork for further talks on logistics
with NATO.
</P>
<P>
The signing was Bulgaria's first step towards its integration
into the Western European military bloc and it would serve as a
basis for drawing up and implementing concrete projects, said
Kunchev after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
It was particularly important for the Bulgarian army to achieve
inter-operability with NATO armed forces in logistics, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria had voiced strong interest, motivation and the
certainty that the cooperation outlined in the memo would be
useful both for Bulgaria and for NATO, Zweerts said.

During talks held earlier on Thursday, NAMSA officials and
representatives of the Bulgarian government agreed that
cooperation of the Bulgarian army with those of NATO member states
would begin with codifying military standards.

<HEADLINE> France, Italy to Limit Fielded Foreign Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- France and Italy will recommend the
number of foreign players that a club could field be limited to
five, sports ministers from the two countries said after meeting
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The French Youth and Sports Minister Marie-Geroge Buffet and
Italian Sports Minister Walter Veltroni noticed that there are
more Italians than Britons in some British clubs, while France is
suffering from a talent drain into Italian soccer.
</P>
<P>
If the situation continues, the two ministers said, the
national soccer will be losing foundation.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the richest clubs are benefiting from opening
of the Eurpean transfer market.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said when the soccer clubs are not subjected to
control in some countries, the European clubs are not playing on a
fair ground as far as players' transfer is concerned.
</P>
<P>
They also said the inequality is also reflected on the earnings
from television broadcasting rights, which differ greatly among
European clubs.
</P>
<P>
The television money are divided even among the French clubs
while it is not the case in many other countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
To address issues like foreign players and anti-doping
campaign, the sports ministers from 15 European Union countries
will convene before the World Cup finals in June.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chengde, home of the well-known
Qing Dynasty imperial summer resort, has adopted effective
measures which have significantly reduced air pollution levels.
</P>
<P>
The major tourism city, located some 300 km northeast of
Beijing, hosts approximately 1.5 million domestic and overseas
tourists annually. The mountainous environment combined with the
rapid rate of industrialization exacerbated the pollution problem,
and created health risks affecting both local residents and
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The city initiated its battle against smog by allocating
massive funding for the installation of centralized heating
systems serving over 2.09 million square meters. Small scale
facilities were also installed to serve an additional two million
square meters. The new systems replaced over 500 outdated heating
systems and industrial furnaces.
</P>
<P>
Related efforts have reduced emissions of waste gas by 1.2
billion cu.m. and airborne particulates by 14,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes U.S. Remarks on Kurile Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia Thursday criticized the
United States for its statement that the Kurile Islands (Chishima
Islands in Japanese) belong to Japan, saying the statement was
"not suitable and appropriate."
</P>
<P>
A senior Russian Foreign Ministry official was quoted by the
Interfax news agency as saying that Russia does not welcome any
third party expressing its attitude on the islands issue while the
present relations between Russia and Japan have moved into a very
sensitive period,
</P>
<P>
The official stressed to reporters that Russia and Japan were
now negotiating over a peace treaty, and were trying to seek
consensus over the sensitive territorial issue. So it was not very
appropriate for the third party to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.S. Ambassador to Russia James Collins
said in Russia's eastern city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk that his
country still recognized the Kurile Islands as Japanese territory.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Russia and Japan are expected to discuss the
islands issue in a commission on March 26, the official said.

MEXICO CITY, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Goal-scoring keeper Jose
Chilavert will return to his national team for a World Cup tuneup
against Colombia, coach Paulo Carpegiani said in Asuncion on

</P>
<P>
The match is scheduled on March 29 at the Yale Bowl stadium in

<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Sports Industry Co. has
finished issuance of 45 million A shares, at 5.80 yuan each, for
listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The firm, sponsored by several subsidiaries under the China
State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, is the first
sports-linked enterprise to be listed, noted today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the establishment of the company is part of the
commission's plan to transform itself into a money-spinning
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
China's sports industry is still at an embryonic stage, with a
feeble output value.
</P>
<P>
The great market potential has already lured both domestic and
foreign investors to the industry, resulting in fierce competition
in areas such as leisure sports, sports contests and sports
merchandising.
</P>
<P>
According to the company's prospectus, proceeds of the issue,
at 250 million yuan, will be used to build sports facilities in
major Chinese cities such as Xi'an, Chongqing, Wuhan, Taiyuan,
Guilin and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The company posted net profits of 39 million yuan in 1997 and
its 1998 profits is expected to reach 48 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Remove Foreign Exchange Volatility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of the
Philippines (BAP) will remove the trading volatility band for the
Philippine peso on March 23 considering the stability of the local
currency in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published Friday, BAP President Deogracias
Vistan said the BAP has decided to lift the volatility band
effective from the start of trading next Monday in view of the
relative stability that has prevailed in the dollar-peso market.
</P>
<P>
Vistan said the decision was made after consultations with
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson.
</P>
<P>
The BAP, which groups commercial banks in the country, operates
the Philippine Dealing System, the country's electronic currency
market.
</P>
<P>
The BAP imposed the volatility band in October last year to
prevent a wild fluctuation of the peso after the currency was
effectively devalued in July.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the BAP widened the band to six percent from
four percent of a reference exchange rate. If the overall band is
breached, trading is suspended.
</P>
<P>
The removal of the volatility band was a commitment made by the
central bank under a proposed precautionary arrangement with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which will be approved by the
IMF in late March.
</P>
<P>
The peso has not breached the band since mid-February.

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal Reforms to Face 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Panama Canal is
undergoing a series of structural reforms in order to face the
challenges of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Canal Commission Transition Official Jaime Bocanegra said
Thursday that the reforms will be completed by 2002 and draw an
investment of more than one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The plan includes the widening of the Gaillard Cut, the
acquisition of modern tug boats, the modernization of the
floodgates control systems, and updating the system of programming
the control of traffic of ships," said Bocanegra.
</P>
<P>
He said with these works done, the Panama Canal will be able to
satisfy the demand of the world maritime trade well into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
"The Canal Commission, the Panamanian government, and the
United States government are working in perfect harmony in this
task," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the waterway is also being prepared for the
administrative transfer from the United States to the Panamanian
sovereignty scheduled on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the interoceanic waterway started on September
7, 1977, when Panama and the United States signed the
Torrijos-Carter Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Bocanegra said policies have been carried out to assure the
growing participation of Panamanians in all the levels of
employment since the signing of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
He praised the high quality of the Canal personnel, of which 92
percent are Panamanians, and stressed Panama is prepared to assume
the historical responsibility at the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Fisheries Experts Propagate Whitebait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Fisheries experts in east China's
Jiangsu Province have succeeded in artificially propagating
whitebait in Taihu Lake.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of artificially bred 500,000 fry have been
introduced to the lake.
</P>
<P>
Whitebait, a delicious small delicate fish, is highly popular
on both domestic and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
However, overfishing and environmental deterioration over the
past several years have combined to seriously deplete whitebait
resources.
</P>
<P>
A mere 2,000 tons of whitebait was harvested from Taihu Lake
during 1997, a substantial drop on the record catch of 17,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Local officials note that the success of the artificial
breeding program will help prevent a further decline in whithebait
resources and in turn promote the local economy.

<P>
PARIS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Athletes were offered voluntary
blood testing in the Golden League Series of track meets to help
fight the use of Human Growth Hormones, the athletics' world
governing body IAAF said in Morocco on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF Medical Commission has proposed to the Golden League
organizers for anonymous blood samples, spokesman Giorgio Reineri
said.
</P>
<P>
"Athletes would be able to consent or not. The samples would be
anonymous," Reineri said. "It's not a doping test and we wouldn't
want to know if they were positive or not."
</P>
<P>
HGH, which occurs normally in the body, is undetectable through
the present system of urine testing.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, known as GH-2000, is backed by the International
Olympic Committee is aimed to clamp down on HGH use prior to the
2000 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The idea of blood tests is a touchy issue, particularly in
Islamic countries where the practice is opposed on religious
grounds.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Latin American Economic
System (SELA) released a report Thursday saying that the Asian
financial crisis has negative effects on the Latin American
economy.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the crisis, Latin American trade with Southeast
Asia will shrink, direct and indirect Asian investments will drop,
and Latin American access to European financing will become
difficult, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But it added that the effects of the crisis should not be seen
as completely unavoidable in the region, since several nations
have adopted fiscal, monetary, and immediate commercial measures
to face it.
</P>
<P>
The Asian crisis will be felt with more intensity in Argentine,
Brazil and Peru, while Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela show
less vulnerability, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 17-page SELA report was prepared by two Latin American
researchers from French universities. The document examines the
long and short-term repercussions of the Asian turbulence on Latin
America, and was distributed to the 27 member states of SELA.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drug Agency Man Guilty of Embezzlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A telecommunications
specialist with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) pleaded
guilty Thursday to embezzlement which netted him and a confederate
nearly 500,000 U.S. dollars worth of electronic equipment, the
Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
Michael D. Hendrix, 53, pleaded guilty to one count of
embezzlement as part of a plea bargain in which he agreed to
cooperate in the continuing investigation of a confederate who was
not identified by name.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1997, Hendrix allegedly conspired with the
confederate to submit 37 DEA purchase orders to outside companies
for television sets, video cassette recorders, videotapes, audio
tapes, laser discs, laser disc players, audio equipment, speakers,
computers and printers, according to government court documents.
</P>
<P>
Hendrix and his alleged co-conspirator retained these
appliances for their own use or sold them to the general public,
the documents said.
</P>
<P>
Suspended with pay since December 1997, Hendrix resigned from
DEA Thursday as part of the plea agreement. He had worked at DEA
headquarters for the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
To give prosecutors time to evaluate Hendrix's cooperation,
United States District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema set sentencing for
May 29. The maximum penalty is five years in prison and a 250,000
dollar fine.

<P>
LANZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Lanzhou Customs department in
northwest China's Gansu Province has taken on the new and
important task of constantly informing local enterprises of the
latest national tax and industrial policies.
</P>
<P>
The customs office is in charge of inspection and taxation on
imported and exported goods in Gansu and Qinghai
provinces. Officials from the office investigated more than 30
medium- and large-size enterprises in 1997, with the aim of
helping them solve problems.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, the office collected 114 million yuan in
taxes and dealt with 11 smuggling cases with a value of 204
million yuan. Making full use of local natural and technological
resources, the provincial government should encourage the
development of the import and export of nonferrous metals, said
Ren Liujiu, director of the Lanzhou Customs office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province should give more attention to
technology and more rights to some trade enterprises to export
goods by themselves, he said.

<HEADLINE> Healthful Spring Discovered in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A spring, which contains 49
mineral elements favorable to health, has been discovered inside
the mountains near Benxi, a city in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jinghua, a local farmer who suffered from gastroenteritis
and neurosis for many years, has recovered from his illnesses
after drinking water from the spring for two months.
</P>
<P>
Many strange phenomena about the spring have been reported:
</P>
<P>
-- The amount of water flow coming out of the spring remains
the same under any climate conditions;
</P>
<P>
-- During summer, sounds of water flowing under ground can be
heard when people crawl on the ground;
</P>
<P>
-- And snakes usually come out to drink spring water when the
weather is still cold in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts confirm that the spring is formed through
complicated geological and physical actions, and provides a
low-sodium, non-polluted water source in the depths of rocks.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Agrees to Prepare Lists of Items for Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) have agreed to
prepare lists of those items for free trade within the region.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers of the seven SAARC countries -- Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, the Maldives and Pakistan -- will
meet on April 29 to consolidate these lists as part of their
efforts to meet the intra-region free trade target by 2001
required under the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement.
</P>
<P>
"SAARC countries have to speed up their efforts to meet the
target of South Asian Free Trade Area set for the year 2001,"
Kantikumar R. Podar, president of the SAARC Chambers of Commerce
and Industry (SCCI), told the media here Thursday after the
concluding session of the second SAARC Economic Cooperation
Conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ten trade sectors discussed in the two-day
conference by respective committees included investment, energy,
telecommunication, tourism, science and technology, human resource
development, information technology, social dimensions of business
and women entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Chairpersons of the ten committees will finalize their reports
on the discussions in the conference and present them before the
trade ministers' meeting of the SAARC countries in April, Podar
said.
</P>
<P>
He said if the member countries could agree on the basic
minimum 300 items for free trade in April, it would amount to
trade liberalization by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Under the WTO agreement we have to liberalize whole of our
trade, but we do not want to hurt our local businessmen," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out there were various "practical problems"
including those of infrastructure in the region and unofficial
trade was costing much for the member countries.
</P>
<P>
He accused western countries of making the region a dumping
ground for their products and called for "anti-dumping measures
for short period".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Podar said the conference has also decided to hold a
trade conference of sixteen countries belonging to SAARC and the
Economic Cooperation Organization in April in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The two-day second SAARC Economic Cooperation Conference began
here Wednesday. The conference, organized by the SCCI, attracted
more than 100 delegates from the seven member countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the delegates held working sessions and
seminars on matters concerning regional trade, investment and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of its kind was held in India in November,
1996.

<HEADLINE> Beckenbauer Worries About German World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Franz Beckenbauer expressed his
"great doubts" on Thursday about the chance for Germany to win the
hosting right for the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, Germany's "ambassador" for its bidding campaign,
said he feared the rival bids from England and Germany would ruin
both countries' chances.
</P>
<P>
A socio-economic study estimated that hosting the World Cup
would be worth five billion marks (2.75 billion U.S. dollars) to
the German economy in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, the former World Cup-winning coach and captain,
said the 2006 tournament would be a great chance to modernise
German stadiums, which had fallen behind standards in other
European countries.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's 24-member executive committee will decide in the year
2000 who will host the tournament. Germany, England and South
Africa have already launched bids and several other countries are
also considering an application.

ISLAMABAD, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two people including
crew aboard a Boeing jet operated by Afghanistan's national
airline Ariana are reported to have been killed when the plane
crashed south of the Afghan capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The jet had gone missing southwest of Kabul and is believed to

The reports quoted Ariana employees and air traffic control
staff at Kabul airport as saying earlier that the ill-fated jet
was on the final leg of a return flight from Dubai and had been
out of contact for more than five hours.

The aircraft had landed around mid day Thursday in the
southwestern Afghan city of Kandahar because of a technical
problem on the flight from Dubai. Most of the passengers got off
the plane in Kandahar airport.
</P>
<P>
After repairs the jet resumed its flight to Kabul. The reports
quoted Ariana airline officials as saying that the plane got lost
in bad weather before running out of fuel and finally crashed near

MADRID, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov
said Thursday that he would return home for CSKA Sofia to prepare
for the World Cup finals in France this summer.
</P>
<P>
Stoichkov, 32, revealed his intention at a farewell lunch party
with his former Barcelona teammates.
</P>
<P>
Stoichkov, the European Footballer of the Year in 1994, ended
his contract with Barcelona last week after he was dumped time and
again by Dutch coach Louis van Gaal.
</P>
<P>
Except an interim period with Parma in 1995-96, Stoichkov had
spent seven years at Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Stoichkov expressed his favor to join Compostela where
fellow Bulgarian Lyuboslav Penev led the attack. However Spanish
league rules prohibit players switching clubs after the transfer
market closes in January.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Stoichkov paced Bulgaria to beat Germany for the World
Cup semifinals.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Washington lawyer Carol Elder
Bruce will investigate charges that Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt allowed campaign fundraising to influence his decision on
a casino license for a Wisconsin Indian tribe.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Justice Department, a three-judge panel
Thursday named Bruce, a former assistant federal attorney,
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
Republicans accuse Babbitt of lying to Congress during last
year's campaign finance hearings.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno has asked the independent counsel
to examine Babbitt's testimony, in which he denied that the White
House leaned on him to deprive the Indian tribe of a gambling
license in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The administration allegedly wanted to reward a rival tribe in
nearby Minnesota, which had donated almost 300,000 U.S. dollars to
the Democratic Party, with the license.
</P>
<P>
Babbitt maintains that a non-political civil servant decided
which tribe would receive the license. He has pledged full
cooperation with Bruce, saying he is confident her investigation
will vindicate him.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have been pushing for the appointment of an
independent counsel since November 13, when they wrote to
Reno.

<HEADLINE> Blair Criticised over Formula One Outing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- British prime minister Tony Blair
was criticised on Thursday for failing to register a free trip to
the British Formula One Grand Prix in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee,
responding to a complaint from a Conservative MP, ruled that Blair
should have registered the outing to the Silverstone circuit in
July 1996 in the register of members' interests.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the prime minister accepts the decision," Blair's
spokesman told reporters. "We accept that the visit should have
been registered."
</P>
<P>
Blair, being a leader of the opposition party, went to the
Grand Prix with his wife and children at the invitation of
Federation International de l'Automobile (FIA) president Max
Mosley. But he left after the start of the race and did not
declare the hospitality -- which would have cost him 300 pounds a
head had he paid for it.
</P>
<P>
The committee said it backed the view of parliament's standards
watchdog Sir Gordon Downey, who investigated the complaint against
Blair, that the visit should have been registered.
</P>
<P>
A committee report said the trip would be included in the next
register.

have formed a partnership to assess the feasibility of a worldwide
satellite surveillance and reconnaissance system to let field
soldiers to get information directly rather than depend on
intelligence agencies, the Defense News weekly said.
</P>
<P>
With the system, soldiers would be able to direct the
satellites to take radar images of a specific area of interest and
retrieve the resulting information within 15 minutes, David
Whelon, tactical technology director for the Pentagon's Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Whelon said the radar satellite would work in concert with
other detection systems, such as missile-warning satellites, to
help find mobile launching platforms.
</P>
<P>
It would be directed almost immediately after a missile attack
is detected to scan probable launch sites for mobile launch
platforms heading back to their hiding places, Whelon added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to battlefield surveillance, the radar systems
could gather intelligence for the nation's secretive agency, the
National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).
</P>
<P>
This would overcome the difficulties that field commanders face
in getting timely information they need.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is taking initial steps toward design and
development of the system with a 592 million U.S. dollars
technology demonstration project called Discover, the Defense News
said in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The DARPA, NRO and the U.S. Air Force formed the partnership on
February 26 to carry out a two-satellite Discover flight
demonstration effort. The satellite will be launched in 2003, the
weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The three agencies will fund 600 million dollars through 2004
on the Discover. Pentagon planners will determine after 2005 how, or
whether, to proceed with the constellation to consist of 24 to 48
radar-equipped satellites.

<HEADLINE> EU Criticizes U.S. Internet Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
formally criticized a U.S. green paper for reforming the
Internet's address system, saying it would give the U.S. too much
control over the global computer network.
</P>
<P>
The text, drawn up on behalf of the European Commission and its
15 member states, will be submitted to Washington in the few days
to come, EU officials said Thursday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner Martin Bangemann and British junior industry
minister Barbara Roche accuse the U.S. in the text of failing to
"recognize the need to implement an international approach."
</P>
<P>
The Commission, the EU's executive body, last month drew up an
identical draft which it later on forwarded to EU governments for
approval, according to the EU officials.
</P>
<P>
The EU expresses concern in the text over the possibility that
the internet reform plan would consolidate the jurisdiction of
Americans over the Internet, including trademark disputes
involving address names.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the U.S. is going to phase out the government's
management of the address system for Internet locations such as
World Wide Web and electronic mail sites.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for an end to the monopoly of U.S.-based
Network Solutions Inc, which registers all name addresses ending
in ".com," ".org" and ".net."
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. proposal, up to five new "top-level domains,"
each with a registry to manage the address database, will be
created to supplement the above three.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. proposals "appear not to go far enough to
ensure a level playing field and fair competition," the EU said in
the text.
</P>
<P>
The EU accuses the green paper of failing to mention a
competing plan for managing Internet domain names drawn up by a
global coalition of companies and organizations, which has already
set up a Council of Registrars (CORE) in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The EU and its member states consider that "an additional
effort is called for to reach a balance of interests and
responsibilities, so that the international character of the
Internet is recognized," says the text.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Announce Changes in Cuba Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
preparing to announce changes on Friday in its policies toward
Cuba, U.S. officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be made following broad-ranging consultations
aimed at finding ways in which the U.S. can assist the Cuban
people without re-energizing the (Cuban) government, a U.S.
official said.
</P>
<P>
The administration planned to allow direct flights to resume
between the United States and Cuba and also to permit direct
remittances between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. officials said key elements of U.S. policy toward
Cuba, including an economic embargo and the Helms-Burton law that
seeks to discourage foreign investment on the island, would remain
in force.
</P>
<P>
"There have been a number of recommendations from the secretary
(of state) and a number of ideas considered here at the White
House... and there will be several things that I think the
president will address tomorrow," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman added,"All the central, basic elements of our
policy are going to remain in place."

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Accused of Weakening World Trade Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A European importers' group
Thursday accused the European Union (EU) and the United States of
threatening to weaken the world trade order by a planned trade
pact between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, last week
adopted a plan for talks with the U.S. on a so-called New
Transatlantic Marketplace, which is aimed at cutting remaining
trade barriers between the two giant trading powers.
</P>
<P>
However, Paris has cast doubt on the proposal, indicating that
it won't easily get approval the Commission needs from the 15 EU
member states.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Trade Association (FTA), representing European
importers of consumer goods, said the Commission proposal risked
causing "a massive weakening of the multilateral trade order."
</P>
<P>
The FTA believes that the Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) will lose much of its authority if the lion's share of
global trade is handled in regional groupings.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would make developing countries think that "the
big world trading powers settle important questions among
themselves and ...wish to impose the outcome on the other WTO
contracting parties," the FTA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Sir Leon Brittan, Commission vice-president in charge
of external trade, told Harvard University of the U.S. Wednesday
that the trade pact plan was "carefully designed to be entirely
compatible with all multilateral commitments."
</P>
<P>
He said in a speech delivered at Harvard that the proposed
agreement was designed to bring major economic benefits to
business and consumers in the EU and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The FTA, which did not seem to be convinced by what Brittan
said at Harvard, urged the EU executive to stop announcing
"several visions at one time which invalidate each other."
</P>
<P>
The European Commission calls for the widespread removal of
technical barriers to trade in goods, a free-trade area in
services and further liberalization in government procurement,
intellectual property and investment.
</P>
<P>
It also appeals to both the EU and the U.S. to be politically
committed to the elimination of all industrial tariffs by 2010 if
a vast majority of other trading partners agrees to do the same.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pays $51.7 Million to United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
paid 51.7 million U.S. dollars as part of its 1.3 billion arrears
to the United Nations, UN Spokesman Juan Brandit Carlos announced
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move is widely seen as the direct result of UN
Secretary-General kofi Annan's latest visit to Washington, which
was mainly aimed at advising the Government of the United States
to pay its 1.3 billion U.S. dollars arrears to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief on February 12 warned that if the United States
does not pay 0.6 billion out of its 1.3 billion arrears to the
United Nations within this year, it will lose its vote power at
the General Assembly starting in January 1999,
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations last
week told reporters that the arrears have undermined the influence
and prestige of the United States among the member states, which
is not in the interest of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader: Cyprus Peace Talks Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash said on Thursday that the negotiations for a peaceful
settlement between the two communities of Cyprus are off.
</P>
<P>
He laid blame on Greek Cypriots and the European Union (EU),
which are scheduled to embark on discussions soon on Cyprus' entry
into the European body.
</P>
<P>
Denktash made the assertion after meeting United Nations
Secretary General's Special Advisor for Cyprus Diego Cordovez in
the Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Denktash walked out of his talks with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides last year after the EU decided to begin accession
negotiations with Cyprus, and has so far refused to return to the
negotiating table or meet EU officials.
</P>
<P>
"The way and means of finding common ground is far us to meet
as two absolutely equal parties to see what we can do," Denktash
told reporters. In so saying, he was demanding the automatic
recognition of his "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", now
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 the
breakaway state against the internationally recognized Republic of
Cyprus dominated by the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by Greek supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
On U.N.'s future efforts to advance the Cyprus peace process,
Denktash said that he wants a solution to the Cyprus problem and
the U.N. Secretary General to continue with his good offices.
</P>
<P>
He stopped short of spelling out what the Turkish Cypriots
would do if the U.N. Security Council calls for a resumption of
the bi-communal talks.
</P>
<P>
"When things happen we will decide," he said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Cordovez said he met with Denktash in a bid to
have a better understanding of his positions.
</P>
<P>
"I will discuss now with Mr. Clerides and will prepare my
report to the (U.N.) secretary general," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy is expected to meet with Cypriot president on
Friday before continuing his trip to Greece and Turkey, the two
major players of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He is on a six-day visit to the Mediterranean island in an
attempt to draw close the two communities.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and some countries have been making efforts
to help reunify Cyprus through a "bi-zonal and bi-communal"
formula. But no tangible results have so far been achieved.

<HEADLINE> European Court Rules Out UK Ban on Calf Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- European Court of Justice
Thursday said that Britain could not ban exports of live calves to
other European Union (EU) countries that rear the animals in
restrictive wooden crates.
</P>
<P>
"A member state may not unilaterally prohibit the export of
cattle to other member states whose farming systems comply with
minimum standards for calves," said the EU's highest court in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The case was first brought by animal welfare groups in Britain
in 1994, before the European Commission, the EU's executive body,
imposed a ban on British beef exports over the mad cow disease
scare.
</P>
<P>
"One regrets the verdict of the court, which has once again
underlined the fact that animal welfare is still subservient to
the requirement of free trade, regardless of whether animals are
suffering as a result," said David Wilkins, director of the
Brussels-based Eurogroup for Animal Welfare.
</P>
<P>
The British High Court asked the European Court at the end of
1995 to decide whether exports of live calves from Britain could
be banned based on issues of public morality and animal welfare.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based European Court said a member state may not
restrict exports to other EU countries on those grounds if the EU
has already adopted legislation on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Britain itself banned veal crate farming in 1990, but the
animal welfare group Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) sought to
stop exports to other EU countries which continued the practice.
</P>
<P>
The EU has agreed to phase out by 2006 the practice of veal
crate farming, which produces the pale-colored meat popular in
continental Europe.

LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- All the three major stock markets
in Europe surged ahead and ended firmer Thursday, with London and
Paris both hitting new record closing highs, boosted by benign
economic situation and large sums of investment funds.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares gained 94.3 points
or 1.60 percent by the close of the session to end at 5,997.9, its
third consecutive record close, lifted by the prospect of interest
rates peaking in the near-term and by investment funds desperately
buying stocks before the tax year end at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that a last minute squeeze saw the FTSE fall just
short of the 6,000 level.
</P>
<P>
They said that futures strength had underpinned cash stocks
throughout the session. There was still plenty of cash coming into
the market.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt closed modestly higher after trading
in a very tight range throughout the session, with the DAX-30
index 16.60 points or 0.34 percent up at 4,936.32.
</P>
<P>
The Paris CAC-40 index stormed to a fresh closing high, up
36.16 points or 0.99 percent at 3,688.68, after a mixed morning,
with money coming out of a falling France Telecom being pumped
back into other big market caps, traders said.

<HEADLINE> Air Mix Enhances Cancer Drugs: Discovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A mixture of oxygen and carbon
dioxide can help cancer drugs get into tumors which they normally
cannot reach, British researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The cocktail, known as carbogen, can double the amount of drug
which gets into a tumor and keep the drug active for half as long
again, Professor John Griffiths, who lead the research team at St
George's Hospital Medical School in London, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Researchers tested the cocktail with the drug 5-fluorouracil to
see how it worked on colon and breast cancers.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that after making the patients breathing 95
percent oxygen and 5 percent carbon dioxide, twice as much of the
drug gets into the tumors because the carbogen increased the
volume of the blood vessels by causing them to dilate.
</P>
<P>
The tumors then eliminated the drug more slowly than normal,
increasing the time it is effective. Cancer cells took a third
longer than normal to grow back after treatment stopped.

<HEADLINE> UK Minister Dismisses Claims Farmers Burying Cows Massively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- British Agriculture Minister Jack
Cunningham on Thursday dismissed charges that farmers buried the
cattle suspected of having mad cow disease "on a massive scale".
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to believe that given the situation in UK
farming today that farmers would voluntarily forgo (such
payments)," he told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government made compensation of close to 500 pounds (830
U.S. dollars) a cow for cattle getting the Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE or madcow disease).
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a scientist Richard Lacey told an inquiry
into the disease that he had been approached by meat renderers who
complained about farmers' actions.
</P>
<P>
"The animals are being buried on a massive scale in farm graves
-- they produced video and photographic evidence of this," Lacey
said.
</P>
<P>
But Cunningham retorted that the UK Renderers Association had
told him that none of its representatives "has ever met or
discussed any issue with Professor Lacey at all".

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Fresh Row Emerges Between Nigeria, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The faceoff between Nigeria and
Liberia which has been under water for some time seems to surface
as a Nigerian general has risen to condemn the Liberian police's
brutal treatment of his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Major General Timothy Shelpidi on Thursday described
the recent harassment and detention of three Nigerian journalists
by Liberian police in Monrovia as an orchestrated attempt to
humiliate the people and government of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A contingent of heavily armed Liberian national police last
Saturday stormed a hotel in Monrovia and arrested three Nigerian
journalists and the acting director of defense information Col.
Godwin Ugbo and some officials of the Nigerian government
some of whom were suspected of carrying drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians at that time were on their way back from a
ceremony marking the restoration of Sierra Leone's President
Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
"The bestiality and brutality exhibited by the Liberian
national police is a clear manifestation of an orchestrated and
calculated attempt to victimize and humiliate the people and
government of Nigeria," said Shelpidi, who is the chief of the
west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
That manifestation of anti-Nigerian sentiment was a
culmination of "previous campaigns of slander and naked abuse to
the people and government of Nigeria", the ECOMOG force commander
said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that his country, in the spirit of a peacekeeping
mission, has exercised restraint in the face of naked teleguided
aggression, warning that "enough is enough".
</P>
<P>
Lamenting "we have been provoked, humiliated and brutalized
for too long", Shelpidi stressed that ECOMOG's silence should not
be misconstrued as a sign of weakness or cowardice.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG chief also firmly denied the allegation that some
of the Nigerian journalists were carrying drug with them.
</P>
<P>
However, Liberian Information Minister Joe Mulbah said
Shelpidi's comment on the issue came as a "shock" and "threat" to
his government.
</P>
<P>
As the the commander of a sub-regional force, Shelpidi "should
not be speaking for the Nigerian government," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"If Nigeria is not satisfied with Liberia, such comment should
come from the ambassador or directly from the Nigerian
government," he argued.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the police suspected some
individuals had drugs with them and decided to inquire. In the
process, they took away some people who were involved. Later the
police director intervened and the men were released.
</P>
<P>
"It is to our surprise that Shelpidi came all heavily and was
threatening us," Mulbah said, quoted by the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The fresh row between Nigeria and Liberia, however, does not
come as a surprise to many observers as it has been reported for
long that Liberian President Charles Taylor does not like
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG was sent to Liberia in 1990 when
Taylor's warring faction had taken over most part of the country
during the civil war the former warlord launched in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Although ECOMOG helped create an environment conducive for
Taylor to become the President, Taylor began to ask the force to
leave his country shortly after his inauguration last August.
</P>
<P>
He also barred ECOMOG to use Liberia for attack against the
military junta in neighboring Sierra Leone and opposed ECOMOG to
be involved in the restructuring of the Liberian army he
previously agreed.
</P>
<P>
It is still early to predict the effect of the new row between
the two countries, but the hostile posture of the Taylor
government has been seen as one of the major reasons for ECOMOG's
planned move of its headquarters from Monrovia to Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Fires to Aggravate Power Deficiency in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A spate of fires will aggravate
the power deficiency situation in Ghana, the British Broadcasting
Corporation reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These fires have been difficult to control and caused
considerable damages.
</P>
<P>
One of the three fires occurred in a thermal power plant yet
to be commissioned some 200 kilometers away from the Ghanaian
capital Accra. The fire caused an explosion which blew up about
half of the plant with an installed capacity of 100 megawatt of
power.
</P>
<P>
Another took place last week in a diesel-burning power plant
and the third one, which is still raging about 100 kilometers
away from Accra, has damaged many electricity generating
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The fires are reportedly caused by local people's traditional
burning of bushes at this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
Ghana has been suffering serious shortage of electricity
supply and the government implemented a nationwide electricity
rationing from the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Implementation of U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said Thursday that mediation in the Mideast peace process can not
succeed unless all parties concerned cooperate and implement
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Annan, speaking at a joint press conference with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, said he did not bring an initiative
with him to revive the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
"I come here not as a mediator or with an initiative... I think
mediation alone can not succeed without the cooperation of all
parties concerned in the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also lent his approval to the U.S. role in the
peace process and urged regional countries to support the leading
U.S. mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to make the peace process succeed does not depend
on how many mediators we have, but to support the one that is
already in the lead," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I say I have no initiatives but I do have ideas," Annan told
reporters, saying that the United Nations is always engaged in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has issued a series of relevant resolutions, he said,
and the success of the peace process is based on their
implementation.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he would expect an early lifting of sanctions
imposed on Libya, the U.N. chief said he has no wish to personally
intervene in the Libya-West crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said he will wait to see the results of a special Security
Council debate on the Libya and Iraq issues called for by Arab and
African countries on March 20. "I think I myself will be in
contact with both parties, the Libyans and Britons," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also referred to the "preliminary procedures"
already taken by the International Court of Justice towards the
settlement of the crisis, adding that the "substance" decision is
yet to be taken.
</P>
<P>
"But I think it may be possible to find a way forward without
waiting for the formal judgement of the court. But this is
something the member states will have to deal with in New York,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Arab League Secretary Esmat Abdul-Meguid said
the league is seeking to lift the U.N. air and arms embargo on
Libya that have been in place since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed after Libya refused to extradite two
suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people. It argues the two men can not get
a fair trial in Britain or the United States.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid said the Arab League would like to see "a solution
acceptable to all parties... to put an end to the sanctions." But
he added the league is "keen not to raise any confrontation."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, who arrived here Wednesday evening on a two-day
visit, has visited Jordan and will go to Syria, Lebanon, the
Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Angola: 191 High-ranking UNITA Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and ninety-one
high-ranking officers of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) were demobilized in central city
of Bailundo on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first case in the three-year peace process that so
many high-ranking officers including several generals have been
demobilized in UNITA.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angolan News Agency, the United Nations chief
observer General Philip Sibanda presided the ceremony. General
Jose Maria, representative of the Angolan government, and Alcides
Sakala, secretary in charge of international relations in UNITA,
attended the ceremony on behalf of the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Sakala said at the ceremony that this move demonstrated to the
whole nation of Angola and the world that the leadership of UNITA
will exert their efforts to commit themselves to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Jose said that all Angolans and the international community
are concerned about this significant political event going on in
the UNITA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The demobilization of so many senior officers showed the
spirit of being responsible on the battling sides and their
determination to establish a united non-partisan national armed
forces, said Jose.
</P>
<P>
Generals Kamalata Numa and Altino Sapalalo were among the
demobilized. They said that they will make due contribution to
the peace and economic growth of their country.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF Approve 800 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved on Thursday a debt
reduction package worth close to 800 million U.S. dollars for Cote
d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Under the Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC), the total assistance to be provided to the Western African
nation by all of its external creditors will reduce Cote
d'Ivoire's external debt burden by 345 million dollars in Net
Present Value (NPV) terms. This is estimated to translate into
debt-service relief close to 800 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and IMF will provide assistance with a NPV of
91 million dollars and 22.5 million dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The completion point for the delivery of the debt reduction
package will be March, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the joint World Bank and IMF came as U.S.
President Bill Clinton was preparing to leave this weekend on a
nearly two-week trip to six African nations during which debt
relief to poor nations in sub-Sahara Africa is expected on his
agenda during his meetings with African leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Cote d'Ivoire is the fifth nation to benefit so far under
the World Bank-IMF 7.4 billion dollar HIPC program which was
kicked off in 1996 by the World Bank and IMF. The program is
expected to benefit some 20 of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
A joint World Bank-IMF statement said Cote d'Ivoire's debt
reduction would still be subject to confirmation from other
creditors, such as governments and commercial banks, along with
satisfactory implementation of an IMF reform program agreed upon
by the Cote d'Ivoire government earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire, with some 19 billion dollars in debt, is
Africa's second most heavily indebted country, following Nigeria
which owes 35 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Pursues New Partnership with Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Thursday that the United States would pursue "a
new partnership for a new century" with Africa.
</P>
<P>
Her remarks comes before President Bill Clinton sets his foot
on the continent on Sunday starting the most ambitious Africa trip
ever undertaken by a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Africa should understand... that when the United
States says it wants to work with them on the basis of shared
interest and mutual respect, we are not just blowing smoke,"
Albright told 200 students at George Mason University outside
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We mean it and in a big way over the long term -- not only
because it is right but because it is smart," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration's Africa policy is focused on
promoting trade and investment on the continent. Legislation to
accomplish these goals was approved by the House last week and now
awaits action by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the United States envisions the full integration
of Africa into the world economy and the global economy.
</P>
<P>
This "will establish lifelines of commerce and investment that
will help Africans reduce poverty, raise living standards and
equip their people with 21st century skills," she said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will be the first president to visit sub-Saharan Africa
since Jimmy Carter visited Liberia 20 years ago. It also is the
culmination of a series of high-profile official visits by
prominent Americans over the past 17 months. Albright toured the
continent in December following a visit a year ago by Hillary
Rodham Clinton. Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher
visited the continent in October 1996.
