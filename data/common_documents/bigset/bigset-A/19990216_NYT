RANGERS DEFEAT PREDATORS, 7-4

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Wayne Gretzky may not be finding the net lately, but
he's still a dazzling playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who has not scored a goal since Feb. 4, handed out a
season-high five assists on Monday night as the New York Rangers
went on a rare scoring binge. They scored four times in the first
period, took a 6-0 lead in the second and cruised to a 7-4 victory
over the expansion Nashville Predators before a sellout crowd of
17,298 at the Nashville Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers (21-26-7), who were averaging only 2.6 goals a game,
needed this victory. They had lost three consecutive games, and
their playoff hopes seemed to be fading with only one victory in
their last five games entering Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Graves and John McLean scored 47 seconds apart in the first
period to ignite the Rangers' attack and drive Nashville's starting
goaltender Mike Dunham to the bench. Dunham had stopped only four
of the seven shots he faced.
</P>
<P>
   For Gretzky, it was the 14th time in his career that he had a
five-assist game, the last coming on Nov. 16, 1995, against the New
York Islanders. In his last nine games Gretzky, the Rangers'
leading scorer, has 12 points _ 1 goal and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky remained tied with Gordie Howe for the major league
career lead in goals with 1,071.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville (19-31-5) remained without a victory at home in
February. In losses to Detroit, Pittsburgh and the Rangers, the
Predators have been outscored by 14-8. They have not had the lead
in any of those contests.
</P>
<P>
   McLean scored at 5 minutes 43 seconds of the opening period when
his shot from the right boards caromed in off Dunham's skate. It
was McLean's 20th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Fedyk's fourth goal of the season and second in as many
days caused Nashville Coach Barry Trotz to make the change in goal.
As he left the ice, Dunham heaved his stick in anger. He never
returned to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Last Nov. 29, Dunham played only one period against the Rangers
before he left the game with a groin injury that sidelined him for
nearly two months. In that one _ a 5-1 New York victory _ he
allowed three goals on 13 shots. In 26:10, the Rangers have scored
6 goals on 19 shots against Dunham.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Vokoun replaced Dunham and gave up three more goals on the
first seven shots he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harvey and Kevin Stevens both beat Vokoun for power-play
goals before Graves tipped home a blue-line blast by Todd Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Dan Cloutier, starting in place of Mike Richter, made 29
saves for his first victory since Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, which lost its sixth straight home game, finally came
to life trailing 6-0 midway through the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators finally got on the board with goals by Greg
Johnson and Sebastien Bordeleau 17 seconds apart. Johnson stuffed
home a loose puck from the front of the net for his 15th of the
season. Bordeleau then took a pass in the right circle, whirled and
scored with a wrist shot.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Walker got Nashville within 6-3 when he scored his seventh
at 16:51 of the second. The Predators' three second-period goals
came on a total of seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Fitzgerald scored Nashville's final goal at 7:50 of the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers became the third Eastern Conference team to sweep a
two-game set from the first-year Predators. Ottawa and Boston did
so previously.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky had a scoring chance late in the first period only to
see Harvey get his 11th goal of the season by scoring off Gretzky's
miss at 14:08. His final assist came on a power play at 16:47 in
the third from behind the net to Mathieu Schneider, who had a slap
shot from the high slot for a 7-4 lead.

TWO ROSTERS, ONE GREAT TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ We saw a heck of a hockey team Monday night
at the Forum. It is speedier than the Presidents Day commute. It is
stronger than ore. It is more skilled than Bobby Orr.
</P>
<P>
   This team has enough star power to sell those few remaining
luxury suites at the new Staples Center or Paul Kariya's middle
initial isn't T., as in Titanic. Call us crazy, but we don't think
it's California dreaming to picture this merry band of icemen
bumping the Phoenix Coyotes from one of those Western Conference
penthouse suites that they've turned into a cushy, comfy home.
</P>
<P>
   The ice below wasn't responsible for those goosebumps on our
arms when the two local NHL entries skirmished. Southern California
could be Puckville, if not for one minor problem. The players on
the team we're wild about weren't all wearing the same-colored
jerseys during the Anaheim Mighty Ducks' 3-1 win in front of a
crowd pretty evenly divided between Los Angeles Kings fans and
Ducks faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The team that could be the talk of every town between San Diego
and Santa Barbara is a melding of the Kings' and Ducks' rosters.
Hey, if our neighborhood grocery store can be gobbled up by another
and our corner bank similarly absorbed, what's to stop us from
consolidating the two area NHL teams into a single mellifluous one?
</P>
<P>
   Well, besides Disney's dollars, Roski's real-estate empire and
Anschutz' mined millions?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind them. It's our space and it can't be bought, not even
for $85 million, the going rate these days for NHL expansion
franchises. So here goes something substantial. Ladies and
gentlemen, introducing your SoCal SigAlerts (named in honor of all
those red goal lights).
</P>
<P>
   The team would commute between the Forum/Staples Center and the
Pond and be worth following to the ends of the San Andreas Fault,
if only to feel the earth move under one's seat every time the Fab
Five takes a shift.
</P>
<P>
   Forwards Teemu Selanne, Jozef Stumpel and Kariya and defensemen
Rob Blake and Mattias Norstrom would stultify the opposition the
way Detroit's Russian unit once did.
</P>
<P>
   To calculate how many of Stumpel's pretty passes Selanne and
Kariya would put away is to risk blowing your mind. Playing with
interchangeable centers this year (most of the time it has been
rugged Steve Rucchin; lately it has been Matt Cullen), Kariya and
Selanne have combined for 50 goals and have assisted each other
enough to stand fourth and fifth, respectively, in the league in
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' Blake is no slouch offensively. He led all defensemen
in scoring in 1997-98 while his partner, Norstrom, is on the
cutting edge of jarring, scarring checks.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Luc Robitaille is the Kings' top scoring threat with
29 goals. He'd be on the second line of the SigAlerts, alongside
center Rucchin and a healthy Glen Murray.
</P>
<P>
   They'd be a sight to behold in the opposition's end, with
Rucchin winning faceoffs, Murray wasting no time getting the puck
on net with that quick release of his and Robitaille waiting to
pounce on any rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   It says a lot about Murray _ and perhaps even more about the
Kings' firepower _ that he stands second on the team in goals
despite sitting out the past 18 games with a torn medial collateral
ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks defenseman Fredrik Olausson was bothered in the exhibition
season by an enlarged spleen. His spleen is fine now; it's his
stats that are swollen. He has almost as many points (38) as the
Kings' top two scoring defensemen (Blake and Steve Duchesne)
combined (39).
</P>
<P>
   Ten of Olausson's 14 goals have come with a man-advantage. He'd
be an integral part of the SigAlerts' power play in addition to
playing regular shifts alongside the Ducks' Ruslan Salei, a rising
stay-at-home defenseman with a rising slapshot that is truly
wicked.
</P>
<P>
   Salei is a one-time teammate of the Kings' Vladimir Tsyplakov.
They'd be reunited again, with Tsyplakov, a left winger, skating on
the third line alongside Cullen and the Kings' Donald Audette.
Audette would be the resident rodent, nibbling at the nerves of
opponents and forcing them into taking cheesy penalties. Once on
the power play, he has a pretty effective top-shelf shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' Doug Bodger and Sean O'Donnell would round out the
defensemen. As he demonstrated Monday, Bodger has never seen a shot
he won't sacrifice his body to block. O'Donnell is every inch as
fearless and selfless.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, Norstrom and Ian Laperriere anchor a Kings' unit that
killed off 28 straight penalties before an ex-King, Tomas
Sandstrom, beat them with a man-advantage in the 16th minute of the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   There'd be a place on the checking line for Laperriere, who does
so many of the little things so well. He's good at faceoffs, he
chases down pucks, he finishes his checks and his shot isn't
half-bad, either; he nearly scored the go-ahead goal off Guy Hebert
from the left circle early in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Sandstrom would also grace the checking line, never mind that on
this night he looked a lot like the King who had 45 goals and 89
points in 1990-91. Sandstrom's heads-up hustle earned him a penalty
shot in the seventh minute of the third and he coolly converted it
to finish off the Kings (Kariya completed the scoring with an empty
netter in the final minute).
</P>
<P>
   Kings tough guy Matt Johnson would play alongside Sandstrom and
Laperriere and in front of Hebert, winner of six of his past seven
games. Jamie Storr, who's nine years younger than the 32-year-old
Hebert, would be the backup goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robinson would coach the SigAlerts, because after four
years of driving a jalopy, he deserves to steer a custom-built set
of wheels.

SCALABRINE FINDS ENERGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC forward Brian Scalabrine has been physically
worn down recently, but he thinks he might have found a way to stay
fresh for the Trojans' final five games.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine's legs felt stronger Saturday than they have in weeks
during USC's 86-82 victory over Stanford, when he had a game-high
22 points and five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't break into a whole sweat before the game during
warmups,'' Scalabrine said. ``I didn't work out as hard. I felt
great in the game. I think a lot of my getting tired in the game
comes from the shootaround. We didn't have one against Stanford
because it was a day game.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine, who's averaging 14.7 points and 6.7 rebounds this
season, continues to be a top contender for the Pacific-10
Conference's newcomer of the year award.
</P>
<P>
   __ Meeting the challenge: One of the unsung heroes of the
Trojans' upset was freshman forward Sam Clancy, who had 12 points
and 10 rebounds, his fourth double-double of the season. Clancy has
more double-doubles than any freshman in the Pac-10 except
Arizona's Michael Wright, who has nine.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy also held his own against Stanford's Mark Madsen,
probably the most physical player in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenged Sam Clancy,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``I
said, `Your father's watching you on TV. Are you going to let
Madsen push you around?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Added Scalabrine: ``Sam was like a Superman.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Clutch free throws: The Trojans defeated Stanford despite the
fact the Cardinal made 28 of 32 free throws while the Trojans were
18 of 24. But USC made 9 of its 10 free throws in overtime, when
Stanford was 4 for 6.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest were by USC guard Elias Ayuso, who hit them with
three seconds left to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the two biggest free throws of my college career,''
Ayuso said.

DOG HANDLER LIVES OUT CHAMPIONSHIP DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Fixing headline to read DOG HANDLER instead of DOG
OWNER) 
By GREG BOTONIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ For more than 15 years, Stephanie Archuleta
has dreamed of taking a dog to the Westminster Kennel Club dog
show.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she got her wish with a blond cocker spaniel named
Mishka, who not only got into America's most prestigious dog show
but came home with a trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done probably 65 shows last year,'' said Archuleta, a
professional dog handler. ``But going to the Westminster was a
dream come true. An absolute once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It was
just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1877 by a group of New York businessmen _ its
organizers call it America's second-oldest continuous sporting
event, after the Kentucky Derby _ the Westminster show accepts only
dogs that already have earned championship titles.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2,500 dogs are accepted to compete and, on average, all
slots are filled in less than 10 minutes from the opening of
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Mishka, a 3-year-old whose official American Kennel Club name is
Champion Laramo's Handsome Dancer, is owned by a Columbus, Ind.,
couple, Nancy Foley and Ken Feller.
</P>
<P>
   But he lives in a kennel at Archuleta's Palmdale home north of
Los Angeles, which dog handling fees have helped pay for. Mishka
gets good care: on Friday, two days after he returned from New
York, he went in for a tonsillectomy _ something not commonly done
on dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Archuleta takes Mishka from coast to coast competing in shows,
and he wins just about every show he enters _ so many that
Archuleta has lost count. She does all his trimming and grooming
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Mishka earned not only an American Kennel Club championship
title but a Canadian Kennel Club Championship title.
</P>
<P>
   In the Westminster show _ held at Madison Square Garden _ Mishka
competed against cocker spaniels in the ASCOB category _ any solid
color other than black. He came out first, meaning he best met the
standards for what the breed should look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mishka is a 100 percent-plus show dog,'' said Archuleta. ``A
once-in-a-lifetime dog. I'm just glad I had the opportunity to take
him there.''
</P>
<P>
   Archuleta became interested in showing dogs nearly 15 years ago
when she purchased her first purebred cocker spaniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to know everything there is to know about the
breed,'' said Archuleta. ``Being in the world of purebreds, you
meet other people who show their dogs and AKC breeders. I just
learned grooming and showing from being their and experiencing it
all. It's become a passion of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her first purebred, Archuleta has brought more than 50
dogs owned by other dog enthusiasts to champion status. She has
shown dogs throughout the country and gained a fair amount of
recognition for her achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was how I became Mishka's handler,'' Archuleta said. ``I
knew the owners and they knew me from shows and they approached me
and asked me to handle Mishka.''
</P>
<P>
   Mishka is the father of four other champions, and Archuleta
handles them as well. She is working with them all in hopes of
taking another dog to Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all great and I hope that they will do as well as
their father,'' Archuleta said. ``It's hard to say. It takes a very
special dog to make it to Westminster but we just keep working at
it and hoping.''

WITH BLAKE, IT'S GREAT EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Wayne Gretzky of the New York Rangers was saying in an
interview this weekend that trying to live up to his remarkable
legacy is ``the hardest part of being me.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we know Wayne Gretzky, and let us tell you, Rob Blake is
no Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   But Blake, the Kings captain, did win the Norris Trophy last
season as the NHL's top defenseman, so he entered this season
bearing his own share of lofty expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Though Blake hasn't played poorly, the Kings ask a lot of their
best player, and when his performance this season is compared to
anything, it is to last season, when he led NHL defensemen with 23
goals.
</P>
<P>
   But injuries and a suspension robbed him of 18 games, and
following Monday's loss to the Mighty Ducks at the Forum, Blake had
just one goal and four points in his last 15 games, and just four
goals all season. Still, to quantify his importance to the team,
consider that the Kings have a winning record when he's in the
lineup and are an abysmal 3-15 without him.
</P>
<P>
   That said, he hasn't lately been dominating the way he does when
he's at his best, and Blake readily accepted a large share of the
blame for Saturday's 3-2 loss to Dallas because he was caught
flatfooted on Guy Carbonneau's game-winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' team leader said, ``It's tough to lead when you're
the guy making the mistakes. It's tough to stand up in the dressing
room and say something.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson said, ``I think he's capable of making much
better plays. He's definitely not playing the way he's capable of
playing. . . . I spoke to him a week ago and I told him how much
this team needs him. We need him at the top of his game. We need
everyone at the top of their game.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, especially if they are to stage a last-ditch
run for a playoff berth, the Kings need Blake, and he knows it
better than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fleury of the week: If Calgary remains in the playoff hunt
when the trading deadline arrives on March 23, it would be sensible
for the Flames to trade unrestricted-free-agent-to-be Theoren
Fleury, but it wouldn't be popular with their fans.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fleury is making it clear he prefers to remain in
the Western Conference, in large part for family reasons. His wife,
Veronica, is due April 8 with the couple's second child, and Fleury
would also like to remain close to a child (from a previous
relationship) who lives in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   A definite hang-up in a Fleury trade is that he has said he
intends to test the free-agent market, which opens July 1, meaning
that a team could make a deal for him in March and have nothing to
show for it a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a source familiar with the situation said, one option for
a team trading for Fleury would be to send the Flames one piece
now, with a second piece going to Calgary contingent on signing the
gritty 5-foot-6 right wing after the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Steel City savior?: The bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins owe
their creditors $127 million, $26.3 million of that to former
superstar center Mario Lemieux, who says he would be willing to
convert a ``large portion'' of what is owed him into equity in the
ailing franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking a big chance,'' Lemieux admitted. ``But I believe
hockey can work in Pittsburgh. I believe in the fans of
Pittsburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux said he would make regular appearances in the Penguins'
offices, unlike absentee owners Roger Marino and Howard Baldwin.
But if anyone is thinking that Lemieux, who is 33, would consider
returning to the ice, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm an owner, I can't be player,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Lemieux's efforts fail, it is possible the Penguins will
move, which would be a pity for their supportive fans and for the
NHL.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looney tunes: It's hard to imagine what was going through th
mind of Art Williams when he took over as owner of the Tampa Bay
Lightning before the season. Apparently, in the aftermath of last
season's league-worst 17-55-10 record, he figured a Stanley Cup was
just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning will fall a tad short. Tampa Bay is a league-worst
11-39-5, and this has been upsetting to Williams, who is
considering selling a portion of his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has just devastated me,'' said Williams, whose team
is expected to lose $20 million this season. ``The losses have been
a really tough thing for me to take. . . . This has been a tragic
year for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The man with the skewed sense of tragedy was asked how the
Lightning can turn itself around and said, ``You do that with young
kids and draft picks and clearing out some of the dead-wood
veterans. And some of the pansies we have.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``I don't know hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Is bigger better?: In their second and final season in
Greensboro, the Carolina Hurricanes are averaging fewer than 8,000
fans at their home games. Obviously, what this franchise needs
above all else is a 19,000-seat arena.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Hurricanes are scheduled to move into just such an
edifice next season in Raleigh, 80 miles from Greensboro.
Considering there are doubts North Carolina State can fill the
building's 20,000 seats for basketball in a region of
hoop-a-holics, the Hurricanes clearly have a big selling job to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that 19,000 is too big,'' Raleigh Mayor
Tom Fetzer said. ``We'll have to figure out ways to fill it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes have recruited racing legend and North Carolina
native Richard Petty to appear in print, radio and TV ads. In the
first TV spot, Petty drives a Zamboni around a rink at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's sufficient to motivate locals to spend up to $95
for tickets remains to be seen.

   AIRLINE TRAVELERS ENJOYED A DECLINE IN TICKET PRICES
</P>
<P>
   When several major airlines raised their fares at the end of

DUCKS DUNK KINGS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It was a game rife with symbolic moments,
moments when it became ever clearer which team was going nowhere
and which was on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   There were the Kings, getting what should have been an emotional
lift from a shorthanded goal by Olli Jokinen that broke up a
scoreless tie late in the second period. But here were the Mighty
Ducks, tying the score on a power play just 17 seconds later with a
goal by a Kings hero of yesteryear, Tomas Sandstrom.
</P>
<P>
   And here, again, was Sandstrom, scoring on a decisive
third-period penalty shot that lifted the Mighty Ducks a little
higher and sank the Kings just a little deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the playoff race,'' Kings coach Larry Robinson
said grimly following Monday's 3-1 loss to the Ducks before a Forum
crowd of 14,664. ``But we're slowly putting ground over our own
graves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said, ``It took all our energy and
everybody had to contribute. We did a good job and stayed solid. We
did a lot of little things right.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss, the second straight for the Kings (20-31-4), left them
six points behind Edmonton in the race for the final playoff berth
in the Western Conference. The Kings are 0-3 against the Ducks this
season and have been outscored, 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks (23-23-9), who recorded their fourth consecutive road
victory and second in as many nights, are fifth in the conference
and are well on their way to the second playoff appearance in their
six-year history.
</P>
<P>
   It was scoreless until late in the second period, when Jokinen
scored his first goal since Dec. 30 off a pass from Yanic Perreault
after Ducks goalie Guy Hebert misplayed a loose puck in the corner
with his team shorthanded.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings' celebration lasted just long enough for Sandstrom
to get behind defenseman Sean O'Donnell, take a lead pass from
Pascal Trepanier and slip the puck between the pads of goalie
Stephane Fiset. The goal broke a string of successful penalty kills
by the Kings at 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge part of the game for us,'' Hartsburg said of
his team's quick response to Jokinen's goal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said, ``I saw Sandstrom cut behind me. I thought that
to go behind me, he'd have to go offside. It was a bad read. My
fault. Totally my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   On a similar play 6:40 into the third period, Sandstrom got
behind Duchesne, this time taking a pass from Steve Rucchin.
Duchesne pulled Sandstrom down and referee Richard Trottier awarded
Sandstrom a penalty shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a step on (Duchesne),'' Sandstrom said. ``I think he was
standing still at the blue line and it was a turnover, so I just
took off and Rucchin hit me with a perfect pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne said, ``I was trying to make the right play. I was
trying not to give up a breakaway. I take the blame for it. It's my
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandstrom made no mistake, beating Fiset to the glove side with
a quick wrist shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his experience and background, he was the perfect guy to
take (the penalty shot),'' Hartsburg said. ``I didn't even watch. I
wanted to watch, but eight guys were standing in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks sealed the victory in the final minute with an
empty-net goal by Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could put in a capsule what's happened this season,''
Kings center Ray Ferraro said, ``instead of finding a way to win,
we found a way to lose.'' &QL;

KINGS STARS FIZZLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Los Angeles Kings coach Larry Robinson tried
something new Monday, having players _ specifically defenseman Sean
O'Donnell and center Ray Ferraro _ discuss at the pregame meeting
what the team needed to do against the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Usually that's the coaches' job, but Robinson figured he might
as well try something new. However, as with everything else this
season, the ploy didn't work and the Kings lost 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pointed out all the things that needed to be done,''
Robinson said, ``and a 20-year-old kid (rookie Olli Jokinen) is the
only one who plays to his potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing. It's the biggest game of the year, or one of
them. . . . How come you can't mentally _ all your big stars _ come
up with your best game of the year? It's very disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson praised only Jokinen, Ian Laperriere, Sandy Moger,
Yanic Perreault and Sean Pronger, who made his Kings debut.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he told his team after the game, Robinson said,
``They're undressed and out of there so quick, you have to be a
magician to get in there fast enough. They should be sitting there
concentrating on the game. A lot of heart checks need to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ailing Ducks: For the second consecutive game, the Mighty
Ducks lost a defenseman to an injury. This time, it was Pascal
Trepanier, who left in the second period with a bruise after he was
struck on the left leg by a puck. He is listed as day to day.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's victory at Phoenix, the Ducks lost Jamie Pushor, who
suffered a bruised left shoulder when checked into the glass by
Coyotes center Tavis Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's game, the Ducks recalled defenseman Dan Trebil
from their Cincinnati affiliate in the American Hockey League.
Trebil had 19 points in 45 games at Cincinnati and he also has
appeared in one game for the Mighty Ducks. He did not play against
the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   __ Penalty shots: Tomas Sandstrom's penalty shot was the fourth
in Mighty Ducks history and their first against the Kings. The
Ducks have scored on three of their four penalty shots. Sandstrom
has scored two penalty-shot goals in his career, the other nine
years ago as a King against Pittsburgh goalie Wendell Young.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have faced 27 penalty shots in their history and
allowed nine goals. Washington's Peter Bondra scored on the only
other penalty shot against the Kings this season. The Kings have
had two penalty shots against the Ducks, getting a goal from Dan
Quinn in 1995. Glen Murray was stopped by Guy Hebert last season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Offensive defense: A key to the Mighty Ducks' success this
season has been the offensive production by their defensemen. A key
factor in the Kings' struggles has been lack of same.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' defensemen have scored 12 goals, eight fewer than the
Ducks' defensemen have scored. With 14 goals, Ducks defenseman
Fredrik Olausson has two more than the Kings' defensemen combined.
</P>
<P>
   Olausson, 32, already has tied the Ducks' record for most goals
by a defenseman, set by Bill Houlder during the inaugural 1993-94
season. He is eight points from tying the franchise record for a
defenseman. Dimitri Mironov had 46 points for the Ducks in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   Olausson recently became only the 37th defensemen in NHL history
to reach 500 points, and the native of Sweden is only the second
defenseman born outside of North America to do so. The first was
Hall of Famer Borje Salming, another Swede who retired in 1990 with
787 points for Toronto and Detroit.

TWO PLAYERS ON THE BUBBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At first blush, Los Angeles Clippers math might
seem easy: five games equals five losses.
</P>
<P>
   But this a different math problem.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, an NBA mandate kicks in, forcing each team to trim
its active roster to 12 players. In tonight's game vs. Vancouver at
the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, the Clippers will have 14 players in
uniform. So, subtract two and you're there, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, we can't forget two Clippers on the injured list - veteran
free-agent guard Scott Brooks and rookie power forward Brian
Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, whose injured knee soon will be ready to roll, may come
off the injured list within the week.
</P>
<P>
   That means the team must do even more subtracting (unless, of
course, someone sustains an unfortunate, but timely, injury).
</P>
<P>
   Who's a likely goner? Aside from Brooks, the only member of the
Super 16 without a guaranteed contract is undrafted rookie forward
Tyrone Nesby.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem; Nesby , who backs up Lamond Murray at
small forward, has hustled his way into Coach Chris Ford's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been playin', hasn't he?'' Ford said of Nesby's immediate
future. ``He's been part of my rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   And that means it's unlikely Nesby will be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about,'' said Nesby, who scored 9 points in 19 minutes
during Sunday's loss to Minnesota. ``But if they cut me, they cut
me. I'll just thank Coach Ford for giving me the opportunity and
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic scenario would involve the Clippers buying out
the remainder of another player's guaranteed contract.
</P>
<P>
   __ Double trouble: Like the composite sketch on a wanted poster,
the moves of Michael Olowokandi are receiving great scrutiny from
Clippers opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three games, the rookie center averaged 14 points
and 10 shots per game. In his last two, both starts, Olowokandi has
managed 7.5 points and 7 shots per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has to work on holding his position,'' Ford said of
the league's top draft pick. ``He has to learn to handle the
double-team.''
</P>
<P>
   In last weekend's losses to Phoenix and Minnesota, Olowokandi
had trouble establishing position against veteran centers Luc
Longley and Dean Garrett, respectively. The Timberwolves also
assisted Garrett with fierce double-teaming tactics, usually
applied by 7-foot Kevin Garnett or 6-10 Joe Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets the ball in the paint,'' Ford said, ``he's got to
get into his move right away. After guys get used to being
double-teamed, they start to wait for the double-team.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, Ford said, is Olowokandi's busy low-post
repertoire, which may be forcing him to decide which move is best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Michael's gotta rely more on his jump-hook,'' said
Ford, who also pointed out that Olowokandi's quick spin move is not
yet ready for the doubting eyes of NBA officials.

 STUDY POKES HOLE IN TALKING NEANDERTHAL THEORY  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A study by three University of California
graduate students has rekindled an old controversy about the
mysterious origins of human speech.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the UC Berkeley anthropology students compared the
obscure anatomical features of apes and monkeys with modern humans
and with their prehuman ancestors of 2 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Their findings challenge a widely accepted contention by senior
researchers at Duke University that the extinct Neanderthal people,
who vanished from Earth some 30,000 years ago, may have possessed
the capacity for speech at least 400,000 years earlier _ long
before modern human beings arrived on the evolutionary scene.
</P>
<P>
   The gift of speech and language _ more than almost any other
ability _ makes possible the expression of symbolic thought, of
organized societies, of art and culture. They distinguish us from
our long-ago prehuman forebears and from our primate cousins, the
apes and monkeys of today.
</P>
<P>
   Until about 30,000 years ago our direct ancestors, modern Homo
sapiens, shared the forests and plains of Europe with another more
primitive people, known today as Neanderthals, who also hunted,
made stone tools and buried their dead in the same territory as
Homo sapiens.
</P>
<P>
   The Neanderthals had evolved from earlier prehumans and had
thrived for hundreds of thousands of years before Homo sapiens
arrived, but ultimately they were doomed to become only a dead-end
branch on the tree of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   They died away even as modern humans had advanced to create
societies, to fill caves with symbolic art and to become the
dominant species in a lineage that traces directly back for
millions of years to the first humanlike creatures, now known as
hominids. Only the scattered fossil bones of Homo Neanderthalensis
remain today to recall their extinction.
</P>
<P>
   But for anthropologists _ and for all of us profoundly curious
about our beginnings _ the great mystery persists: Did Neanderthals
have language? Could they speak? Or are we moderns the only ones
graced by evolution with that capacity?
</P>
<P>
   The sparse but intriguing evidence about the origin of speech,
like so much in science, is bound to evoke puzzlement and may never
be finally resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But last year a team of Duke University researchers concluded
that the shape of tiny tube-like bone structures they analyzed in
fossil skulls from two Neanderthals gave evidence that those squat,
heavy-bodied people with their beetling brows could well have
developed speech as far back as 400,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tubular bones at the base of the brain _ no thicker than
pencils _ are called hypoglossal canals. They carry specialized
nerve fibers from the brain to the tongue and control the flexible
tongue's movements in shaping the elements of spoken language. The
same canals also carry blood vessels that nourish the flexible
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke anthropologists compared the size of the tube-shaped
bone structures in their 70,000-year-old Neanderthal fossils with
those of early and modern Homo sapiens. Because the average
dimensions of the bone structures were nearly equal, the Duke
scientists concluded that the canals of the extinct Neanderthals
were easily large enough to hold the elaborate nerve fibers and
blood vessels essential to make their tongues capable of forming
articulate speech.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; First to Speak
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Neanderthals at least 400 millennia ago
could well have been the first people to speak, according to
Richard F. Kay, Matt Cartmill and Michelle Ballow, the Duke
researchers. They published their widely heralded findings last
April in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   And the much smaller hypoglossal canals in earlier fossil
hominids, known as Australopithecus africanus, were almost
identical in size to those of modern monkeys, chimpanzees and
gorillas, the Duke scientists found. So clearly, like the
Australopithicenes, nonhuman primates who lived some 2.5 million
years ago, they could not have possessed even the rudimentary
structures essential for human speech, the anthropologists said.
</P>
<P>
   Australopithecus, like today's apes and monkeys, may well have
screamed and grunted, but it was not true language.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tuesday's issue of the same publication, the three
Berkeley graduate students have boldly challenged their seniors
with a compelling counterargument.
</P>
<P>
   David DeGusta, W. Henry Gilbert and Scott P. Turner contend in
their research report that they have ``falsified'' the Duke theory
that the size of the hypoglossal canal and its nerves is an
indicator of speech and language capacity. And their argument found
support at once from one of the foremost experts on human
evolution, UC Berkeley physical anthropologist F. Clark Howell.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Howell said enthusiastically that the Duke report
``adds a new arrow in the quiver of evidence'' that is slowly
attacking the language origin problem. At that time he called the
Duke conclusions based on size comparisons of the hypoglossal canal
``a very promising approach.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year Howell has sponsored the publication by DeGusta
and his colleagues, and in an interview over the weekend he backed
the UC Berkeley students more strongly.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; `It Just Doesn't Work'
</P>
<P>
   The Duke approach of comparing the size of the hypoglossal
canals in the skulls of Neanderthals with modern humans, with
monkeys and apes, and with far more ancient hominids ``just doesn't
provide good evidence for the origin of speech,'' Howell said. ``It
just doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGusta and his colleagues, in fact, did make a detailed
comparative study, and they did it meticulously. But they found no
correlation at all between canal size and language ability.
</P>
<P>
   They measured the dimensions of the canals in museum-held skulls
of 104 modern humans; 75 monkeys, chimps and gorillas; and two
fossil species of early hominids dating as far back as 2.5 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among all those samples, the Berkeley scientists found, the
average size of the hypoglossal canals overlapped so strongly that
many were larger than human canals while others were smaller. Even
the canals of the Australopithicenes were equal in size to the
canals of modern humans, DeGusta said in an interview, and he added
that in one gibbon skull the canal was actually twice as large as
the average human.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley researchers dutifully sent an advance copy of their
report to Kay and his colleagues, and in an interview Kay
acknowledged it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very interesting paper, indeed,'' he said, ``and it's
on our horizon right now, so we'll certainly have to deal with it.
But there's been a lot going on in human evolution over the past
million years, and based on their data our view isn't seriously
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in it refutes us, and while they've raised a
cautionary flag, there are signal difficulties with their data and
there's still a lot we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, DeGusta and his colleagues have already replied in
their own paper:
</P>
<P>
   ``The size of the hypoglossal canal does not reflect vocal
capabilities or language usage. Thus, the date of origin for human
language and the speech capabilities of Neanderthals remain open
questions.''  &LR;

 GLOBAL MOB CASHING IN ON HUMAN CARGO  &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  ON THE ADRIATIC SEA _ From the moment he sees the rust-streaked
freighter slide out of a fog bank on the Otranto Strait, 25 miles
west of the Albanian coast, and abruptly change course, Captain
Antonino Lo Presti is wary.
<P>
   ``She's an old gas tanker, the kind a smuggler can buy at a
scrap yard for next to nothing,'' he says, giving the order for
full throttle. ``When we picked her up on radar, she didn't even
respond to our signals.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the war-torn Third World meets Western Europe
head-on, in a tense struggle between civil society and organized
crime that holds hundreds of lives hostage every night.
</P>
<P>
   Lo Presti's command, the high-speed pursuit vessel Cavaglia,
sailing under the flag of the Guardia di Finanza, Italy's
counterpart to the U.S. Coast Guard, patrols one of the most
dangerous seaways on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   An international conspiracy of unprecedented dimensions,
involving crime syndicates in half a dozen nations _ and
trafficking in enormous quantities of narcotics, arms and desperate
human beings _ operates in these waters.
</P>
<P>
   As the two vessels close on a moonless January night, the
220-foot freighter's radio finally crackles into response, agreeing
to heave-to. The vessel's name and Syrian home port are faint,
nearly illegible scrawls on her stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be drugs,'' Lo Presti says to a reporter. ``Could be
guns. Could be people.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by chief engineering officer Girolamo Gambino, four of Lo
Presti's men strap on bulletproof vests and handguns and prepare to
board.
</P>
<P>
   They return after an hour, shaking their heads. The freighter
carries only a herd of goats bound for the port of Koper, Slovenia.
It makes no commercial sense as cargo, but there is nothing more
the Cavaglia can do.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, police report that a large group of clandestine
emigrants has landed on the coast near Venice, from a small port
just south of Koper.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-mile-wide Otranto Strait, the narrowest waterway between
the rich European Union and a Third World engulfed in civil war, is
the last leg of a epic journey for vast numbers of undocumented
migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Their origins are a catalog of the planet's bloodiest crises in
1999. Crossing the strait in the holds of rusting freighters _ or
more often aboard ``gommones,'' 60-mph motor launches based in the
Albanian port of Vlore _ they include refugees from every conflict
now raging in Africa, the Balkans and south and central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   On the single January afternoon and night that a Chronicle team
spent aboard the Cavaglia, the Guardia di Finanza rounded up 365 of
the clandestine emigrants.
</P>
<P>
   They had set sail from Vlore after journeys to Albania of up to
10 weeks, from Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, the Kurdish borderland of
Turkey and Iraq, Kosovo, Algeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesmen estimate that 800 to 1,000 such emigrants
leave Vlore daily, successfully eluding detection _ or drowning en
route.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Italy, the emigrants are able to travel north unimpeded
and disappear into the swelling Third World ghettoes of Paris,
Berlin, Brussels and Rotterdam. In an effort to further integrate
their economies, Italy and most other European Union nations have
dismantled border posts with their EU neighbors in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   It is what precedes the clandestine voyages on the Otranto
Strait that suggests an underworld conspiracy more extensive, and
more ominous, than anything preceding it in the annals of organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, ``mafia'' groups from the South China Sea to Sicily
have recognized a golden opportunity in Europe's open internal
borders.
</P>
<P>
   With extraordinary sophistication and minute planning, they have
combined forces to smuggle thousands of human beings over the EU's
Adriatic frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews, emigrants said they had paid for their
transportation to Western Europe in their homelands, once and for
all. At each step on the subsequent journey _ whether it be the
remote frontier between Iraq and Turkey, or a port in Nigeria,
Albania or Pakistan _ buses, cars and maritime vessels were
waiting, and no further payment was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave a man in Kabul $6,000 for myself and my sister,'' said
a traveler from Afghanistan. ``When we crossed into Pakistan, there
was a minibus ready for us, and others when we reached Iran and
Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor his sister had passports or official
identification documents, yet they had crossed several of the
world's most heavily defended borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Turkey, it was a freighter to Albania,'' the Afghan
said. ``Nobody anywhere said a word about more money.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, each driver or helmsman's share of the fee had been
assigned in advance, and distributed by an international team of
paymasters who were trusted to meet specific billing schedules that
stretched across two continents.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the advance payment is based on a complicated
formula that takes into account the level of political risk, as
well as distance.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Afghans, several Sri Lankans had paid $3,000 apiece.
``We were the last sons alive in our families,'' one said.
``Everybody gave something, everybody hopes we'll be able to get
them out, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of 14 Kurds and six Christians from Iraq who made the
journey together had paid $1,500 per person, and a family of four
from Kosovo $1,000 per adult and $500 per child.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians are offered a special package if they make their own
way to Vlore: three voyages to Italy for a flat $1,200 _ ``in case
we're caught the first two times,'' one explained.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the Albanians, most of those who are apprehended at
sea by the Guardia di Finanza, or on the beaches by the Italian
carabinieri, are refugees eligible to apply for political asylum,
although there is no certainty that they will eventually receive
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government will not forcibly repatriate those who
arrive illegally from war-torn countries where they might be
imprisoned or executed as suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of clandestine emigrants from Kosovo, Kurdish Iraq
and Turkey, and northern Sri Lanka _ especially young men between
21 and 35 _ are clearly militants who have been identified by law
enforcement authorities in their homelands and obliged to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I am a Tiger,'' one refugee said, referring to the
ethnic-Tamil guerrilla army that has waged a bloody 15-year war
against the Sri Lankan government. ``Every Tamil my age in our
country is a Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   The apprehended newcomers find themselves on a complicated,
demoralizing road once they reach Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop is a cluster of metal sheds, aluminum truck
containers that have been refashioned into temporary housing and
installed on the wharves of Otranto, the Cavaglia's port.
</P>
<P>
   Once their origins are established, those who are not identified
as nationals of Albania, Morocco or Tunisia _ countries that have
signed ``instant deportation agreements'' with Italy _ are bused to
the Casa Regina Pacis, a refugee camp 15 miles north of Otranto in
the town of San Foca, where they are photographed and
fingerprinted.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, most are freed to the custody of relatives in
Germany, northern Italy or France, in keeping with legislation
covering asylum applicants. Others are sent to larger holding camps
in Sicily _ or climb over the San Foca fences at night to make
their way north as best they can.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at San Foca in a late January week was Babel
revisited, with a dozen languages pouring into the hallway phones
from which internees called relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The facility was built to house 300 boy scouts on summer
vacations. It held nearly 600 emigrants on January 24. The walls of
the building's crowded sleeping halls were covered with graffiti,
also in a dozen languages, left behind by earlier arrivals:
``Kosovo I love You.'' ``I went to Germany.'' ``Allah protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall from the phones, two Liberian prostitutes sat
quietly on bunk beds, awaiting a decision on their next
destination.
</P>
<P>
   The clandestine traffic has increasingly become a modern slave
trade, with young women _ chiefly from West Africa, Ukraine, Russia
and Albania _ forced into prostitution and sold to middlemen
overseeing sex rings in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberian women declined to talk, but many others at San Foca
were eager to tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a schoolteacher, from a country where there are no
classrooms or books anymore,'' a refugee from Afghanistan said. ``I
am also a Tajik,'' he added, drawing a finger across his neck to
suggest a throat-slitting.
</P>
<P>
   The Tajik minority in Afghanistan, which resisted the revolution
of the fundamentalist Taliban movement, has been subjected to
genocidal campaigns by the government in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic charity organization Caritas, which
administers the camp for the Italian authorities and oversees
reporters' visits, asks only that no names be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are political refugees,'' said a Caritas executive.
``Their families could well be in mortal danger if the wrong person
reads your article.''
</P>
<P>
   Her concern reflects a widespread mixture of alarm and sympathy
over the influx among Italians, for whom mass emigration is a
recent episode in their own history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They arrive with every imaginable problem _ bayonet wounds,
broken limbs, infections of the respiratory system, intestinal
disorders, acute mental trauma. It's heart-breaking,'' says Dr.
Marina Greco, who presides over a two-physician clinic at Regina
Pacis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at these people, and I can't help but think of how many
of my own family made the same kind of voyage to America,'' said
Cavaglia engineering officer Gambino, a Sicilian.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentimentality does not extend to Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the refugees who share their boats, Albanians in police
custody are returned home within 24 hours. One result is that the
ferries that travel daily between Italy and Albania are nearly
empty westbound _ the voyages in that direction are made in
gommones or freighters _ and crammed full on the eastbound run.
</P>
<P>
   The returnees are a living encyclopedia of the reasons why
Italian popular opinion has shifted from open-armed sympathy toward
Albania when it threw off half a century of oppressive Stalinist
rule in 1992, to fearful hostility.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent voyage from the Italian port of Brindisi to Vlore,
the Illyrian Lines ferry Tirana was packed to the gunwales with
young men who drank themselves into a brawling rage on the
night-long voyage, leaving ransacked cabins and decks full of
broken chairs and tables in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves quickly singled out the few foreigners on board _
including two Chronicle correspondents, who were threatened
repeatedly with beatings, and whose cabin vouchers and return
tickets were stolen before the ship even sailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a distorted mentality after all those years of
isolation,'' says Antonio Probo, a Cavaglia officer, referring to
Albania's years under the late Enver Hoxha, a reclusive dictator
who shut his country to the Soviet Union and Mao's China as well
the capitalist West.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no sense of a relationship between legitimate work
and money. The worst of them are evil bastards who will throw a
baby overboard without a second thought if it will slow us down in
a chase.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge is widely repeated by Italian law enforcement
authorities and aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, in the last few months, a baby or a young girl
has been pushed into the sea,'' according to Alessandro Russo, a
medical aide with the Catholic charity Misericordia who treats
injured emigrants on the Otranto wharf.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 p.m., as Probo and Gambino scour the horizon with
binoculars, the voice of the radar officer suddenly squawks over
the Cavaglia loudspeakers: ``Gommone, 41 degrees 22 minutes north
by 18 degrees 43 minutes east, bearing west southwest at 45
knots.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Lo Presti adjusts course and speed to intercept.
</P>
<P>
   The chase is an exercise in the frustrations that make Europe's
spiraling immigration crisis seem beyond solution to many
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with sensitive computerized navigation instruments, the
Cavaglia is able to bring the gommone in sight one hour later. But
until the smugglers' work is done _ until the emigrants are safely
ashore _ ``we can't do anything but keep track of its location,''
Lo Presti says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' he adds, ``just in getting too close, we might
accidentally kill a lot of people. These vessels are dangerously
overcrowded and unstable.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are justified. On December 6, two Italy-bound
vessels foundered in a winter storm. International maritime
officials believe they carried up to 700 Kurds, West Africans,
Algerians, Afghans, Iraqis and Pakistanis. It is feared that more
than 200 drowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``A confrontation at sea with gommones weighed down with mothers
and children is something that cannot be undertaken without the
gravest risks,'' said Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the frustration only grows when the gommone has landed its
passengers, and probably a cargo of narcotics, and put back to sea.
In a perilous midnight cat-and-mouse game at nearly 50 mph on the
high seas, the Cavaglia brings the motor launch alongside several
times, only to be outmaneuvered and eventually outrun by its more
agile quarry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to put a shot into their sides, that's for sure, and
we have the armaments to do it,'' says Domenico Di Gianvittorio, a
veteran Guardia di Finanza officer in his 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we come out here with shackles on our wrists. The policy
is `No shooting unless they shoot first,' and the smugglers are
well aware of that. So the result is that we race back and forth,
night after night, to little purpose, and the flesh trade goes on
under our noses.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS WEIGHS CURBING DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE BANK DATA
 &HT;    With ONLINE-PRIVACY. For release Sunday, Feb. 21.
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first glance, a pending House bill seems to be
on the side of the angels: it would make it a federal crime for
anyone to fraudulently obtain information about your account from a
bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Dana LeJune(cq), a Houston attorney, says the devil is in
the details.
</P>
<P>
   LeJune should know, because he spends a good part of his time
trying to collect money owed to his clients. And in order to find
where these debtors are hiding their money, he says it is sometimes
necessary to trick banks into revealing if a deadbeat has an
account.
</P>
<P>
   No trickery, no money.
</P>
<P>
   LeJune and other attorneys who specialize in collections say
debtors routinely try to hide their assets, leaving bill collectors
with two options.
</P>
<P>
   One is to file legal papers with every bank in the area looking
for an account that can be legally seized. While fees vary from
state to state, LeJune says Texas banks typically charge $500 per
search, making such a tactic prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The second alternative is to hire private investigators who, for
a fee, hunt down a debtor's assets, often by misleading bank
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was ads placed by private investigators offering
their services to collections attorneys that caught the eye of Rep.
Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who chairs the House Banking Committee. Leach,
with the help of the American Bankers Association, crafted a bill
known as H.R. 30 that would curb the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The bill says that a person could get up to five years in jail
for ``knowingly making a false, ficticious or fraudulent
statement'' to a financial institution in order to get customer
information. If the fraud is commited in connection with another
crime or if there is a ``pattern of illegal activity,'' the maximum
penalty is doubled. Hearings will be held this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mr. Leach's view, `` explained committee spokesman David
Runkel, ``the privacy argument is more important than the
difficulty that comes about as a result of collecting on a
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't believe that the only way people have been able
to collect on judgments over the past number of years has been to
use illegal means to obtain financial information,'' Runkel said.
``It defies logic. People do owe money and other people pay up. It
is just part of the way the world works.''
</P>
<P>
   LeJune finds people like Runkel hopelessly naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That couldn't be further from the truth,'' LeJune said. ``They
obviously have not done collection work in Texas, because if they
had, they would know how ridiculous that sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Runkel says the bill was blocked in the last Congress because of
objections from people like LeJune. He declined to speculate on how
it may fare this year.

 &HT;    PRIVACY CRUMBLES BEFORE HIGH-TECH 'INFORMATION BROKERS'
 &HT;    With ONLINE-LAWS and ONLINE-SLEUTH. For release Sunday, Feb. 21.
 &HT;    Eds: In graf 15, (tilde) stands for the tilde symbol.
 &HT;    By ANDREW ALEXANDER
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``You're kidding!'' my wife exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   I had just told her that someone had gained access to our
private bank records, lifted our account number and recorded our
balance.
</P>
<P>
   She listened in stunned silence. There was more.
</P>
<P>
   They had also tracked our recent long-distance calls,
identifying those we had telephoned by name, address and
occupation. And they had compiled dossiers on us, complete with
Social Security numbers, property holdings and financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's incredible,'' she said. ``How can they do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Easily, it turns out, in the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   ``They,'' I finally confessed, was actually my Cox Newspapers
Washington Bureau colleague Elliot Jaspin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
high-tech wizard who had delved into our personal lives at my
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to come up with a way for our reporters to use
computer databases to do background checks on little-known figures
who suddenly break into the news, quickly learning about pending
lawsuits or long-concealed arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Start with only my name, I suggested, and see what you can get.
</P>
<P>
   He hit pay dirt within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Given more time _ and a little money _ he soon would have been
able to obtain confidential records of my credit card purchases,
salary, stocks, bonds, credit history, life insurance policy,
recent air travel, whether I had ever been nailed for speeding, and
even my medical records going back 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the popular notion is that a computer linked to the
Internet is a key that unlocks all kinds of personal secrets, most
databases on the Internet are dull as dishwater.
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard (http://www.switchboard.com), for example, will
allow you to instantly discover Uncle Edgar's telephone number in
Dubuque. But then, calling Dubuque information will get you the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, however, carries ads for a burgeoning and largely
uncontrolled industry of ``information brokers'' that _ for a fee _
will reveal the most intimate details of your life, right down to
that birthmark on your backside or ancient records of psychological
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For fees as low as $1.50 a minute or $40 per search, they will
disclose non-published telephone numbers or track down the owners
of private aircraft. Corporate Investigative Services of
Huntsville, Ala., has a Web site
(http://www.hsv.tis.net/(tilde)pvteye/source.html) that also allows
you to listen to the theme music from ``Mission Impossible'' while
you link to hundreds of other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like AutoTrack, have assembled massive
computerized databases containing several billion public records.
Using sophisticated database software, information is quickly
plucked from scores of different files, and within minutes is woven
together into a report.
</P>
<P>
   It was through such a company that Jaspin unearthed a loan I
took out in North Carolina and the tax records on property I own in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   AutoTrack files are interesting, but not nearly as revealing as
companies that use what they politely term ``pretexts'' to shoehorn
information from banks, phone companies, and whomever else you may
do business with. The major weapon here is a huckster's patter
rather than a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from information broker ads, everything is up for grabs.
That includes such sensitive financial information as the location
of your safe deposit box, your bank deposits anywhere in the world,
and even your bank account history, including dates and amounts of
deposits, checks written or wire transfers.
</P>
<P>
   As privacy expert Robert Ellis Smith of Rhode Island noted,
``Every fact about you is on record somewhere,'' and information
brokers see that as fair game. Posing as a forgetful husband,
telephone repairman, or bank clerk, a private investigator can
often get this information by outwitting low-level clerks at the
phone company or some obscure branch of a major bank.
</P>
<P>
   There are few laws forbidding disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our company policy not to release any customer
information without a court order or some legal document,'' said
Sandy Arnette, a spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic in Baltimore. ``But
there is no state or federal law against disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the House Banking Committee found only three states _
Connecticut, Illinois and Maine _ with laws making it a crime to
induce an employee of a financial institution to disclose data
about a customer's account. And there are no federal statutes
against using ``pretexts'' to wangle private data from financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James A. Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, tried unsuccessfully to get the practice outlawed last
year, and he has introduced the same bill again this year.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares if you have a checking account in Duluth and own
40 acres of scrub land in Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Creditors do.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, who need to collect on bad credit card debts, routinely
turn to lawyers who specialize in collections. And these lawyers,
in turn, use information brokers to find assets they can attach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of credit card collection. Thousands of cases a
week,'' said Mike Martin of Advanced Research, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bankers Association supports Leach's proposed
legislation to outlaw fraudulently obtaining information from
banks. But at the same time, Martin noted, ABA member banks ``hire
us to do exactly what it is they're trying to shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   Information brokers will also chase deadbeat dads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often, it gets used for good purposes,'' said private
investigator Edmund Pankau of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago,'' he recalled, his firm traced the financial
dealings of a Houston man who had left his family. The information
allowed them to locate the man in another city. ``He had skipped
out on his ex-wife,'' Pankau said, ``but they needed to find him
because his daughter needed a bone marrow transplant and he was the
only one who could help.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the press also use information brokers to snoop. Al
Schweitzer, a controversial private investigator _ he pleaded
guilty in 1992 to illegally buying Social Security records _ became
a legend by compiling detailed dossiers on Hollywood stars for the
National Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   After actor Kiefer Sutherland split from Julia Roberts,
Schweitzer used her phone records to locate him at his ranch in
Whitefish, Mont. He used the same method to track down Marlon
Brando's daughter in Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   In cases like these, no one lost anything more than privacy, and
probably some sleepless nights worrying that Schweitzer was
constantly on the prowl. But there is a darker side.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials express growing concern about ``identity
fraud'' or ``identity theft,'' in which a con artist uses purloined
personal financial information to assume your identity, then loots
your bank account or makes costly purchases with your credit card
number.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which Americans are actually harmed by this is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A report last year by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, suggests a startling rise in
identity fraud. Trans Union, a leading credit reporting firm, told
GAO that the number of inquiries about credit fraud it receives
each year jumped from 35,235 in 1992 to 522,922 in 1997. Two-thirds
involved identity fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same report, GAO acknowledged that it could find ``no
comprehensive statistics on the prevalence of identity fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressured by the Federal Trade Commission and the threat of
restrictive legislation, some large data collection firms have
begun self-regulation. Several such companies represented by the
Individual Reference Services Group recently agreed to abide by
rules limiting unauthorized disclosure of information.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds of other firms remain essentially unregulated,
including the bulk of information brokers.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, only a handful existed. Today, said Evan
Hendricks, editor of the Washington-based Privacy Times newsletter,
there may be as many as 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of the Internet and higher-powered computers means
we've entered an era where ``nothing is private,'' warned Pankau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything that's private,'' agreed Smith, who
publishes Privacy Journal, a monthly newsletter that monitors how
new technology affects privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the extent of actual financial harm is difficult to gauge.
</P>
<P>
   My wife later acknowledged that she was most troubled by the
notion that someone could so easily obtain information we thought
was private. Disclosure, she conceded, does not automatically mean
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would argue that just the mere unauthorized access (to
private information) is one form of harm,'' Hendricks said, ``and
psychological harm is very real.''

 &HT;    HOW BANKS ARE FOOLED INTO REVEALING PRIVATE DATA
 &HT;    With ONLINE-PRIVACY. For release Sunday, Feb. 21.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many private detectives use ``pretexts'' to fool
banks into releasing a customer's confidential financial data. Al
Schweitzer, an investigator who once pleaded guilty to illegally
obtaining Social Security numbers, told the House Banking Committee
last year how he used ``gags'' to get information:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would first obtain your home telephone number (from the
phone book). I would then call the billing office of your local
telephone company and claim to be you. At this point, I know your
name, address and telephone number and more often than not your
Social Security number and date of birth,'' often from public
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would explain to the telephone company representative that
although I know I paid my bill last month, I forgot to record it in
my check register. I would then ask, 'Could you please tell me how
much it was and when it was due?' The service rep would then tell
me the amount paid and when it was due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next, I ask when the next bill is due and how much it is. The
service rep would freely tell me that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I change hats. I call you at home and either get you or
your wife on the telephone. This time, I am the service rep at your
local telephone company. 'Mr. or Mrs. Subject, this is Mr. Sawyer
with Bell Atlantic. I am calling about your May bill that was due
June 10 in the amount of $98. We haven't received payment and now
your June bill in the amount of $122 is also due. If this can't be
paid immediately, I will have to discontinue your service.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of individuals will immediately become indignant,
claiming that they have already paid those bills. 'Let me get my
checkbook. Here it is. I paid you on June 5, $98.'
</P>
<P>
   `` 'You did? What check number was that? What bank was that
drawn on? The account number, please, so we can locate it in our
billing system. It was probably credited incorrectly to another
account, I'm sorry.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I now have the bank account information complete with your
account number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I have two options. First, call the automated line of the
bank where, by entering your account number and Social Security
number, the automated attendant will provide dates and amounts of
deposit and checks that have cleared as well as your balance. The
second option would be to call a customer service representative
and claim to be you, as I now have everything I need to impersonate
you.''

 &HT;    Luxury dream apartment? Try a locker in Penn Station
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Rumor has it that Hillary Rodham Clinton has
been apartment shopping in New York and is considering a co-op on
Manhattan's Upper West Side. She should have checked with me first.
I spent a year there one week looking for a place to live. I could
have told her that it's sometimes referred to as the ``city that
never sleeps'' because no one can afford a place to...
</P>
<P>
   It was 1960. My husband of five months had just been bumped out
of his junior co-pilot slot in Chicago and shipped to an even more
junior one in New York. The airline offered to pay for our move,
but we didn't own enough to bother. We had a little English car,
some clothes, a few pots and pans, and a set of dishes
</P>
<P>
   his grandmother had given us for a wedding present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be an adventure,'' I remember saying to him as we hung
onto a strap in the aisle of the Port Authority bus that was
shuttling us from LaGuardia into the city. His reply was a wan
smile.
</P>
<P>
   The airline sprang for two weeks in a mediocre hotel (the
elevators were working and so were the girls in the lobby) while we
searched for a place to live. Sunday morning we split up the Times
classifieds and took turns reading to one another. I went first:
``19th St. West. Bright, sunny studio. $400.'' My husband rolled
his eyes and told me to keep looking. I read another: ``77th St.
and 3rd Ave. Studio, neat. Good location. $625.'' Same response.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly reality was beginning to break through our youthful
naivete. We may have been from out of town, but it didn't take a
skyscraper to fall on us. The only place we could afford to live in
this town was beginning to look less like our dream apartment and
more like a locker in Penn Station. Time for a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning we contacted a rental agent, told him
what we were looking for and how much we could afford. He didn't
laugh, but he did take a phone call during our chat. Big smile:
``Yes, Mrs. Gotrocks, I have a beauty on Fifth near the park. Four
bedrooms, four baths, library, two fireplaces, and maid's room.''
There was a pause as he listened intently to the caller and then
casually added, ``Somewhere in the neighborhood of $150.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our kind of neighborhood,'' I enthused to my husband.
</P>
<P>
   The rental mogul hung up and turned back to us. Right away, I
told him I wanted one of those too. He tilted his head as though
bemused, sniffed once, and said he didn't think so. ``That's $150
per room.'' I ran up the numbers in my head and figured it out _ at
that rate, our housing budget would buy us three-quarters of a room
in a crummy neighborhood and we'd have to hope the missing
one-fourth wasn't the one with the plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious not to waste too much time on the pair from Podunk who
were taking up space on his Oriental, he half-heartedly handed my
husband a list. ``Try these and give me a call if you find
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of dejected kids hit the pavement and over the next two
days, we saw it all _ everything we could afford, anyway. There was
a studio on 53rd Street with a mattress on a shelf and the kitchen
cabinets painted shut. Another on 9th Avenue had the bathtub in the
kitchen, the toilet down the hall, and cockroaches everywhere. When
exhaustion set in, we settled on one room in the Village with a
purple toilet, and the stove in the living room. It wasn't pretty,
but we could pay the rent.

<P>
   If the rumor is true, the first lady is planning on moving into
a luxury, pre-war building where a two-bedroom apartment sells for
$700,000. A far cry from frying bacon next to the sofa bed, but who
knows where she's going to end up after she's dug into her savings
to bail out Bill.

 &HT;    Unlike home movies, video has reflections and, yikes,
inflections
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The last time I saw these shards of my youth they
were in a World War II ammunition box in Dad's basement. I wasn't
in that box alone. Brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, long-gone
loving pets, and a great grandpappy I never knew were there. We sat
together, wound tightly around 16-millimeter reels _ a
generation-and-a-half of silent home movies.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day in my Waco living room I held the whole ammo
box's contents in one hand, a brute feat made possible by
technology.
</P>
<P>
   My brother had copied them all, chronologically, on one two-hour
video cassette, a most magnificent gift.
</P>
<P>
   From the first national Boy Scout Jamboree in 1936 when my dad
and his brothers did a trapeze act for Franklin Roosevelt, to my
taking of a bride nearly five decades later, it's all on one reel
now.
</P>
<P>
   So, is this the near-death experience: having your life
fast-forward before your eyes. Thank goodness for the pause button.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing everything again for the first time on video accented
what we didn't record then and what we record now: voices.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is, thank heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about the indignities we've recorded from the mouths of
our babes in their formative years, I'm relieved to know there's no
way that I'll be similarly revealed.
</P>
<P>
   It's inglorious enough to be filmed at age 4 with a six-gun
holster around your bare belly, a cowboy hat sagging over your ears
as you fire at flood lights in the living room. Yes _ ahem. That's
me. We are left to imagine the sound effects I supply from my
crouched position, sort of a ``kew, kew.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, we have a 1987 home video of our oldest son, at 5.
He's also wearing a cowboy hat, but armed with a miniature guitar.
He is strumming, so to speak, a tune for his infant brother's
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Cowboy Buddy,'' he sings as he lyrically describes
how he fights bad guys, how he'll ``shoot and shoot and shoot'' if
need be.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about embarrassing. Let's invite all his high school
friends over.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, children aren't the only ones whose secrets are
better preserved in the silence of a home movie.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1952 home movie we have my dad showing off a newborn me in
his arms, strong and invincible.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1987 home video we have me holding up our youngest son as
he performs one of his first sounds: a slobbery motor-boat against
my upper arm. Then we get my startled yelp as the teething child
tries out a newborn incisor on unsuspecting Daddy's flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Home movies betrayed no yelps.
</P>
<P>
   Today's children are forever to be haunted by the high pitches
of their voices as they say childish things on tape. For all my
children know, I had my current mellifluous voice when I emerged
from the womb, and could sing ``Born Free'' with the ease I do
today.
</P>
<P>
   I shudder to think what will happen in years to come when
today's children start to run for public office, and when some
political hit man gets his hands on another's old home videos,
evidence sure to disgrace any statesman or stateswoman.
Undoubtedly, some day the pursuit of truth about candidates' past
lives will demand it.
</P>
<P>
   We'll see the unauthorized airing of grade-school tapes showing
a presidential candidate singing ``I'm a Little Teapot'' while
doing the gotta-go-to-the-bathroom dance that only a PTA program
can inspire.
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you, this will destroy great people.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I revel in the solemn silence as my long-lost
childhood purrs through the VCR. I never said anything embarrassing
as a child, to my recollection.

 &HT;    Pins and Needles (The Good Kind)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Pain, tough for anyone to beat, attacked
Esther Levow like one of her meanest karate opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, while in her early 20s, Levow nearly died when
a doctor gave her painkillers during an operation. Since then,
she's been terrified to take any pain relievers during medical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my heart stop,'' says Levow, a third-degree karate black
belt who otherwise is no shrinking violet. ``It's a little scary to
have that happen... I just want to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   So Levow resorted to an unusual counterpunch recently when told
she needed dental surgery: acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   And she isn't alone. With an increasing number of patients
reporting pain, fear and experiences like hers, local doctors have
become more open-minded about the blending of conventional and
alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a test,'' Levow recalls. ``After (the acupuncturist) put
the needles in, she stuck a needle directly into my gum to see what
would happen. I felt almost nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced she could use this alternative in her dentist's chair,
Levow got permission from Delray Beach, Fla. dentist Dr. Hyman
Friedman to bring the acupuncturist to his office. Before the
scaling, scraping and pulling he was to perform, the acupuncturist
_ Simm Gottesman of Deerfield Beach, Fla. _ carefully placed
needles on the side of Levow's face, her ear, and her hand to ease
her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt more than a bearable discomfort,'' Levow said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman was fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not work with every patient, but I was impressed,''
the dentist says.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the movement toward so-called ``alternative''
treatments may be driven by economics. Dr. David Eisenberg, an
assistant professor of medicine at Harvard University, led a survey
that found a sharp increase in the use of alternative medicine by
Americans from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever doctors' motivation, bastions of conventionality such
as The American Medical Association are taking alternatives
seriously. The AMA devoted the entire November issue of its journal
to alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Across the road from Jupiter Medical Center, where patients
undergo CAT scans and other high-tech medical procedures, the new
Mind/Body Institute offers alternative treatments from hydrotherapy
to acupuncture to therapeutic touch.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no real competition here between conventional and
alternative healing methods: The center is a department of the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 300 medical institutions are employing mind/body centers
in this country,'' says John Fritz, executive director of the new
institute. ``We feel we'll be able to show others how to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   A physician serves as medical director for the institute,
reviewing most patient's cases for appropriate treatment. Fritz
admitted it took some meeting of the minds before the medical
center's doctors were comfortable with the institute's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, which opened in November, was a gift to the
hospital from Guy and Jackie Fiske, area residents whose son is a
cancer researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are either referred by doctors or come in on their own.
And they're not always dealing with intractable pain, which drives
many to seek alternative care. The institute offers programs for
weight reduction, smoking cessation, and insomnia, Fritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the institute is part of the hospital, Fritz thinks it
might make people more comfortable seeking alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people would like to know more about what's
available, but they may not have a place to go they can trust,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And trust is a precious commodity, especially when treating
patients with chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   A-h-h-h-h.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cottrill lets out an explosive sigh.
</P>
<P>
   She is being treated for her chronic pain by Brett Ferrigan, a
licensed acupuncturist who isn't a medical doctor, but is certified
in Florida to perform the age-old treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He works at St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center in West Palm Beach.
It's on the campus of St. Mary's Hospital but is a separate
corporation and operates independently. The center has offered
alternative treatments for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Cottrill has acute pain from an operation 10 years ago that was
followed by a fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain changes you,'' she says, as Ferrigan strategically places
acupuncture needles in her feet and hands to relieve her suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Gardens resident has been through many medical
procedures for pain, she said, even nerve blocks. But results
varied. She tried acupuncture when her doctor suggested it.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrigan sticks a needle in the big toe of her right foot. When
the ``blocked energy'' that Ferrigan blames for the pain is
released, Cottrill flinches again, as if someone has clamped a
cardiac paddle on her chest and yelled, ``clear.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the acupuncture brings relief where conventional
painkillers haven't.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come primarily for pain,'' says Ferrigan, who has
started getting referrals from St. Mary's doctors. ``I like working
in a medical setting. It's very gratifying for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That type of partnership is growing.
</P>
<P>
   A task force from the National Institutes of Health found
acupuncture, a component of the Chinese health care system that can
be traced back at least 2,500 years, was ``widely practiced'' and
that ``promising results have emerged'' for nausea, vomiting and
post-operative dental pain.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, The American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, a
12-year-old society of medical doctors trained in acupuncture, has
seen its membership grow from 200 in 1991 to 1,550 today.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joan Barice, an Ivy League-trained doctor, practices her
skills on military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Barice works part-time at the Veteran's Administration Medical
Center in West Palm Beach. She's a longtime supporter of
alternative care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been treating VA patients more than a year with
acupuncture. I've heard nothing but good things from patients,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had some open-minded people in administration, good
supportive leaders. And they also recognize that when you're
working with chronic pain patients, and nothing has really relieved
that suffering, it's a useful adjunctive tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until not that long ago, doctors mistrusted chiropractors and
were resisting things they didn't know,'' Barice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, people are jumping on the bandwagon for a number of
reasons. Profit motivation, or patients want it. It's almost a
shotgun marriage in a lot of places between alternative and
traditional medicine.''

 &HT;    HEALTHBRIEFS: Drugs, light combat SAD symptoms
 &HT;    (EDS: This is a compilation of health stories which moved to the
wires this week.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Growing up in Pennsylvania, Tamara Alexander remembers
how bad she began to feel around September each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd become lethargic and moody and tearful, and I'd have a lot
of temper tantrums, starting from the time I was 10,'' says
Alexander, now 28 and a secretary at Emory University. ``I spent
much of my adolescence thinking I'm just an unhappy person.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until she turned 23 that Alexander's boyfriend
suggested she might be suffering from seasonal affective disorder _
depression caused by a shortage of sunlight during the fall and
winter months.
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatrist confirmed the diagnosis, prescribing the
antidepressant Prozac. Alexander also tried light therapy, spending
several hours a day in front of a specially designed box that gives
off a powerful exposure of full spectrum light to mimic natural
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Both therapies helped Alexander significantly, and they are the
only methods routinely prescribed to treat the disorder, which
afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. Winter blues _ milder
seasonal depression _ affects another 14 million people. For
reasons not entirely clear, four times as many women suffer from
SAD and winter blues as men.
</P>
<P>
   But many people who have SAD symptoms also try alternative
remedies, or use them to supplement light therapy and
antidepressants. Some of those treatments show promise _ St. John's
wort, for instance _ but doctors urge caution when trying
alternative methods.
</P>
<P>
   People who truly have SAD, and not other depressive disorders
that might mimic it, usually start treatment with antidepressants
such as Prozac or Paxil and light box therapy, says psychiatrist
Jeffrey Kelsey, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral
sciences at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Other treatments that might help: monitoring what you eat and
drink and taking brisk outdoor walks during sunlight hours. And if
you can swing a winter vacation, go to someplace sunny, Kelsey
advises.
</P>
<P>
   As for over-the-counter products or herbs, use caution, he says.
``Often medications that treat anxiety can worsen depression,''
Kelsey says.
</P>
<P>
   Taking sample of newborns' DNA useful tool, some parents find
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the freezer next to the frozen orange
juice, in a little foil pouch, Micky Cradit's mom keeps a sample of
his DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months ago, Micky became one of the first babies
genetically fingerprinted under a program _ now being proposed as a
state law _ that allows hospitals to take a newborn's blood sample
for future DNA identification. Not a bad idea, thought Micky's mom,
who also happens to be a lab tech at the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement's DNA lab, where blood samples are typically used to
find criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``DNA analysis is a powerful thing and a wonderful tool and
we're just starting to tap into all that can be done,'' said Rona
Kay Cradit.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Micky's venture into the high tech world of DNA
analysis began long before his birth, when the problem of child
abductions made national headlines with the disappearance of Adam
Walsh. A year after the 1982 kidnapping and slaying, FDLE created
its Missing Children Information Clearinghouse, which is
shepherding the program. So far, 1,300 babies have taken part in
trial sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The number of abducted children has remained fairly constant _
about 4,600 nationally every year _ but public attention to the
problem has intensified. Florida had 2,089 children reported
missing or abducted in 1997. But those numbers include children
lost at the mall or missing only briefly before being found.
</P>
<P>
   High profile cases like JonBenet Ramsey's have only increased
concern and generated ideas to help find children. Among them are
several home-test kits that use a child's saliva for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Mandating the sampling would ensure it is available to all
parents at a reasonable cost, said Rep. Bob Starks (R-Casselberry),
who drafted a Florida House bill. The kit costs only $1.40 and
hospitals can be reimbursed for the procedure through the state, he
said. Hospitals could choose to charge patients more than $1.40 for
the service.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, North Carolina started a similar program using a
federal grant with elementary school children. But when the grant
stopped, so did the program, Starks said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical conditions illustrated in 3-D
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ADAM Internet Health has acquired a library of videos
that can be used to illustrate _ in three-dimensional animation _
various medical conditions as they appear inside the body. The
announcement of the purchase from an Austrailian development
company came from the Atlanta-based company.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM's use of the Net is aimed at exploiting the growing use of
``streaming'' technology that lets computer users download and
watch video, said Robert S. Cramer Jr., ADAM's chairman and chief
executive. The company also depends on increasing use of broadband
technologies like digital subscriber lines and cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   But ADAM also will work CNN Newsource Sales, a Time Warner
company, to distribute the new video content to television
stations, which can use it to illustrate health and medical news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM recently announced a change of its name to reflect its new
Net-reliant strategy.

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Oxbow Power Corp. broke new ground last
week in the Central American power industry, starting construction
of a $70 million power plant it will build, operate for 15 years
and then turn over to the Costa Rican government.
</P>
<P>
   Called a build-operate-transfer agreement, the West Palm
Beach-based company says it will finish the ``build'' part of a
geothermal plant in northwestern Costa Rica by April next year.
It's the first BOT plant agreement in Central America, and the
first BOT geothermal outfit in all Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to make this plant a showcase of what we can do
there,'' says Oxbow Power President Bud Cherry. Co-owners of the
plant with Oxbow are Marubeni Corp. of Japan, a Costa Rican company
and the project financiers which include the InterAmerican
Development Bank, Cherry says. Oxbow and Marubeni put up $20.5
million of the $70 million cost.
</P>
<P>
   Oxbow Power is the most profitable affiliate of Oxbow Group, an
energy and minerals conglomerate privately held by Palm Beach
resident William ``Bill'' Koch. Oxbow Group, with 1998 revenue of
$475 million, ranks No. 482 on Forbes magazine's list of the Top
500 private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Oxbow's primary businesses are generating and selling
electricity, and mining and marketing coal and other energy
commodities. Forbes estimated the company's 1998 net profit to be
$50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Costa Rican project is the company's seventh power plant and
its fifth geothermal unit. Oxbow also has a geothermal plant under
construction in Mindanao, Philippines, and starts construction on a
coal-burning plant in eastern China in a few months, Cherry says.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 years, Oxbow and its partners expect to recoup all their
investment - plus a nice profit - before turning over the plant to
Costa Rica's national utility.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry says BOT's are good deals for developing countries and
are gaining popularity throughout the world. The host country gets
the plant, technology and expertise for free, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Costa Rican national utility owns two geothermal plants in
the same region, but awarded the bid to build the third to Oxbow
and Marubeni in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Geothermal plants use naturally occurring steam found thousands
of feet in the earth to turn turbines to generate electricity.
Oxbow bills geothermal as one of the most environmentally friendly
methods of power generation.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback of geothermal plants, though, is they must be built
where the steam occurs. And that is near volcanoes or in earthquake
zones where the earth's crust is thin and easier to drill through.
</P>
<P>
   The Costa Rican project is near a dormant volcano and in a
seismically active area, Cherry says.
</P>
<P>
   Oxbow Group _ at a glance
</P>
<P>
   Headquarters: West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Lines of business: Generating and selling electricity; mining
and marketing coal and other energy commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Employees: 900 worldwide, including 100 in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Operations: Mines and plants in various states, and power plant
projects in the Philippines, China and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated 1998 revenue: $475 million.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated 1998 net income: $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   As estimated by Forbes. Oxbow does not disclose.

 &HT;    Pins and Needles (The Good Kind)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Pain, tough for anyone to beat, attacked
Esther Levow like one of her meanest karate opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, while in her early 20s, Levow nearly died when
a doctor gave her painkillers during an operation. Since then,
she's been terrified to take any pain relievers during medical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my heart stop,'' says Levow, a third-degree karate black
belt who otherwise is no shrinking violet. ``It's a little scary to
have that happen... I just want to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   So Levow resorted to an unusual counterpunch recently when told
she needed dental surgery: acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   And she isn't alone. With an increasing number of patients
reporting pain, fear and experiences like hers, local doctors have
become more open-minded about the blending of conventional and
alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a test,'' Levow recalls. ``After (the acupuncturist) put
the needles in, she stuck a needle directly into my gum to see what
would happen. I felt almost nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced she could use this alternative in her dentist's chair,
Levow got permission from Delray Beach, Fla. dentist Dr. Hyman
Friedman to bring the acupuncturist to his office. Before the
scaling, scraping and pulling he was to perform, the acupuncturist
_ Simm Gottesman of Deerfield Beach, Fla. _ carefully placed
needles on the side of Levow's face, her ear, and her hand to ease
her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt more than a bearable discomfort,'' Levow said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman was fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not work with every patient, but I was impressed,''
the dentist says.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the movement toward so-called ``alternative''
treatments may be driven by economics. Dr. David Eisenberg, an
assistant professor of medicine at Harvard University, led a survey
that found a sharp increase in the use of alternative medicine by
Americans from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever doctors' motivation, bastions of conventionality such
as The American Medical Association are taking alternatives
seriously. The AMA devoted the entire November issue of its journal
to alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Across the road from Jupiter Medical Center, where patients
undergo CAT scans and other high-tech medical procedures, the new
Mind/Body Institute offers alternative treatments from hydrotherapy
to acupuncture to therapeutic touch.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no real competition here between conventional and
alternative healing methods: The center is a department of the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 300 medical institutions are employing mind/body centers
in this country,'' says John Fritz, executive director of the new
institute. ``We feel we'll be able to show others how to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   A physician serves as medical director for the institute,
reviewing most patient's cases for appropriate treatment. Fritz
admitted it took some meeting of the minds before the medical
center's doctors were comfortable with the institute's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, which opened in November, was a gift to the
hospital from Guy and Jackie Fiske, area residents whose son is a
cancer researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are either referred by doctors or come in on their own.
And they're not always dealing with intractable pain, which drives
many to seek alternative care. The institute offers programs for
weight reduction, smoking cessation, and insomnia, Fritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the institute is part of the hospital, Fritz thinks it
might make people more comfortable seeking alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people would like to know more about what's
available, but they may not have a place to go they can trust,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And trust is a precious commodity, especially when treating
patients with chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   A-h-h-h-h.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cottrill lets out an explosive sigh.
</P>
<P>
   She is being treated for her chronic pain by Brett Ferrigan, a
licensed acupuncturist who isn't a medical doctor, but is certified
in Florida to perform the age-old treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He works at St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center in West Palm Beach.
It's on the campus of St. Mary's Hospital but is a separate
corporation and operates independently. The center has offered
alternative treatments for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Cottrill has acute pain from an operation 10 years ago that was
followed by a fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain changes you,'' she says, as Ferrigan strategically places
acupuncture needles in her feet and hands to relieve her suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Gardens resident has been through many medical
procedures for pain, she said, even nerve blocks. But results
varied. She tried acupuncture when her doctor suggested it.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrigan sticks a needle in the big toe of her right foot. When
the ``blocked energy'' that Ferrigan blames for the pain is
released, Cottrill flinches again, as if someone has clamped a
cardiac paddle on her chest and yelled, ``clear.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the acupuncture brings relief where conventional
painkillers haven't.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come primarily for pain,'' says Ferrigan, who has
started getting referrals from St. Mary's doctors. ``I like working
in a medical setting. It's very gratifying for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That type of partnership is growing.
</P>
<P>
   A task force from the National Institutes of Health found
acupuncture, a component of the Chinese health care system that can
be traced back at least 2,500 years, was ``widely practiced'' and
that ``promising results have emerged'' for nausea, vomiting and
post-operative dental pain.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, The American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, a
12-year-old society of medical doctors trained in acupuncture, has
seen its membership grow from 200 in 1991 to 1,550 today.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joan Barice, an Ivy League-trained doctor, practices her
skills on military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Barice works part-time at the Veteran's Administration Medical
Center in West Palm Beach. She's a longtime supporter of
alternative care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been treating VA patients more than a year with
acupuncture. I've heard nothing but good things from patients,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had some open-minded people in administration, good
supportive leaders. And they also recognize that when you're
working with chronic pain patients, and nothing has really relieved
that suffering, it's a useful adjunctive tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until not that long ago, doctors mistrusted chiropractors and
were resisting things they didn't know,'' Barice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, people are jumping on the bandwagon for a number of
reasons. Profit motivation, or patients want it. It's almost a
shotgun marriage in a lot of places between alternative and
traditional medicine.''

 &HT;    Fashion editor kisses the tomboy look goodbye
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The ponytail is still on the dashboard
of my car, wrapped in a red rubber band.
</P>
<P>
   The eyebrows are just plain gone.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to kick off a monthly makeover series, I
figured, than to have one myself. We could headline it, ``Fashion
editor leaps, then looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I like how it turned out. Chase Thomas (of Chase Salon in
West Palm Beach) was creative, funny and patient during what turned
out to be five hours in the chair, makeup and all.
</P>
<P>
   My fault. ``With you, we started from scratch,'' Thomas said
cheerfully, stepping back yet again and squinting.
</P>
<P>
   We certainly did.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up a tomboy. My thick hair had been long and straight for
the past decade, and my morning routine consisted of applying
lipstick and concealer, then grabbing a tissue and rubbing it off.
I was dull but happy.
</P>
<P>
   Then I got The Insult.
</P>
<P>
   A model who shall remain nameless came by the office one day to
show off a line of cosmetics. Miffed that I wasn't going to write a
story about it, she leaned in and sneered, ``How can you be a
beauty editor if you don't even wear makeup?''
</P>
<P>
   As silly as the question was, it sounded like a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A makeover seemed like a simple enough experiment. Here was the
chance to be glamorous, at least until I slept on it. The only rule
was that I be open to anything.
</P>
<P>
   Chase already had a plan. He wanted to put highlights in the
hair, cut it short and tweeze the eyebrows into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Strange, it was just as everyone predicted in the days preceding
the makeover. ``If it's that obvious,'' I wondered, ``why didn't
someone throw me down and do this before?''
</P>
<P>
   Chase whacked off the ponytail and trimmed the rest into sort of
an egg shape, then put blonde highlights along the hairline from
ear to ear. In the rest, he massaged a golden-auburn glaze. ``It
goes with your coloring,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Then he bleached the eyebrows, colored them the same shade and
spent a good hour plucking. It opens the eye area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It also gave me time to worry. Will the eyebrows grow back?
(Yes.) And if they do, will they be two-tone? (Unless I keep
bleaching them, yes.)
</P>
<P>
   For makeup, Chase used light eye shadow colors near the nose to
widen my close-set eyes. He applied medium-brown eyeliner and
mascara on the upper lids, and drew the mauve, Sandra
Bernard-shaped lips himself.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say I could duplicate it the next morning. The same old
lipstick and concealer got the same old dab-and-wipe.
</P>
<P>
   But the hair was a nice surprise. Right away I stumbled on a
nice, tousled style _ wash it, sleep on it, rake fingers through it
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad you can't do that with clothes.

 &HT;    Socialite diary: `This is sort of the art of being a woman'
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Lesley Friedman is a self-made woman.
She created a temporary-lawyer business in New York, sold it and
became a multimillionaire, then retired early and moved to Palm
Beach, Fla., four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then she took a look at herself.
</P>
<P>
   She never had the time before, she says. She and other women at
the law firm had purposely dressed conservatively, even matronly.
She got manicures when she remembered to, and she let her naturally
curly hair be. Makeup and styling really didn't make a difference,
she thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes on dates, I would wear my business suit,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She was too busy to bother. ``I had the attitude of, `This is
me, successful and smart. People are going to like me no matter how
I look.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She never married. When she retired, she realized that the
young, natural look starts to go in the mid-30s. And if she was
going to take the trouble to correct it, she figured, wouldn't it
be nice to have someone around to admire the work?
</P>
<P>
   So, a year and a half ago, she got started. She lost 25 pounds
on a variety of diets and hired a New York fashion consultant at
$100 an hour. She shipped her entire wardrobe by UPS to New York,
and the consultant threw almost everything out. Friedman, nervous,
learned to get used to low-cut necklines and tight pants. For the
first time in her life, she teetered on stiletto heels.
</P>
<P>
   As she changed she tackled dating, to a degree (73 blind dates
in one year) that The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page feature
story about her new ``job.'' She got hundreds of calls, some very
odd, but also a book deal. The topic: ``How I'm using my business
skills to find a mate.'' There's talk of a movie, and if that comes
about she wouldn't mind Meg Ryan in the lead role.
</P>
<P>
   She's finding, though, that her transformation is neither
complete nor permanent, and it certainly isn't cheap. It takes
hours of maintenance, and last week she was willing to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   With classical music playing softly and a vanilla aromatherapy
candle flickering, she lies back in a chair at Deborah Koepper's
Palm Beach salon and waits for her newest treatment, a light
electric current that is supposed to tone the facial muscles _ at
$75 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman is refreshingly open. The only thing she keeps quiet
about is where she gets waxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I didn't care about this s---,'' she says.
``But when things started happening to me, it got really
bothersome.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman lives alone in Palm Beach and travels often to New York
or California, where she grew up in a Los Angeles suburb and
skipped dating to study.
</P>
<P>
   When in town, she spends her days working out at Mar-a-Lago,
visiting the salon, dating, going to parties, working on her book
and wondering if she started all of this a little too late.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman won't quite reveal her age. ``That's like asking a man
about his net worth,'' she says. She only admits to 37 and told The
Wall Street Journal she only admits to 39.
</P>
<P>
   Size is easier. She is a 6 or 8 on top and a 8 to 10 on the
bottom, and she still wants to lose another 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   With the weight loss and the straightened and colored hair and
the dental work and the contact lenses, she looks nothing like her
driver's license photo anymore.
</P>
<P>
   She walks into the salon in slim black pants and a peach-colored
scarf around her neck one day, and the next she comes in wearing a
lime-colored tank minidress. ``I wouldn't have worn this dress
before,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her New York fashion consultant, Sheila Grant, remembers meeting
Friedman with her ``sacky'' dresses and her ``long, kind of bushy''
hair. ``She had no real sense of fashion or style, to be honest
about it,'' Grant says. ``As much as she was sort of reluctant, it
was a very exciting process.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a tall blonde who admits to having had a face lift at 47,
is used to seeing women like Friedman. ``Many, many women wake up
at age 40 and say, `My God, I don't have a life.' It's a panic
button. For Leslie, she had made all this money and was wonderful
and independent, but she wanted a personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   After dumping most of Friedman's clothes, Grant took her on a
three-day shopping spree for a 77-piece fall and winter wardrobe,
and even went with her to the hairdresser. In that first year,
Friedman spent into the six-figure range on clothes alone.
</P>
<P>
   Grant would dress her for her dates, and the two still talk
nearly every other day. Last week, Friedman needed to a buy a coat
for a romantic weekend in the Hamptons, and Grant described what
she needed over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Friedman thought the clothes were too young, too sexy.
``I want to be taken very seriously, for my brains,'' she says. But
she squeezed into the 3-inch stilettos and the strapless cocktail
dresses just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still fiddle,'' she says, ``but I try not to do it in
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Her seasonal wardrobes are bought to mix and match. For one
season, she says, they bought four pairs of tight pants, three
cashmere turtleneck sweaters and four blazers. The spring corner of
her walk-in closet is full of lime greens and peaches, which go
well with her skin tone, and the usual black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Grant taught her to wear long jackets (``You're hippy''), high
heels with pants and low-cut tops (``I have a good chest'').
Friedman used to buy what was trendy or cute. Now she gets what
flatters her body shape, and when it doesn't she has learned to use
a tailor.
</P>
<P>
   She shops at Luca Luca, Escada, Celine, and Armani, but she can
walk just as easily into Ann Taylor, Banana Republic and the Gap.
``You can find a copy of an Armani at Ann Taylor,'' Friedman says.
And she goes to Nine West for ``great knockoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   About accessories, she knew zip. ``I didn't understand you don't
take a purse like this out at night,'' she says, pointing to her
beige Charles Jourdan bag. She went to Books-A-Million and bought a
book on how to tie a scarf, and packs about 15 scarves when she
travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how the French women do it,'' she says, as she gets a
pedicure. ``They spend a fortune on accessories, and clothes-wise
they have just a few pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   She switches chairs, tissue paper stuffed between her toes, to
get her blow dry and manicure done simultaneously. At 11 a.m., two
hours after walking into the salon, the blow dry is over and the
base coat is on. ``I'm going to be here three hours today,'' she
says, marveling at the time. ``It's ridiculous. But I'm not gonna
cut back.''
</P>
<P>
   She grabs a phone. Usually she checks her messages, or chats, or
plans what clothes she will pack for an upcoming trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is flying to New York for a date? Wow, it must be
nice!'' Deborah Koepper says to Friedman, preparing her for makeup.
</P>
<P>
   She dabs on concealer _ ``She had the facial yesterday, so her
face is nice and plump and moisturized'' _ and peach-colored blush,
to show off Friedman's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   All Friedman will have to do the rest of the day, Koepper says,
is touch up her Glossy Maple lipstick (Koepper's own brand). And
she's right _ lipstick is usually the only makeup Friedman carries
in her purse.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items for her weekend getaway are already laid out
on the table in her living room. Among the jewelry is a copy of
Chic Simple's What Should I Wear? She's more confident in her
judgment now, but a little help is nice.
</P>
<P>
   She is, of course, not finished with her changes. ``She's not
willing to accept any imperfections now,'' Grant says. They consult
about getting her ``undereyes'' done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel like this is my creative expression,'' Friedman
explains. ``Before, I was doing nothing, just being casual. But
this is sort of the art of being a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The facial
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $135 per session
</P>
<P>
   How often: Every two weeks
</P>
<P>
   (Another $75 buys a 15-minute session using electrical current
to tone up the face muscles)
</P>
<P>
   The pedicure
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $38 per session
</P>
<P>
   How often: Every two weeks
</P>
<P>
   (Toe polish color is Fine Red Wine)
</P>
<P>
   The manicure
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $18 per session
</P>
<P>
   How often: Every week
</P>
<P>
   (Nail color is Bashful Beige)
</P>
<P>
   The blow-dry
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $40-$45 per session
</P>
<P>
   How often: Twice a week
</P>
<P>
   (If she's careful, a blow dry can last a week)
</P>
<P>
   The makeup
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $50 per session
</P>
<P>
   How often: About twice a week
</P>
<P>
   (The finishing touch is the lip lacquer, to make her lips look
wet. ``Men don't like to kiss it, though, because it gets on
them,'' she says)
</P>
<P>
   The closet
</P>

 &HT;    HEALTH: Nerve stimulation may decrease epileptic seizures
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: Ohio, Texas editors.)
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Sometimes Bob and Margaret Stone can actually
watch the electrodes in their son's neck cut off an epileptic
seizure.
</P>
<P>
   They see Chris Stone start to stiffen up while he's sleeping, a
sure sign a seizure is beginning. But before he starts flailing and
kicking, they see him let out a deep breath and go limp again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just stops,'' Margaret says.
</P>
<P>
   The young Beavercreek man's seizures had grown progressively
worse through adolescence, and medication hadn't seemed to help
much when he met Dr. Robert Simkins 16 months ago. Simkins had just
become medical director of Kettering Medical Center's epilepsy
center, arriving there from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
Since 1990, he had been part of research in Texas into a device for
treating epilepsy that was comparable to a cardiac pacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   So soon after the device went on the market, Chris became the
first person in the Miami Valley, Ohio area with a vagus nerve
stimulator (VNS). It was implanted last June by Dr. Theodore
Bernstein, a neurosurgeon who works with Simkins at the Wallace
Kettering Neuroscience Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Indications are the VNS will at least be as effective as brain
surgery, Simkins says, and certainly safer for many of the 25
percent of epileptics whose seizures can't be controlled by
medication. It works by stimulating areas in the brain that are
associated with starting, stopping and preventing the electrical
short circuits that cause seizures in the 2.5 million Americans
with epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after the surgery, Simkins says Chris' seizures
have decreased by more than 75 percent. It seems more like about 30
percent to Margaret, but she says the ones he has are shorter and
less apt to wake up her and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, 20, wouldn't know. His seizures strike only when he's
sleeping. ``I've never realized when my seizures took effect,'' he
says, ``and I've never remembered them.''
</P>
<P>
   He has seen the holes he kicked in walls, though. He remembers
the two times in the year before surgery that he needed stitches
for cuts near his eye. He knows his bedroom furniture is bolted to
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pretty lucky he hasn't damaged himself more,''
Margaret says. ``He's had some violent ones where he gets out of
bed and kicks or rolls on the floor and hollers.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no obvious cause for 60 percent of epilepsy cases, but
head injuries are related to the rest and suspected in many others.
Babies with epilepsy, for example, might have been injured during
birth.
</P>
<P>
   Chris had his first seizure when he was 6 months old. When he
was about 5, his petit mal seizures would cause him to lapse into a
faraway stare, or maybe climb under his school desk and punch
himself. ``His teacher thought he was just making trouble,''
Margaret says.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis came at 7. The batteries of tests never really
seemed to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of stumbled into Dr. Simkins,'' Margaret says.
They were looking for a different, more communicative doctor just
as Simkins was opening his clinic.
</P>
<P>
   In Chris, Simkins found a patient whose various medications
helped no more than slightly and whose brain monitors didn't
identify the problem in a particular part of the brain that could
be surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always stick electrodes in people's brains and operate
on people,'' Simkins says, but the low success rate isn't worth the
risk. Vagus nerve stimulation, on the other hand, has regularly
reduced seizures by 40 percent to 50 percent in clinical trials,
with rates continuing to drop for as long as three years after the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   When Simkins proposed the VNS implant, ``It was not a hard
decision,'' Chris said before the operation. It required just two
small incisions, under the collarbone to insert the device and in
the neck to attach its wiring to the nerve. If it didn't help, it
could be removed.
</P>
<P>
   His epilepsy wasn't debilitating. It didn't stop Chris from
setting up a seasonal lawn-mowing business or playing sports,
including softball and soccer after high school. But he couldn't
spend a night outside his bedroom, with his parents nearby, and his
medications left him too drowsy to try college even if they were
only minimally effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get these seizures under control,'' he said
last spring. Sure, he was nervous about the operation. But this was
his best hope.
</P>
<P>
   The device is about the size of a small pocket watch, according
to manufacturer Cyberonics Inc. Chris and his parents can use a
magnet to start it any time, and Simkins has used a wand to adjust
the stimulator's strength and schedule several times. It's
currently at a low strength and a quick cycle, on for seven seconds
and off for 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideas behind this device go back hundreds of years,''
Simkins says, to the observation that epilepsy patients who rubbed
their arms as seizures began seemed to stop their progression. The
vagus nerve is one of the body's largest; it sends impulses from
the brain to control heart rate, bowel function and limb movement,
among other things, and it carries impulses back to the parts of
the brain that are especially active during seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only can vagus nerve stimulation abort a seizure, it can
also help prevent a seizure,'' Simkins says. How? ``We have no
idea. We know the areas it affects, but we're only scratching the
surface.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stones have noticed a mystery of their own since adding a
puppy to the household after Chris' surgery. ``This dog seems to
know when he's going to have a seizure,'' Margaret says, ``and runs
back there before we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the family often feels as though it is running in
place as it waits for continued improvement. Chris wants to go to
college. He wants a career in law enforcement. ``I'd like to get
into the Air Force if I ever got rid of the epilepsy,'' he says.
``I want to get on with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret hopes he'll soon have more freedom, to drive or simply
to be left alone. They all find their encouragement in the progress
he has made so far, of which they're reminded every morning. As
Margaret says, ``We're definitely getting more sleep.''

 &HT;    Homeless man's pride a strong survivor of ordeal
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. _ My appointment with 61-year-old Bill
DeRuiter was for 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   When at 8:10 a.m. I knocked on his dumpster and asked, ``Bill,
are you up?'' a gravelly voice rumbled from within.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir, I overslept. Can you come back?''
</P>
<P>
   Good acoustics, I thought. Of course I could come back. The fact
is, I felt funny about interviewing a man who lived in a trash bin
beside a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   I had been referred to DeRuiter by his old Palm Beach High
School classmate, Chuck Otterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Bill in high school, Class of '56,'' Chuck told me.
``He was a fine athlete and very popular with boys and girls. I
think he went on to marry and put a couple of daughters through
Cardinal Newman.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck said that other classmates in the area were aware of the
man's plight, and they had been known to drop by the store to say
hello. Usually, Otterson said, they would bring a six pack or a
carton of cigarettes. Outright offers of money embarrass DeRuiter,
but if you offer to buy him something to eat, he likes a Cuban
sandwich slightly warmed in the microwave, and if you insist on
buying him something to wash it down with, he will mention that
your best value is a quart of Milwaukee's Best at 99 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean is that all we can do?'' Chuck asked. ``It doesn't seem
right, somehow. I guess the thing that I keep thinking about is
that if Bill DeRuiter can end up on the street, it can happen to
anybody. Maybe he would talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   When I first approached De-Ruiter at the West Palm Beach
convenience store he calls home, he had just finished pumping gas
for an elderly woman who tipped him a dollar. I introduced myself,
saying right up front that one of his old high school buddies was
worried about him, and would he mind being interviewed?
</P>
<P>
   DeRuiter's leathery, sun-ravaged face split into a dazzling
smile of recognition. ``Sure, I know you, Ron. I read your stuff in
the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries prevent working
</P>
<P>
   At first, he balked at the write-up. He said that he hit the
skids after his second marriage ended, leaving him depressed. A bad
back and two operations to have disks removed have left him unable
to work for sustained periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people know me, and I don't want them coming down
here trying to give me money. I've gotten myself into this mess and
I have nobody to blame but myself. Now if you're going to ask me a
bunch of stupid questions, we're going to stop right now.''
</P>
<P>
   So what if I stuck to smart questions?
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough, he nodded, and although our first appointment found
DeRuiter under the weather, some days later we did sit down beside
the waist-high metal dumpster that is his shelter from cold and
rain these past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dumpster is clean,'' he said. ``Just cardboard in there,
no garbage. The garbage goes into that other one,'' he said,
indicating a companion container next to his sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   DeRuiter's life these past few years is days telescoped into
days, one with little to distinguish it from another. The store
closes at 11 p.m. and opens at 6 a.m. DeRuiter does not sleep well
even if he stays warm and tolerably dry in his metal box. Road
noise is magnified. Passersby awake and alarm him.
</P>
<P>
   He is a night watchman without portfolio, a flesh and blood
extension of the convenience store, keenly aware that without the
indulgence of the management, DeRuiter would have to sleep
elsewhere. He tidies the grounds and washes windows. On Mondays he
stocks shelves. When he sees anyone struggling with the gas pumps
or in a hurry, he pumps gas.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes DeRuiter is tipped; often patrons take the smiling
service for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the manager has a job that DeRuiter can handle, he taps
on the window and DeRuiter rises out of his lawn chair by the
dumpster. He trades such services for smokes and an occasional
sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   DeRuiter recalls a night two years ago when thieves smashed a
window with a concrete block and took off with cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped up and called 911. A train hit the car on the
crossing, and killed everybody inside, three or four of them as I
recall. I went there and gathered all the cigarettes I could
salvage and gave them to the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Wake-up rattle
</P>
<P>
   The manager, DeRuiter volunteers, ``rustles me out in the
morning if I oversleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one fine Haitian gentleman,'' he declares. ``They don't
come no better.''
</P>
<P>
   If this peculiar symbiotic relationship between a homeless man
and a store endures, it may have something to do with DeRuiter's
manner, almost courtly in a way reflexive to men who were reared to
respect elders and to address everyone as ``ma'm'' or ``sir.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you threaten the one possession DeRuiter has left _ his
dignity _ he will let you know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not beg,'' he said. ``I have never stood at an
intersection with a sign, no sir, I will not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you do ask DeRuiter if he will accept money, he fixes you
directly with amazing blue eyes and says ``Yes sir, I will,'' and
when you give it to him, he says, ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   DeRuiter is blade thin and does not look like he gets enough to
eat. When he's asked if he eats enough, he answers matter of
factly: ``Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he cracks a smile and laughs. ``Let's put it this way,
Ron, I'm happy to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He dates his depression to the breakup of his second marriage
and the collapse of the house cleaning business with his second
wife. Before that, he was a surveyor for Ranger Construction Co.,
and somewhere in his work history, according to a classmate, he
managed a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Children?
</P>
<P>
   ``Four,'' he answered. ``Two by my first marriage and my second
wife had two.''
</P>
<P>
   And here, probing was not welcome. DeRuiter's children know
where to find him, and they do visit him on holidays and birthdays.
When I got nosy, he brought me up on stupid question charges.
</P>
<P>
   He could not pinpoint precisely when he became homeless. The
unraveling, he guesses, began about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't work since those disks were taken out, and I've had a
cancer taken out of my nose.'' The skin on his face, hands and neck
are fearfully damaged from thousands of hours spent under the
relentless Florida sun, reading in his lawn chair by his dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   Out of `the system'
</P>
<P>
   When I suggested that DeRuiter's depression could be treated and
that his back problems would surely qualify him for disability
payments, it was clear that I had touched a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disability? No, sir, I tried that and got beat. And I'm not
taking no damned drugs!'' Then he backed off a turn, and smiled.
``Cigarettes is enough drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   I went into the store and bought a pack of Dorals. His friend,
the store manager, declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned, DeRuiter was shooting the breeze with Frank
Bowman, who works odd jobs and checks in on DeRuiter every day or
two. A police officer came out of the store with a cup of coffee
and waved amiably in DeRuiter's direction. ``Hi, Bill, how's it
going?''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman told me that De-Ruiter knows dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people who like Bill. They stop by and give
him books and magazines. I know he reads a lot. There should be
something better for him than a dumpster.''
</P>
<P>
   When DeRuiter and I picked up the thread of our conversation he
remembered that he had gotten a bit testy with some of my
aggravating questions and said quietly, ``You can't always treat
people the way you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   In one phrase, it seemed, he had captured the essence of
civility.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bill, why not go into a shelter? Again, the testiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sleep with the loud music and the television going.
People have asked me to stay with them, but I feel obligated, and I
won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   I had saved my last question because I wasn't sure I wanted the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   What does Bill DeRuiter have to look forward to?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be 62 July 14 and get Social Security. When I get my
first check, I'll get my own little place.''
</P>
<P>
   And until then?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get up in the morning, the manager gives me a cup of
coffee and I feel better. People stop by and say, `Hi, Bill,' and
it kind of gives you a lift. It picks you up.''
</P>
<P>
   A day or two later, DeRuiter mentioned to customer LaJan Gartner
that I was writing him up for the newspaper. She called to pass on
something for my story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel safer when I'm at the store because Bill is there,''
the West Palm Beach legal secretary said. ``If you'll notice, it's
one of the cleanest convenience stores around. Bill pumps my gas
and is very thankful for anything I give him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Super Bowl Sunday I stopped by the store, and DeRuiter was
fiddling with a 5-inch battery-powered TV set someone had loaned
him to watch the game. Channel 29 was coming in like gangbusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this something?'' he exclaimed, marveling. ``When it
gets dark it will be even better!''
</P>
<P>
   That was quintessential Bill DeRuiter, living life in the
moment, looking forward to something better, just hanging in there
until his 62nd birthday.

 &HT;    Animals favored in advertising
 &HT;    Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Guy walks into a bar, and the barkeep says to him,
``What'll ya have?''
</P>
<P>
   And the guy says, ``I'll have what the frog's drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the guy goes into a fast food joint and orders the taco
that's favored by a Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   Things like this seldom happen in life.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it, then, that they happen so often in TV commercials,
where animals seem to be challenging humans as product endorsers?
</P>
<P>
   The Madison Avenue menagerie includes frogs and lizards for
Budweiser, a Chihuahua for Taco Bell, gophers for BellSouth
Mobility, dogs for RCA, cows for Chick-fil-A and a beaver for
Planters Peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising experts say animals are eye-catching, memorable and
lovable, as well as less expensive and _ in some cases _ safer than
human endorsers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Budweiser frogs can do goofy things and convey the relaxed
nature of having a few drinks,'' says Richard Morgan, who covers
the ad industry for the trade paper Variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's politically incorrect to have humans doing the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Animals have long been a favorite with advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most memorable commercials of the '70s, for instance,
featured a dog biting sour cream salesman Sam Breakstone. And, in
the 1980s, Alex the dog fetched Stroh's beer.
</P>
<P>
   What changes, says Mark Dolliver, an Adweek magazine editor, is
the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago the popular dog was Jack Russell terriers,''
he says. ``Now it's a Chihuahua.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, breakthroughs in technology _ the so-called ``Jurassic
effect'' _ have made it easier to make animals seem to talk, as
cats do in a current Freshstep litter commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all those goodies, you can make animals more likable than
people,'' says Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Animals don't guarantee a campaign's success, says Luke
Sullivan, creative director for WestWayne, the Atlanta ad agency
that put gophers in the BellSouth mobility ad. ``They have to fit
the problem you're trying to solve or the market you're trying to
reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's own agency ran a commercial for Publix Super Markets
that featured monkeys interrupting a family's picnic _ for reasons
that were unclear. The spot was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   More successfully, the agency put gophers in the BellSouth
mobility ad because they look like office workers poking their
heads above cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has another animal spot in the works, a humorous
commercial for NAPA Auto Parts featuring a bear that eats a man.
</P>
<P>
   What the connection between that and spark plugs, oil filters
and fan belts?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that market hunts and camps,'' says Sullivan, ``so
it's relevant to them.''
</P>
<P>

Atlanta, Ga.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ There's a delicious new thrill running through
conservatives, who sometimes seem to like nothing more than scaring
themselves with lurid frights. This one has President Clinton
veering to the far left after escaping the impeachment posse. (Tom
Teepen is national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ As I sat down to write this, I intentionally
placed my late father's timeworn, quarter-sized green union button
on the desk in front of me, not only as a reminder of where I came
from, but as a notation of my personal lifelong support of the
American labor movement. I put the pin of Local 133 of the Club and
Restaurant Employees Union _ dad once had been a bartender _ so
that I wouldn't go off the deep end in what I had to say about the
sick-out against American Airlines and the paying public by the
Allied Pilots Association _ so arrogant that it initially ignored a
federal judge's demand that the pilots return to work. (Howard
Kleinberg is a former editor of the Miami News.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ After relocating to New York
with my husband of five months, ugly reality was beginning to break
through our youthful naivete. The only place we could afford to
live in this town was beginning to look less like our dream
apartment and more like a locker in Penn Station. (Elizabeth
Schuett, a teacher and writer in Gibsonburg, Ohio, writes twice a
week for Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ It's inglorious enough to be filmed at age 4 with
a six-gun holster around your bare belly, a cowboy hat sagging over
your ears as you fire at flood lights in the living room. Yes _
that's me. We are left to imagine the sound effects I supply from
my crouched position, sort of a ``kew, kew.'' By contrast, we have
a 1987 home video of our oldest son, at 5. He's also wearing a
cowboy hat, but armed with a miniature guitar. He is strumming, so
to speak, a tune for his infant brother's benefit. ``My name is
Cowboy Buddy,'' he sings as he lyrically describes how he fights
bad guys, how he'll ``shoot and shoot and shoot'' if need be. Talk
about embarrassing. Let's invite all his high school friends over.
(Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

naturally curly hair be. Makeup and styling really didn't make a

voice rumbled from within. ``No, sir, I overslept. Can you come

   EPILEPSY-SEIZURES _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Chris Stone starts to stiffen
up while he's sleeping, a sure sign a seizure is beginning. But
before he starts flailing and kicking, they see him let out a deep
breath and go limp again. The young man's seizures had grown
progressively worse through adolescence, and medication hadn't
seemed to help much when he met Dr. Robert Simkins 16 months ago.
Since 1990, Simkins had been part of research in Texas into a
device for treating epilepsy that was comparable to a cardiac
pacemaker. Soon after the device went on the market, Chris became
the first person in the Miami Valley, Ohio area with a vagus nerve
stimulator (VNS). Indications are the VNS will at least be as
effective as brain surgery, Simkins says, and certainly safer for
many of the 25 percent of epileptics whose seizures can't be
controlled by medication. It works by stimulating areas in the
brain that are associated with starting, stopping and preventing
the electrical short circuits that cause seizures in the 2.5
million Americans with epilepsy. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

 &HT;    Holbrooks uses Twains' wit for political revenge on stage
 &HT;    (EDs: W/BIO BOX at end of story.)
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hal Holbrook is mad as heck about a lot of things:
politicians, tabloid journalists, junk-filled cable channels,
Shakespeare productions in Nazi uniforms, to name but a few.
</P>
<P>
   But the actor doesn't have to stew in silence. He has a secret
weapon named Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been agitated and fed up with the political scene lately
_ the country's come unhinged, for God's sake!'' declares Holbrook,
``So I'm grateful for Twain to get things off my chest.'' He's been
performing ``Mark Twain Tonight!'' since he was 29 and will perform
it Wednesday, his 74th birthday, at the Fox Theatre. (He'll also
step in briefly next month for Brian Dennehy in the acclaimed
Broadway revival of ``Death of a Salesman.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Twain was in top form on the idiocies of politics,'' Holbrook
continues, ``so I've added new material on that subject. These days
I just say the word `Congress' and the crowd goes beserk! They know
something hilarious is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Twain's wit at my disposal is revenge on all the morons
of the current scene,'' Holbrook adds with hearty, wicked laugh. He
sounds a Twainlike curmudgeon with his twangy Ohio-Massachusetts
accent (he modulates it to a Missouri drawl for the role) by phone
from his Los Angeles home. ``It's like having a machine gun: I get
to stand up there and mow 'em all down!''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Rowe Holbrook Jr. has performed ``Twain'' at least one
night in each of the last 45 years, sometimes slipping a show into
the odd pause between TV and movie roles. ``Twain'' is the sire,
and still king, of today's many solo shows. It's a compendium of
sly satire, crackerbarrel philosophy, timeless truths on human
foibles and excerpts from such Twain classics as ``The Innocents
Abroad'' and ``Huckleberry Finn.'' The show is so long-lived and
indestructible that it's almost taken for granted _ carved into the
American landscape like Mount Rushmore _ though it's hard to
imagine that Holbrook's ever done it better than now.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was only recently that he caught up with Twain in
age. ``I've always played Twain as 70, as he was in 1905, because
by then he'd written all the pieces I use in the show. Accuracy is
important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Making Twain authentic: Holbrook purchased a series of
turn-of-the-century photographs of Twain at his Connecticut home,
enlarged and mounted them on the floor and walls of a room in his
home. ``I stood there for hours studying the pictures, looking this
way and that, absorbing the body langauge, the way Twain tilted his
head or held his cigar.'' The six-foot actor wears a too-long
jacket to appear closer to Twain's height of five-eight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Finding his sea legs: ``I went aboard a Mississippi steamboat
similar to one that Twain used to pilot. The decks were so tilted,
to let water run off, that to keep my balance I found myself sort
of shuffling, sliding my right foot out in front. Twain's gait was
described in exactly that way. So I keep the deck in mind when I'm
rehearsing the show.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keeping it straight: Holbrook has returned to regional stages
in Shakespearean roles in the '90s. He'll play Shylock in an
upcoming production of ``The Merchant of Venice'' at The
Shakespeare Theatre of Washington, D.C. ``I do these roles because
I genuinely enjoy them; what I don't enjoy is seeing Shakespeare
jerked around to different periods. When they bring on the Nazi
uniforms, I don't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bliss at home (and on TV): In commercials for the Yellow
Pages, Holbrook plays second banana to actress wife Dixie Carter as
she uses the phone book to make make lavish purchases. Holbrook
grumbles or smiles ruefully in the background, playing a sort of
George Burns to her Gracie Allen: ``Dixie and I are often that way
with each other, so we've enlarged it into a kind of routine. I
call her a loon. She's very Southern and improvisational. I with my
New England background tend to be more organized. I watched her
pack the other day. She folded one dress very carefully, then a
second one, then closed the suitcase, saying, `I don't want
anything to get crushed.' `Crushed?!' I said, `There's nothing but
empty space in there!' She took seven suitcases. But she's utterly
adorable.''  &QR;  The other side of Dixie: ``My wife is an astute
observer of acting. I run my `Salesman' lines at home, and the
other day she said, `Hal, don't use a character voice, keep it in
your own voice. Remember, your dad was gone when you were young.
You had troubles with your own son. You've spent 50 years on the
road. You think you're not close to Willy Loman?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Not slowing down: ``I once woke up in Spokane and found my
flight was fogged in. I had to make a connection in Seattle for a
(``Twain'') performance that night. I told my stage manager to rent
a town car and meet me at the hotel. I took the wheel and we roared
286 miles across Washington _ luckily the snow had just been plowed
in the Cascades _ in just over three hours. That's an average of 86
miles per hour. I was 69 at the time.''

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ There's a delicious new thrill running through
conservatives, who sometimes seem to like nothing more than scaring
themselves with lurid frights. This one has President Clinton
veering to the far left after escaping the impeachment posse. (Tom
Teepen is national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ As I sat down to write this, I intentionally
placed my late father's timeworn, quarter-sized green union button
on the desk in front of me, not only as a reminder of where I came
from, but as a notation of my personal lifelong support of the
American labor movement. I put the pin of Local 133 of the Club and
Restaurant Employees Union _ dad once had been a bartender _ so
that I wouldn't go off the deep end in what I had to say about the
sick-out against American Airlines and the paying public by the
Allied Pilots Association _ so arrogant that it initially ignored a
federal judge's demand that the pilots return to work. (Howard
Kleinberg is a former editor of the Miami News.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ After relocating to New York
with my husband of five months, ugly reality was beginning to break
through our youthful naivete. The only place we could afford to
live in this town was beginning to look less like our dream
apartment and more like a locker in Penn Station. (Elizabeth
Schuett, a teacher and writer in Gibsonburg, Ohio, writes twice a
week for Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ It's inglorious enough to be filmed at age 4 with
a six-gun holster around your bare belly, a cowboy hat sagging over
your ears as you fire at flood lights in the living room. Yes _
that's me. We are left to imagine the sound effects I supply from
my crouched position, sort of a ``kew, kew.'' By contrast, we have
a 1987 home video of our oldest son, at 5. He's also wearing a
cowboy hat, but armed with a miniature guitar. He is strumming, so
to speak, a tune for his infant brother's benefit. ``My name is
Cowboy Buddy,'' he sings as he lyrically describes how he fights
bad guys, how he'll ``shoot and shoot and shoot'' if need be. Talk
about embarrassing. Let's invite all his high school friends over.
(Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   SCHOOLS-RACE (San Francisco) _ Patrick Wong, Brian Ho and Hilary
Chen were turned away from the San Francisco public schools of
their choice for one undisputed reason: They are Chinese Americans.
By policy, Chinese American kids must score higher on admissions
exams than students of other races. The families of the students
filed a class-action lawsuit seeking to overturn San Francisco's
desegregation plan. By JULIAN GUTHRIE.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOLS-LOWELL (San Francisco) _ At the vortex of the most
high-stakes lawsuit in the history of San Francisco's public
schools is Lowell High School, a fiercely competitive campus that
is being shaped by race. It is Lowell that required Chinese
American students to score higher than kids of other races in an
attempt to bring diversity into its hallowed halls. By JULIAN
GUTHIRE.
</P>
<P>
   CHINESE-CALENDAR (San Francisco) _ John Kim doesn't like to
discuss it, but there's no getting around it: he was born in the
Year of the Rabbit. ``It's not a pleasure being a bunny,'' he said.
``At work, you want to be taken seriously.'' Starting Tuesday, this
is the year of the rabbit by the Chinese lunar calendar. By JULIE
CHAO.
</P>
<P>
   FAT-PROTEST (San Francisco) _ Despite protests from fat
activists, a health club is refusing to budge from its new ad that
suggests that overweight people will be the first to be devoured by
hungry space aliens when the invasion comes. By ULYSSES TORASSA.
</P>
<P>
   TET-OFFENSIVE (San Antonio) _ Thirty-one years after the Tet
Offensive in Vietnam, one-time Air Force Airman 1st Class Alonzo J.
Coggins was honored for his bravery. By SIG CHRISTENSON.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS-FOOD (Albany, N.Y. ) _ It's no mystery that many
prescription drugs don't mix well with each other and that taking
drugs with alcohol is almost always a mistake. But it may surprise
you to learn that sometimes food and drugs interact in ways that
may be bothersome or even harmful. The culprits may include such
seemingly benign and healthy foods as milk, leafy green vegetables
and grapefruit juice. By SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACHMENT-CLASS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Here's an opinion on
impeachment you didn't hear in the U.S. Senate last Friday: ``If
the sex helps him do his job better, so be it,'' said Kelly Davis.
She was telling the more than 100 students attending the ``Sex,
Lies and Impeachment'' class at the University at Albany that the
president should be held to a lower standard than most Americans.
By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN.
</P>
<P>
   MENSWEAR (New York) _ The fall '99 menswear collections opened
with an edgy salvo from Kenneth Cole, who didn't even bother to
acknowledge that there were any other colors but black, gray and
navy. Cole's collection, however, set the pace for everyone else in
terms of cut (sleek and boxy at the same time) and attitude (young,
urban, futuristic). By CYNTHIA ROBINS.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNAPP-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The ad in USA Today, titled ``In
tribute to Reggie White,'' included a short letter signed by more
than 100 NFL players. The letter's conclusion was bold-faced: ``So
get ready, America, because we're standing with Reggie to defend
the Gospel.'' The point, however carefully veiled, seemed clear.
White has been criticized for his brand of Christianity only once.
He took up the anti-gay cause last spring, using religion as a
cover for bigotry. By GWEN KNAPP.
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (Yosemite National Park, Calif.) _ America's
greatest lookout, normally crowded beyond comprehension, can now be
visited with only a few souls within miles. It is Glacier Point, of
course, where the scope of view is unparalleled. By TOM STIENSTRA.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ My friend and colleague, Fred
LeBrun, and I disagree on President Clinton. My thoughtful view was
that the president had committed felonies, ``high crimes` by
definition. Therefore, even if the effort to oust him was partisan
(it was), even if he'd been trapped into a position where he would
be tempted to break the law (he was) and even if you find his
policies generally acceptable (I do), he still had to go. LeBrun's
laughable position, on the other hand, was that it was all a put-up
job over a private sexual encounter, and that Clinton should stay.
By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ President Clinton survived
impeachment, but, thanks to the Monica Lewinsky scandal, his public
life will never be the same. It's safe to assume his personal life
has been similarly altered? By STEPHANIE SALTER.

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Sitting on a bamboo-slatted bench, widow
But Lin crumbled dried lumps of cooked rice in a basket and talked
about what she wants to happen to the Khmer Rouge leaders who
brutalized her country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we arrest them, we should cut off their heads,'' said the
52-year-old. ``In fact, if they asked me to do this, I am willing
to do it myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost six children from starvation and my husband and parents
were killed,'' she went on. ``I am still alone today. We cannot
forget that regime. No Cambodian people can forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an outburst seemed incongruous from this fragile-boned
woman in simple clothes and rubber sandals, a poor woman who saves
burned rice.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after the Khmer Rouge fell from power, a day of
judging them approaches. But Lin hopes it will put her anger to
rest.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations team of three legal experts is scheduled this
month to recommend to Secretary General Kofi Annan whether to start
action against the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders living openly in
Cambodia. Some form of international tribunal likely will be
proposed to hear evidence against the men who masterminded the
madness that left as many as two million Cambodians dead in less
than four years, from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all Cambodians, including the leaders of this wary
country, view the prospect of trials with the same longing as the
widow But Lin.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who believe that only justice can release the ghosts
shackling their country often fear justice well might bring new
dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be cautious and consider how to avoid a civil war
before holding any trial,'' said Sau Sisovanna, a Cambodian
economics professor and government adviser, who sadly described
Cambodians as ``hostages to fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that 3,500 wiry guerrilla fighters finally abandoned
their Khmer Rouge jungle camps this month, switching allegiance and
uniforms to the Cambodian army, provided little relief from that
fear.
</P>
<P>
   These were believed to comprise the last sizable groups of
hard-line rebels holding out in jungle military bases. Cambodian
defense officials hailed their ``integration'' into the regular
army as the final dissolution of Khmer Rouge power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet photos of a ceremony in Anlong Veng, a rebel center in north
Cambodia, showed some fighters putting on their new army uniforms
over their old guerrilla fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodia Daily quoted one ex-guerrilla as pronouncing in one
breath, ``The Khmer Rouge is dead,'' but in the next adding that he
would keep his old uniform ``just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Some rebel commanders among the defecting troops were not
convinced they would remain government adherents, admitting they
would be tempted to go back to the bush if their old Khmer Rouge
leaders called on them for support.
</P>
<P>
   The key leaders now are living openly in Pailin, a town on the
Thai border the government virtually ceded them as an enclave when
they began agreeing to lay down their weapons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   These are the men most likely to face any international
judgment, and some have made it clear they will not do so quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Senior leader Leng Sary, once the number three Khmer Rouge
commander, warned that any trial could have disturbing
consequences. His new political union in Pailin issued a statement
that ``in order to make our nation live in peace'' the courts
``should not try this or that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Khmer Rouge were ultra-Maoist communists, who emptied the cities
and forced Cambodians into groveling peasant lives. They killed
almost one-sixth of the population through execution and torture,
and left others to die from starvation, exhaustion and disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge were ousted when Vietnamese troops swooped into
Cambodia in 1979, but thousands who were not killed or captured
continued fighting from jungle hideouts.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Most Cambodians interviewed believed the remaining Khmer Rouge
could not mount a large-scale civil war today, but feared they
could cause plenty of trouble in an unsettled, poverty-stricken
nation that can only pay its teachers the equivalent of (US)$20 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small troops cannot make war, but small troops with a will to
survive, to save their lives, could be a terrible source of
suffering for the country,'' said Ok Serei Sopheak, coordinator of
the Cambodian Center for Conflict Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia's autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has tried to break
the back of Khmer Rouge power by luring leaders and fighters to
defect from their fighting units and peacefully rejoin society,
demanding no accounting from them for the bloody tyranny they
imposed.
</P>
<P>
   His policy of appeasing them finally drew protests at home and
abroad last December, when two of the last major Khmer Rouge
leaders left their jungle hideouts. The prime minister treated them
like visiting dignitaries and suggested the past should be
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   After a public outcry, Hun Sen has vacillated over whether and
how the Khmer Rouge should be tried. Even if there is an
international tribunal, Cambodian government accord will be crucial
to making it work.
</P>
<P>
   Many here believe a trial is essential not only to reconcile the
past, but to assure the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of violence is in the mentality of our people,''
said Thun Sary, 47, the president of a Cambodian human rights group
called Ad Hoc(CQ). ``Impunity is the precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes a trial of Khmer Rouge principals is necessary if
Cambodia ever hopes to rein in its rogue police and military who
still torture and kill, if it expects to end official corruption
and judicial partiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still feel, 'If we have the force, we can do
anything,''' he said. ``We need to do something about this case.''

   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ As a snowstorm rages outside, what to
do on a deep winter afternoon while hanging around in your small,
musty Russian digs?
</P>
<P>
   Catch a soap opera or maybe some music videos on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   At the St. Petersburg Zoo, orangutans Monika and Rabu(CQ both)
are literally hanging around -- from the steel bars of their cage
-- watching TV. Sequestered upstairs in a makeshift nursery, their
three-month-old son Ramon is wearing Pampers and being bottle-fed
baby formula by a human.
</P>
<P>
   Such parental neglect is not what the zookeepers had in mind.
The orangutans were exposed to television with the hope that it
would help Monika learn how to be a better mother.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the St. Petersburg Zoo learned a fundamental lesson of
our century: merely turning on a television set does not make it a
tool of education.
</P>
<P>
   Monika, who came to the zoo as a toddler in 1987, was raised in
captivity and thus never taught the lessons she would have learned
in the jungles of Sumatra. When her son Ramon was born on Nov. 20
she showed motherly concern, but did not bond where it counted. She
showed no interest in breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials recalled reading about zoos in America that used
instructional videos to help primates like Monika learn what would
have been instinctively imparted in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Petersburg, they did not have the educational videos, but
they had a color TV set. They rigged it outside the cage in the
primate house in hopes that wildlife programs on Russian broadcast
channels would give Monika the right idea.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work. After a few days young Ramon was taken from his
mother to be fed by bottle and sleep in a crib complete with sheets
befitting a strapping young boy -- they are emblazoned with
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, downstairs in the cages of the decaying 19th-century
zoo the television experiment continued.
</P>
<P>
   Rabu, the male orangutan, initially became so captivated with TV
that he ignored his mate.
</P>
<P>
   Monika was upset over being neglected. She stood between her man
and the TV screen. She grabbed him in an effort to distract him
from the set (complete with rabbit ears and a remote control --
which are out of reach of the pair).
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, she gave up and joined him, seeming to enjoy
cartoons, soap operas and music videos (though Monika became highly
excited one day when a nature program showed a lion).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they've calmed down. They watch it together. If something
comes on they don't like, they do something else,'' says Yelena
Goraschenkova, veteran zoologist in the primate department.
</P>
<P>
   Their TV viewing is limited to no more than an hour a day and
monitored by the staff, who have been in contact with officials at
Zoo Atlanta and the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago for more information
about videotaped programs to inspire orangutan motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Monika was already something of a local celebrity before her
exposure to television. Scientists from the Pavlov Institute gave
her art supplies in a comparative study on the development of
primates and human children. Some of her unquestionably abstract
artwork, in watercolors, crayon and pencil, was auctioned off at a
local gallery to benefit the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Rabu also tried his hand at drawing. ``But Monika was far, far
better -- no comparison,'' says Goraschenkova.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of Monika's plight hasn't exactly rivalled the story of
another Monica, even in Russia. But it has made the Russian papers
in a splash of sexual sensationalism. It was reported, not so
correctly, that Rabu had become a television addict and no longer
found Monika desirable, ruining the pair for life.
</P>
<P>
   But their love endures, confirmed when a male newspaper reporter
stepped too close to the cage to take a look at Monika, provoking a
jealous Rabu to spit at him, several times, and then caress
Monika's hand.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   In a more momentous tone, with the country's economy in the
dumps and its politics not much better, some observers suggested
that Monika's story in a way reflects the plight of Russia today.
</P>
<P>
   The zookeepers had a notion of the way things worked at some
American zoos and so turned on the TV, an ultimately superficial
and unsuccessful experiment in the same way post-communist Russia
has tried and failed to emulate the democratic and free-market
West.
</P>
<P>
   But that weighty analysis runs much too deep. After all, it's a
pair of TV-watching orangutans who favor music videos over
documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like pop,'' says Natalya Popova, curator of the zoo's
primate exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet wary about creating an impression that the zoo is creating a
couple of orangutan delinquents, she quickly adds: ``They haven't
developed a dependence on TV -- yet.''

   To some, they're frightening. To others, they seem almost
magical. Their webbed wings help them soar through the night sky.
Their echolocation skills are a wonder. They are bats, one of the
most successful creatures on the planet: One out of every four
mammal species is a bat. Bats have left few fossils behind, so
their evolution remains an enigma among researchers. One of the
major points of contention is which came first, echolocation or
flight. Carl Zimmer, senior editor at Discover magazine, discusses
the debate in the scientific community over these unusual
creatures.

   A clever hacker could insert a virus in an innocent-looking
e-mail and wreak havoc for the unwary computer owner. So far, that
hasn't happened, although flaws have been found in certain e-mail

experts believe, is an interloper finding his or her way into an

   Nancy Simmons went down to the jungles of French Guiana in 1991
with the seemingly simple mission of determining how many species
of bats live in one place. She surveyed her site for three field
seasons. She was overwhelmed by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up getting 78 species of bats from an area that was
within a three-kilometer walk of our camp, just a pinprick on the
map.''
</P>
<P>
   The great variety of bats seen today is just part of the larger
evolutionary mystery surrounding these creatures. Simmons, who
works at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, is a
paleontologist by training. Before she entered the jungle to look
for live bats, she had spent years studying a miserably scrappy
record of bat fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Bats are not good candidates for paleontological study. When
they die, they usually disappear. Often they are eaten by
scavengers; if not, they decompose on the ground. The muscles and
membranous skin that make up their wings rot away. As a result
there are only a handful of complete bat fossils in the entire
world.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists like Simmons have studied those few relics
assiduously because, living or dead, bats pose one of evolution's
supreme puzzles. A few other mammals may be able to glide from tree
to tree, but only bats have evolved true powered flight. In fact,
only two other vertebrates _ birds and pterosaurs _ ever managed
this feat. But with little fossil evidence to go by, it's hard to
figure out how bats did it.
</P>
<P>
   What did the first bat look like, and how did it survive? And
how did bats diverge into the forms they take today? Piecing
together the story of bat evolution requires researchers to
determine in what order bats' marvelous flying and echolocating
(locating objects by means of reflecting sound waves) equipment
developed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s one intriguing scenario was constructed by Brock
Fenton, a zoologist at York University in Ontario. Fenton suggested
that bats became echolocaters first and only later acquired the
ability to fly.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that a bat ancestor running through trees at night
on four legs, catching insects to survive, might have found it
could hear the faint echo of its calls as they bounced off a bug
flying past. Its descendants might have started to reach for
passing insects, and evolution would then have favored protobats
with longer and longer arms, and with webbing between their fingers
to help them catch their prey.
</P>
<P>
   Their calls would have become more focused and powerful, and
they might have been able to start gliding from tree to tree.
Eventually their descendants could fly under their own steam and
catch insects in midflight.
</P>
<P>
   That model came under fire, however, when John Speakman, a
zoologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, measured the
metabolic cost of an echolocating pulse and found that it cranked
up the animal's metabolism by a factor of nine. And that was for a
stationary bat _ how could a bat handle both that cost and the huge
metabolic cost of flight simultaneously?
</P>
<P>
   But when Speakman then measured the energy expenditures of bats
while they are flying, he got a surprising result. Bats, it turns
out, can use the energy required for flying to echolocate for free.
</P>
<P>
   The contracting muscles not only move the bat's wings but also
squeeze its rib cage, pushing the air out of its lungs and through
its voice box, creating the echolocating pulses.
</P>
<P>
   These results have led Speakman to question whether the earliest
bats could have evolved echolocation before flight, since it takes
so much effort while perching. Instead he has suggested that flight
and echolocation evolved hand in hand, improving by little steps
together.
</P>
<P>
   As with any transition in evolution, you can craft all sorts of
plausible scenarios for how bats came to be. The genealogy of bats
is a murky matter, though, and has inspired some pretty exotic
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, for example, John Pettigrew of the University of
Queensland in Australia suggested that megachiropterans, the giants
of the bat world, weren't bats at all but were actually closer to
primates.
</P>
<P>
   Largely in response to Pettigrew's work, there was an avalanche
of bat research in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Simmons was one of
those involved.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of paleontologist Jonathan Geisler, also of the
American Museum of Natural History, Simmons gathered together the
findings of other bat experts and examined many species of bats
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Based on her studies she adds her support to the idea that
megachiropterans are indeed bats and not primates with wings, as
Pettigrew claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity of their wiring to that of the brains of
primates, she says, is just a sign that both groups got their start
using vision to live nocturnally. Thus all bats seen today, from
large, big-eyed fruit eaters to small, echolocating insect hunters,
descend from a common ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she also concludes that the megachiropterans did split away
from other bats long ago. Those fossil bats, she says, are actually
on the path toward microchiropterans, or ``little bats,'' the
suborder to which most bats belong.
</P>
<P>
   That means, Simmons points out, that the common ancestor of all
today's bats and the known fossils could already fly. And that
megachiropterans, while they have undergone a fair amount of
evolution since those early days, are in some ways relic
representatives of those first forms. Those ancient bats, she
reasons, couldn't echolocate. The few megachiropterans that can
echolocate today seem to have evolved the ability independently
from their smaller cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to test the ideas of Simmons and Speakman and
others will be to get more evolutionary information. But
considering how hard it is to find bat fossils, it may be quite
some time.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Simmons will be returning to the jungles of
South America (this time Peru) to catch more living bats. There are
enough mysteries flying around in the night to keep her busy.

 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A computer virus that could hide in an innocent-looking e-mail
message, slip past antivirus software and erase the files on your
hard drive would be a hacker's dream _ and a nightmare for the rest
of us. Fortunately, there is no such virus _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But in July, computer engineer Marko Laakso and his colleagues
at the University of Oulu in Finland found a worrisome security
hole in three popular e-mail programs _ Microsoft Outlook Express,
Outlook 98 and Netscape Mail. A clever hacker, the Finnish
researchers warned, could exploit this flaw and transform an
ordinary bit of e-mail into a carrier for a data-destroying virus.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw arose not from some fancy new software feature but from
an old problem common to many e-mail programs. The programs'
designers assumed that the name of an e-mail attachment (something
linked to the message, such as another document or an image) would
be fairly short, so they set a 200-character limit for the length
of the name. If the name exceeds that limit, the extra data could
cause your computer to crash or possibly even instruct it to run a
rogue program hidden in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common flaw, but one that's easy to fix,'' says
security specialist William Orvis of the Computer Incident Advisory
Capability at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California. The almost embarrassingly simple solution is to rewrite
the software so that the program shortens names longer than 200
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Netscape quickly publicized the problem and
offered free corrective software on their Web sites. A few days
later, Qualcomm announced that its popular Eudora e-mail software
contained a different flaw, which could allow a seemingly innocuous
Web link contained in an e-mail message to trigger a virus program.
The solution again was relatively simple. Despite the quick fixes,
however, the media and the Internet buzzed with news of a
frightening-sounding and pervasive vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were largely groundless, says Orvis, who points out
that there has never been a documented case of a virus infecting a
computer as a result of someone reading e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anyone bitten by this attack,'' he says.
``Not that many people know how to exploit it. And if you did, the
FBI would be on your case very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negative media coverage focused on everybody's
favorite villain, Microsoft. The software giant was charged with
skimping on security and offering an initial software fix that did
not cover all the potential weak spots in its Outlook e-mail
programs. But Laakso cautions that ``most of the major vendors make
the same kind of mistake.'' Moreover, other computer security
problems are far more serious than the threat posed by e-mail
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Hernan, who works at the Computer Emergency Response Team
at Carnegie Mellon, points to the much greater danger of intruders
who hack their way into Internet service providers _ the companies
that provide connections to the Internet. He notes that CERT has
received reports of interlopers invading computer systems operated
by hospitals, corporations and software vendors. Hernan blames
these broader security problems on sloppiness among the companies
that develop and sell the susceptible software _ and on the people
who buy their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They produce what the public demands: feature-rich, faster,
easier-to-use products,'' he says. Security usually ranks very low
on the list of consumer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   People and companies that depend seriously on the sanctity of
their communications will need to be more cautious, says Orvis. He
gives this advice: Be careful and be prepared (in other words,
don't ever take candy _ or any free software _ from strangers, and
don't leave the only copy of your magnum opus on your hard drive).
Keeping on top of software updates and paying close attention to
security advisories will also help.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem like an awful lot of effort to the casual computer
user. But when it comes to computer security, the options are few.
People could choose to disconnect from the Internet _ an isolated
computer is, after all, a completely secure one. Or they could just
accept that sometimes things will go wrong.

contained a different flaw, which could allow a seemingly innocuous
Web link contained in an e-mail message to trigger a virus program.
The solution again was relatively simple. Despite the quick fixes,
however, the media and the Internet buzzed with news of a
frightening-sounding and pervasive vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were largely groundless, says Orvis, who points out
that there has never been a documented case of a virus infecting a
computer as a result of someone reading e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anyone bitten by this attack,'' he says.
``Not that many people know how to exploit it. And if you did, the
FBI would be on your case very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negative media coverage focused on everybody's
favorite villain, Microsoft. The software giant was charged with
skimping on security and offering an initial software fix that did
not cover all the potential weak spots in its Outlook e-mail
programs. But Laakso cautions that ``most of the major vendors make
the same kind of mistake.'' Moreover, other computer security
problems are far more serious than the threat posed by e-mail
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Hernan, who works at the Computer Emergency Response Team
at Carnegie Mellon, points to the much greater danger of intruders
who hack their way into Internet service providers _ the companies
that provide connections to the Internet. He notes that CERT has
received reports of interlopers invading computer systems operated
by hospitals, corporations and software vendors. Hernan blames
these broader security problems on sloppiness among the companies
that develop and sell the susceptible software _ and on the people
who buy their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They produce what the public demands: feature-rich, faster,
easier-to-use products,'' he says. Security usually ranks very low
on the list of consumer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   People and companies that depend seriously on the sanctity of
their communications will need to be more cautious, says Orvis. He
gives this advice: Be careful and be prepared (in other words,
don't ever take candy _ or any free software _ from strangers, and
don't leave the only copy of your magnum opus on your hard drive).
Keeping on top of software updates and paying close attention to
security advisories will also help.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem like an awful lot of effort to the casual computer
user. But when it comes to computer security, the options are few.
People could choose to disconnect from the Internet _ an isolated
computer is, after all, a completely secure one. Or they could just
accept that sometimes things will go wrong.

<P>
   Nancy Simmons went down to the jungles of French Guiana in 1991
with the seemingly simple mission of determining how many species
of bats live in one place. She surveyed her site for three field
seasons. She was overwhelmed by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up getting 78 species of bats from an area that was
within a three-kilometer walk of our camp, just a pinprick on the
map.''
</P>
<P>
   The great variety of bats seen today is just part of the larger
evolutionary mystery surrounding these creatures. Simmons, who
works at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, is a
paleontologist by training. Before she entered the jungle to look
for live bats, she had spent years studying a miserably scrappy
record of bat fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Bats are not good candidates for paleontological study. When
they die, they usually disappear. Often they are eaten by
scavengers; if not, they decompose on the ground. The muscles and
membranous skin that make up their wings rot away. As a result
there are only a handful of complete bat fossils in the entire
world.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists like Simmons have studied those few relics
assiduously because, living or dead, bats pose one of evolution's
supreme puzzles. A few other mammals may be able to glide from tree
to tree, but only bats have evolved true powered flight. In fact,
only two other vertebrates _ birds and pterosaurs _ ever managed
this feat. But with little fossil evidence to go by, it's hard to
figure out how bats did it.
</P>
<P>
   What did the first bat look like, and how did it survive? And
how did bats diverge into the forms they take today? Piecing
together the story of bat evolution requires researchers to
determine in what order bats' marvelous flying and echolocating
(locating objects by means of reflecting sound waves) equipment
developed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s one intriguing scenario was constructed by Brock
Fenton, a zoologist at York University in Ontario. Fenton suggested
that bats became echolocaters first and only later acquired the
ability to fly.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that a bat ancestor running through trees at night
on four legs, catching insects to survive, might have found it
could hear the faint echo of its calls as they bounced off a bug
flying past. Its descendants might have started to reach for
passing insects, and evolution would then have favored protobats
with longer and longer arms, and with webbing between their fingers
to help them catch their prey.
</P>
<P>
   Their calls would have become more focused and powerful, and
they might have been able to start gliding from tree to tree.
Eventually their descendants could fly under their own steam and
catch insects in midflight.
</P>
<P>
   That model came under fire, however, when John Speakman, a
zoologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, measured the
metabolic cost of an echolocating pulse and found that it cranked
up the animal's metabolism by a factor of nine. And that was for a
stationary bat _ how could a bat handle both that cost and the huge
metabolic cost of flight simultaneously?
</P>
<P>
   But when Speakman then measured the energy expenditures of bats
while they are flying, he got a surprising result. Bats, it turns
out, can use the energy required for flying to echolocate for free.
</P>
<P>
   The contracting muscles not only move the bat's wings but also
squeeze its rib cage, pushing the air out of its lungs and through
its voice box, creating the echolocating pulses.
</P>
<P>
   These results have led Speakman to question whether the earliest
bats could have evolved echolocation before flight, since it takes
so much effort while perching. Instead he has suggested that flight
and echolocation evolved hand in hand, improving by little steps
together.
</P>
<P>
   As with any transition in evolution, you can craft all sorts of
plausible scenarios for how bats came to be. The genealogy of bats
is a murky matter, though, and has inspired some pretty exotic
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, for example, John Pettigrew of the University of
Queensland in Australia suggested that megachiropterans, the giants
of the bat world, weren't bats at all but were actually closer to
primates.
</P>
<P>
   Largely in response to Pettigrew's work, there was an avalanche
of bat research in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Simmons was one of
those involved.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of paleontologist Jonathan Geisler, also of the
American Museum of Natural History, Simmons gathered together the
findings of other bat experts and examined many species of bats
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Based on her studies she adds her support to the idea that
megachiropterans are indeed bats and not primates with wings, as
Pettigrew claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity of their wiring to that of the brains of
primates, she says, is just a sign that both groups got their start
using vision to live nocturnally. Thus all bats seen today, from
large, big-eyed fruit eaters to small, echolocating insect hunters,
descend from a common ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she also concludes that the megachiropterans did split away
from other bats long ago. Those fossil bats, she says, are actually
on the path toward microchiropterans, or ``little bats,'' the
suborder to which most bats belong.
</P>
<P>
   That means, Simmons points out, that the common ancestor of all
today's bats and the known fossils could already fly. And that
megachiropterans, while they have undergone a fair amount of
evolution since those early days, are in some ways relic
representatives of those first forms. Those ancient bats, she
reasons, couldn't echolocate. The few megachiropterans that can
echolocate today seem to have evolved the ability independently
from their smaller cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to test the ideas of Simmons and Speakman and
others will be to get more evolutionary information. But
considering how hard it is to find bat fossils, it may be quite
some time.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Simmons will be returning to the jungles of
South America (this time Peru) to catch more living bats. There are
enough mysteries flying around in the night to keep her busy.

   In 1986, for example, John Pettigrew of the University of
Queensland in Australia suggested that megachiropterans, the giants
of the bat world, weren't bats at all but were actually closer to
primates.
</P>
<P>
   Largely in response to Pettigrew's work, there was an avalanche
of bat research in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Simmons was one of
those involved.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of paleontologist Jonathan Geisler, also of the
American Museum of Natural History, Simmons gathered together the
findings of other bat experts and examined many species of bats
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Based on her studies she adds her support to the idea that
megachiropterans are indeed bats and not primates with wings, as
Pettigrew claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity of their wiring to that of the brains of
primates, she says, is just a sign that both groups got their start
using vision to live nocturnally. Thus all bats seen today, from
large, big-eyed fruit eaters to small, echolocating insect hunters,
descend from a common ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she also concludes that the megachiropterans did split away
from other bats long ago. Those fossil bats, she says, are actually
on the path toward microchiropterans, or ``little bats,'' the
suborder to which most bats belong.
</P>
<P>
   That means, Simmons points out, that the common ancestor of all
today's bats and the known fossils could already fly. And that
megachiropterans, while they have undergone a fair amount of
evolution since those early days, are in some ways relic
representatives of those first forms. Those ancient bats, she
reasons, couldn't echolocate. The few megachiropterans that can
echolocate today seem to have evolved the ability independently
from their smaller cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to test the ideas of Simmons and Speakman and
others will be to get more evolutionary information. But
considering how hard it is to find bat fossils, it may be quite
some time.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Simmons will be returning to the jungles of
South America (this time Peru) to catch more living bats. There are
enough mysteries flying around in the night to keep her busy.

   A computer virus that could hide in an innocent-looking e-mail
message, slip past antivirus software and erase the files on your
hard drive would be a hacker's dream _ and a nightmare for the rest
of us. Fortunately, there is no such virus _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But in July, computer engineer Marko Laakso and his colleagues
at the University of Oulu in Finland found a worrisome security
hole in three popular e-mail programs _ Microsoft Outlook Express,
Outlook 98 and Netscape Mail. A clever hacker, the Finnish
researchers warned, could exploit this flaw and transform an
ordinary bit of e-mail into a carrier for a data-destroying virus.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw arose not from some fancy new software feature but from
an old problem common to many e-mail programs. The programs'
designers assumed that the name of an e-mail attachment (something
linked to the message, such as another document or an image) would
be fairly short, so they set a 200-character limit for the length
of the name. If the name exceeds that limit, the extra data could
cause your computer to crash or possibly even instruct it to run a
rogue program hidden in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common flaw, but one that's easy to fix,'' says
security specialist William Orvis of the Computer Incident Advisory
Capability at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California. The almost embarrassingly simple solution is to rewrite
the software so that the program shortens names longer than 200
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Netscape quickly publicized the problem and
offered free corrective software on their Web sites. A few days
later, Qualcomm announced that its popular Eudora e-mail software
contained a different flaw, which could allow a seemingly innocuous
Web link contained in an e-mail message to trigger a virus program.
The solution again was relatively simple. Despite the quick fixes,
however, the media and the Internet buzzed with news of a
frightening-sounding and pervasive vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were largely groundless, says Orvis, who points out
that there has never been a documented case of a virus infecting a
computer as a result of someone reading e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anyone bitten by this attack,'' he says.
``Not that many people know how to exploit it. And if you did, the
FBI would be on your case very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negative media coverage focused on everybody's
favorite villain, Microsoft. The software giant was charged with
skimping on security and offering an initial software fix that did
not cover all the potential weak spots in its Outlook e-mail
programs. But Laakso cautions that ``most of the major vendors make
the same kind of mistake.'' Moreover, other computer security
problems are far more serious than the threat posed by e-mail
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Hernan, who works at the Computer Emergency Response Team
at Carnegie Mellon, points to the much greater danger of intruders
who hack their way into Internet service providers _ the companies
that provide connections to the Internet. He notes that CERT has
received reports of interlopers invading computer systems operated
by hospitals, corporations and software vendors. Hernan blames
these broader security problems on sloppiness among the companies
that develop and sell the susceptible software _ and on the people
who buy their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They produce what the public demands: feature-rich, faster,
easier-to-use products,'' he says. Security usually ranks very low
on the list of consumer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   People and companies that depend seriously on the sanctity of
their communications will need to be more cautious, says Orvis. He
gives this advice: Be careful and be prepared (in other words,
don't ever take candy _ or any free software _ from strangers, and
don't leave the only copy of your magnum opus on your hard drive).
Keeping on top of software updates and paying close attention to
security advisories will also help.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem like an awful lot of effort to the casual computer
user. But when it comes to computer security, the options are few.
People could choose to disconnect from the Internet _ an isolated
computer is, after all, a completely secure one. Or they could just
accept that sometimes things will go wrong.

COUPES ARE BACK _ THOUGH THEY NEVER WENT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coupe is back in favor in the automobile world. It isn't
that these two-door models ever left the car scene, but this year
they are `in' as never before. And more new models are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a sign that buyers are nostalgic for the cars of their
youth or do these cars have an aura of performance combined with
sex appeal?
</P>
<P>
   For the manufacturers, it seems an easy way to gain a more
``youthful'' market and jazz up what might be considered a dull car
line.
</P>
<P>
   The coupe is not the most practical of vehicles _ it's hard to
get into the back seat and cargo space is usually smaller than in a
sedan. And limiting a vehicle to two doors doesn't seem to make
sense at a time when manufcaturers are adding doors to minivans and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   This new marketing of coupes may be the signal of a new era in
the auto world. Manufacturers view the baby-boomers _ now in their
50s and freed of college payments and the need to haul things
around _ as leaving sport utilities and looking for something more
dashing.
</P>
<P>
   Is this fanciful thinking on the part of carmakers or, even a
momentary craze among car buyers? Certainly the numbers don't
justify the new interest in coupes. In 1985, sales of coupes
reached almost 2.1 million or 13.6 percent of the auto market. In
1987, sales were down 1 million with coupes capturing just 6.8
percent of the market. According to Automotive News, the past
year's sales of such coupes as the Honda Accord, Cadillac Eldorado
and Lexus SC have been way off projections. And yet, along comes
Audi, Mercedes, Mercury, Toyota, Volvo and BMW with coupes that
range from the fanciful and sleek to BMW's M Coupe that can best be
described as a drive into nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the more eye-catching coupes are designed to do just
that _ catch buyers' eyes in the showroom. How else can you explain
the Volvo C70, the Toyota Solara or the Mercury Cougar?
</P>
<P>
   Volvo, better known for its boxy designs, has built its
reputation on safety, not style. Volvo knows, as other makers add
to their safety credentials, that it needs to draw in new customers
looking for sleeker style. Toyota's Camry has everything going for
it _ including a reputation for reliability and quality _ but to
many people, it's also short of pizzaz. Enter the Solara, a
Camry-based coupe that is anything but dull in looks. The Cougar is
the first shot from Mercury in its new goal to be more than a Ford
lookalike. The Cougar is a Mercury exclusive. When the new Ford
Thunderbird comes out, it will not share anything of the Cougar
design or platform as it has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   While these coupes have appeal, it's harder to explain the
appeal of the BMW M Coupe. Its design is unusual. A long hood,
short body. Room for just two and enough cargo space to carry two
suitcases of moderate size. But it does perform on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW M Coupe is a bit of nostalgia and its design comes out
of the past. When BMW introduced this South Carolina-built coupe,
it predicted Europeans would use it to dash off to the seashore or
the mountains for a weekend. Little luggage was needed, but the car
had to be quick and handle those mountain roads or twists and turns
down to the sea as nimbly as possible. At $42,000, the car is
loaded with safety, performance and comfort features. BMW says it
will do 0-60 miles per hour in 5 seconds and has a top speed of 137
m.p.h. Not bad for a funny-looking little car.
</P>
<P>
   More in trend with the times, the all new BMW 3-series coupe
will be going on sale this summer. Like the new 3-series sedan for
'99, the coupe will be larger and more quality driven and will
debut as a 2000 model.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz offers two coupes in its CLK line. The V6-powered
CLK320 ($40,600), which was launched last year, is now joined by
the V8-powered CLK430 ($47,200). Mercedes designed the CLK
structure specifically for coupe and Cabriolet models. However, the
Cabriolet convertible is not a coupe with the top cut off. In fact,
except for modified doors on the Cabriolet, the two models share
very little structure and no body panels beyond the A pillars.
</P>
<P>
   For New England drivers, these coupes have added features to
ensure safe driving in wet and winter driving. An Electronic
Stability Program is standard on the 430 and optional on the V6.
ESP prevents slides and spins by automatically detecting the road
problem and applying selective braking to keep the car going where
the driver is pointing it. And there is ASR traction control that
detects when one rear wheel is spinning faster than the other and
selectively applies the brake to that wheel to restore traction. If
it were not for a warning light on the dash to indicate ESP action,
you'd never know something was happening.
</P>
<P>
   These hot performers provide Mercedes safety innovations along
with room for four passengers. There is ample room in the rear for
two passengers, and entry is easy. When a latch is moved on the
driver's or passenger's seat, that seat automatically moves
forward, then returns to its original position.
</P>
<P>
   Like its sedans and wagons, Volvo's C70 coupe is loaded with
safety features. Volvo finally has broken out of its rectangular
looks, and the C70 is proof positive of that change. Volvo isn't
skimping on performance, either. The C70 also is available as a
high-pressure turbo model.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar already is proving to be a winner for Mercury. It is
drawing people into Mercury showrooms who have never bought or
thought of buying a Mercury before. That's success. The Cougar is
available with either a 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a 2.5-liter V6
power plant.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota says its Solara is aimed at ``consumers entering their
peak earning years, who are nostalgic for the sports cars of their
youth, but need more room and comfort that a sports car can
provide.'' It comes with either a four-cylinder or V6 engine and a
choice of five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.
The Solara is the first Toyota to have a new JBL premium sound
system with 200 watts and eight speakers ``that will achieve a
level of performance and sound reproduction previously unavailable
in a Toyota.''
</P>
<P>
   The coupe craze extends throughout the auto world. Reading
Automobile magazine's 1999 Buying and Leasing guide, I counted 59
coupes ranging in price from $9,000 to $319,900. Both in looks and
convenience, one of the best buys is the Saturn SC with a third
door. Yes, hidden near the driver's side door is a hinged third
door, just like those on extended cab trucks. You'd never know it's
there until you need it. Then you'll love it.
</P>
<P>
   For $9,000, you can get the Chevrolet Metro and have the EPA's
overall winner in the fuel economy listings. If you wish to spend
$319,900, you could buy the Bentley Continenta. It isn't much on
mileage, but if you've got this much money to spend, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   The Honda Accord is another distinct coupe. Like the Volvo and
Camry coupes, the Accord has its own sheet metal package, setting
it apart from the four-door sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Among other new '99 models to check out are the Oldsmobile
Alero, Pontiac Grand Am, the Plymouth/Dodge Neon, Ford Mustang,
Daewoo Lanos, and from Volkswagen, the new Golf or the very catchy
Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Joining in the coupe craze is Audi, which this spring will bring
out a striking-looking TT coupe with a 180-horsepower turbocharged
1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine. You'd never know it shares a
platform with the VW Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   So are two doors enough? Unquestionably, especially in two-car
families where the second vehicle is a people-mover.

TO BUY OR LEASE IS THE QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To buy or lease. That is the question.
</P>
<P>
   It's one that's been around for some time, and while the answer
may seem easy, getting into a new set of wheels is no quick
decision or easy matter.
</P>
<P>
   The world of wheels is changing. Not only is the way one shops
changing, but also changing are the makes available and their
options and body styles. The answer to buying or leasing is both
simple and complex.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, to lease can be less costly on paper than buying.
Your monthly payments will be less if you lease a vehicle. You will
be able to ``afford'' a more luxurious vehicle on a lease. But, at
what cost in the long run?
</P>
<P>
   A lease is very simple. You never own the vehicle. You may not
need a down payment (but you may need a ``cap-cost reduction,'' _
jargon for a down payment). Basically, the dealership ``lends'' you
the car for a certain number of months or years.
</P>
<P>
   When the lease is over, the dealership will sell that vehicle
for its residual value. The residual value is the price the
dealership believes the vehicle will bring on the used car market
two or three years down the road. So you are paying the difference
between the resale price and the agreed-upon price. Sounds good,
but there are a lot of potholes along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing to first consider is how much you
intend to use the vehicle. Mileage is the key. All leases allow for
a certain amount of miles a year _ 10,000, 12,000, maybe more. Go
above that number of miles and you pay somewhere in the
neighborhood of 15 cents for every mile over the agreed-upon number
in the lease. If you average 20,000 miles a year _ and lots of
people do that many and more _ you could be in for a dollar shock
when you return the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you might want to buy the vehicle at the end of the
lease, get an agreed-upon price in writing at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   You don't just walk away at the end of the lease. If your
mileage is over the limit, you pay. If you don't return the vehicle
in salable condition _ check the lease stipulations before signing
_ you pay. And, should you have signed an open-ended lease (one
where the value of the vehicle will be determined at the end of the
lease), you could be in money trouble if that vehicle is not worth
what everyone said it would be. That has happened and could happen
again, especially if you buy a vehicle with no track record.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, lease contracts are now required to be more
understandable. You should know before signing the cost of the
vehicle, the interest you'll be paying, and the ins-and-outs of
allowed mileage, responsibility for repairs, maintenance and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of insurance, you should know the vehicle's value in
the event of a total loss. The original price? Don't be so sure.
Your insurance may only cover the price as a used car.
</P>
<P>
   Also check whether there is a termination fee. And what happens
if you decide to get out of the lease before the contract expires?
</P>
<P>
   A lease may also not be written in stone. In many cases, you can
negotiate factors from allowed mileage to acquisition fees.
</P>
<P>
   Leases can be a very attractive way to go, but before you sign
on the line, do your homework. Check on the ``up front'' costs
(that down payment) and other inception costs. Add up all the costs
before you decide if it's really a good deal for you _ not the
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you buy or lease, it always pays to do your homework.
Know what's in the marketplace. There are more choices than ever _
not just in cars, but also trucks, minivans and sport utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Before you lease or buy anything, think about what you need _ or
want _ to drive, and how it will be used _ work, play, family
transportation or all three.
</P>
<P>
   While every dealership has a deal for you, only you can tell how
good a deal it is. To do that you should know what the vehicle
costs, whether there are rebates or other incentives to be factored
in, and what you can expect for your trade-in.
</P>
<P>
   How do you find prices? Not by looking at the sticker _ that's
only a suggested retail price. Sign up for a service such as
Consumer Reports or AAA. For $10 to $15, they'll supply you with
the retail cost of the vehicle, the dealer's cost, and any rebates
or incentives being offered. These services will also give you the
value of your present vehicle, so you'll have an idea of what it
could be worth in a trade in.
</P>
<P>
   If you have access to the Internet, you can obtain these figures
there as well.
</P>
<P>
   One such service is offered by autosite.com. What's nice about
this service is that not only does it contain prices and other
information on all the makes and models, but you can do some
instantaneous comparison shopping. Can't decide between two makes
as to features etc.? Autosite will provide you with a side-by-side
comparison of the two models, similarly equipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is becoming a valuable tool in the search for a
vehicle. Many dealerships are now on the Web _ Daewoo, the newest
car company to hit American shores, is planning to sell cars on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other easy-to-access sources of information on the '99 models
magazine publications such as Automobile's 1999 Buying and Leasing
Guide, or Consumer Reports annual auto-buying guide.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when factoring in the costs, consider, the vehicle's
warranty. Many makers have extended the length of the factory
guarantees.

COMING: PARADE OF NEW MODELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new cars continue to roll out of the factories.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon are a new Neon, a new sporty Honda Civic, an S model
from Jaguar, new Chevrolets, Buicks, Pontiacs, a small Lincoln, and
vans and trucks. While most of these will be out this spring, they
will be racing to be the first of the 2000 models, not 1999s.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 model year brings with it not only new models, but also
new car companies and new quality standards. Mercedes-Benz, which
has been setting the standards for technology and quality for
years, will raise that benchmark with its all new S-Class flagship
sedan. Consider just a few of the features of the new V8-powered
sedan: It will be leaner by 500 pounds than previous models, giving
it more fuel efficiency; it will be three inches shorter, yet add
an inch of space to the already spacious rear-seat area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the car's airbags will automatically adjust for
low- or high-speed collisions; it will have side airbags on all
four doors, as well as front airbags and head-protection curtain
airbags; a satellite-based navigation system will be standard; and
the climate control will be ``smart,'' adjusting for both where the
sun is shining and where the passenger is sitting. Controls on the
steering wheel will direct many of the car's systems and also
diagnose any faults that occur. The S-Class will also have a smart
cruise-control system that will automatically maintain a pre-set
distance behind the car in front.
</P>
<P>
   The new Dodge/Plymouth Neon is entering the marketplace and the
2000 model year Neon will sport a quieter 132-horsepower engine.
Chrysler says the new car is longer, wider, more solid and sports a
more controlled ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic Si brings youthful excitement to the Honda line.
Honda, recognizing that many drivers like to lower and customize
Civics, has designed the Si to appeal to that market. For
performance, the Si has a 1.6-liter dual overhead cam VTEC
four-cylinder engine that boasts 160 horsepower, tops of any
vehicle in the compact class, Honda says. Priced at around $17,000,
the Si comes with customized exhaust system, special suspension and
slightly different looks. For liability reasons, Honda has chosen
not to lower the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Jaguar will introduce a sedan in the $40,000 range.
The S-type model will have a choice of specially tuned V6 and V8
engines. Also featured will be a navigation system and
voice-activated controls. The new Jaguar will be a companion to the
Lincoln LS-series. The new rear-drive Lincoln also will have a
choice of V6 and V8 engines along with a five-speed automatic. The
V6 will be offered with a five-speed manual. Take that as a sign
the times they are a-changing.
</P>
<P>
   Other models to look for will be a new Buick LeSabre and Pontiac
Bonneville, offering new ride comfort and handling. Chevrolet
brings back the Impala, a full-sized front-drive car with V6 power.
</P>
<P>
   From Europe will come a replacement for the Ford Escort. Saab
will introduce its 9-5 wagon, loaded with safety features, space
and a choice of a turbocharged four-cylinder or V6 engine. Nissan
is introducing a newly redesigned Maxima and Mazda will offer a new
MPV minivan with dual sliding doors, larger interior and a carlike
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is going all out with its new Tundra truck. The Tundra,
built in America, is designed to take on Ford's top selling F
series. It will be loaded with features, choices of wheelbases and
engines. Four-wheel drive will also be offered.
</P>
<P>
   Spicing up the truck field, Ford is planning on a little bit of
thunder of its own with the F-150 SVT Lightening. The Lightening
will boast a 325 horsepower V8 and ride on 18-inch performance
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the Hyundai Sonata a totally new car, but it also
boasts one of the best warranties of any car at any price. The
Sonata has not only a new body, but also two new engines, three new
transmissions, a new double-wishbone suspension, and added safety
features including side airbags. The family-sized Sonata sedan
comes with a five-year, 60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a
10-year powertrain guarantee. Add to this a 24-hour roadside
assistance plan good for five years. With its pricing, warranty
protection and new quality standards, Hyundai deserves a fresh
look.
</P>
<P>
   New on the scene from Korea is Daewoo, a company with unusual
marketing ideas. For now, the only showroom for Daewoo is in Natick
because the company is depending on college students to market the
cars by word of mouth. Daewoo recently announced it would sell
cars, at least in California, over the Internet. Daewoos start at
$9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also from Korea, Kia recently entered the New England market
with a small sedan and sport utility vehicle. Both vehicles are in
the low price range.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot that's new out there. Volkswagen has just about
totally revamped its lineup from the new Beetle and Golf to the
Jetta and Passat . . . Acura has a new mid-priced 3.2TL that's
loaded with features . . . Audi has a sporty A6 Avant wagon
available with all-wheel-drive . . . BMW is beginning the
introduction of a new 3-series. Only the sedan is currently
available.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Want more? Chrysler has revived a grand name in its standout
300M performance sedan . . . Infiniti has brought back the G20, a
nicely equipped introduction to the line . . . Mitsubishi has an
all new Galant that's longer, wider, taller and more of a performer
than in the past . . . Oldsmobile has a new Alero series is
well-equipped for under-$17,000 introductory price . . . The
Pontiac Grand Am is new and more powerful . . . Volvo is now all
front-drive with the introduction of its S80 sedan. The new
flagship replaces the old 900 series. Its packed with luxury,
safety and performance features . . . And even Rolls-Royce has a
new model, the Silver Seraph _ the company's first new car since
1980.

SUVS: THEY COME IN ENDLESS VARIETIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you think you've seen all the sport-utility vehicles
imaginable, along come more. And the end isn't in sight. Let's face
it: Sport-utes are hot. And, if that market should cool, some
manufacturers are hedging their bets by offering hot performance
wagons. (Yes, the old station wagon, the model declared dead on its
wheels a few years ago, is having a revival, not as a family
hauler, but as a sports wagon.)
</P>
<P>
   Also, if a passenger car is not for you, and you're not into a
sports-utility or a wagon, there's always a pickup truck. One
neighbor just bought a small pickup to go along with an older and
larger family-hauling Oldsmobile sedan. Another neighbor, a single
woman, just bought a full-sized Dodge pickup. In both cases the
choice ``made sense.'' The small pickup provides low-cost
transportation and serves as a utility hauler. It has rear,
swing-out doors so the kids can fit in otherwise tight quarters.
The other neighbor liked the full-size pickup's ride and the
handling plus the fact it is a great vehicle for camping trips.
</P>
<P>
   And we haven't even addressed the world of minivans yet.
</P>
<P>
   Minivans, like the SUVs, are considered a part of the truck
family in the motor vehicle world. They are another alternative to
both the old station wagons and to SUVs, especially since Chrysler
and Dodge offer all-wheel-drive options on the Town &AMP; Country and
Caravan.
</P>
<P>
   As car sales cool, manufacturers turn to SUVs to boost sales.
Lincoln did it last year with the Navigator, and now Cadillac has
seen the light with the Escalade. And while it may seem there's no
need for these huge models, both basically plusher versions of the
Ford Explorer and GMC Yukon, they are selling. Ford is even
thinking of building an even larger SUV to top Chevrolet's mammoth
Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, BMW will join the SUV market with its
``sport-activity vehicle.'' The X5, as BMW is calling it, really
isn't an SUV, says the carmaker. Instead, they portray it as a
luxury-car alternative.
</P>
<P>
   It will boast a number of seating configurations, a cargo load
platform that extends at the push of a button, a 5-series
touring-style split tailgate, and four-wheel drive. The X5 is said
to be longer, wider and lower than a Mercedes M-class SUV. The X5
is being built in Spartanburg, S.C. and will be available in a
number of engine choices, including a high-performance V8. It will
be priced a bit higher than a 5-series wagon, so guess around
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Taking aim at the sport utility crown is the new Jeep Grand
Cherokee. The new Jeep may look a lot like the old, but is far
different in ride, handling and room. There's a new engine, new
all-wheel-drive system, new seating, and new transmission. Jeep
even has taken the spare tire out of the cargo area and put it
underneath for added room. The Quadra-Drive system is designed to
keep the Jeep going even if three wheels lose traction. The new
4.7-liter, V8 offers better mileage and 30 percent lower emissions.
Add a long list of luxury and comfort amenities and you have quite
a package.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jeep is part of the DaimlmerChrysler family, the
company has a strong one- and two-punch approach in SUVs. The
Mercedes M-class, priced right with top of the line Jeep and Ford
Explorer products, is my choice as the best all-around sport-ute,
especially with this year's introduction of the V8-powered M430.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus, which last year entered the market with the innovative
RX300, has an all-new, full-sized LX470. The Lexus is based on the
likewise all-new Toyota Land Cruiser. These new SUVs are aimed at
becoming the ``kings of the 4WD' vehicles, and boast new stability,
an Automatic Height Control system allowing the driver to raise the
body by up to 2 inches at the push of a button, and a spacious
interior.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury market for SUVs keeps growing. Unlike other makers,
GMC is not pushing ``car-like'' in its ads; instead it is stressing
the ``truck-like'' strength of its models built on truck frames.
GMC has two luxury models in its SUV line, the full-sized Denali
and compact Envoy.
</P>
<P>
   Worth checking out is the all new Suzuki Grand Vitara. Starting
at around $18,000, Suzuki says its Vitara is the only V6-powered
mini-sport-ute and calls it ``unbelievably quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all SUV's have to be expensive: Honda, Kia, Toyota, and
Subaru have competent sports-utes that are easy on the pocket and
fun to drive. Ford is expected to join the mini-sports-ute field in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, which is still king of the hill in sports-utes, has added
features for safety, comfort and the environment for '99. A Reverse
Sensing System (a whole-range rear warning system to alert drivers
of objects to avoid when backing up), side air bags, and engines
with low-emissions can be found on the Explorer, Mercury
Mountainer, Expedition and Lincoln Navigator. For shorter drivers,
Ford's huge Expedition has optional power-adjustable brake and
accelerator pedals that can be adjusted up to three inches.
</P>
<P>
   One of the complaints about SUVs, especially smaller ones, is
the uneasiness felt as the vehicle leans on turns. The new Land
Rover Discovery Series II has a computer-assisted system that
should allay this unsettling feeling. The Discovery's ACE (active
cornering enhancement) system _ which uses hydraulic levers that
counter the lateral tilt of the vehicle's body _ counters this
feeling. This second generation Discovery has added room, and also
adds an electronic hill descent control that supplements engine
braking on steep hills by automatically applying the brakes as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs are coming in many shapes and styles. One of the more
unusual is the new Isuzu VehiCROSS which could be mistaken for
something other than an SUV. But this small vehicle will go
anywhere, and from reports, handles quite nicely without any of the
roll of other SUVs. It's tight on space, but handles four
passengers. It is palette-challenged, however: This fully loaded
vehicle ($29,000) is available in only three colors.
</P>
<P>
   Just to play it safe, BMW brought back its 5-series wagon after
a three-year absence and is said to be bringing out a 3-series
wagon shortly after the turn of the century. Makers like BMW know
that not everyone is happy with the ride of a sports utility
vehicle _ no matter how ``carlike'' the manufacturers claim it to
be. If you want sports car handling and performance, along with
extra space, one of the new breed of wagons from Europe may be for
you. Some have cargo capacities equal to a sport utility; others
give preference to design and handling over utility.
</P>
<P>
   For the performance-oriented driver who needs the space of a
wagon, the Audi A6 Avant includes Tiptronic _ a transmission that
allows one to shift through the gears without a clutch, and that
also can be used as an automatic.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Saab is bringing out a wagon version of its new
9-5. The wagon will be Saab's' first since the '70s. Audi, Volvo,
Mercedes, Volkswagen and BMW wagons are all available with
all-wheel-drive, making them great choices for an all-around
vehicle, especially for New England winters. The only holdback is
the price _ most range the mid-30s to mid-50s. For those who feel
the SUV still has the advantage because of height off the road,
check out the Volvo Cross-Country: It sits almost as high as most
SUVs. The VW Passat (around $23,000) deserves a good look, not only
for its price, but also as it shares many of its mechanics with
Audi.
</P>
<P>
   In the minivan field, Chrysler the leader (and originator) of
these vehicles has new competition. Honda offers an all new
Odyssey. The Odyssey has more of everything and it even tops
Chrysler with two powered doors in the EX model. The new Odyssey is
larger than the previous model (still available as the Isuzu
Oasis). Odyssey offers lots of seat configurations _ the rear seat
can even be folded flat on the floor and with the seats out, a 4 x
8-foot sheet of plywood can be placed inside). While it doesn't
offer all-wheel drive, it does have optional traction control.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is pushing safety in its redesigned Windstar. The new
minivan offers dual power-operated sliding doors, a reverse sensing
system to warn of objects at the rear of the vehicle, and head and
chest side-impact airbags. The Windstar gets a 5-star rating in
crash tests, and Ford says its V6 engine is the cleanest running of
any minivan.
</P>
<P>
   All new for '99 are the Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest. While
these vehicles are not as large as other minivans, for this model
year they have been enlarged by 5 inches to provide additional
cargo and passenger room. Both now have four (two which are
sliding) doors.
</P>
<P>
   Still the benchmark for all the minivans are the Chrysler Town &AMP;
Country, Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager. Within the Chrysler
line are multiple choices in size (the Grand Caravan is 13.3 inches
longer than the standard Caravan). The truly plush and fully loaded
Chrysler Town &AMP; Country comes with dual climate control for driver
and passenger, heated seats and all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   The news in trucks continues to be doors, the more the better.
The added doors make getting into the rear of an extended cab model
a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I don't see the need to own a truck, I recently
gained a new appreciation of their added comfort, along with the
added doors. In the process of moving, I used an F-150 Ford that
rode and handled almost as well as a car. Add to that comfortable
seating and great visibility and you have a vehicle that even my
wife conceded would be fine to own.
</P>
<P>
   Now I can see why my neighbors have turned to trucks as either
the household's first or second vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   About the only objection I found with the Ford was the tonneau
cover over the cargo area. While it adds a nice look, and is a
blessing in rain or snow, I found it almost impossible to snap back
into place during recent cold snaps.
</P>
<P>
   New for '99 in the truck field are the Chevrolet Silverado and
the GMC Sierra. An easy way to describe these new full-sized
pickups is to use Chevrolet's words: ``bigger, faster, stronger,
and smarter.'' In the compact truck field, Nissan offers a nice
performing Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   While foreign manufacturers have left the full-sized pickup
field alone up to now, that is about to change. This spring Toyota
will launch its Tundra, which is being built in Indiana and has a
V8 engine and the capacity ``to haul more and tow more.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota says the vehicle will ``set a new standard in the segment
for handling, ride comfort, and interior noise isolation.'' The
Tundra will be available in two- or four-wheel drive, two-door
regular cab with an eight-foot bed or a four-door Access Cab with a
6 1/2-foot bed. The Access Cab will feature exterior handles on
each door for easier access.

</P>
<P>
   Only a few monarchs left in the world really matter. And not one
has mattered for longer than King Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's
master of dramatic intrigue for the last 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CAMBODIA-GENOCIDE: Twenty years after the Khmer Rouge fell
from power, a United Nations team of three legal experts is
scheduled this month to recommend to Secretary General Kofi Annan
whether to start action against the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders
living openly in Cambodia. Some form of international tribunal
likely will be proposed to hear evidence against the men who
masterminded the madness that left as many as 2 million Cambodians
dead in less than four years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT: SWEEP AWAY SWEEPS?(Available by 2 p.m., Thu., Feb.
18):
</P>
<P>
   The sweeps _ when Nielsen Media Research measures the
demographics of local TV affiliates, so the stations can set their
ad rates _ are part of an antiquated system that is responsible for
a lot of what's wrong with network television today. ``If we don't
get serious and change our game, we're gonna be left in the dust,''
warns Steven Bochco, executive producer of ``NYPD Blue.'' ``We
ought to be reinventing the medium, changing the rules of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS: ``Practical Magic,'' ``Snake Eyes'' and
``The Governess.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CD REVIEWS: Kyle Eastwood's (Clint's son) ``From Here to
There,'' Libby Whittemore's ``Almost a Legend'' and country/rock's
Kelly Willis' ``What I Deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NASCAR (Available by 2 p.m., Thu., Feb. 18) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Winston Cup drivers this week turn their focus from the
season opener at Daytona to the season's second race, the Dura
Lube/Big K 400 at North Carolina Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD: TAMALES IN MISSISSIPPI &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Orsby has been selling tamales on the street corners of
Clarksdale, Miss., for 17 years. He's part of an unlikely tradition
that shows things aren't always as black and white as they seem,
even in the deepest recesses of the Deep South.

   WITH: RECIPES: Mississippi Tamales, with dough, filling recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHEELS: CHEVROLET TAHOE Z71 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If bigger really is better _ and there's a segment of the market
that agrees with that theory when the goal is going off-road _ then
the '99 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 is a certified winner.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: AT A GLANCE: Facts about the '99 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SHARP DRIVING: It wasn't long ago that the automotive
industry was preparing the obituary of the minivan. It seemed
sport-utility vehicles were all the rage and certain to displace
the popular mom-mobile as the vehicle of choice for carrying people

   &UR; PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY: BLACK HISTORY MONTH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For some, the arrival of February _ Black History Month _ used
to mean countless hours in the library searching for information on
such figures as Paul Robeson, Madame C.J. Walker and Bessie Smith.
But today, students and parents have another reference point: the
Internet.

   WITH: TECH TOOLS: I upgraded the other day to Windows 98. Oh,
wow, as the hippies used to say.

</P>
<P>
   The mantra of the Windsor Court Hotel in downtown New Orleans is
details, details. Details such as the 175 roses flown in from South
America every Friday and placed in a priceless antique urn in the
lobby. The $8 million collection of English art and antiques
adorning common rooms. The afternoon tea poured in Wedgewood china

   &UR; BOOKS: BLACK HISTORY MONTH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We call each February Black History Month, but it needs to be a
whole lot more than a revisitation of black history. With the focus
on the black experience, the view can be forward as well as
backward, which is _ or should be _ the goal of any study of the
past. Books have always done well to record and remind us of the
events that brought us to this time, this place.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: Patricia Cornwell writes a good story when she's
being Patricia Cornwell. She has an eye for detail and a stomach
for the gruesome aspects of crime, embodied in her regular heroine,
coroner Kay Scarpetta. Unfortunately, in ``Southern Cross,''
Cornwell's apparently trying to be Virginia's answer to Carl
Hiaasen, the wickedly funny writer who mocks all things modern in
Florida. And Hiaasen she isn't.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS: Allen Barra's sympathies are with Wyatt
Earp, but he is no hagiographer. His understated humor and his
sense of the ironic make ``Inventing Wyatt Earp'' part revisionist
history and part disquisition on the malleable meaning of legend,
with impromptu forays into film criticism.

   &UR; SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH: IS IT JUST A COLD? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's very important, doctors say, that people be able to
differentiate among a cold, a routine case of the flu and a
complication that commands medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: FLU TEST: The first practical diagnostic test for flu is
on the market this year.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HEALTHY TEA: Sometimes there's hardly a better tonic for
what ails you _ whether it's a stuffy head or achy joints _ than a
nice cup of hot tea. Emerging research is suggesting that while tea
may not cure, it might help prevent many serious diseases, such as
cancer and heart disease.

   &UR; FOCUS: CAMBODIA ROYAL(Available by 2 p.m., Fri., Feb.19) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only a few monarchs left in the world really matter. And not one
has mattered for longer than King Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's
master of dramatic intrigue for the last 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CAMBODIA-GENOCIDE: Twenty years after the Khmer Rouge fell
from power, a United Nations team of three legal experts is
scheduled this month to recommend to Secretary General Kofi Annan
whether to start action against the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders
living openly in Cambodia. Some form of international tribunal
likely will be proposed to hear evidence against the men who
masterminded the madness that left as many as 2 million Cambodians
dead in less than four years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT: SWEEP AWAY SWEEPS?(Available by 2 p.m., Thu., Feb.
18):
</P>
<P>
   The sweeps _ when Nielsen Media Research measures the
demographics of local TV affiliates, so the stations can set their
ad rates _ are part of an antiquated system that is responsible for
a lot of what's wrong with network television today. ``If we don't
get serious and change our game, we're gonna be left in the dust,''
warns Steven Bochco, executive producer of ``NYPD Blue.'' ``We
ought to be reinventing the medium, changing the rules of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS: ``Practical Magic,'' ``Snake Eyes'' and
``The Governess.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CD REVIEWS: Kyle Eastwood's (Clint's son) ``From Here to
There,'' Libby Whittemore's ``Almost a Legend'' and country/rock's
Kelly Willis' ``What I Deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NASCAR (Available by 2 p.m., Thu., Feb. 18) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Winston Cup drivers this week turn their focus from the
season opener at Daytona to the season's second race, the Dura
Lube/Big K 400 at North Carolina Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD: TAMALES IN MISSISSIPPI &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Orsby has been selling tamales on the street corners of
Clarksdale, Miss., for 17 years. He's part of an unlikely tradition
that shows things aren't always as black and white as they seem,
even in the deepest recesses of the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: RECIPES: Mississippi Tamales, with dough, filling recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHEELS: CHEVROLET TAHOE Z71 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If bigger really is better _ and there's a segment of the market
that agrees with that theory when the goal is going off-road _ then
the '99 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 is a certified winner.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: AT A GLANCE: Facts about the '99 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SHARP DRIVING: It wasn't long ago that the automotive
industry was preparing the obituary of the minivan. It seemed
sport-utility vehicles were all the rage and certain to displace
the popular mom-mobile as the vehicle of choice for carrying people
and cargo in the safety of a large vehicle. Well, not so fast.

TO BUY OR LEASE IS THE QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To buy or lease. That is the question.
</P>
<P>
   It's one that's been around for some time, and while the answer
may seem easy, getting into a new set of wheels is no quick
decision or easy matter.
</P>
<P>
   The world of wheels is changing. Not only is the way one shops
changing, but also changing are the makes available and their
options and body styles. The answer to buying or leasing is both
simple and complex.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, to lease can be less costly on paper than buying.
Your monthly payments will be less if you lease a vehicle. You will
be able to ``afford'' a more luxurious vehicle on a lease. But, at
what cost in the long run?
</P>
<P>
   A lease is very simple. You never own the vehicle. You may not
need a down payment (but you may need a ``cap-cost reduction,'' _
jargon for a down payment). Basically, the dealership ``lends'' you
the car for a certain number of months or years.
</P>
<P>
   When the lease is over, the dealership will sell that vehicle
for its residual value. The residual value is the price the
dealership believes the vehicle will bring on the used car market
two or three years down the road. So you are paying the difference
between the resale price and the agreed-upon price. Sounds good,
but there are a lot of potholes along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing to first consider is how much you
intend to use the vehicle. Mileage is the key. All leases allow for
a certain amount of miles a year _ 10,000, 12,000, maybe more. Go
above that number of miles and you pay somewhere in the
neighborhood of 15 cents for every mile over the agreed-upon number
in the lease. If you average 20,000 miles a year _ and lots of
people do that many and more _ you could be in for a dollar shock
when you return the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you might want to buy the vehicle at the end of the
lease, get an agreed-upon price in writing at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   You don't just walk away at the end of the lease. If your
mileage is over the limit, you pay. If you don't return the vehicle
in salable condition _ check the lease stipulations before signing
_ you pay. And, should you have signed an open-ended lease (one
where the value of the vehicle will be determined at the end of the
lease), you could be in money trouble if that vehicle is not worth
what everyone said it would be. That has happened and could happen
again, especially if you buy a vehicle with no track record.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, lease contracts are now required to be more
understandable. You should know before signing the cost of the
vehicle, the interest you'll be paying, and the ins-and-outs of
allowed mileage, responsibility for repairs, maintenance and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of insurance, you should know the vehicle's value in
the event of a total loss. The original price? Don't be so sure.
Your insurance may only cover the price as a used car.
</P>
<P>
   Also check whether there is a termination fee. And what happens
if you decide to get out of the lease before the contract expires?
</P>
<P>
   A lease may also not be written in stone. In many cases, you can
negotiate factors from allowed mileage to acquisition fees.
</P>
<P>
   Leases can be a very attractive way to go, but before you sign
on the line, do your homework. Check on the ``up front'' costs
(that down payment) and other inception costs. Add up all the costs
before you decide if it's really a good deal for you _ not the
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you buy or lease, it always pays to do your homework.
Know what's in the marketplace. There are more choices than ever _
not just in cars, but also trucks, minivans and sport utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Before you lease or buy anything, think about what you need _ or
want _ to drive, and how it will be used _ work, play, family
transportation or all three.
</P>
<P>
   While every dealership has a deal for you, only you can tell how
good a deal it is. To do that you should know what the vehicle
costs, whether there are rebates or other incentives to be factored
in, and what you can expect for your trade-in.
</P>
<P>
   How do you find prices? Not by looking at the sticker _ that's
only a suggested retail price. Sign up for a service such as
Consumer Reports or AAA. For $10 to $15, they'll supply you with
the retail cost of the vehicle, the dealer's cost, and any rebates
or incentives being offered. These services will also give you the
value of your present vehicle, so you'll have an idea of what it
could be worth in a trade in.
</P>
<P>
   If you have access to the Internet, you can obtain these figures
there as well.
</P>
<P>
   One such service is offered by autosite.com. What's nice about
this service is that not only does it contain prices and other
information on all the makes and models, but you can do some
instantaneous comparison shopping. Can't decide between two makes
as to features etc.? Autosite will provide you with a side-by-side
comparison of the two models, similarly equipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is becoming a valuable tool in the search for a
vehicle. Many dealerships are now on the Web _ Daewoo, the newest
car company to hit American shores, is planning to sell cars on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other easy-to-access sources of information on the '99 models
magazine publications such as Automobile's 1999 Buying and Leasing
Guide, or Consumer Reports annual auto-buying guide.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when factoring in the costs, consider, the vehicle's
warranty. Many makers have extended the length of the factory
guarantees.

COMING: PARADE OF NEW MODELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new cars continue to roll out of the factories.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon are a new Neon, a new sporty Honda Civic, an S model
from Jaguar, new Chevrolets, Buicks, Pontiacs, a small Lincoln, and
vans and trucks. While most of these will be out this spring, they
will be racing to be the first of the 2000 models, not 1999s.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 model year brings with it not only new models, but also
new car companies and new quality standards. Mercedes-Benz, which
has been setting the standards for technology and quality for
years, will raise that benchmark with its all new S-Class flagship
sedan. Consider just a few of the features of the new V8-powered
sedan: It will be leaner by 500 pounds than previous models, giving
it more fuel efficiency; it will be three inches shorter, yet add
an inch of space to the already spacious rear-seat area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the car's airbags will automatically adjust for
low- or high-speed collisions; it will have side airbags on all
four doors, as well as front airbags and head-protection curtain
airbags; a satellite-based navigation system will be standard; and
the climate control will be ``smart,'' adjusting for both where the
sun is shining and where the passenger is sitting. Controls on the
steering wheel will direct many of the car's systems and also
diagnose any faults that occur. The S-Class will also have a smart
cruise-control system that will automatically maintain a pre-set
distance behind the car in front.
</P>
<P>
   The new Dodge/Plymouth Neon is entering the marketplace and the
2000 model year Neon will sport a quieter 132-horsepower engine.
Chrysler says the new car is longer, wider, more solid and sports a
more controlled ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic Si brings youthful excitement to the Honda line.
Honda, recognizing that many drivers like to lower and customize
Civics, has designed the Si to appeal to that market. For
performance, the Si has a 1.6-liter dual overhead cam VTEC
four-cylinder engine that boasts 160 horsepower, tops of any
vehicle in the compact class, Honda says. Priced at around $17,000,
the Si comes with customized exhaust system, special suspension and
slightly different looks. For liability reasons, Honda has chosen
not to lower the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Jaguar will introduce a sedan in the $40,000 range.
The S-type model will have a choice of specially tuned V6 and V8
engines. Also featured will be a navigation system and
voice-activated controls. The new Jaguar will be a companion to the
Lincoln LS-series. The new rear-drive Lincoln also will have a
choice of V6 and V8 engines along with a five-speed automatic. The
V6 will be offered with a five-speed manual. Take that as a sign
the times they are a-changing.
</P>
<P>
   Other models to look for will be a new Buick LeSabre and Pontiac
Bonneville, offering new ride comfort and handling. Chevrolet
brings back the Impala, a full-sized front-drive car with V6 power.
</P>
<P>
   From Europe will come a replacement for the Ford Escort. Saab
will introduce its 9-5 wagon, loaded with safety features, space
and a choice of a turbocharged four-cylinder or V6 engine. Nissan
is introducing a newly redesigned Maxima and Mazda will offer a new
MPV minivan with dual sliding doors, larger interior and a carlike
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is going all out with its new Tundra truck. The Tundra,
built in America, is designed to take on Ford's top selling F
series. It will be loaded with features, choices of wheelbases and
engines. Four-wheel drive will also be offered.
</P>
<P>
   Spicing up the truck field, Ford is planning on a little bit of
thunder of its own with the F-150 SVT Lightening. The Lightening
will boast a 325 horsepower V8 and ride on 18-inch performance
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the Hyundai Sonata a totally new car, but it also
boasts one of the best warranties of any car at any price. The
Sonata has not only a new body, but also two new engines, three new
transmissions, a new double-wishbone suspension, and added safety
features including side airbags. The family-sized Sonata sedan
comes with a five-year, 60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a
10-year powertrain guarantee. Add to this a 24-hour roadside
assistance plan good for five years. With its pricing, warranty
protection and new quality standards, Hyundai deserves a fresh
look.
</P>
<P>
   New on the scene from Korea is Daewoo, a company with unusual
marketing ideas. For now, the only showroom for Daewoo is in Natick
because the company is depending on college students to market the
cars by word of mouth. Daewoo recently announced it would sell
cars, at least in California, over the Internet. Daewoos start at
$9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also from Korea, Kia recently entered the New England market
with a small sedan and sport utility vehicle. Both vehicles are in
the low price range.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot that's new out there. Volkswagen has just about
totally revamped its lineup from the new Beetle and Golf to the
Jetta and Passat . . . Acura has a new mid-priced 3.2TL that's
loaded with features . . . Audi has a sporty A6 Avant wagon
available with all-wheel-drive . . . BMW is beginning the
introduction of a new 3-series. Only the sedan is currently
available.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Want more? Chrysler has revived a grand name in its standout
300M performance sedan . . . Infiniti has brought back the G20, a
nicely equipped introduction to the line . . . Mitsubishi has an
all new Galant that's longer, wider, taller and more of a performer
than in the past . . . Oldsmobile has a new Alero series is
well-equipped for under-$17,000 introductory price . . . The
Pontiac Grand Am is new and more powerful . . . Volvo is now all
front-drive with the introduction of its S80 sedan. The new
flagship replaces the old 900 series. Its packed with luxury,
safety and performance features . . . And even Rolls-Royce has a
new model, the Silver Seraph _ the company's first new car since
1980.

   WASHINGTON _ Now that the impeachment process is finally over,
it doesn't hurt to recall that there have been four genuine
impeachment imbroglios in the history of the American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Three of them have been real dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest is merely the ugliest and least reputable. Off the
stats alone, the temptation would be to declare the constitutional
provision for impeachment flawed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it stands tall, still an awesome power, but on the
shelf for only the gravest of contingencies. In this revival season
for the English language's greatest Bard, the fault is not in the
provision but in ourselves, a truth the framers acknowledged by
inserting the Everest-sized requirement that a two-thirds vote in
the Senate is required for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Our experience with it, at a minimum, teaches that we have yet
to make the same mistake twice.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, just the majority vote required to proceed in
the House of Representatives was enough to stop impeachment
proceedings against John Tyler in 1843. The two-thirds provision
was, of course, central to Andrew Johnson's survival 25 years
later, and it played at least an ancillary role in the case against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When it worked, magnificently, during Watergate, the two-thirds
mandate was correctly interpreted even in the House Judiciary
Committee to require the meticulous assembly of hard and direct
evidence of felonies that were also ``high crimes'' that could
command support beyond the Democratic Party. Richard Nixon was
toast even before the ``smoking gun'' tape recording produced his
unique resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton case was clearly a regression in an age of lowered
standards, but the decisive character of its rejection blunts its
force as precedent.
</P>
<P>
   So do its origins. It is enough to note that the actions of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr in getting jurisdiction over the
Monica Lewinsky mess are themselves the subject of official
inquiry. But it is more important to note that this is the first _
and, one trusts, the last _ impeachment case based solely on work
done outside Congress. In every other one, Congress did its own
work to make its own case.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton case, however, the House first played politics
with Starr's referral by dumping it unexamined into the public
domain, and then carelessly re-writing it into an impeachment case.
Even Representative Henry Hyde now acknowledges that the failure to
check the facts and fill the holes in an admitted rush to judgment
was a fatal flaw that a longer trial in the Senate would only have
demonstrated more conclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Now that nearly all the statements made during the closed-door
speeches last week in the Senate have been made public, it is clear
that more than 33 Democrats and at least one Republican (Rhode
Island's John Chafee) voted to acquit solely on the facts of the
case. What took the number to 50 senators were additional opinions
that the offenses alleged were not worthy of the capital punishment
of removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   This rejection was unique. In no other impeachment trial has a
case failed to attract even a bare majority of the Senate to any of
its elements.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton case, the lesson is as old as the Constitution's
specific design to guard against impeachments pushed by one
political faction. And it may be as modern as an implicit rejection
of personal misbehavior (in this situation, arising out of alleged
misbehavior in another case that preceded his presidency) as proper
grounds for impeachment. The problem was not with the Democrats who
saw it one way and the Republicans who saw it another, for
partisanship is a natural crutch in relatively close decisions; the
problem was with the case itself.
</P>
<P>
   The House's decision not to proceed against Tyler showed that a
failed presidency and massive unpopularity would not become grounds
to alter election, or in Tyler's case, succession results after
William Henry Harrison's death made him president. Johnson's
survival meant that impeachment would not be used to change
national policy, in this case post-Civil War Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nixon precedent stands, leaving impeachment precisely
where it was intended to be, as protection against presidents who
directly threaten constitutional government by corruptly using
their official powers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton case was a dog recognized correctly by the public
from the beginning. That the Senate rescued the country from Ken
Starr's overzealousness and the House's irresponsibility may be
small consolation; but it is real consolation.

SCANDAL'S EFFECT ON JOURNALISM IN DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Big stories always change media,'' says media critic Jon Katz.
``The death of Elvis created the tabloid culture. The Gulf War
legitimized cable as a medium.''
</P>
<P>
   So how has a mind-boggling year of sex, lies, and impeachment
altered the media landscape? Will it change the way journalists
pursue the confounding ``character issue?'' Has it permanently
damaged press credibility in the eyes of the public? Does it mark
the coronation of the instantaneous ``new media'' embodied by the
Internet and cable news networks?
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky affair may have triggered the
quickest orgy of media introspection in history. One week after the
story broke, journalists were guiltily assailing their pursuit of
the tawdry details on a CNN program tellingly called ``Media
Madness.'' Yet more than a year later, the story's impact on
journalism is as murky and as ambiguous as the lessons of the
scandal itself.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious conclusion is CNN analyst Jeff Greenfield's
assertion that ``even though (``Monica-gate'') led to an
extraordinary event, I don't think it blew anybody's mind in the
way that Watergate did.'' And not just because the president
survived. Watergate spawned a movie starring Robert Redford and
Dustin Hoffman as hero journalists and steered a generation of
starry-eyed students to journalism school.
</P>
<P>
   When University of Virginia government professor Larry Sabato
recently asked his class of 500 students how many of them planned
on entering journalism, not a single hand shot skyward. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The new media &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first big story since journalism had changed,''
says ABC's Cokie Roberts. ``We never had a story like this, with
three 24-hour channels and all the `dot coms.' None of us knew how
to operate in that world.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a scandal introduced on the Internet when cyber snoop
Matt Drudge pirated Newsweek's reporting and broke the Lewinsky
tale several days before the mainstream media. It was maintained at
a screeching decibel level by the unceasing
``all-Monica-all-the-time'' punditry on cable news stations like
MSNBC, Fox News Channel, CNBC, and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a sad moment for America, a fine moment for Fox
news'' acknowledges John Moody, Fox News Channel vice president for
news.
</P>
<P>
   The cable channels have come in for serious criticism for
trivializing the story and for grinding it to a pulp. But no one
expects them to fold their tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it ends, you've still got all of these networks with 168
hours a week to fill,'' says television and cultural critic Steven
Stark. ``They're on to the next tabloid crisis if they can find or
invent one.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoes Wall Street Journal executive editor Al Hunt: ``I can't
wait to hear (CNBC talkhost) Chris Matthews do a whole show on
Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the National Press Club last June, Drudge lauded the
virtues of cybernews as ``an era vibrating with the din of small
voices . . . a future where there'll be 300 million reporters,
where anyone from anywhere can report for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Internet's peformance left plenty to be desired.
Drudge hyped a bogus story about a supposed Clinton ``love child''
and The Wall Street Journal and Dallas Morning &UR;  &LR; News had to retract
erroneous stories hastily posted on their web sites. Still,
analysts think the ``disconnect'' between the public and mainstream
journalism over this scandal plays into Drudge's scenario,
hastening the fragmentation of news and the further decline of the
traditional gatekeeper press. Whether it be a talk radio host, a
web site, or cable TV pundit of choice, citizens will be more
likely to customize their news in an era of expanding outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is much less dependent on journalism,'' says Katz.
``They're reaching their own conclusions. We have this spectacle of
a very, very well informed citizenry that is reaching different
conclusions than Washington journalists.'' Adds Sabato:
``Everyone's going to have a different set of sites. Everyone's
going to believe in a different reality.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The character issue &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread agreement that the salacious
Clinton-Lewinsky affair marks a high _ or low _ point in the public
scrutiny of the ``character'' issue that has been on the front
burner since Gary Hart's adultery-plagued 1988 presidential
campaign. In the wake of the scandal, there's some feeling that
journalists may be less eager to sniff around the bedsheets for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel that we've come to the end of the road with this
stuff,'' says Newsweek's chief political correspondent, Howard
Fineman. ``Every reductio ad absurdum has been reached. We've
almost gone real time in the private lives of public people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, (journalists) are the idealists here. We believe
there are good and bad public servants,'' says U.S. News &AMP; World
report columnist and CBS analyst Gloria Borger. She believes there
may be more emphasis on the positive aspects of government as part
of a mini-backlash to the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato worries, however, that to compensate for the Monica
scandal ``the next wave could easily be a truly lowered standard, a
feel-good journalism where we basically go back to the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are dissenting votes. Hunt thinks the post-Monica
media will still be eager to ``define character in terms of sex and
I think it's going to be a travesty. We're going to cover
pseudo-character.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A press in disrepute: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even David Broder, the painfully well-mannered dean of
Washington political columnists, doesn't mince words when gauging
his profession's current standing. In all likelihood, ``we're in
the crapper,'' he says. The public is ``very angry at us for our
yearlong proccupation with this.'' Echoes Greenfield: ``It
certainly didn't make heroes out of journalists. As a general
statement, Washington does cover politics with its head up its own
intestinal tract.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the widespread belief that this story exposed a
yawning gulf between the media and the citizenry, there are some
hopeful signs. For one thing, polls indicate that as the scandal
dragged on, people were inclined to think more favorably of the
media's performance _ even as they fervently hoped for an end to
the story. In January 1998, only 36 percent of the respondents to a
Media Studies Center poll considered coverage of the Lewinsky story
``excellent'' or ``good.'' A year later, the number of satisfied
customers was nearing 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors that ``seemed to be so outrageous and out there at
the beginning, basically were confirmed,'' says Media Studies
Center research director Larry McGill. ``I think the media, in a
funny way, have escaped relatively unscathed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that may depend on whether journalism has absorbed
some of the lessons of the last 12 months. One lingering fear is
that the media have become so addicted to covering the likes of the
O.J. Simpson trial, the death of Princess Diana and the White House
scandal, that they will transform the frantic hunt for the next
mega-story into a full-preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether this story is a kind of crack cocaine
. . . and whether we find a way of telling other stories,'' says
Fineman. ``I don't think things will ever slow down again. . . . A
huge apparatus has been built to keep the pace up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about this business is there's always another
story,'' says Moody, who seems to be confirming Fineman's theory.
``We're not too far from a presidential cycle; we have an unsolved
murder in Colorado; we have an institution we thought was
incorruptible, the Olympic Committee. When does it end? It never
ends. That's why it's called news.''

IN THE NAME OF `RESPECT,' A SHAKEDOWN

   BAKU, Azerbaijan _ This was a novel approach to airport
security.
</P>
<P>
   It was the dark, run-down departures hall of Baku's airport,
inside the security zone, between customs and passport control. The
two men who identified themselves as ``police'' wanted a passenger
to ``take a small package.''
</P>
<P>
   The passenger balked. What was that line they tell you at
airports all over the world? Never carry a bag for a stranger . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you want to show us some respect?'' one ``officer''
retorted.
</P>
<P>
   The respect thing. The passenger had heard this before.
</P>
<P>
   The airport security man, who had introduced himself as
``Airport KGB,'' said it when he had offered to bump up an economy
class ticket to business class for a small fee. The airline
representative said it when he wanted to make that small fee a big
one. The customs agent a year ago said it when he had confiscated
the passenger's money.
</P>
<P>
   Trying not to sound rude, the passenger declined the police
officer's request and prepared for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airports are a sore spot in the former Soviet Union. The Baltic
states have world-class airports, as does Kiev. But most seem to
operate on two principles: ``The customer is always blight'' and
``You can check in any time you like, but you can never leave.''
</P>
<P>
   For attempted extortion from foreigners, Baku beats them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hit up for a little `respect' at the ticket gate by two
Azeri cops,'' said Tom Goltz, author of ``Azerbaijan Diary: A Rogue
Reporter's Adventures in an Oil-rich, War-torn Post-Soviet
Republic.'' ``It was so incredibly shameless and brazen that it
really took me aback.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens at the airport is indicative of the times in a
country waiting to get rich from the oil under the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most of Azerbaijan is in shambles. Many regions have no
electricity, and even Baku experiences water and power shortages.
At least 700,000 people _ one tenth of the country's population _
are refugees from the territory Azerbaijan lost during a six-year
war with Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign money has come in, via oil companies and
Western-style shops and eateries that have opened to support them.
</P>
<P>
   But little wealth has trickled down from the inner circle of
President Geidar Aliyev, 75, the authoritarian former KGB general
and Communist Party chief. The Aliyev government keeps its oil
dealings secret and suppresses all dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest businesses have ties to the inner circle of
Aliyev,'' says opposition leader Etibar Mammadov. ``And corruption
and bribery are so highly developed, there are huge obstacles to
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   That perhaps explains why Baku's airport, or at least the part
that is not reserved for VIPs, has no shops or cafes, which are
never profitable in corrupt societies. Instead of the market
identifying and meeting people's needs, Baku airport works on the
old Soviet principle of letting officials do it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The police were still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, if you don't want to carry something for us, maybe you'll
just pay us a small fee instead?'' one said. ``Out of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen,'' the passenger said. ``I respect you. But I just
gave all my money to the Airport KGB.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know what to make of that. The passenger strode off
to passport control, where the border guard was waiting.

TRIPS, TUITIONS: A `RELENTLESS' OLYMPICS BID

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The Utahans doused their fact-crammed ``bid
books'' with pine scent and slipped them into leather saddlebags
for a distinctive Western touch.
</P>
<P>
   They packed up jars of local honey, white Stetson cowboy hats,
logo-emblazoned duds, souvenir pins, disposable cameras, and boxes
of home-style mementos and brought them to England in the spring of
1991, where the Lords of the Rings were awarding the 1998 Winter
Olympics. But when they arrived in Birmingham, the Salt Lake
bidders realized that they were putting a rummage table up against
Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Their Japanese rivals were feeding sushi and champagne to the
International Olympic Committee members and giving them jewelry,
luggage, laptop computers, and video recorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were giving out saltwater taffy,'' a Utah bid official
mused after underdog Nagano had edged Salt Lake by four votes out
of 88 cast. ``And they were giving out Hondas.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that Salt Lake had the best technical bid _
superb venues, a modern airport, huge hotels, superhighways,
state-of-the-art telecommunications, and the ``greatest snow on
earth.'' The Utahans had been playing the wrong game.
</P>
<P>
   Landing the Olympics wasn't about luge runs and cloverleafs, bid
chief Tom Welch and his team told the trustees and local
businessmen when they returned home. It was about ``winning
hearts,'' about getting to know the Lords and their wives and
children and making them feel part of your family _ and ultimately,
about winning their votes.
</P>
<P>
   So Welch drew up a mission statement for 2002 with one goal: to
``establish and maintain long-term, vote-influencing relationships
with IOC members.'' What resulted was a bid that went haywire and
created the worst scandal in modern Olympic history. Salt Lake's
corrupt quest for the Winter Games was a seven-year cornucopia of
cash handouts, tuition payments, free medical care, jobs, lavish
trips, shopping sprees, and gifts ranging from shotguns to golden
retrievers.
</P>
<P>
   A 300-page report issued last week by the organizing committee's
ethics panel and interviews with Olympic insiders paint a sordid
portrait of two ``relentless'' men (Welch and Dave Johnson) who
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in secret, of trustees who
asked few questions, of independent accountants who gave clean
audits without demanding details, and of greedy IOC members who
broke their oaths and succumbed to temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is plenty of blame to go around,'' said ethics panelist
David Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of the IOC voters have since been implicated. Nine
have either resigned or been forced out, and more than a dozen
others still risk expulsion. The US Department of Justice, US
Olympic Committee, and Utah attorney general are all probing the
Salt Lake Organizing Committee. The committee's top two officials,
Frank Joklik and Johnson, have resigned, and Welch, who stepped
down in 1997 amid charges of spousal abuse, lost his pension and
$10,000-a-month consultancy. The board of trustees and executive
committee have been reshuffled.
</P>
<P>
   And Salt Lake City, which prides itself on hospitality and
rectitude, has been profoundly embarrassed before the world. All
was to guarantee an Olympics that IOC insiders say was never in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake easily won on the first ballot, collecting nearly
twice as many votes as the three other bidders (Sion, Switzerland;
Ostersund, Sweden; and Quebec City) combined. It didn't need any of
the IOC members that it paid to influence. ``We won the vote fair
and square,'' board chairman Robert Garff said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did Salt Lake try to rig a game it had already won?
Because after five failed bids, it was determined to win the Games
at any cost. Because after losing to Nagano despite having the best
package, it concluded that merit meant little. And because it
believed that the IOC's unwritten rule was that you won hearts by
filling hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told that was the way business was done,'' said
Jordan, referring to explanations by the Salt Lake bidders. ``And
they were not in a position to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the Utahans just didn't get it, said IOC
marketing director Michael Payne. They should never have bid for
1998, not when Atlanta had already won the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Salt Lake, `There's not a chance in the world you'll
get them,' '' recalled Payne. ``We can't go back to America two
years later. That's the simple geopolitical reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States had already hosted the 1980 Winter and 1984
Summer Games, and the IOC was sensitive to criticism that Uncle Sam
was turning the Olympics into its own backyard block party.
</P>
<P>
   Asia hadn't had the Winter Games since 1972; it clearly was
Japan's turn. If the IOC members hadn't sensed that, one of IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch's top aides told them the night
before the vote that Samaranch favored Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City would have its turn in 2002, the IOC hinted, but
the Utahans set out to win hearts anyway, targeting voters in
developing nations just as Atlanta had. The Africans and Latin
Americans had no stake in where the Winter Games were held, and
conversations with middlemen offering blocs of votes in Birmingham
had convinced Welch that they were eager _ even asking _ to be
influenced.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1991, with the 2002 vote still nearly four years
away, the wife of IOC member Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa wired
Welch asking for a $30,000 loan to help a friend in a ``serious
situation.'' Welch raided his daughter's trust funds, meant for
tuition at Wellesley College and the University of Utah, and sent
the cash.
</P>
<P>
   IOC member David Sibandze of Swaziland wanted his son Sibo to
attend Utah. The bidders helped get him admitted, wangled him a
visa, and spent more than $100,000 in committee funds to pay for
his education.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a ``scholarship program'' purportedly allowing
Olympic committees from developing countries to send ``outstanding
individuals'' to Utah colleges at bid committee expense. It turned
into a slush fund that the ethics report said Welch and Johnson
tapped liberally for payoffs to IOC members and their children _
with no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Though the executive committee knew about the program and was
supposed to approve the recipients, it never asked where the money
was going, the report concluded. That became the Salt Lake pattern.
The board's job was to raise cash. Welch's and Johnson's jobs were
to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The executive committee paid less attention to specific
expenditures so long as the overall budget balanced,'' the ethics
report found.

DESPITE OLYMPIC SCANDAL, US CITIES CARRY TORCH FOR 2012

<P>
   Each city has a fancy logo, a multimillion-dollar budget, and
more endorsements from Olympic medalists than a mountain of
Wheaties boxes. Most of all, each has a dream.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, they all have the same dream.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cascading revelations of corruption within the Olympic
movement, a record eight US cities are vying to host the 2012
Summer Games _ the next potential chance to stage the Olympics on
US soil after the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer number of US cities bidding for the 2012 Olympics is,
by itself, a tribute to the enduring lure of top-flight athletes,
five-ringed flags, two weeks of the world's undivided attention,
and billions and billions of dollars.

   Leaders of all eight bid efforts, contacted last week, said they
were thoroughly unruffled by the still-unfolding scandal involving
allegations that IOC members took payoffs and gifts from Olympic
host cities, including Salt Lake City and Sydney. All expressed
nothing but the upbeat optimism and blithe enthusiasm expected of
Olympic hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scandal has actually helped us,'' said Nick Vehr,
president of Cincinnati 2012 and, fittingly, a public relations
executive. ``It has convinced everybody that the playing field is
going to be level in the future. That other game that occurred off
the field won't be going on. We view that as a silver lining in
what is a very dark cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Loder, bid coordinator of the San Francisco-based Bay Area
Sports Organizing Committee, said: ``The Olympics is a dream, an
ideal, and neither this scandal nor any other that I could imagine
is going to tarnish the beauty of the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cincinnati and San Francisco, the 2012 bidders
are Dallas, Houston, a combined Baltimore-Washington effort, New
York, Los Angeles, and a Florida proposal that includes Tampa and
Orlando. Each has paid $100,000 to $150,000 to secure its place as
a bidder, and each has won required support from local government
officials to pursue the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Three other cities, Boston, Chicago, and Seattle, had been
expected to bid, but all dropped out before a Dec. 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Olympic Committee will choose one of the
cities as the US candidate for 2012 based on comprehensive final
bids due in March 2000. The USOC winnowing process will occur in
late 2002, and the US choice will then go before the International
Olympic Committee. The IOC is scheduled to choose the 2012 host
city in the fall of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the US bidders are focused on the domestic
competition _ stressing to anyone who will listen their cities'
natural beauty, easy access, modern facilities, love of tourists,
and can-do spirit. At the same time, all are downplaying potential
problems such as 100-degree summer days, drenching humidity,
traffic gridlock, and acts of God large and small, from mosquitoes
to tornadoes to earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the ideal choice. Florida is differently positioned than
any other place on the planet,'' said Ed Turanchik, president of
the Florida 2012 bid effort. ``Atlanta was traumatized by the
crowds. We handle those crowds every year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is the only international capital that has never
hosted the Olympics,'' countered Dan Doctoroff, head of NYC-2012.
``There were 197 nations at the Atlanta Games. Every single one of
them could have found a neighborhood in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is a natural,'' offered Susan Bandy, executive
director of the Houston 2012 Foundation. ``We're a well-known
international city with great amenities, wonderful airports, plenty
of hotel rooms, and probably the best corps of volunteers in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, all eight bidders eagerly boast about the
luminaries who have loaned their names and reputations.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area group is heavy on skaters, including Peggy Fleming,
Kristi Yamaguchi, and Brian Boitano, with former secretary of state
George Shultz thrown in for good measure. Houston trumps Shultz
with former President George Bush, plus Olympic stars Carl Lewis
and Mary Lou Retton, whose father-in-law is an executive with the
bid team.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas weighs in with Ross Perot Jr., Cowboys owner Jerry Jones,
and sprinter Michael Johnson. DC-Baltimore has the longtime
television host of the Olympics, Jim McKay, as well as Oriole Cal
Ripken. Cincinnati has astronaut legend Neil Armstrong and
basketball great Oscar Robertson, a 1964 Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has decathlon hero Rafer Johnson and swimming star
Janet Evans, as well as Olympic impresario Peter Ueberroth, who led
the city's organizing committee for the 1984 Summer Games. Florida
has Olympic softball star Dot Richardson and soccer phenom Michelle
Akers. New York, which had hoped to bid for the 2008 Olympics until
the USOC decided there would be no US bidder for those Games, is
still rebuilding its all-star list.
</P>
<P>
   Though each bid group says its venues, supporters, and plans are
far and away the best, all try not to violate the first rule of
Olympic diplomacy: Never trash the competition.
</P>
<P>
   But with promises of anonymity, several bid organizers and close
Olympic observers were willing to handicap the field. There is a
vague consensus that Washington-Baltimore will offer a hard-to-beat
bid on the strength of location and already advanced organization,
and that either Dallas or Houston will be in the running until the
very end. San Franciso gets credit for the best scenery, and
Cincinnati is considered a potential spoiler that benefits from a
wholesome image. Florida is viewed as a mixed bag, with excellent
resources but doubts in some minds that the IOC would share the
world stage with Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles and New York are wild cards, having waged low-key
stealth campaigns, thus far. New York is still getting its plans
together and Los Angeles is banking on its reputation as a
successful past host.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the current tumult, the USOC is positively
buoyant about the number of bidders and the prospect that by the
time one is chosen, the scandal will be a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on now is a painful exercise for us. It is
excruciating,'' said USOC spokesman Mike Moran. ``It took 100 years
for us to build the brand, and in less than 100 days it has been
tarnished. We've got a job to build this back up. But the cities
still want it. The Games are the Games and the athletes are the
athletes. But the other stuff has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Each city expects to spend millions of dollars in the domestic
phase of the competition, with Los Angeles working with the
smallest budget and most others budgeting between $3 million and
$10 million. None has a firm idea how much it will cost 13 years
from now to actually host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the process, all the cities will have to conform to
rules the USOC enacted in November 1997, more than a year before
the scandal broke, that strictly limit contacts with USOC and IOC
members, set a $50 cap on gifts (rising to $150 in the final phase
of competition), and spell out detailed ethics and disclosure
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   At an October 1998 conference of bid cities, ``We gave a fanny
pack, a pin, and a water bottle, with a combined value of $7.63.
And I think we might have been the big spenders in the pack,'' said
Turanchik, head of the Florida 2012 effort.
</P>
<P>
   One unresolved question for all the bidders is a requirement
that arrangements be made _ either through local governments or
some other ``third party'' _ to pick up the cost of any budget
shortfalls if the 2012 Games run in the red. That requirement
helped to knock Seattle from the bidding, and at least some others
are expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Once a winner emerges from the US field, it will face the rest
of the world. Among the international cities expected to be in the
competition are the losers in the chase to host the 2008 Summer
Games, the winner of which will be chosen in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Early handicapping gives Beijing front-runner status for 2008,
with bids also expected from Toronto; Paris; Osaka, Japan; Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia; Buenos Aires; Istanbul; and Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The US bidders have to hope that Toronto doesn't pull away from
the crowd and win the 2008 Games; under Olympic protocol, the Games
are expected to rotate from continent to continent. If Toronto were
to win the 2008 Games, the US cities probably would have to keep
smiling and bidding at least until 2016.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK, I'm young enough to hang in there,'' said
Turanchik. ``Whenever it comes, it'd be worth the wait.''

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share their memories of growing up in small-town
America. Back then, or at least the way we remember it, life was
like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Michael M. Alvarez
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me a story.''
</P>
<P>
   It was more of a command than a request.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Tony. And he was built like a lifesize Tonka truck.
</P>
<P>
   I had no place to hide, so I did the only thing I could to save
myself from getting hammered into a bloody pulp.
</P>
<P>
   I told Tony the most interesting story I knew, making it up as I
went . . . and so began my life as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   The long bus rides to and from school would have been completely
unbearable had it not been for my newfound talent as a storyteller.
I discovered, much to the delight of our beleaguered bus driver,
that I could entertain a majority of the students by telling them
stories.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't just any stories. They were stories with characters
that had the same names as those of my listeners; they seemed to
perk up and pay more attention when the hero was named Hector and
the hero's girlfriend was named Helen.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of stories and a couple of years later, I discovered that
I could save myself a lot of wear and tear by writing down my
stories and passing out copies instead of delivering them orally.
</P>
<P>
   My dear mother gave me one of the most invaluable gifts anyone
can receive _ she forced me to learn how to touch type the summer
before I entered high school.
</P>
<P>
   I figured my storytelling days on the bus were over. But there
was just one hitch: my large friend Tony didn't like to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me a story,'' demanded Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Towering a good two inches above me, Tony gave me his best
I'll-pulverize-you-if-you-don't look. But deep down I knew Tony
would never hurt me.
</P>
<P>
   I negotiated a compromise. I would read him the story I had
typed the night before instead of just spewing it out off the top
of my head. Tony said he liked my typewritten stories better
because they flowed more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Bless his heart. Aside from being my greatest fan, Tony was also
my first critic.
</P>
<P>
   I lost track of Tony through the years. The scuttlebutt in my
hometown was that he had been killed in Vietnam. Others said that
he had died from a drug overdose. There was also speculation that
Tony had married a wonderful woman and moved to parts unknown.
</P>
<P>
   That last story was the one I preferred to believe. I'd like to
think that things turned out well for Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I sit down to write, I listen carefully . . . so
intently that I almost hear the voice of my special friend who
unknowingly helped me to become a writer by voicing every reader's
wish:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me a story.''

SUVS: THEY COME IN ENDLESS VARIETIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Just when you think you've seen all the sport-utility vehicles
imaginable, along come more. And the end isn't in sight. Let's face
it: Sport-utes are hot. And, if that market should cool, some
manufacturers are hedging their bets by offering hot performance
wagons. (Yes, the old station wagon, the model declared dead on its
wheels a few years ago, is having a revival, not as a family
hauler, but as a sports wagon.)
</P>
<P>
   Also, if a passenger car is not for you, and you're not into a
sports-utility or a wagon, there's always a pickup truck. One
neighbor just bought a small pickup to go along with an older and
larger family-hauling Oldsmobile sedan. Another neighbor, a single
woman, just bought a full-sized Dodge pickup. In both cases the
choice ``made sense.'' The small pickup provides low-cost
transportation and serves as a utility hauler. It has rear,
swing-out doors so the kids can fit in otherwise tight quarters.
The other neighbor liked the full-size pickup's ride and the
handling plus the fact it is a great vehicle for camping trips.
</P>
<P>
   And we haven't even addressed the world of minivans yet.
</P>
<P>
   Minivans, like the SUVs, are considered a part of the truck
family in the motor vehicle world. They are another alternative to
both the old station wagons and to SUVs, especially since Chrysler
and Dodge offer all-wheel-drive options on the Town &AMP; Country and
Caravan.
</P>
<P>
   As car sales cool, manufacturers turn to SUVs to boost sales.
Lincoln did it last year with the Navigator, and now Cadillac has
seen the light with the Escalade. And while it may seem there's no
need for these huge models, both basically plusher versions of the
Ford Explorer and GMC Yukon, they are selling. Ford is even
thinking of building an even larger SUV to top Chevrolet's mammoth
Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, BMW will join the SUV market with its
``sport-activity vehicle.'' The X5, as BMW is calling it, really
isn't an SUV, says the carmaker. Instead, they portray it as a
luxury-car alternative.
</P>
<P>
   It will boast a number of seating configurations, a cargo load
platform that extends at the push of a button, a 5-series
touring-style split tailgate, and four-wheel drive. The X5 is said
to be longer, wider and lower than a Mercedes M-class SUV. The X5
is being built in Spartanburg, S.C. and will be available in a
number of engine choices, including a high-performance V8. It will
be priced a bit higher than a 5-series wagon, so guess around
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Taking aim at the sport utility crown is the new Jeep Grand
Cherokee. The new Jeep may look a lot like the old, but is far
different in ride, handling and room. There's a new engine, new
all-wheel-drive system, new seating, and new transmission. Jeep
even has taken the spare tire out of the cargo area and put it
underneath for added room. The Quadra-Drive system is designed to
keep the Jeep going even if three wheels lose traction. The new
4.7-liter, V8 offers better mileage and 30 percent lower emissions.
Add a long list of luxury and comfort amenities and you have quite
a package.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jeep is part of the DaimlmerChrysler family, the
company has a strong one- and two-punch approach in SUVs. The
Mercedes M-class, priced right with top of the line Jeep and Ford
Explorer products, is my choice as the best all-around sport-ute,
especially with this year's introduction of the V8-powered M430.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus, which last year entered the market with the innovative
RX300, has an all-new, full-sized LX470. The Lexus is based on the
likewise all-new Toyota Land Cruiser. These new SUVs are aimed at
becoming the ``kings of the 4WD' vehicles, and boast new stability,
an Automatic Height Control system allowing the driver to raise the
body by up to 2 inches at the push of a button, and a spacious
interior.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury market for SUVs keeps growing. Unlike other makers,
GMC is not pushing ``car-like'' in its ads; instead it is stressing
the ``truck-like'' strength of its models built on truck frames.
GMC has two luxury models in its SUV line, the full-sized Denali
and compact Envoy.
</P>
<P>
   Worth checking out is the all new Suzuki Grand Vitara. Starting
at around $18,000, Suzuki says its Vitara is the only V6-powered
mini-sport-ute and calls it ``unbelievably quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all SUV's have to be expensive: Honda, Kia, Toyota, and
Subaru have competent sports-utes that are easy on the pocket and
fun to drive. Ford is expected to join the mini-sports-ute field in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, which is still king of the hill in sports-utes, has added
features for safety, comfort and the environment for '99. A Reverse
Sensing System (a whole-range rear warning system to alert drivers
of objects to avoid when backing up), side air bags, and engines
with low-emissions can be found on the Explorer, Mercury
Mountainer, Expedition and Lincoln Navigator. For shorter drivers,
Ford's huge Expedition has optional power-adjustable brake and
accelerator pedals that can be adjusted up to three inches.
</P>
<P>
   One of the complaints about SUVs, especially smaller ones, is
the uneasiness felt as the vehicle leans on turns. The new Land
Rover Discovery Series II has a computer-assisted system that
should allay this unsettling feeling. The Discovery's ACE (active
cornering enhancement) system _ which uses hydraulic levers that
counter the lateral tilt of the vehicle's body _ counters this
feeling. This second generation Discovery has added room, and also
adds an electronic hill descent control that supplements engine
braking on steep hills by automatically applying the brakes as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs are coming in many shapes and styles. One of the more
unusual is the new Isuzu VehiCROSS which could be mistaken for
something other than an SUV. But this small vehicle will go
anywhere, and from reports, handles quite nicely without any of the
roll of other SUVs. It's tight on space, but handles four
passengers. It is palette-challenged, however: This fully loaded
vehicle ($29,000) is available in only three colors.
</P>
<P>
   Just to play it safe, BMW brought back its 5-series wagon after
a three-year absence and is said to be bringing out a 3-series
wagon shortly after the turn of the century. Makers like BMW know
that not everyone is happy with the ride of a sports utility
vehicle _ no matter how ``carlike'' the manufacturers claim it to
be. If you want sports car handling and performance, along with
extra space, one of the new breed of wagons from Europe may be for
you. Some have cargo capacities equal to a sport utility; others
give preference to design and handling over utility.
</P>
<P>
   For the performance-oriented driver who needs the space of a
wagon, the Audi A6 Avant includes Tiptronic _ a transmission that
allows one to shift through the gears without a clutch, and that
also can be used as an automatic.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Saab is bringing out a wagon version of its new
9-5. The wagon will be Saab's' first since the '70s. Audi, Volvo,
Mercedes, Volkswagen and BMW wagons are all available with
all-wheel-drive, making them great choices for an all-around
vehicle, especially for New England winters. The only holdback is
the price _ most range the mid-30s to mid-50s. For those who feel
the SUV still has the advantage because of height off the road,
check out the Volvo Cross-Country: It sits almost as high as most
SUVs. The VW Passat (around $23,000) deserves a good look, not only
for its price, but also as it shares many of its mechanics with
Audi.
</P>
<P>
   In the minivan field, Chrysler the leader (and originator) of
these vehicles has new competition. Honda offers an all new
Odyssey. The Odyssey has more of everything and it even tops
Chrysler with two powered doors in the EX model. The new Odyssey is
larger than the previous model (still available as the Isuzu
Oasis). Odyssey offers lots of seat configurations _ the rear seat
can even be folded flat on the floor and with the seats out, a 4 x
8-foot sheet of plywood can be placed inside). While it doesn't
offer all-wheel drive, it does have optional traction control.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is pushing safety in its redesigned Windstar. The new
minivan offers dual power-operated sliding doors, a reverse sensing
system to warn of objects at the rear of the vehicle, and head and
chest side-impact airbags. The Windstar gets a 5-star rating in
crash tests, and Ford says its V6 engine is the cleanest running of
any minivan.
</P>
<P>
   All new for '99 are the Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest. While
these vehicles are not as large as other minivans, for this model
year they have been enlarged by 5 inches to provide additional
cargo and passenger room. Both now have four (two which are
sliding) doors.
</P>
<P>
   Still the benchmark for all the minivans are the Chrysler Town &AMP;
Country, Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager. Within the Chrysler
line are multiple choices in size (the Grand Caravan is 13.3 inches
longer than the standard Caravan). The truly plush and fully loaded
Chrysler Town &AMP; Country comes with dual climate control for driver
and passenger, heated seats and all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   The news in trucks continues to be doors, the more the better.
The added doors make getting into the rear of an extended cab model
a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I don't see the need to own a truck, I recently
gained a new appreciation of their added comfort, along with the
added doors. In the process of moving, I used an F-150 Ford that
rode and handled almost as well as a car. Add to that comfortable
seating and great visibility and you have a vehicle that even my
wife conceded would be fine to own.
</P>
<P>
   Now I can see why my neighbors have turned to trucks as either
the household's first or second vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   About the only objection I found with the Ford was the tonneau
cover over the cargo area. While it adds a nice look, and is a
blessing in rain or snow, I found it almost impossible to snap back
into place during recent cold snaps.
</P>
<P>
   New for '99 in the truck field are the Chevrolet Silverado and
the GMC Sierra. An easy way to describe these new full-sized
pickups is to use Chevrolet's words: ``bigger, faster, stronger,
and smarter.'' In the compact truck field, Nissan offers a nice
performing Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   While foreign manufacturers have left the full-sized pickup
field alone up to now, that is about to change. This spring Toyota
will launch its Tundra, which is being built in Indiana and has a
V8 engine and the capacity ``to haul more and tow more.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota says the vehicle will ``set a new standard in the segment
for handling, ride comfort, and interior noise isolation.'' The
Tundra will be available in two- or four-wheel drive, two-door
regular cab with an eight-foot bed or a four-door Access Cab with a
6 1/2-foot bed. The Access Cab will feature exterior handles on
each door for easier access.

ACQUITTAL A PARADOX FOR GORE

   WASHINGTON _ The impeachment saga of President Clinton spawned
what would call political paradox: The deeper the trouble Clinton
found himself in the past 13 months, the more Democratic party
loyalists rallied around the White House _ and especially Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the trial is over and Clinton's tenure presumably
secure, the after-effects on Gore's presidential ambitions remain
an open issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could benefit if he is seen as heir to the positive aspects
of the Clinton Administration without the personal negatives. But
the fear among some Gore allies is the vice president could be hurt
if a scandal-weary public decides it is time for a fresh team at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some potential Democratic presidential candidates have concluded
Gore already has gotten the benefit of the rosy scenario, with
prospects such as Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and House minority
leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri choosing not to run. But if
Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts joins former Senator Bill
Bradley of New Jersey as a candidate, it may well be because of the
belief that the public wants someone without such strong ties to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial, according to Kerry press secretary Jim
Jordan, ``has perversely galvanized support for the Democratic
Party and by extension, the White House. It has forced all
Democrats into a posture where they are almost forced to defend the
party and the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Jordan, who was the spokesman for Democrats on the House
Judiciary Committee during the impeachment inquiry, added, ``I
don't think it has increased support for Gore per se.'' The
question, he said, is ``whether or not the sins of Clinton are
visited on Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said there are as many theories as senators when it comes
to assessing how the trial will affect Gore. But Kerry said that
has nothing to do with his decision whether to run. ``I haven't
been analyzing this in that context,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, has launched an aggressive strategy to put
himself at the forefront of both the administration and the race
for the Democratic nomination. In the past week, Gore led the way
on policy announcements, including those dealing with an anti-drug
strategy and pension benefits. This week, Gore heads to South
Africa and then to Miami to meet with the AFL-CIO, two trips that
Gore aides hope will help the vice president with the key
constituencies of blacks and labor union members.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, has launched a campaign fund-raising effort
that openly seeks to take advantage of the controversy over the
impeachment trial. Gore wrote in a letter sent to more than 850,000
past contributors: ``Will our nation succumb to the forces of
divisiveness, extremism and personal destruction that threaten to
engulf Washington as I write this?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore implied he was the next victim, writing: ``Republicans
candidates have already begun their attacks on me. . . . and they
will only intensify. Will you stand with me as I face down these
personal attacks?''
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's top aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that the fund-raising appeal was based partly on the
theory that the scandal at least temporarily helps Gore. ``The
party wants to stay unified as opposed to splitting apart,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying message of the fund-raising appeal is a warning
shot to potential primary opponents that Gore will have massive
financial resources at his disposal. ``Al Gore is going to win the
nomination, either pretty or not pretty,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Clinton scandal has had the indirect effect of
depleting the Democratic primary field.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, in a previously unreported act, Kerrey took polls
in Iowa and New Hampshire to try to determine the impact of the
Clinton scandal on Gore. The result, according to Kerrey political
director Steve Jarding, was astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question that this scandal was helping the vice
president,'' Jarding said. ``It was across the board. When you poll
(likely) caucus and primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, it
was startling. It leapt off the page.''
</P>
<P>
   Those results played a role in prompting Kerrey to leap out of
the presidential campaign. Kerrey had an extra concern because he
had pledged not to run for reelection to his Senate seat in 2000 if
he ran for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jarding, like a number of others interviewed for this
report, said Gore can't afford to be complacent and hope the
``rally around the White House'' benefit continues. Unless Gore can
establish his own identity and vision, Jarding said, he could be in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, national polls reveal a key Gore weakness. When pitted
against potential Republican rivals such as Texas Governor George
W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole, Gore finishes second.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN poll conducted by the Gallup organization and
released Feb. 1 found that 39 percent of those surveyed said Gore's
association with Clinton would make them less likely to vote for
Gore, while 36 percent said it would make them more likely to back
Gore, and 21 percent said it made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   Gore for months has made a concerted effort to inoculate himself
from the impeachment. He has praised the president, and by
extension, himself, for the administration's achievements of the
past six years, while calling Clinton's actions ``indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has tried to direct attention away from the impeachment
scandal by criticizing the Republicans's partisan attacks. After
Clinton was impeached by the Republican-majority House, Gore said
the action ``does a great disservice to a man I believe will be
regarded in the history books as one of our greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments have prompted Republicans to link Gore with
Clinton in the same way Democrats in 1996 linked GOP presidential
nominee Bob Dole with then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who campaigns as if he were
already in a head-to-head match with Gore, said Gore is inseparable
from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Iowa last week, Quayle said Gore owes it to the
American people to say why Clinton ``trashed the White House,''
asserting that Clinton and Gore are ``attached at the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   But such a strategy relies on the theory that Clinton will drag
down Gore. Gore is betting the opposite is true.

FOR GOP, IT`S TIME TO LISTEN TO AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For weeks, Senate Republicans have sat silently in
their seats listening to the impeachment trial as they watched
their public approval ratings plummet. Now, leading Republicans
say, the best way to rebuild the tattered party is once again to
sit silently _ but this time listening to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   The future prospects of the Republican Party could be determined
by the way the GOP handles the transition from an unpopular
impeachment trial to the legislative calendar and Campaign 2000.
The first step in the rebuilding process will begin in the next few
weeks, as Republican governors join with congressional leaders at
town hall-style meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The forums, titled ``Listening to America,'' are intended to
focus public attention on the top four legislative priorities:
preserving state and local control over education dollars, saving
Social Security, improving national defense, and providing tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said the
biggest fight with Democrats could be over tax cuts _ a fight
Republicans like. Nicholson, who recently made headlines by joking
that ``every day at the RNC feels like an eternity,'' sounded
euphoric as he envisioned the public focusing on tax cuts instead
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a distant memory,'' Nicholson said about the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing problem for Republicans, however, is they will be
hard-pressed to pass any of their major initiatives over a
presidential veto, possibly leaving the GOP with few
accomplishments to tout in the upcoming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our 2000 plans depend a lot more on what happens after
impeachment than what is happening now,'' said Republican pollster
Glen Bolger. ``We have to get things done on key issues. On the
other hand, the Democrats have zero incentive to help by passing
any legislation. It is not going to be an easy road back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party's problem is well documented. A recent New
York Times/CBS poll, for example, said the party is viewed
unfavorably by 52 percent of Americans, with half of those who
identify themselves as conservative Republicans saying the party's
handling of impeachment will make it harder to elect GOP candidates
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, however, said the polls obscure a silver
lining: The GOP is stronger than ever at the state level, with
Republican governors in 31 states, representing nearly 70 percent
of Americans, including traditionally Democratic states such as
Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to remain true to the principles of the party, and we
need to be listening carefully to the people we serve,'' said
Montana Governor Marc Racicot, who is helping coordinate the
Listening to America forums. ``We need to recognize that it is
their government, and we work for them. It is our best hope.''
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans are right, the party's strength at the local
level might be the political equivalent of finding the yellow brick
road after a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any Democrat thinks that they are entering the era of beer
and skittles, they are wrong,'' said Governor Frank Keating of
Oklahoma, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, quoting
what he called one definition of nirvana. ``To the average
American, Republicans have shown at the state level they can
provide the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating acknowledged that the trial, in the short term, ``has
been calamitous for Republicans. But in the long term, if anything,
it will have a positive impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating said it could take months for Republicans to recover,
but the party eventually will be applauded for its impeachment
action, while Democrats might be mired in the legacy of a tarnished
president.
</P>
<P>
   To GOP leaders, it is ironic that their party is viewed as
needing national healing, when it is Clinton who committed the
offenses that resulted in impeachment. Republicans remember how
difficult it was for the party to recover from Watergate, when
Democrats scored large gains in the midterm elections in 1974 and
watched Jimmy Carter ascend to the presidency in 1976. When Gerald
Ford became president in 1974, he both healed and divided the party
by pardoning former President Nixon. But Ford was clearly the
party's leader.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, at another critical juncture for the GOP, the party
does not have an obvious leader. For decades, the party has been
led by the World War II generation, exemplified most recently by
President Reagan, former President Bush, and former Senate majority
leader Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans see a silver lining in the lack of
leadership. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich retired from office
and is no longer the lightning rod of the party. A little-known
Illinoisan, Representative Dennis Hastert, is now speaker, and
Senate majority leader Trent Lott, though bruised in the eyes of
some for his leadership of the Senate trial, is not viewed as a
divisive, acerbic figure in the way Gingrich was.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, the GOP leadership will be determined not by the
impeachment drama, but by the fight for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It is noteworthy, analysts said, that much of the Republican
presidential field comes from outside of Congress: Texas Governor
George W. Bush, former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, former
Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander, publisher Steve Forbes, and
former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three members of Congress expected to get in the GOP
race, Senator John McCain of Arizona probably has the strongest
shot at the nomination because he plans to run as an outsider and
reformer who doesn't fit the Senate mold. McCain bucked the
Republican Party in his fights for campaign-finance legislation and
tobacco regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire has filed
candidacy papers, and Representative John Kasich of Ohio is poised
to enter the field.
</P>
<P>
   While many of these presidential prospects have criticized the
president and some have called for his resignation, those who are
not members of Congress have the luxury of separating themselves
from the impeachment trial.

SENATE MAY EMERGE MORE UNIFIED THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Phil Gramm was railing against a Democratic
plan for censure, his Southern drawl echoing throughout an
underground hallway in the Capitol. Suddenly, he spied a target
coming down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that's a sweet lady right there,'' shouted Gramm, a
Republican from Texas, blowing kisses in the direction of Senator
Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat leading the push for
censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, tough guy,'' Feinstein playfully shouted back, as she
kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter was brief but intriguing. A day earlier, the two
senators had sparred on a Sunday morning talk show, spitting snide
remarks back and forth on the topic of censure. By the next day,
they were laughing about it. And while Gramm and Feinstein may not
have moved closer together on the ideological spectrum, their
exchange seemed to indicate a flash of bipartisan fondness, despite
their month trapped together in the Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, that may illustrate a kind of impeachment
victory. Despite a series of partisan votes, and, at times,
forceful disagreements, senators say the process has prompted as
many cross-party discussions as any political wrangle in the past.
Unlike the House, which dissolved in bitter acrimony over
impeachment last fall, many said the Senate has actually benefited
from the ordeal and may emerge more unified than divided,
particularly at a personal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a keen awareness that not only the president
but also the Senate was on trial,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
Senator Fred Thompson, a Republican from Tennessee, agreed: ``In a
strange way, we've had more interplay and back and forth. We've
been forced to work together, with each other, toward our mutual
goal of handling the thing responsibly. I think we've shown that
when the chips are down, we can at least talk to each other and
listen to each other. And I think, in some respects, it might
enhance our ability to work together in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Senate's relations with the House will be as smooth
remains a good question. Several senators said they feared members
of the House _ especially the 13 Republican prosecutors who had
bitterly complained that their case was hamstrung by Senate
strictures _ would be less interested in cooperating on
legislation, particularly after disparaging remarks by senators
about the chaotic nature of the impeachment process in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to have far greater post-impeachment
internal struggles _ and has already felt destructive effects. Two
congressmen were ruined by it. House Speaker Newt Gingrich resigned
in the wake of embarrassing November election returns for
Republicans. Just over a month later, the man tapped to replace
him, Representative Robert Livingston of Louisiana, unexpectedly
stepped aside as well, following revelations that he had had
extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential trouble spot is relations between both
branches of Congress and the White House. Although many senators
downplayed the notion that post-trial tensions would inhibit
legislative relations with the president, there already has been an
explosive rift between the White House and the House in recent
days. News reports that Clinton was planning to seek revenge for
impeachment by helping Democrats regain control of the House in
2000 stirred denunciation by some GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But that bitterness, to whatever degree it exists, may
ultimately be trumped by a strong desire to move on _ not just by
Republicans, who are desperate to separate the party's identity
from impeachment, but also by Democrats. Vows to ``return to the
people's business'' have echoed from all corners of the Capitol for
weeks, beginning with Clinton's State of the Union address on Jan.
19, in which he wished later generations might look back and say,
``We put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and
hopefulness, that we joined together to serve and strengthen the
land we love.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Senate majority leader Trent Lott has indicated he will
push ahead with legislation immediately after the Senate returns
from its weeklong President's Day recess. During the trial, he
repeatedly said it was ``time to get to a vote and move on'' _ and
routinely ticked off his priorities, including education, defense,
tax cuts, and Social Security. Committee hearings have continued
throughout the trial, albeit at a slower pace, and numerous bills
have been hammered out, all in anticipation of the trial's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republicans are going to engage in a flurry of
effort to prove they haven't lost time and they have an agenda,''
said Senator John F. Kerry. ``The public will look for substance,
not form.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the wish to move on is realized may depend in part on
the lasting value, if any, of personal connections made during the
Senate trial. But even at the end of the trial on Friday, there
were glimmers of the old strains. After the impeachment votes were
taken, and the House prosecutors were escorted from the Senate
well, a senator objected that the White House lawyers should be
escorted out as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, raising his hand, said with a wry smile: ``There's the
door.''

LAW WOULD GIVE RIGHTS TO PRIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does a chimpanzee have rights? Should our primate cousins be
entitled to some of the same protections of life and liberty _ or
at least a basic protection from needless suffering _ that humans
enjoy? These are no longer just abstract philosophical musings, but
have become part of an active legislative debate.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed amendment to an animal welfare law being considered
by a House subcommittee in New Zealand would for the first time
confer some basic legal rights on chimpanzees and other great apes.
The bill is expected to come to a vote within the next month. Some
see this as an important first step toward acknowledging humans'
kinship with our closest relatives, but others see it as a
potentially dangerous step toward limiting medical research that
might save lives.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations in many nations, including the United States,
already protect apes used for research from being subjected to
unnecessary suffering and set rules for their treatment that go
beyond the basic animal-welfare guidelines that apply to all
species _ for example, specifying minimum cage sizes. But the
proposed New Zealand law, being promoted by an international
organization called the Great Ape Project, goes much further. It is
the first to speak in terms of ``rights'' for these animals, and
the first to prohibit any scientific or medical research that is
not in the best interests of the animals themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That language is strongly supported by many animal-rights
advocates and researchers who specialize in great apes. But it
gives chills to those who contend that research using animals,
including those most closely related to us, is needed to develop
life-saving treatments for human diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The specific law being debated in the New Zealand parliament is
moot. Only about 36 great apes are currently held in New Zealand _
there are no native species there _ and none is used for medical
research or subjected to conditions that would be prohibited by the
new law.
</P>
<P>
   But David Penny, a biologist at New Zealand's Massey University
and author of a brief in support of the law signed by 38 academics,
said, ``We've found that chimps and humans have some very similar
abilities,'' including a capacity for complex communication. Thus,
he said, ``We have to change our laws to take this into account.''
</P>
<P>
   What worries some medical researchers _ and encourages some
animal-rights advocates _ is that this law is seen as just a first
step, a foot in the door. The Great Ape Project hopes to see
similar legislation adopted in other nations, including the United
States, where it would have direct effects on some research
(although very little research is currently done on great apes).
Ultimately, the group hopes to get similar language incorporated in
a United Nations resolution that would apply to all nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to break the species line'' for beings that are
considered deserving of basic rights, said Paul Waldau, who teaches
ethics at Tufts University and is vice president of the
international Great Ape Project. The all-volunteer organization, he
said, is ``pushing for recognition of these kinds of rights and
protections'' for all great apes, a category that includes five
species: chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, and humans.
</P>
<P>
   The rights conferred by the proposed New Zealand law include the
right not to be killed, not to be tortured, and not to be used for
any research that doesn't benefit the individual being subjected to
the research.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Ape Project's view on all medical research using apes
_ even if it might have the potential to lead to life-saving
treatments for human disease _ is that ``we want it abolished,
unless it is for the direct benefit of the individual involved,''
Waldau said.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the potential medical benefits of such research?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will lose some benefits,'' Waldau acknowledged. But, he
added, ``suppose there was a disease that you could only cure by
experimenting on Tibetan orphan children. We would have to say
no.'' In the same way, he said, because the other great apes are
such ``rich, complex individuals,'' they should not be sacrificed
for research ``any more than a particular group of humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in medical research using primates worry about
the possible outcome of such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important issue; the implications are very
widespread,'' said Bertha Madras, acting director of the New
England Regional Primate Research Center in Southborough, which is
run by Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of such laws for researchers' ability to
develop treatments ``for a broad range of human diseases are quite
serious,'' Madras said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Southborough center does not use any of the great apes
in its present research, the specific implications are only in
terms of setting a precedent that might later be extended to other
species _ or in terms of limiting potential future research.
</P>
<P>
   For research on possible AIDS treatments, for example, the
center uses Rhesus monkeys. Chimpanzees, shown to have been the
source of the AIDS virus, are unsuitable for research on treatments
because they apparently have a natural immunity to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But in principle, Madras sees no reason to exclude chimpanzees
from such research if it turns out that would be useful. ``I'm a
speciesist,'' she freely admitted. ``I prioritize life. Human life,
to me, is my priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldau and others who support a ban on research using apes say
efforts should be directed toward developing better alternatives
for such research, such as laboratory work using human cells or
genetic material, rather than whole animals. They emphasize that
animal models are always imperfect, and that some treatments that
work in a lab animal may be useless on humans _ and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Fouts, director of the Chimpanzee and Human Communication
Institute at the University of Central Washington, agrees with the
push to ban research using great apes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to bring our laws into line with the biological
reality . . . with the historical and biological fact that we're
all connected,'' Fouts said.
</P>
<P>
   Present US laws protecting chimpanzees, he said, are minimal:
They must be kept in cages that are at least 5 feet by 5 feet by 7
feet, and must be provided at least one toy. ``To put them in a
5-by-5 cage for life imprisonment is an abomination,'' said Fouts,
who is the author of a book on chimpanzee research called ``Next of
Kin.''
</P>
<P>
   But Madras pointed out that ``some of the regulations are far
better for primates than for humans.'' For example, primates must
be kept within a strictly limited range of temperatures, must not
have any sharp, dangerous objects in their cages, and must have
toys to play with. ``That's not true for our children . . . I would
love to see'' such regulations extended to children as well, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts suggested one of the arguments made for the importance of
using apes for medical research can just as easily be turned around
to make the opposite point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we need to use chimps because they're so close to
us,'' he said. ``But isn't that also an argument against using
them? We do biomedical research on humans, but with strict
regulation. Maybe we should use the same standards, or similar
standards'' for experimenting on our closest animal relatives.

   BIG SUR, Calif. _ ``One wing in the grave.''
</P>
<P>
   In the words of one researcher, that's how close the California
condor came to extinction. The biggest birds in North America, once
common throughout the West, lost their last nesting female in the
wild in 1986 when she died of lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, 100 dignitaries, including a congressman
and a Hollywood actor, shivered on a windy ridge high above the
Pacific Ocean to witness something that once seemed impossible: the
return of condors to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Seven immature condors, raised at the Los Angeles and San Diego
zoos, cautiously hopped out of a pen late last month, then pumped
their enormous black wings and took their first free flight as the
crowd watched through binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like riding your bicycle for the first time,'' beamed Jim
Davis, executive director of the Ventana Wilderness Society, the
private group that owns the rocky hillside south of Monterey where
the condors were released.
</P>
<P>
   Behind that remarkable scene lies one of the most dramatic, and
controversial, wildlife gambles in history. Over the objection of
environmentalists, wildlife biologists trapped the last wild
California condors in 1987, bringing the entire species into zoos
for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, biologists have held the fate of one of the oldest
animal species on the continent in their hands. Zoo and US Fish and
Wildlife Service workers have reared scores of condors from the day
they hatched, often using puppets that resemble condors to help
train the birds to avoid the evils of the world, such as houses,
power lines and, of course, people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of skepticism, bird deaths, and some condors
who behaved more like dogs than wild animals, biologists seem to be
perfecting their condor assembly line. Fifty condors now live in
remote areas of California and Arizona, with six more birds
scheduled for release this month.
</P>
<P>
   But the condor comeback is far from assured. None of the wild
birds is old enough to mate and all depend on people to supply at
least some food, requiring field workers to carry 100-pound
carcasses into the wilderness under cover of dark. Moreover, the
condors still face many of the hazards that plagued them before,
such as lead poisoning from ingesting bullets in the remains of
hunters' kills.
</P>
<P>
   However, the burgeoning success of the California Condor
Recovery Program is winning credibility for captive breeding, an
approach to saving endangered species that was once considered
dangerous meddling with nature. It turns out, if biologists have
enough time and resources, they can become surrogate parents even
to smart animals like condors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not advocate captive breeding and release for all
situations,'' said Mike Wallace, a pioneer of the condor program
now at the San Diego Wild Animal Park. ``It's expensive. It's time
consuming, and Murphy's Law (whatever can go wrong will go wrong)
works overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in the mountains of California at least, it's working.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Condors have been soaring over canyons and gorges for millennia,
effortlessly riding the columns of warm air on wings that stretch
up to 11 feet from tip to tip. Before the last ice age 10,000 years
ago, condors ranged over much of what is now the western United
States as well as New York and Florida, feeding on the carcasses of
sabre-toothed tigers, woolly mammoths and other extinct
``mega-fauna.''
</P>
<P>
   As condors retreated to increasingly smaller areas of California
in this century, some researchers wrote them off as living fossils,
doomed like the other big animals of the Pleistocene Period.
Paleontologist Loye Miller decribed them as ``a species with one
foot and even one wing in the grave.''
</P>
<P>
   But condor biologists regard Miller's view as a profound error.
Condors survived for thousands of years after the Ice Age, after
all, until their unhappy collision with people. Nineteenth century
miners shot them for their quills, which served as handy cases for
gold dust; hunters shot them to keep them away from kills; an
increasingly urban society strung power lines that electrocuted
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not an Ice Age relic. It was just a nice thing to say
. . . so that people wouldn't have to feel guilty,'' said Kelly
Sorenson, ornithologist at the Ventana Wilderness Society.
</P>
<P>
   The young condors under Sorenson's care look more like
undertakers than relics as they gather around a dead calf near Big
Sur, their bald heads bowed and wings folded respectfully behind
their backs. As they mature, their black heads will turn orange,
and a circling of them in the sky will tell the world that
something has died.
</P>
<P>
   These birds, released a year ago, are oblivious to the
extraordinary human effort that made their dinner possible, from
the field workers watching in the grove below to the rancher who
donated the stillborn calf to the 30-year recovery effort that has
cost more than $25 million. They're just doing what condors have
done since the Pleistocene Period, feasting on the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a service to all humans, really. Those carcasses . . .
can harbor disease and the scavengers come out there and clean it
up,'' said Sorenson as he watched the five birds eat. ``They're
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the condors' diet has played a major role in
their decline, even after governments cracked down on shooting the
animals in the early 1900s. Given the chance, condors will eat
sewage, puddles of anti-freeze or lead-tainted animal guts,
sometimes overwhelming their immune system.
</P>
<P>
   By 1982, the condors' decline had grown so serious that three
chicks were brought into the Los Angeles and San Diego zoos for
safekeeping and the remaining 24 wild condors were watched
constantly by biologists from public and private conservation
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Hamber, condor biologist at the Santa Barbara Museum of
Natural History, said biologists didn't plan to bring all the
condors into captivity, hoping instead to use the zoos to
supplement the condor population. But events overtook them when six
of the remaining wild birds, including the female of the last
breeding couple, died in a single winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, it was like no birds are safe,'' Hamber said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists sued to stop the round-up, questioning the
zoos' ability to care for the condors. They noted that the Los
Angeles Zoo had inappropriately put some of the captive condors on
display, making them too tame to be released to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wildlife Service won court approval to capture the
condors and, by 1987, the California condor species consisted of 27
birds in two California zoos.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that keeping condors in the zoo is fairly easy _
condors can be trained like a dog _ but preparing them for release
to the wild is hard, largely because the birds need so much
guidance. The birds released near Big Sur last month, for instance,
have the comparative life skills of elementary school students.
</P>
<P>
   Young condors in the wild stay with their parents for several
years, but biologists couldn't afford the luxury of parent-rearing
for most of the birds. Instead, they removed the eggs as soon as
they were laid in hopes that the female would lay another fertile
egg, a practice known as ``double clutching.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, caretakers had to raise most of the birds
themselves, and, to avoid taming the animals, do it without direct
contact. The sign in the condor nursery at the Los Angeles Zoo,
reads, ``No talking. No whispering. No exceptions.'' Caretakers
remain behind a dark curtain, using a condor puppet to preen the
chicks, play with them and generally keep them company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that preparation, early condor releases to the wild
only confirmed skeptics' belief that the effort would fail. In
1992, the first male returned to the wild died after apparently
licking up anti-freeze and four condors were electrocuted over the
next year when they either flew into or tried to roost on utility
lines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By late 1993, all 13 condors that had been released to the wild
were either dead or recaptured because they were not wary enough of
people, and biologists knew they had to better prepare the birds
for life among human hazards.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the biologists turned to the avian equivalent of
shock therapy. Under what became known as ``aversion training,''
biologists placed utility poles in the birds' flight pens that
carried a shock strong enough to hurt, but not to harm. Likewise,
they electrified roofs of small buildings to discourage roosting on
houses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, biologists made the birds' contacts with humans
into negative experiences, sometimes shouting and menacing them
when they entered the cage to take blood or move the birds. When
soon-to-be-released birds were fitted with radio transmitters at
the Los Angeles Zoo recently, Wallace kept them in small kennels
all day just so they would fear people more.
</P>
<P>
   Even those precautions weren't enough as condor rearing
expanded. Four birds raised at a new Fish and Wildlife Service
facility had to be recaptured in 1996 because they kept roosting on
roofs, and one, nicknamed Walter, liked to visit the office of a
Big Sur resort.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Sorenson now insists on an older ``mentor'' condor
to stay with the young birds for the last few weeks before they are
released.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the condor program is working as the biologists had
hoped, and environmental groups such as the Golden Gate chapter of
the National Audubon Society support the program again. At five
sites in California and Arizona, condors are flying free, including
some in the Los Padres National Forest north of Los Angeles that
may be old enough to mate next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildlife Service is still well short of its goal of 150
condors in both California and Arizona, but the wild population is
back to mid-1960s levels and rising. The biggest remaining obstacle
for the biologists is the replacement of lead in bullets and shot
with a less toxic metal.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there was an atmosphere of celebration at Big Sur
on Jan. 30 as a long convoy of vehicles drove an hour and a half up
a steep mountain road for the condors' release. Even US
Representative Sam Farr, a California Democrat, hobbling on a
broken ankle, and actor Timothy Bottoms jumped at the chance to see
some of the rarest animals on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we would be raising `wild pigs,' '' said Davis of
the Ventana Wilderness Society, recalling earlier criticisms of the
captive breeding program. ``Attitudes are changing.''

WALLING OFF EMOTIONS A BUY-NOW, PAY-LATER STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do Bill Clinton, O. J. Simpson, and Tom Hanks in ``Saving
Private Ryan'' have in common?
</P>
<P>
   Each has shown a knack for walling off one part of his emotional
life so it doesn't interfere with other parts. For ignoring what is
momentarily troublesome or painful in order to concentrate on a
narrow, self-serving agenda. For ``compartmentalizing,'' to use the
pop-psychology buzzword of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ability to partition aspects of his public and private
persona _ Monica mess over here, bridge to the 21st century over
here _ has become, for better or for worse, the distinguishing
characteristic of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, whose capacity for denial borders on the delusional,
responded this way last year when asked how it felt to lose his
Brentwood, Calif., estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a sentimental guy,'' he said. ``But there's things you've
got to compartmentalize. You take them and file them away. I've
tried to live my life forward and not backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks's character bravely soldiered on in ``Private Ryan,''
forgoing the impulse to stop and grieve over fallen comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived both Monicagate and impeachment, Clinton may now
go down in history as the Great Compartmentalizer, much as Simpson
is likely to forever reign as the prince of pathology. But are they
really that uncommon in a culture that celebrates ``toughing it
out'' in tough situations? Is compartmentalizing strictly a guy
thing? Is it ever a good thing? Do we all do the C-thing at times?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mental health experts may not agree on the answers, any more
than political pundits agree on what accounts for Clinton's lofty
poll numbers _ beyond the public's ability to compartmentalize its
feelings about politicians and public officials, that is.
</P>
<P>
   But experts do seem to agree that there are degrees of
difference to this sort of psychological defense mechanism _
compartments to compartmentalizing, if you will _ and that what
works in the short term can be dangerous to one's health if adopted
as a way of life, a permanent modus vivendi.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I support patients doing it, it's usually when they're
under siege or duress,'' says psychiatrist and author Dr. Joseph
Glenmullen, a staff clinician at the Harvard University Health
Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most extreme example would be combat,'' Glenmullen says,
``when you simply can't afford to sit down and deal with your
feelings. To a lesser extent, college students face similar
choices. If they have a personal crisis during exam week, sometimes
they have to put off dealing with it until they can focus on it
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from his own practice, Glenmullen cites the case of a
patient who is undergoing a personal crisis in the midst of a
crucial career change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't really deal with the crisis until the job situation
stabilizes,'' says Glenmullen. ``But then we'll come back to those
issues. I still have mixed feelings about it, though _ wanting to
help right away, even though it's not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Another example ripped from the news pages is Jimmy Johnson, the
tough-guy coach of the Miami Dolphins, who flirted with retirement
recently because he did pause to look backward. Johnson's mother
had died in December, and his father has cancer. Having skipped his
mother's wake to prepare for a football game, Johnson was overcome
with grief when the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   Said Johnson, at a press conference to announce he will scale
back on his coaching duties this year, ``There's a time you pull
back and say, `Be with people you care about. Don't shortchange
them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To psychologist Irene Stiver, author of ``The Healing
Connection,'' it is important to differentiate between what she
calls ``mechanisms people use to help them do their work better and
ones that don't help them live their lives better.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton analysts have theorized that the president learned
to compartmentalize early in life, in response to his having to
deal with alcohol abuse and domestic violence in the Clinton
household. Sheetrocking his psyche into neat compartments was young
Bill's way of building an impermeable ego, or so goes this theory
of Clintonian dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   While hesitant to speculate about Clinton and his psychological
profile specifically, Stiver sees him as a ``strong person'' who,
10 years removed from office, could well suffer from depression or
some other breakdown of his internal defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to pathologize someone like Clinton, because a lot of
people screw up their lives like that,'' says Stiver. ``But he's
one of those people who do their jobs well but who aren't connected
to their inner experience of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Men do that more than women, Stiver says, primarily due to
cultural conditioning. Whereas women learn to pay attention to
their feelings more, men are encouraged not to. With high-profile
high achievers _ Senator Edward Kennedy and former defense
secretary Robert McNamara being two other examples _ boxing up
emotions or trafficking in half-truths may lead to problems down
the line, including alcohol abuse and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many men have made such an investment in achievement and power
that they can exist on those for a long time,'' says Stiver. ``At
some point, though, they have to pay a price. You always pay a
price for not representing yourself fully, or at least relatively
fully.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Janet Surrey, coauthor of the book ``We Have to
Talk: Healing Dialogues Between Men and Women,'' agrees that men
and women have different cognitive styles _ and thus differing
abilities to compartmentalize feelings from action. To illustrate,
she cites the husband and wife who quarrel in the morning, then
separate and go off to work.
</P>
<P>
   The woman ``may be processing the fight all day long,'' says
Surrey, ``talking about what happened with her friends. Then she
goes home and wants to talk about it some more. He, meanwhile, may
have completely put the disagreement out of his mind. For him, it's
over. So he's caught off guard when she brings it up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Surrey, reaching well back into history for another
example, ``It goes all the way back to Ulysses not being led off by
the Sirens. To not be as relationally aware of everything can
clearly be a strength, when you need to blot out feelings in order
to act. To focus on the goal. But there's also a moral question
here, which is a different issue. At some point there must be some
integration with a moral sense. The big question is, do you use
this defense selectively or does it define who you are?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Renana Brooks, a clinical psychologist in the Washington,
D.C., area, flips the political paradigm on its head. Brooks
contends that without Clinton's extraordinary ability to stay on
message _ tuning out whatever personal static interferes with his
public broadcasts _ the Great Compartmentalizer would be a great
washout politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the essence of Bill Clinton's resiliency,'' Brooks
maintains, adding that no, it's not just a guy thing. Hillary
Clinton is also a ``master compartmentalizer,'' Brooks says. So is
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was ``badly hurt by her
husband,'' says Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ronald and Nancy Reagan (remember the Kitty Kelley
biography?) exhibited similar traits during their years in the
White House, even though their marriage had a much sunnier public
image than the Clintons'.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans are the great compartmentalizers, if you
want to know the truth,'' says Brooks. ``They're the ones talking
about family values when most of them are divorced or have had
extramarital affairs. Compartmentalizing seems to be a requirement
for political service across the board. If you're going to set
yourself up as some sort of moral example for the country, you
pretty much have to compartmentalize.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one prominent psychologist disputes the conventional
wisdom on Clinton. Frank Farley of Temple University, a past
president of the American Psychological Association, says Clinton
is less a compartmentalizer than a compulsive risk-taker who
thrives on uncertainty and discordance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying he compartmentalizes is a neat box to put Clinton in,
you can visualize it, but I'm not sure it has much validity,'' says
Farley. ``He's more what I call a T-type personality. By which I
mean, someone who likes excitement and adventure and who is capable
of juggling many things at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Clinton to other T-type politicians _ John F. Kennedy,
Gary Hart, and Theodore Roosevelt are three names that come up _
and to Albert Einstein, a more purely intellectual T-type, Farley
notes that even in impeachment, Clinton exuded self-confidence.
That wasn't a byproduct of denial or delusion, Farley suggests, but
a shining example of the Clinton who gets most energized when he's
most beset by contradictory forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave his State of the Union speech like he was the last
gunfighter standing at the OK Corral,'' observes Farley. ``He's a
jazz man. He lives for uncertainty. When you say he
compartmentalizes, I say the human mind doesn't really work that
way. We're the one species that doesn't live in boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, the ones fashioned by historians.

THE DIARY OF VASLAV NIJINSKY 
Unexpurgated Edition 
Edited by Joan Acocella. Translated, from the Russian, by Kyril
Fitzlyon. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. 312 pp. Illustrated. $30. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dancer began his program by sitting in a chair, staring at
the audience for what seemed an eternity. Eventually, he unrolled
strips of black and white velvet on the floor to form a cross.
Standing in its center, he announced he was dancing out ``the war
which you did not prevent,'' and launched into a violent
improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   While the description fits the dance world of the Vietnam era,
the actual event came half a century earlier, on Jan. 19, 1919,
when Vaslav Nijinsky, the most celebrated dancer in history, gave
his final performance, in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, he began his famous diary, an intense, six-week
outpouring that ended with a train trip to Zurich and
institutionalization in a mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Nijinsky's life with dance, including his days as a child
prodigy, lasted two decades; his life with insanity, just over
three. His legend is based almost as much on the latter as on the
former, which is scantily documented. The primary way people have
learned of his madness is through the diary, which his wife,
Romola, published in 1936 _ along with a plea for contributions
toward his medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Romola did for Nijinsky's diary what Anne Frank's father did to
hers, sanitizing it. In addition to removing references to bodily
functions and sex, Romola red-penciled parts unflattering to
herself, ``My wife is an untwinkling star'' among them. She also
cut out much of Nijinsky's elaborate wordplay, poems, and puns, the
illogical, the passages in which Nijinsky casts himself as God's
own voice.
</P>
<P>
   It's all been restored now, in the first unexpurgated version in
English, and the first in any language to publish the so-called
``fourth notebook'' that Romola repressed, which consists of
letters to friends, acquaintances, and, in one case, ``mankind.''
The original notebooks remained in Romola's possession until her
death, in 1978, after which they were sold at Sotheby's, with
Nijinsky's two daughters retaining the copyright. They released it
only in 1995, when the complete diary was published in French.
</P>
<P>
   The new English edition, in a translation by Kyril Fitzlyon, is
edited by Joan Acocella, whose lengthy introduction is both
fascinating and essential. Wade through the diary without it at
your peril. Acocella, biographer of Mark Morris, is not only among
the finest dance writers of the day but also uniquely equipped to
take on Nijinsky: She coauthored the textbook ``Abnormal
Psychology: Current Perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   She begins by pointing out that while plenty of other artists
have gone mad, none that she knows of has left an on-the-spot
written account of what it's like to do so. Nijinsky's diary does,
and it makes for sad and scary reading, a saga of doom. Nijinsky
was fully aware of what that train ride to Zurich meant. He wanted,
instead, to go to Paris and see that his diary was published. He
not only meant the world to read it; he also meant it to save the
world _ and himself. ``I want my manuscript to be photographed,''
he wrote, ``because I feel that my manuscript is alive. I will
transmit life to people if my manuscripts are photographed.''
</P>
<P>
   He opened on a note of normalcy _ ``I have had a good lunch, for
I ate two soft-boiled eggs and fried potatoes and beans'' _ but
soon turned inward to a private universe. ``I have a dry maid
because she does not feel,'' he wrote. In his idiosyncratic
vocabulary, ``dry'' seems to mean having all the life wrung out of
you, ``thinkers'' are literal and brutish, and ``feelers'' are
sensitive, intuitive and, to Nijinsky, altogether superior.
</P>
<P>
   His use of language, writes Acocella, shows schizophrenic traits
including insistent repetition and ``clanging,'' connecting words
on the basis of sound rather than sense. But, she adds, ``As for
repetition, elision, and odd juxtapositions, these were the
stock-in-trade of early modernist artists, of whom Nijinsky was
one.'' The diary's stream-of-consciousness narrative, she notes,
has been compared to ``Ulysses.'' And Nijinsky's page-long
paragraphs and eccentric capitalization fit a modernist canon that
created new rhythms, new hierarchies. It's not much of a stretch to
see Nijinsky as precursor of such diverse artists as Martha Graham,
John Cage, and Philip Glass.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, it is tragic that he left so little for history to
go on. ``Never,'' Acocella writes, ``was so much artistic fame
based on so little artistic evidence: one 11-minute ballet, `Faun,'
plus some photographs.'' Of the four ballets Nijinsky created, his
1912 ``Afternoon of a Faun'' is the sole survivor _ and still an
astonishing work. Nijinsky threw out the rules of classicism,
creating a flat frieze of movement with the dancers' legs in the
parallel position they'd been trained out of since their first
ballet class.
</P>
<P>
   It's immensely frustrating that Nijinsky barely mentions his
choreography in the diary. Nor does he write much about his
dancing. But people familiar with his legend, and careful readers
of Acocella's introduction, will connect the dancing career with
the writing. The press proclaimed Nijinsky the ``God of the
dance,'' and perhaps the adulation helped tip him into identifying
with the deity _ he signed Book 1 of the diary ``God Nijinsky.''
``I am the God who dies when he is not loved,'' wrote the dancer
whose fans stole his underwear out of his dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   In the diary he dwelled on his family, friends, enemies,
doctors, servants; his diet; his sexuality, including his period of
``chasing tarts'' in Paris; his dialogue with God; his hatred of
Diaghilev, the impresario who made him the most renowned dancer on
earth _ after he had made him his lover. Nijinsky used the black
smears that Diaghilev's hair dye left behind on the pillow as a
graphic illustration of his disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Disgust plays a big part in the diary. Nijinsky was revolted by
red meat, believing it to cause excess lust. He railed against
masturbation, which ``causes idiocy,'' he wrote. Some of his
philosophy he picked up from Tolstoy, whom he revered. But his
obsession with eating and elimination also go with being a dancer;
it's an occupational hazard, as any observer of a contemporary
dance scene blighted by anorexia and bulimia knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am both wife and husband,'' he wrote. His was a fluid
persona, not only in matters sexual. The familiar photographs of
Nijinsky demonstrate his power to become another character
completely, even a nonhuman one. Looking at those images of
Nijinsky as the spirit of a rose, you can almost smell the
blossom's perfume.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of his sometimes impenetrable writing are
perceptive gems, rarely to do with dance. Before charities were
routinely criticized for being administrative-heavy, for instance,
Nijinsky complained that ``Societies for the poor become rich and
are unable to organize things.''
</P>
<P>
   Believing that the circle was the perfect shape, he wrote that
``I do not like a theater with a square stage. I like a round
theater.'' Glimpses of artistic vision suggest that when Nijinsky
snapped, the world lost a choreographer who might have taken the
great 20th-century revolutions in dance several steps further.
While dying the death that finally claimed him in 1950, he wrote,

A WISE WAY TO SETTLE THE `GIRLS WAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUSSELL, New Zealand _ An elderly survivor, a 33-foot whaleboat,
is cradled in the yard of the local museum, and Russell does have
the look and air of a small, unrushed New England whaling town.
Old, well-risen-and-wide-reaching trees guard the handsome white
frame houses that stand behind whitewashed picket fences lining the
quiet waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell, originally known by the Maori name Kororarake, has
been in plenty of action. Countless willful seafaring men have seen
to that as they made names along the Karikari Peninsula, an
upraised finger from the fist that is New Zealand's North Island.
Whalers, adventurers, naval commanders, missionaries, traders.
</P>
<P>
   But could any have been as magnetic as the visiting English
whaling captain William Darby Brind? As the object of too much
affection _ perhaps the whalebone of contention? _ Captain Brind
was the cause of the ``Girls' War'' of 1830. Because each of two
native maidens, from different Maori tribes, were convinced that
she was the heart's desire of the captain, their people fought it
out in the neighborhood for the girls' honor.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody won Captain Brind, or the war, which was settled by the
wise chief of chiefs, one Titore, who separated the tribes by an
arbitrary border. Brind may have found whales easier to deal with
than romance.
</P>
<P>
   Captain James Cook, that restless roamer of the Pacific who
would claim Australia for Britain in 1770, sailed into these parts
a year earlier and named the waters the Bay of Isles _ ``a most
noble anchorage.'' Missionaries arrived in the area in 1814, and
urged the inhabitants to change their diet from devouring each
other to something more acceptable to Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, so friendly and placid today, was considered a ``hell
hole'' of the Pacific by those striving Christians, who in 1835
erected New Zealand's first house of their kind of worship, Christ
Church, a couple of blocks from the harbor. The town's three R's in
that time were ``rum, rascality, and rapacity,'' according to one
preacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' says a smiling Allan Nicklin, ``but you won't find
any of them here.'' He and wife, Marilyn, operate the Ounuwhao, an
exemplary bed-and-breakfast where at least her cuisine might be
considered intoxicating by any rascal or straight-arrow. ``There
were a lot of grog shops in the old times, the most notorious run
by a highly qualified rascal, John Johnson, and called the Duke of
Marlborough.''
</P>
<P>
   The duke remains today (minus Johnson, of course) a respectable
harborside inn whose terrace offers good grub, as well as grog, and
a fine view of sailing traffic.
</P>
<P>
   By the 20th century, the rascals worrying the citizenry were the
smooth kind who might turn the heads of female schoolteachers. In
1915, the rules for such educators included these prohibitions:
``No loitering in ice cream parlours. Do not ride in a carriage or
automobile with a man unless he is your brother or father.''
</P>
<P>
   War came to town again in 1845 _ British settlers against the
Maoris, whose fierce patriotic chief, Hone Heke, started it by
chopping down the flagpole from which the new rulers' Union Jack
fluttered, and burning much of the village. Before it was over,
with the usual result, a British warship, HMS Hazard, had bombarded
much of Russell occupied by the Maoris. Outgunned, they had to make
peace, losers in their own land.
</P>
<P>
   Bullet and cannonball damage can be seen in the white planking
of quaint, tidy, one-room Christ Church. In the churchyard are
graves of British marines killed in the fighting. Also those of
Hannah Lethbridge, in 1816 the first foreign woman born in New
Zealand, and whaler Henri Turner of Nantucket, skipper of the
Mohawk at his death in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   Across the bay by ferry is a livelier town, Paihia, and the
Waitangi National Reserve where the British signed a treaty with
the Maoris in 1840. It conceded governorship to the outsiders (New
Zealand became independent in 1947) but guaranteed citizenship and
land rights to the natives. Like US treaties with the Indians, it
has been often broken, and is still hotly debated.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, the Whare Runanga, the wooden Maori meetinghouse, one
large room, is a mystical treasure distinguished by its carvings,
particularly the imaginatively fearsome eyes and tongues. Splendid
carving, notably sea monsters, also dominates the impressive war
canoe nearby. Longer even than its long-preserved name,
Ngatokimatawhaorua, it's a 120-foot replica of the vessel in which
Kupe, the Maoris' great ancestor from Polynesia, is said to have
discovered New Zealand at the end of the first century.
</P>
<P>
   Kupe-power was furnished by 80 muscular paddlers, but I would
suggest that an easier, more practical means of wandering the
gorgeous Bay of Isles is sailpower. A day's passage out of Russell
on a 56-foot ketch called A Place In The Sun has been booked, and
Pip Campbell, the one-woman crew, casts off. Her husband, Oliver
Campbell, is at the eight-spoked wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My city-girl dream was to marry a man with a boat,'' she says,
laughing, ``but I didn't know I'd be doing most of the work. Oh, he
helps with the sails, and this has been going on _ still a dream _
for 20 years. Barefoot, briny, and barnacled we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The seascape is dreamy. Isle after isle, each a different size
and conformation. Oliver says, ``There are about 350 of them, 50
inhabited.'' Some jutting rock assemblages lead my friend, Aurelio,
to dub them ``an aquatic Stonehenge.'' Along the way, we encounter
a gang of penguins, diving for lunch, and Pip brings out ours,
sandwiches. Lonely black rocky platforms are trimmed in white by
homesteading gulls or green by lichen.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver takes a chance, giving us turns at the wheel, saying,
``Oh, the boat can steer itself. It knows the way by now. I usually
drink and drive.'' And he does _ though his poison is Coca-Cola,
not rum.
</P>
<P>
   At the wheel I feel like Captain William Darby Brind. But
Aurelio says, ``I don't think there's any danger of you starting
another `Girls' War'.''

TEEN ANGEL FOREVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Frankie Avalon, a teen idol on the cusp of 60, pops
out of a long black limousine and points toward the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Malibu?'' he asks, incredulously. ``This is the
beach?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he's at Dorchester's Malibu Beach, just across an
inlet from the Dorchester Yacht Club. There are no frolicking
bikini babes, and not a surfboard in sight. Two people are walking
their dogs and the tide's about as low as it gets. The wave in
Avalon's hair is bigger than the ones haplessly lapping at the
shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surf's down,'' smiles Avalon, who's about as happy as a guy
gets. He's trim and tan and smiling. Just like in all those beach
movies he made with Annette Funicello back in the '60s. And why
not?
</P>
<P>
   ``What's not to like?'' asks Avalon, rhetorically, as he
searches for something complimentary to say about the MDC's Malibu
Beach. ``OK, so there aren't many waves. Hey, it's not crowded,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made those beach movies in 15 days for $350,000,'' says
Avalon, in town promoting his upcoming appearance as Teen Angel in
``Grease'' opening Wednesday at the Wang Theatre. ``We didn't get
rich. But they were a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's hard not to have fun when you're hanging with
Frankie. His smile is sincere and straightforward. His tan, in a
shade that would make George Hamilton envious, comes from Twilight
Tan, a self-tanning product he sells on the Home Shopping Network.
His kids are fine, his wife loves him, and he's still getting paid
to play the world's oldest teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought the image was funny,'' says Avalon as he
steps back into the limo. ``I mean, I take my acting and singing
seriously. But not myself.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1958 to 1960, they didn't get much hotter than Frankie
Avalon. From ``Dede Dinah'' to ``Venus,'' he had prepubescent
screaming female fans hitting octaves that wouldn't be heard again
until John, Paul, George, and Ringo hit town. At $5,000 a night
performing for crowds of 10,000, Avalon racked in the dough. And he
was still just a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would end,'' he says. ``I was wild. I had a
hangout house in Los Angeles. Johnny Rivers. Glen Campbell. Jack
Nicholson. They'd hang out and we'd play cards and there were
starlets all around. That's the way it was. One night, this girl
Lisa showed up and I fell in love. That was it. I told everyone
there that I was going to marry that girl. Three weeks later, I
did. And we've been married ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   For 36 years, to be precise _ long enough to have eight children
ranging in age from 25 to 35.
</P>
<P>
   Avalon's introduction to show business wasn't through his voice
but through a trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the trumpet,'' he says. ``I practiced for four or five
hours every day. I remember cooling off in a bathtub on those hot
Philly nights and playing the trumpet. I was 11 and I heard that Al
Martino, who came from our neighborhood, was having a party. So I
snuck in. I just went in and started playing. It was just like a
movie. Everyone stopped talking and Al Martino liked me. The next
thing I knew I was in the penthouse of the Sheraton Hotel in New
York playing for Jackie Gleason. He booked me on his show.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Into the stratosphere &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it was singing that made Avalon a star. Some friends founded
Chancellor Records, and Avalon started hanging out in the studio.
One day, he recorded ``Dede Dinah,'' a song that achieved its
unique nasal quality when Avalon, as a joke, held his nose while he
was recording. That was the cut they released, and it sent Avalon
into the pop star stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while everything was great,'' says Avalon, as the
limousine noses along the Southeast Expressway toward town. ``When
I was in Hollywood making the beach movies with Annette we got to
meet everybody. I was lucky. I met Gary Cooper. I worked with John
Wayne (in ``The Alamo''). Elvis.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Elvis?
</P>
<P>
   Presley was often portrayed as Avalon's evil adversary in those
early fanzines. Avalon, the pretty boy next door vs. the
hip-swinging, sexually dangerous Presley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just made-up stuff. We liked each other, but Elvis
was strange. He left his house in the morning _ was driven to the
studio. Worked all day. Was driven home. And he stayed there. He
invited me up to his house a couple of times. It was strange. One
of his friends or bodyguards _ whatever they were; they all dressed
like him _ came into the living room and announced that Elvis would
be down in five minutes. It was as if he was doing a show. And he
had this great jukebox that held 100 records _ all but one of them
by Elvis. I remember the only one not his was `It's Only Make
Believe' by Conway Twitty _ and he sounded just like Elvis.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that make Avalon likable is his guilelessness.
He would rather talk about other people than about himself. He
realizes his limitations. He stills gets a kick out of his work and
he refuses to become a parody of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Randall Kleiser, the director, asked me to play Teen
Angel in the movie `Grease,' I hesitated,'' says Avalon, who
descends from the heavens singing ``Beauty School Dropout'' in the
hit film. ``I'd seen the play and Teen Angel was played all in
black like a motorcycle gang leader. I didn't want that. So, I
redesigned him. I made him more my style.''
</P>
<P>
   What is Avalon's style?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never a threat to anyone,'' he says. ``I wasn't 9 feet
tall. I was nice.'' Avalon pauses, staring out the window at the
flock of giant cranes working on the Big Dig. ``I can't believe it
lasted.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to think of Avalon without thinking of Annette, his
beach partner and love interest in the beach movies. Annette
Funicello suffers from multiple sclerosis, and according to Avalon,
``she's not doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had so much fun doing `Back to the Beach,' '' he says,
referring to the 1987 retro-beach movie that Variety called ``a
wonderfully campy trip down pop culture's trash-filled memory
lane'' and inspired critic Leslie Halliwell to write, ``Not so bad
as it sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Annette was great,'' Avalon says. ``She never complained, but
she was having trouble with her eyes and she stumbled a little. I
just accepted an award for her at a special ceremony. Michael
Eisner was there. I saw her backstage and told her how beautiful
she looked. I told her to keep praying. She told me that she keeps
praying, but God didn't answer her prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Avalon, a devout Roman Catholic, says he responded, ``God's
delay is not God's denial.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Congenial partnership &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We made seven films together and we never had an argument or a
disagreement,'' he says. ``One of the sad parts is that she never
made any money until `Back to the Beach.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, during the late '60s through the mid-'70s, money
was a problem for Avalon, who at one time had thought he had ``more
money that I ever dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was broke,'' he says as the limousine pulls up across from
the Wang Center for the Performing Arts. ``And I thought I was
broke before I got in trouble with the IRS. I thought, at least, my
managers were taking care of the taxes. They didn't. I thought I'd
never recover. There were nights where I'd ask the manager of a
club where I was playing how many people we had. `Forty,' he'd say.
I was used to playing for thousands. I'd ask him if I had to go on.
He said yes. And I'd go on. But it was difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Avalon's eyes brighten. ``But I'll tell you something.
I had success at such a young age that I never learned anything.
When you're doing so well everyone assumes you know everything. And
I was so swept up in everything I never stopped. I only learned
when I started over. At the bottom. Now, I have one of my daughters
working in the office and I take care of my own business. I don't
leave it to someone else. That's why I'm enjoying myself so much
more now. This is just a whole lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at Quincy Market, Frankie Avalon sits behind a long table
surrounded by colorful balloons and dozens of fans. He signs
autographs and exchanges small talk while Paul Perry, a radio
personality on WODS-FM (103.3), plays ``Venus'' and offers tickets
to ``Grease'' as prizes in a trivia contest. Just before the
hula-hoop contest gets underway, Avalon glances up at the ceiling
in the rotunda where a cadre of additional fans had assembled. He
smiles and waves.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Avalon's mother died, four years ago in May, she
told her son she didn't want him to shed a tear when she was gone.
``Why?'' he asked her. ``Because you gave me all the joy and
happiness a mother could want,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Avalon is no longer a teen, his mother believed he was
an angel. And for him, there is no greater testament.

RUTHARDT'S STAYING POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is Linda Ruthardt still the state insurance commissioner?
</P>
<P>
   Just after Paul Cellucci was elected governor last November, it
was reported that Ruthardt wanted to step down _ code for saying
the newly elected governor wanted her to step down.She was
supposedly asked to take a job as risk manager for the Big Dig, as
good a place as any to bury a burdensome bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Cellucci was asked recently about Ruthardt's status as
commissioner, he said he hoped she would remain in her current job
_ code for saying she isn't going anywhere soon. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt is almost always described as ``quirky,'' but that is
hardly a fireable offense _ particularly since it is used so often
to describe women.
</P>
<P>
   In Ruthardt's case, the quirky label comes partly from her
background and partly from her personal style. She is a former
president of the Camp Fire Boys and Girls Inc. and a former
director of risk and insurance for the Girls Scouts of the USA. She
refers to her staff as ``worker bees'' and ``busy bunnies.'' She
once told a reporter ``I'm not the dumbest bunny in the hutch,''
reinforcing an image of cheery flakiness.
</P>
<P>
   She gets credit for overseeing decreases in auto and workers
compensation rate, but is criticized for being an ineffective
department leader. Staff discontent is said to be high, and morale
low. The division is generally considered overworked, understaffed,
and underbudgeted.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this scenario of benign bureaucratic neglect is fairly
typical of government during the Weld-Cellucci years. It exacts its
not-so-benign penalty on whatever area the specific agency is
supposed to be regulating _ children or insurance companies, for
example. Normally, it's no reason to remove anyone, but in
Ruthardt's case, the complaints were loud and they came from
insurance industry sources, as well as from consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   However, she's still on the job, an occurrence partly explained
by her willingness to take hits for the administration and the fact
that her husband is ill.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory about her longevity involves the Emlico
imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
   This complicated case, reported extensively by the Globe's Steve
Bailey and Steve Syre, involved Ruthard's quick approval of a move
by Electric Mutual Insurance Co., a Massachusetts insurer, to
Bermuda. The company, Emlico, filed for bankruptcy a few months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Emlico was founded by General Electric Co. its sole customer.
Robert Cordy, chairman of Cellucci's judicial screening panel and a
former legal counsel to Governor William F. Weld, has been a
lawyer/lobbyist for GE. Other graduates of the Weld-Cellucci
administrations, including former Economic Affairs Secretary Gloria
Larson, have also worked for GE.
</P>
<P>
   When Emlico moved to Bermuda and declared bankruptcy, it left
its reinsurers holding the bill for around $500 million needed for
reserves to cover GE's asbestos and environmental liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Angry reinsurers sued in Massachusetts courts, charging that
Emlico knew it was bankrupt and that it relocated to avoid lawsuits
stateside. The case cast a cloud over Ruthardt's decision to allow
Emlico to relocate. The Massachusetts Supreme Court eventually
ruled that Ruthardt had erred.
</P>
<P>
   In sworn testimony before a legislative committee investigating
the matter, Ruthardt said she was getting signals from someone in
the Weld administration to ``just sort of forget the whole thing''
and let Emlico escape to Bermuda. She later attributed those
signals to a ``misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   After the November election, word seeped out that Ruthardt
``wanted'' to leave her job. Suzanne Bump, a former state
Democratic state representative, was said to be ``emerging'' as a
leading candidate to replace her.
</P>
<P>
   As a legislator, Bump helped reform the state workers'
compensation law. Now, she is an insurance industry lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Cordy and Larson, the administration's former economic affairs
secretary, were said to be pushing Bump. Larson declined comment
when asked about her support for Bump. Cordy said the report of his
support for Bump ``stuns me,'' then declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bump was bumped and Ruthardt remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd still like her to leave. But they are not going to rush
her out the door,'' says an administration insider.
</P>
<P>
   Could Cellucci be treating Ruthardt gently because he worries
what she will say if he doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   Should we care? It's all inside baseball, isn't it, over a
somewhat obscure political post?
</P>
<P>
   Only the quirky Linda Ruthardt knows for sure.

WHICH PLANET IS THE SMALLEST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is the smallest planet in the solar system?
</P>
<P>
   F.R., Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Pluto, with a diameter at the equator of just 1,429 miles, is
the smallest of the nine planets. Discovered in 1930, it's made of
the same ice and dust that other objects that far from the sun are
made of, and some say that because of its small size, composition,
and elliptical-instead-of-circular orbit, Pluto shouldn't even be
called a planet.
</P>
<P>
   But other astronomers say it's not fair to pick on the little
guy. They point out that one suggested astronomical definition of a
planet is anything wider than 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) that
orbits the sun. Pluto qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   But it is small. Earth's moon is nearly 50 percent bigger,
measuring 2,159 miles across. Charon, Pluto's moon, is almost as
big as Pluto itself. Together they are the closest thing to a
double planet in our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   The next smallest planet is Mercury, which is only 3,032 miles
in diameter and the closest planet to the Sun. Earth's diameter is
7,927 miles. Jupiter is the solar system king, more than eleven
times bigger than Earth at a median diameter of 88,875 miles.
Jupiter, made up mostly of gasses, is spinning so fast it's a
little bit oval, so they don't just measure it equatorially.
</P>
<P>
   Compare all that to the sun. At 870,105 miles across, it's
nearly ten times larger than Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the red spot on Jupiter part of the planet or part of its
atmosphere?
</P>
<P>
   M.P.M., Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   They don't call Jupiter's Great Red Spot ``great'' for nothing.
It's bigger than the Earth, 8,700 miles from north to south, 17,400
miles across the middle!
</P>
<P>
   The Great Red Spot is part of Jupiter's atmosphere. Like a giant
hurricane, it has a center and clouds swirling around it. They take
an average of six earth days to make one complete rotation around
the spot, traveling at about 180 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter has lots of ``spots,'' rotating weather systems that are
tougher to see from Earth because they're smaller and mostly white.
Nobody knows why the Red Spot is red. Astronomers think it may be
because it has enough power to draw trace chemicals up from the
planet's lower levels (Jupiter, like all the giant outer planets,
is believed to have little or no solid surface.) But even the
Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft that flew by for a close look back in
1979 and the observations by Galileo, which has been orbiting
Jupiter since Dec. 1995, weren't able to figure that one out.

AS YEARS ADVANCE, PEOPLE SLEEP LESS, WAKE EARLIER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most people with his condition, Frank Tosti, who is 67, had
no idea why he constantly felt so logey that he was in danger of
dozing off in the middle of a business conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But when he drifted onto the highway median strip at 65 miles
per hour one day, Tosti's wife insisted he get help. Two nights in
a sleep laboratory revealed the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found out I was waking up 53 times an hour, although I
didn't know it,'' he recalls. ``That didn't leave me much time for
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosti's problem is sleep apnea _ momentary cessation of
breathing while asleep. It's among the most common reasons why many
people of a certain age discover they can no longer take a good
night's sleep for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep disorders are rampant among the elderly. ``All sleep
disorders increase in prevalence with age,'' says Dr. John
Winkelman, the Brigham and Women's Hospital sleep specialist in
Boston who diagnosed Tosti's problem. More than half of people over
65 have persistent trouble sleeping, a proportion that rises to two
of every three in nursing homes, according to a National Institutes
of Health report on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A report to Congress last year by the National Center on Sleep
Disorders Research decried an ``epidemic of more than 40 million
undiagnosed and untreated, or misdiagnosed and mistreated,
chronically ill sleep-disorders victims.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just ``disorders'' that are to blame. Researchers
have found that normal, healthy elders with no identifiable
disorders sleep less, wake earlier, have more nocturnal
wakefulness, and spend less time in deep sleep than younger adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found some fascinating changes in older people,'' says
Dr. Charles A. Czeisler, director of the Circadian, Neuroendocrine
and Sleep Disorders Section at Brigham and Women's. ``As we get
older, the range of times in which we can sleep soundly is much
narrower. That's probably why older shift workers have so much more
difficulty sleeping during the daytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sanford H. Auerbach, director of the sleep disorders center
at Boston Medical Center, notes that these changes often arise in
middle age. ``As we age, we become more intolerant of sleep
deprivation. The whole sleep system is a little more delicate,''
Auerbach says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, starting in middle age, ``people can't sleep late
any more. Their clock just won't allow it,'' he says. ``So if they
want to catch up on their sleep, they have to go to bed earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that some of the most common sleep disorders
can be successfully treated _ but only if they are recognized and
properly diagnosed. Unfortunately, specialists say, many physicians
don't know much about sleep problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders in primary-care
medicine today is essentially zero,'' the National Center on Sleep
Disorders Research said in its report. Winkelman notes that medical
schools devote an average of only one hour in their four-year
curricula to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many people think nothing can be done about their
their difficulty getting to sleep, their poor-quality sleep, or
their too-early awakening. ``People think it's just part of growing
old,'' Auerbach says. ``Patients don't even complain to their
primary care physicians sometimes, thinking there's nothing that
can help them.'' Or they make matters worse by practicing poor
sleep habits or resorting to over-the-counter nostrums that give
rise to other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors' successes in treating sleep apnea and another leading
cause of sleeplessness, called ``restless legs syndrome,'' are
antidotes to despair.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep apnea, which afflicts more men than women, can interrupt
sleep hundreds of times a night because breathing is blocked by
narrowing or collapse of the air passages at the back of the
throat. A rapid buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood sets off
alarms in the brain so conscious breathing can take over. Like
Tosti, most apnea victims don't remember waking, because it takes
three to five minutes of wakefulness to establish a lasting memory.
</P>
<P>
   The problem ceased when Tosti began a nightly treatment called
CPAP, for ``continuous positive air pressure.'' At bedtime, the
Taunton man puts on a plastic mask attached to a device that gently
forces air into his nose, keeping his airways open. It has made all
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sleep a solid six hours a night and wake up bright-eyed and
bushy-tailed,'' the real estate broker says.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Clifford, a 61-year-old retired school guidance
counselor, is another CPAP success story. ``I feel invigorated in
the morning now,'' Clifford says, ``whereas before I'd drag myself
through the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every sleep apnea sufferer needs CPAP. Some can be helped by
weight loss, avoidance of alcohol within six hours of bedtime, or
even such expedients as sewing a tennis ball into the back of their
pajama tops to prevent them from sleeping on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, 65-year-old Edmund Teixeira, a retired school
principal and coach, had a double dose of sleeping trouble. In
addition to sleep apnea, Teixeira had a severe case of restless
legs syndrome, or RLS _ an irresistable urge to move the legs
during the night that makes sleep impossible. In addition to the
restless movement, patients often describe the syndrome with words
like achy, crampy, creepy-crawly, worms crawling under my skin, and
heebie-jeebies.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of RLS is probably in the nervous system, but beyond
that no one knows if it originates in the lower brain, the spinal
cord, or the peripheral nerves in the legs. Whatever the cause,
Teixeira and other victims testify that it's a maddening malady
that can ruin everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a period of 18 months, it was a nightmare,'' he says. ``My
legs would start bouncing like mad. I could not go to sleep. People
said, 'You're retired, you can sleep late.' But I'm a diabetic, I
need physical activity. I need to get up and play golf with
friends. It gets to the point where you'd do anything to get to
sleep.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... to sleep.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teixeira's problem was tamed, as many patients' are, with low
doses of l-dopa (Sinemet) and pramipexole (Mirapex), drugs designed
for people with Parkinson's disease, another movement disorder that
is thought to have nothing to do with RLS. For individuals in whom
those drugs don't work, doctors sometimes prescribe benzodiazepine
sedatives, opioids such as codeine, or anticonvulsants such as
gabapentin (Neurontin).
</P>
<P>
   With faithful use of his CPAP face mask for apnea and medication
for his restless legs, Teixeira says, ``I feel that I've turned the
corner. Lately I've been sleeping right through the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients like Teixeira, Clifford, and Tosti are relatively easy
cases, the kind about which Winkelman says, ``You get to feel good
about yourself as a doctor because usually you can produce
tremendous relief for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Other victims of sleeplessness pose more challenges, but that
doesn't mean they can't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, about one-third of chronic insomnia is rooted in
depressive mood disorders that can range in severity from mild to
severe, and affect women more often than men. Antidepressants can
often improve their sleep, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause often gives rise to sleep problems in women. Winkelman
recently saw a 60-year-old woman who has not slept normally since
she underwent menopause a decade ago. ``No one knows why this
occurs,'' he says. ``Somehow estrogen is related to a number of
functions _ mood, memory, sleep, and so on. We're investigating
menopause-related sleep disturbance and how much hormone
replacement helps or does not help sleep problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A broad array of age-related medical problems can also wreck
sleep: arthritis and other painful conditions; prostate enlargment;
heart and lung disease that can cause shortness of breath; the
``heartburn'' caused when stomach acid leaks into the esophagus or
food tube; Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the medications to treat these and other problems
can themselves interfere with sleep _ a factor to which doctors and
patients should be alert whenever sleep is an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, some sleep problems are more amenable to treatment
than others, depending on the underlying cause. But almost always,
careful dissection of the problem can lead to helpful treatment,
specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to make a diagnosis of sleep disorders,'' Winkelman
says. ``Unfortunately, many physicians will just tell people, `Oh,
drink a glass of wine,' or `Take a hot bath,' or `Here's a sleeping
pill'.''
</P>
<P>
   And often, of course, the sleep deprived will go to the
drugstore and buy one or more over-the-counter sleep aids. Bad
idea, sleep specialists say. They usually contain antihistamines
such as benadryl, which can cause or aggravate constipation,
urinary retention, tachycardia (a racing heart beat) and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   As for alcohol, another favorite sleep aid, its short sedative
effect wears off in a few hours, leaving users stranded on the
shores of sleeplessness _ and it's a diuretic to boot, requiring
noctural trips to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription sleeping pills, or ``hypnotics'' as they're called,
can be useful for short periods when unusual stress or bereavement
is an issue. But better for the long run, doctors say, are
antidepressants in carefully modulated doses. Doctors prescribe
well-tested drugs such as trazodone (Desyrel), amitriptyline
(Elavil), and doxepin (Sinequan) for their mildly sedating, rather
than their antidepressant, effects. And unlike other sedatives,
they don't pose the risk of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HELP IS OUT THERE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone battling a sleep problem _ but especially elders _ should
begin by practicing good ``sleep hygiene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with flossing your teeth, but with
habits and behaviors that prepare you for sleep and facilitate
optimal sleep quality,'' says Dr. John Winkelman of Brigham and
Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   These habits may sound obvious, but sufferers dismiss them at
their peril. They include:
</P>
<P>
   Regular bedtime. Recent science backs up your mother. Elders are
less flexible about shifting schedules, and their inner clocks are
set about an hour earlier than young adults', predisposing them to
awaken earlier than they may want to.
</P>
<P>
   Many make matters worse, says sleep researcher Charles A.
Czeisler, by exposing themselves to light in the early morning,
which resets their circadian clocks to an earlier hour. Those who
want to sleep later, he says, should ``avoid early-morning light
exposure and increase exposure to light in the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Be careful with caffeine and alcohol. Caffeine after noon and
alcohol within six hours of bedtime are ``two major culprits'' in
sleeplessness, says Dr. Sanford Auerbach of Boston Medical Center.
``Caffeine can be a much bigger issue in the elderly.'' Limiting
liquid intake in the evening will also reduce the chance that a
full bladder will disrupt sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the Goldilocks rule. Be sure everything is just right:
Not too hot, not too cold; not too firm, not too soft; not too
bright, or noisy either. And reserve the bedroom for sleeping or
sex.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't sleep, don't fret in bed. ``If you're not sleepy,
you shouldn't be in bed,'' Winkelman advises. ``If you're not
asleep after 20 or 30 minutes, you should get up and do something
distracting. After that, anxiety and clock-watching is only going
to increase.''

TV NEWS FEELS A HARSH NEW ECONOMIC REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As suddenly as it flared up, a highly publicized
contract dispute involving Susan Wornick, one of Boston's most
popular TV news anchors, could be nearing a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Friday, WCVB-Ch. 5 general manager Paul La Camera
announced that Wornick was finished at Channel 5, sending shock
waves through a station where she had worked for two decades, and
through a community where she had become a gregarious fixture. But
La Camera and Wornick are now talking again, amid signs that the
offer she previously rejected may be put back on the table, and
that this time she will say yes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it is settled, the Wornick-Channel 5 imbroglio
has thrown a revealing light on the changed landscape of TV news.
In the cable era, shrinking audiences have imposed a new economic
reality on local broadcast stations, especially those that are _
like Channel 5 _ owned by out-of-town conglomerates. ``It's a
message that all bets are off, that it really is a new age,'' said
one Channel 5 staffer Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporters and anchors no longer stand on the firm ground they
once stood on. There was a time when, if you were doing well, and
your ratings were up, you could name your deal. That's no longer
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Wornick's ratings could scarcely be better: Since she began
coanchoring the Channel 5 noon newscast 10 years ago with Jim Boyd,
the newscast has won every ratings ``sweeps'' period. But Jim
Thistle, who hired Wornick 20 years ago when he was news director
at Channel 5 and who is now the dean of broadcast journalism at
Boston University, said the old cause-effect assumptions no longer
apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's under pressure. The business has changed,'' said
Thistle. ``In the 1970s and '80s, the axiom was that you would
always make more money the next year than you did the previous
year; owning a network affiliate was like a license to print money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those days are long gone because of competition from cable
and home satellites and the Internet. So local on-air people don't
command automatically the kinds of salaries they did 10 or 15 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement between La Camera and Wornick is reached, it
would still be subject to approval from executives at Hearst-Argyle
Television, Inc., Channel 5's corporate parent. La Camera declined
to discuss details of the negotiations, saying only that ``there's
continued discussions occurring'' with Wornick.
</P>
<P>
   Wornick herself did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   While the contract offer was not initially satisfactory to
Wornick, there are no indications it contained a pay cut in her
salary of nearly $300,000 per year. Neither are there indications,
however, that it contained a pay raise as hefty as some others at
Channel 5 have reportedly received.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with cost-cutting,'' insisted La
Camera. ``Susan Wornick decided not to renew her contract with
WCVB-TV and decided to leave on Friday.'' Channel 5 news director
Candy Altman said it is ``patently false'' to suggest the station's
negotiating stance was motivated by cost-cutting concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some observers speculated that Channel 5's
apparent initial willingness to let Wornick walk may have stemmed
from the temptation to unload a big salary and replace it with that
of a lesser-paid journalist. The echoes had barely faded from
Wornick's final negotiating session with La Camera when the station
put out a press release announcing her departure.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter at a rival station who requested anonymity said that
Hearst-Argyle, owner of Channel 5, has developed a reputation of
being ``very much bottom-line people, much more `show me the money,
let's run this like a normal business.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Few of those interviewed by the Globe believed the difficulties
encountered by Wornick, 49, were related to the plight faced by
many aging TV newswomen in a business that wants fresh, young faces
before the camera. Several, however, noted that she was passed over
five years ago for an anchor post on one of Channel 5's
early-evening newscasts in favor of Heather Kahn, nearly two
decades her junior.
</P>
<P>
   Wornick acknowledged last year in an interview with The Boston
Globe Magazine that ``it was upsetting to me, and everybody knew
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the dispute will put a dent in the image of a
professional ``family'' that Channel 5 tries to project. Others,
however, predict it will quickly blow over. They say the truth of
the matter is that negotiations simply got out of hand between two
people who like and respect each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just one of these last minute, very emotional,
spur-of-the-moment issues that popped up,'' said Emily Rooney,
former news director and a close friend of Wornick's. ``It was an
unfortunate confluence of events. It didn't have as much thought
behind it as it should have on Susan's part.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney added that Wornick is ``really pleased that they're
talking again and really wants to go back to Channel 5,'' and that
Wornick ``really hopes they forgive her.''
</P>
<P>
   The ebullient Wornick is also a consumer reporter for Channel 5
and she is known as a figure who throws herself zealously into
community events. She was conspicous by her absence on Channel 5's
noon news Monday; colleague Liz Brunner substituted for her.
</P>
<P>
   For Channel 5, long the dominant force in Boston TV news, the
dispute _ with its damaging headlines and calls from irate viewers
_ occurred at what even La Camera conceded is ``not the most
opportune time.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the middle of the vital February ``sweeps'' period,
during which newscast ratings are closely measured to set future
advertising rates, the chief revenue source for local stations.
</P>
<P>
   While still firmly on top at noon, Channel 5 seems vulnerable
elsewhere. Long dominant in Boston, the station has been losing
ground lately to WHDH-Ch. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Channel 5 would make a mistake in allowing a person who's that
well-known and that well-liked in the community to leave,''
remarked WBZ-Ch. 4 reporter Dan Rea.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer clear that Wornick will in fact leave. What is
clear, however, is that Boston's broadcast community is buzzing
about once-staid Channel 5.

WITH IMPEACHMENTS, LITTLE SET IN STONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the one hand, many constitutional scholars and historians are
deeply upset by the precedents growing out of President Clinton's
legal and political travails. Then again, most aren't very worried
about what those precedents portend.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the seemingly contradictory analysis is this: No
matter how important the short-term impact may be of any actions
taken by the courts or by the Congress since the president's affair
with Monica S. Lewinsky was revealed, the experts believe future
judges and lawmakers probably won't model their behavior strictly
on this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' said William Van Alstyne, a constitutional
historian at Duke University who maintains Clinton committed
impeachable offenses. ``Everything could be reassessed if and when
there is another episode like this, and much of it probably will
be. . . . Absolutely, we could make too much of all this.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that legal specialists take this case
lightly. Indeed, some argue it already may have shifted the balance
of power among the branches of government, and set other important
precedents, but they disagree about what the changes are and how
lasting they may be.
</P>
<P>
   Most critics of the charges against Clinton, for instance,
assert that Republican prosecutors _ by focusing on behavior that
was mainly private _ have so diminished the intent of ``high crimes
and misdemeanors'' that future House majorities will be tempted to
impeach presidents whenever it suits their partisan purposes. In
this view, the effect of the prosecution was to shift the balance
of power away from the executive and toward the legislative.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, some conservative scholars contend that Democratic
pressure put such constraints on the prosecution's case,
particularly by limiting the number of witnesses and blocking live
testimony, that it undermined the prospect of success for future
prosecutions. This analysis holds that the legislative branch has
diluted its ability, through impeachment, to keep presidents in
check, thereby shifting power to the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, experts with diverse views about other issues said a
major shift toward the judicial branch, at the expense of the other
two, could take place if there is an appeal to the Supreme Court
about any aspect of the trial _ from the closing of Senate
deliberations to the final verdict _ and the court agrees to hear
it. That now seems extremely unlikely, but legal scholars don't
preclude it given the harshly adversarial nature of the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically, there are supposed to be neutral, historical
standards . . . and changing them can have a real impact on the
balance of power,'' said Judith Olans-Brown, a constitutional law
professor at Northeastern University. ``But the truth is that
precedent in many ways is a myth. When the Supreme Court doesn't
want to follow one of its rulings anymore, it changes it. So do the
courts . . . and so do the House and the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Precedents, both on legal and procedural matters, are
particularly susceptible to change in presidential impeachments
because they occur so rarely. Moreover, the Constitution gives
Congress such broad latitude in deciding issues relating to them
that precedent matters less than it does in other legal
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   So the Senate's decision to close its doors for deliberations in
the Clinton case was based on Andrew Johnson's trial more than a
century earlier, when television and open-meeting laws didn't
exist. But that doesn't mean future senators, faced with different
social pressures and advanced technologies, will make the same
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, just because the Supreme Court held unanimously that
Paula Jones could proceed with her civil suit against Clinton while
he was in office _ a decision that ultimately led to his
impeachment trial _ doesn't mean that subsequent courts will allow
similar litigation against other presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't go so far as to say they can or would totally
reinvent their decisions each time they're made, but they have such
wide discretion that, certainly, they can do it,'' said Todd
Gaziano, a senior fellow in legal studies at the Heritage
Foundation. He was referring to both the courts and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the circumstances and management of the
Clinton trial won't have substantial legal and historical
reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, both the Supreme Court decision about civil suits
and the expansive authority given to the special prosecutor in this
case, Kenneth W. Starr, have led many potential congressional and
presidential candidates to reassess whether high offices in the
United States are worth seeking or holding.
</P>
<P>
   But, largely as a result of Starr's actions, members of both
parties predict the special prosecutor law will be radically
revised or even eliminated this year. And many legal analysts agree
tat if civil suits against presidents proliferate as a result of
the Clinton v. Jones ruling, the high court probably will reverse
this judgment.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Congress that provoked the most scholarly concern
about the fluidity of impeachment precedent. Just because the
Constitution gives lawmakers so much discretion and power, those
interviewed said, doesn't mean they should necessarily use it.
</P>
<P>
   Experts of every political stripe, for instance, decried the
Senate's serious consideration of splitting its final vote: one on
whether Clinton committed the acts he was charged with, the other
on whether he should be removed from office. Conservatives like
Gaziano and former federal judge Robert Bork joined liberal
scholars in pronouncing that idea as patently unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between having the power to do
something and having the right to do it,'' said Dan Coquilette, a
constitutional historian at Boston College who thinks the charges
against Clinton should not have led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how that difference manifests itself, since a
congressional action probably could not be appealed to a higher
authority, Coquilette replied: ``It's not just a question of the
immediate consequences. The big difference comes in terms of
people's respect for what they do, and the legitimacy of what they
do. . . . History will be the final judge.''

UNEXPECTED WINNERS LIKELY TO BE WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This scandal that was, to many, all about sex and
the married man closes with an unexpected twist: Women come out
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Meager winnings, maybe, for the female leads in the yearlong
soap opera. Paula Jones got her money and a makeover. Monica S.
Lewinsky has a big book deal and bragging rights for a boffo
performance before the House impeachment managers. Even the
vilified Linda R. Tripp has embarked on a network TV
image-enhancement tour.
</P>
<P>
   But just as ``the year of the woman candidate'' followed Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas's sexually charged confirmation
hearings in 1991, many think women will benefit politically from
Washington's toxic mix of sex, machismo, and partisanship that
ended Friday with President Clinton's acquittal in the Senate
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that Elizabeth Dole, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
and Senator Dianne Feinstein suddenly are being touted as women who
can win high office in 2000 _ even though none has said she will be
running for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``For heaven's sake, look what we have been put through because
of the foibles of Washington's failed old-boy network,'' said
Elizabeth Sherman, director of the Center for Women in Politics and
Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
``People think they can clean things up by electing a woman who is
more honest, more compassionate, more authentic, and, true or not,
not as prone to the kinds of sexual peccadillos that men are.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Dole, a two-time Republican Cabinet secretary and the
recently retired head of the American Red Cross, debuted on the
political stage with a speech in New Hampshire that included
several references to her gender and repeated calls for restoring
integrity and moral leadership in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a little speculation that I might run for
president,'' said Dole, who is expected to formally announce her
intention to do that this week. ``If I run, this will be an
important reason why: The United States deserves a government that
is worthy of her people.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Dole, who is married to former senator Bob Dole, the
1996 presidential candidate, not only has a shot at the top of the
GOP White House field but also would defeat Vice President Al Gore
in a head-to-head matchup today.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, nobody was giving any serious consideration to
Hillary Clinton's running for public office. But her dignified
handling of a public embarrassment, a political crisis, and
certainly, a personal ordeal, won Mrs. Clinton a combination of
respect and sympathy that sent her once-sagging popularity through
the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also dived into last fall's elections, campaigning
where her beleaguered husband couldn't and proving that she could
pump up huge crowds and make the difference for Democrats in tight
races. Now she is being wooed by New York Democrats to run for an
open Senate seat in 2000
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wait and see, give her time,'' said Marsha Berry, Mrs.
Clinton's press secretary. ``She has not ruled it in or out.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said the first lady is ``gracious and listens'' to New
Yorkers who are promoting her candidacy, but she refuses to discuss
it, or even think about it, until the impeachment issue is gone.
President Clinton, however, brought it up at a recent fund-raising
dinner in Manhattan, quipping that he might be remembered as ``the
person who comes with Hillary to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's political standing has vastly improved, but isn't it
a terrible irony that people who didn't like her because of her
independence, intelligence, and ambition, found her a much more
sympathetic character after she was taken down and humanized as a
humiliated wife?'' said Wendy Kaminer, an author and public policy
fellow at Radcliffe College.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for
Women, said she thinks Mrs. Clinton ``has an agenda, and she is out
there stirring things up.''
</P>
<P>
   NOW also is poised to stir things up. Its political action
committee met this week to plan ways to promote Feinstein,
California's senior senator, as vice president on the Democratic
ticket in 2000. One idea is to have NOW members show up at campaign
events featuring Gore or former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley
with placards that say ``Democrats Deserve Dianne,'' and
``Countdown to D (Dianne)-Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland said NOW officials had not spoken to Feinstein, a proven
money-raiser from a state rich with electoral votes, but she did
not expect her to ``run from the room and slam the door'' on a vice
presidential draft. Feinstein has gotten attention as a tough and
persistent critic of the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson we learned in the last year is that it is entirely
possible to have an administration that is good on the issues and
on appointing women and still have a streak of sexism a mile
wide,'' said Ireland, in an effort to justify NOW's push to get the
second woman on the Democratic ticket. Former representative
Geraldine Ferraro of New York was the first, in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, President Clinton put women who shared his
politics _ his wife, Democratic lawmakers, and feminist activists _
on the spot by his relationship with Lewinsky. The president became
a campaign issue last fall for Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of
California, Patty Murray of Washington, and Carol Moseley-Braun of
Illinois, who defended Clinton's record but said they deplored his
conduct. Boxer and Murray were reelected; Moseley-Braun was not.
</P>
<P>
   Feminist leaders were accused of hypocrisy for loudly
championing sexual-harassment laws but staying silent when such
charges were brought against a president who advocated for women's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Democratic women in the House or Senate had turned against
him, if feminist groups had abandoned him, or if his wife had
indicated at any point that she did not stand by him, it could have
been a turning point and tipped the public scales against the
president,'' said Martha Burk, president of the Center for the
Advancement of Public Policy, a liberal advocacy group for women.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Burk said, ``it's definitely pay-back time.'' Women's
groups want the White House to act quickly on their issues:
legislation guaranteeing women equal pay for equal but not
identical work, improved child care, and recognition of the special
needs of older women in any Social Security overhaul plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that doesn't happen, women who stood by the president are
going to be supremely disgusted and look beyond the Democratic
Party, particularly if Republicans put forward a good female
candidate next year,'' Burk said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has said she is not interested in the No. 2 spot on the GOP
ticket, but three Republican female senators emerged as leaders and
up-and-comers in the party during the impeachment trial. Senator
Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas led an unsuccessful campaign to open
the Senate's final, secret deliberations. Maine's two senators,
Olympia Snowe and Susan M. Collins, teamed up to seek bipartisan
agreement on a finding of fact proposal to rebuke the president.
That effort failed, too.

   Ireland might try to enlist the Republican women in what she
says will be a major effort this year to get Congress to strengthen
sexual-harassment laws and beef up the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission for better enforcement of civil rights laws.

   ``We're going to make every effort to capitalize on the
Republican Congress's recently expressed and newfound interest in
sexual-harassment laws and enforcement,'' Ireland said. ``Over and

UNCELEBRATED PAID BIG PRICES FOR THEIR BIT PARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI agents showed up at 6 a.m. at Ben Hiatt's
door in Alexandria, Va., with a subpoena and a surprise:
Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr was seeking his grand jury
testimony in the case against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hiatt, a hospitality consultant, didn't welcome the intrusion.
``I felt invaded,'' Hiatt said. And he definitely felt intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, he recalled something his sister, Julie Hiatt Steele,
had said to a Newsweek magazine reporter who was examining her
friend Kathleen Willey's relationship with the president _ a
relationship that had drawn Starr's scrutiny. And on that slender
thread he found himself ensnared in Starr's ever wider net.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has paid much attention to Ben Hiatt or the dozens upon
dozens of little voices who played bit parts in Washington's
dramatic Year of Sex, Scandal, Starr, Monica, Linda, Clinton, and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't mean that in ways large and small, lives haven't
been altered, relationships bruised, and nest eggs shattered in
what, for many, amounted to one very scary moment in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The havoc this has caused to families and children, in dollars
and cents, and in the disruption of lives, has been huge,'' said
Ann Kendall, a well-known Washington child psychologist. ``So many
of them were public servants put under such stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall understands the personal toll because the scandal has
all but devoured her husband, David, one of the lawyers who
defended Clinton in the impeachment trial that ended Friday with
acquittal. Like many others who have been touched by the year of
troubles, Ann Kendall is under an attorney's orders not to talk to
reporters about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Hiatt Steele isn't allowed to give interviews, either. She
faces trial March 30 on Starr's charges she lied to two grand
juries about whether the president groped Willey, a White House
volunteer, outside the Oval Office. But Ben Hiatt, who has set up a
legal defense fund for his sister, an unemployed single mother of
an eight-year-old son, is vocal about how the scandal is putting
her through the wringer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julie is a classic victim. Every day she asks, `Why me?' ''
Hiatt said, noting that his sister faces a maximum 35-year jail
term and is the only person indicted so far by Starr in the
Lewinsky phase of his long investigation. ``She's got a strong
will, but it takes a lot of energy to withstand this kind of
pressure, emotional and financial. It pains her that her son gets
teased at school.''
</P>
<P>
   While under investigation, Steele lost her sales job at a
telecommunications company in Richmond, Va., and her neighbors
began avoiding her, Hiatt said. Worst of all, he said, prosecutors
began questioning him and other relatives about the circumstances
and legality of Steele's adoption of her Romanian-born son in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Steele, Jennifer Palmieri was only a witness in the Starr
probe. A former aide in the office of then-White House chief of
staff Leon Panetta, Palmieri had the bad luck to have been
supervising Lewinsky the night she delivered pizza to, and began an
affair with, the president. For her, testifying before the grand
jury was a ``Kafkaesque'' experience, said Richard Sauber,
Palmieri's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer felt terribly guilty, and she still does,'' Sauber
said. ``Who wants to drop a dime on a co-worker or get a friend in
trouble? Nobody understands how dramatically a thing like this
alters a workplace and how absolutely deleterious it is to personal
and professional relationships when people are afraid to talk to
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Sauber donated his legal services to Palmieri, which is one
reason she has stayed at the White House, now as a deputy assistant
to the president for press operations. ``Spending $20,000 or
$30,000 for a defense in a criminal case is nothing,'' Sauber said.
``But to somebody making $80,000, that is a huge bill.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, of course, is small change compared to what Betty
Currie, the president's secretary, has incurred in her six-figure
legal bills. While some of the big names in the administration
bailed out early, most of the small fish hauled into Starr's probe
remain at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Stewards Bayani Nelvis and Glen Maes, for example, are still on
the job after being grilled by Starr's prosecutors about what they
saw in the pantry outside the Oval Office. Nancy Hernreich and
Marsha Scott, two aides who didn't trust Lewinsky around the
president, and who testified to that, remain as Clinton deputies in
the West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service made a fuss, and an unsuccessful legal
challenge, when more than a dozen of its agents were called to
testify about the president and Lewinsky before Starr's grand jury
last year. Arguing for the privilege of ``protective function,''
lawyers for the service said they feared for a future when the
president would not allow agents to be near enough to carry out
their guard assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Larry Cockell, Clinton's agent in charge, is back and
heading the presidential detail _ Cockell was reassigned around the
time of his testimony _ and there is speculation he is soon going
to be named by the president as director of the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very awkward position for all of us, but I can't say
we have suffered any adverse effect professionally,'' said John
Muskett, a Secret Service officer who told the grand jury he had
often seen Lewinsky around and about the president's office.
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, one of the president's closest advisers through
the scandal, called working in the White House ``one of the
greatest experiences of my life,'' but also one of the most trying.
Emanuel recently left to become an investment banker in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, this period has been a tiring and draining death
march,'' Emanuel said. ``For others, it has been a noble battle
waged against the endless effort of a prosecutor to distract,
attack, and derail the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few, the scandal took them on a strange journey into
celebrity status and media madness. Irene Kassorla, a Los Angeles
psychologist who counseled Lewinsky from 1992 to 1997 and was
required to give Starr a deposition about her patient, said she got
very weary of finding a throng of television cameras at her gate
and reading press interviews she had never given.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to security, privacy, and confidentiality,'' said
Kassorla, noting she would have to ``crouch down in the back seat''
of her car to avoid the press. She also hired three lawyers _ two
in California, one in Washington _ to guide her though the legal
thicket.
</P>
<P>
   All the attention and aggravation had some good effect, however.
Kassorla said her practice now receives more calls from would-be
patients, and attendance has improved at her lectures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that,'' Kassorla said. ``I really like to help
people.''

AN ALTERED POLITICAL LANDSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A quarter century ago, Watergate ended with the
resignation of President Nixon and with booming proclamations of
triumph: (itals)Justice was done, the system worked.(unitals) On
the day Nixon left office, The Boston Globe stretched the words of
the preamble to the Constitution (``We the people . . .'') across
the top of the front page.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone feels that way in America today. There's no sense
of triumph, only trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Our long national nightmare may be over, but that doesn't mean
Americans can now sleep easily.
</P>
<P>
   Because now that we are awakening to the dawn of the post-Monica
era, we are discovering that the landscape of American political
life and culture has been altered substantially _ and in disturbing
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The respect of the public for national authority has diminished.
The connection between the electors and the elected has broken. The
gap between the selfless and the cynical has grown. The wall
between the public and the private has tumbled. The restraints on
the press have loosened. The powers and prerogatives of the
president have eroded. The majesty and mystery of high office have
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate ended with hope. The Clinton sex-and-deception scandal
ends in dejection. Watergate brought a new beginning. The Clinton
episode foreshadows a frightful new era of more intrusion into
public lives, more comprehensive investigations of government
officials and more public alienation.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate left a blot on American political life, but Republican
Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. was able to rise above party and
Democratic Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr. of North Carolina was able to
rise above parochialism. Watergate put administration officials in
impossible positions, but Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson
resigned over a matter of principle. Watergate left the law
trammelled, but the integrity of Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski
above reproach.
</P>
<P>
   The long struggle to determine if President Clinton had an
affair with a onetime intern and then conspired to lie about it
produced no such shining figures _ and no sense or where or how to
make a new start.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Americans _ weary of politics _ are girding for a
congressional session full of suspicions and for a presidential
contest in which the candidates' personal affairs will be as
important as their positions on national affairs. Now Americans
must grow accustomed to a presidency that is grounded in celebrity,
to national debates that are more than ever distilled down to
personality conflicts, and to a bigger gap than ever between
Washington leaders and the people who chose them as their
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, as the president has repeatedly deceived the
American public, and as the nation's politicians have bent the
constitution to partisan advantage, the fragile sense of decency
that pervaded the nation's politics has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a new political world _ one where the sturdy
signposts of the past have been toppled and where the assumptions
that guided Americans in times of turmoil and testing no longer
hold firm. Here are some of the unknowns in that new world:
</P>
<P>
   --The future of the presidency. Clinton set his cap for the
presidency because, in his youth in the heady Kennedy years, the
presidency was the commanding heights of American life and culture.
The strong stewardship of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the
reassuring presidential presence of Dwight D. Eisenhower made the
White House an irresistible focus of national attention. Throughout
the Cold War, when American survival in the face of the communist
threat was not assured, the White House, along with the
``football'' with the secret nuclear-weapons code, was the symbolic
center of American security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first modern president whose tenure fell
completely outside of the Cold War tensions. But Clinton helped
diminish the presidency further when he adopted a political style
that was better suited to afternoon television than to prime-time
presidential addresses; when he chose to be approachable rather
than formidable; and when, after his health-care plan died in 1994,
he changed his approach from grand policy proposals to small
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   All presidents change the office they hold, but few will have
changed it as dramatically as Clinton did. He will leave to his
successor in 2001 a presidency that is shrunken and trivialized _
posing an enormous challenge for an office that until now has shown
remarkable resiliency. In the past, most recently for Gerald Ford
and Ronald Reagan, a diminished presidency has presented an
opportunity for a strong leader to restore the office's prestige _
and with it the nation's.
</P>
<P>
   --The future of the legislative branch. For two centuries,
American congresses have been organized by parties, but seldom _ in
the Reconstruction era, perhaps in the New Deal period _ has the
sense of partisanship on Capitol Hill been as strong as it is
today. Historians likely will apportion the blame evenly _ to the
Democrats for enforcing a near tyranny in the House for 40
consecutive years, to the Republicans by responding with a searing
partisanship of their own once Newt Gingrich led them to power in
1994 and presided as speaker for four years thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The House impeachment and Senate trial only exacerbated those
tensions. Every important question was settled by votes basically
along party lines. When the House finally voted to impeach the
president, only five Democrats and five Republicans broke from
their parties to embrace the views of the other side. When the
Senate voted on whether to call witnesses or dismiss the trial late
last month, only Senator Russell D. Feingold, the Wisconsin
Democrat, strayed from party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the scholarly New York
Democrat, used to say that the glory of the American legislature
was that no important measure ever passed by a party-line or narrow
vote; America jumped into new waters or deep water with both feet,
and both parties. The Clinton impeachment saga jeopardized that
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   --The future of the two-party system. The framers of the
Constitution didn't envision a two-party system, but the enduring
power of the two major parties has been one of the hallmarks of
American political stability. Even so, third-party candidates have
made major challenges to the Democrats and Republicans four times
in the last third of the century (George C. Wallace in 1968, John
B. Anderson in 1980, Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's second term opened with an inquiry into the Democrats'
questionable fundraising practices, but there remained serious
questions about the Republicans' campaign-finance techniques as
well. In behaving more like corporate fund-raisers than like party
organizers, the Republicans and Democrats seemed to undermine their
stability rather than solidify it. The public attention to the
campaign-finance system hurt public confidence in the parties. The
deeply partisan behavior of both parties in the Clinton impeachment
and trial only deepened public suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   --The convergence of politics and technology. President
Clinton's liaison with Monica S. Lewinsky and the furor that
followed it made for a thoroughly modern scandal, recorded by tape,
proven by DNA evidence, prosecuted on television, chewed over on
cable. The technology that transformed into a consuming national
scandal the sort of sexual adventure that Presidents John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson were accused of having were
unimaginable in the Kennedy and Johnson years. One of the elements
of proof in the Clinton scandal, e-mail from Lewinsky, was unknown
to most Americans at the beginning of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton scandal is a harbinger of a new politics for the new
world. As technology expands and the capability of individuals to
record the failings of humans grows, politicians can expect new
levels of scrutiny and Americans can expect scandals to develop
with new levels of volume and velocity.
</P>
<P>
   --The worth of the president's word. Americans have disbelieved
their leaders before; even the earliest observers of the new nation
noted that a hearty crop of skepticism is bred in the fertile
American soil. The popularity of the term ``credibility gap'' in
the Johnson years is proof of Americans' well-justified skepticism
of the president. Harry Truman once said of President Nixon: ``I
don't think the son of a bitch knows the difference between telling
the truth and lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Now President Clinton has added his own half-truths and
deceptions to the nation's repertoire of presidential whoppers. His
finger-wagging denial of any sexual relationship with ``that woman,
Miss Lewinsky'' and his hair-splitting legalisms on subjects such
as the definition of the word ``is'' have further eroded public
trust in the person who occupies the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   --The role of the public. One of the chestnuts of politics is
the story about the lady who said she didn't vote because ``it only
encourages them.'' That lady now speaks for the country, and the
story no longer is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, at every twist, on issues small and large, the
public recoiled from this case, and at every turn the political
establishment, which until recently was reviled for listening too
carefully to polls, defied the public. Americans didn't want
Clinton impeached. The House impeached him anyway. A day before the
Senate voted to depose witnesses, a Pew Research Center poll showed
that 53 percent of people opposed witnesses. The Senate did it
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a growing gap between those who govern and those
who are governed _ but, perhaps more significant, a growing view
that the governing class and the governed class have little in
common, little to do with each other, and little to say to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the political system is as great at the close
of the 20th century as it was at the close of the 18th: To nurture
a connection between public officials and the public, to establish
a sense of legitimacy for the political system, and to infuse the
public with a sense of ownership of the institutions of government.

COUPES ARE BACK _ THOUGH THEY NEVER WENT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coupe is back in favor in the automobile world. It isn't
that these two-door models ever left the car scene, but this year
they are `in' as never before. And more new models are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a sign that buyers are nostalgic for the cars of their
youth or do these cars have an aura of performance combined with
sex appeal?
</P>
<P>
   For the manufacturers, it seems an easy way to gain a more
``youthful'' market and jazz up what might be considered a dull car
line.
</P>
<P>
   The coupe is not the most practical of vehicles _ it's hard to
get into the back seat and cargo space is usually smaller than in a
sedan. And limiting a vehicle to two doors doesn't seem to make
sense at a time when manufcaturers are adding doors to minivans and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   This new marketing of coupes may be the signal of a new era in
the auto world. Manufacturers view the baby-boomers _ now in their
50s and freed of college payments and the need to haul things
around _ as leaving sport utilities and looking for something more
dashing.
</P>
<P>
   Is this fanciful thinking on the part of carmakers or, even a
momentary craze among car buyers? Certainly the numbers don't
justify the new interest in coupes. In 1985, sales of coupes
reached almost 2.1 million or 13.6 percent of the auto market. In
1987, sales were down 1 million with coupes capturing just 6.8
percent of the market. According to Automotive News, the past
year's sales of such coupes as the Honda Accord, Cadillac Eldorado
and Lexus SC have been way off projections. And yet, along comes
Audi, Mercedes, Mercury, Toyota, Volvo and BMW with coupes that
range from the fanciful and sleek to BMW's M Coupe that can best be
described as a drive into nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the more eye-catching coupes are designed to do just
that _ catch buyers' eyes in the showroom. How else can you explain
the Volvo C70, the Toyota Solara or the Mercury Cougar?
</P>
<P>
   Volvo, better known for its boxy designs, has built its
reputation on safety, not style. Volvo knows, as other makers add
to their safety credentials, that it needs to draw in new customers
looking for sleeker style. Toyota's Camry has everything going for
it _ including a reputation for reliability and quality _ but to
many people, it's also short of pizzaz. Enter the Solara, a
Camry-based coupe that is anything but dull in looks. The Cougar is
the first shot from Mercury in its new goal to be more than a Ford
lookalike. The Cougar is a Mercury exclusive. When the new Ford
Thunderbird comes out, it will not share anything of the Cougar
design or platform as it has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   While these coupes have appeal, it's harder to explain the
appeal of the BMW M Coupe. Its design is unusual. A long hood,
short body. Room for just two and enough cargo space to carry two
suitcases of moderate size. But it does perform on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW M Coupe is a bit of nostalgia and its design comes out
of the past. When BMW introduced this South Carolina-built coupe,
it predicted Europeans would use it to dash off to the seashore or
the mountains for a weekend. Little luggage was needed, but the car
had to be quick and handle those mountain roads or twists and turns
down to the sea as nimbly as possible. At $42,000, the car is
loaded with safety, performance and comfort features. BMW says it
will do 0-60 miles per hour in 5 seconds and has a top speed of 137
m.p.h. Not bad for a funny-looking little car.
</P>
<P>
   More in trend with the times, the all new BMW 3-series coupe
will be going on sale this summer. Like the new 3-series sedan for
'99, the coupe will be larger and more quality driven and will
debut as a 2000 model.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz offers two coupes in its CLK line. The V6-powered
CLK320 ($40,600), which was launched last year, is now joined by
the V8-powered CLK430 ($47,200). Mercedes designed the CLK
structure specifically for coupe and Cabriolet models. However, the
Cabriolet convertible is not a coupe with the top cut off. In fact,
except for modified doors on the Cabriolet, the two models share
very little structure and no body panels beyond the A pillars.
</P>
<P>
   For New England drivers, these coupes have added features to
ensure safe driving in wet and winter driving. An Electronic
Stability Program is standard on the 430 and optional on the V6.
ESP prevents slides and spins by automatically detecting the road
problem and applying selective braking to keep the car going where
the driver is pointing it. And there is ASR traction control that
detects when one rear wheel is spinning faster than the other and
selectively applies the brake to that wheel to restore traction. If
it were not for a warning light on the dash to indicate ESP action,
you'd never know something was happening.
</P>
<P>
   These hot performers provide Mercedes safety innovations along
with room for four passengers. There is ample room in the rear for
two passengers, and entry is easy. When a latch is moved on the
driver's or passenger's seat, that seat automatically moves
forward, then returns to its original position.
</P>
<P>
   Like its sedans and wagons, Volvo's C70 coupe is loaded with
safety features. Volvo finally has broken out of its rectangular
looks, and the C70 is proof positive of that change. Volvo isn't
skimping on performance, either. The C70 also is available as a
high-pressure turbo model.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar already is proving to be a winner for Mercury. It is
drawing people into Mercury showrooms who have never bought or
thought of buying a Mercury before. That's success. The Cougar is
available with either a 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a 2.5-liter V6
power plant.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota says its Solara is aimed at ``consumers entering their
peak earning years, who are nostalgic for the sports cars of their
youth, but need more room and comfort that a sports car can
provide.'' It comes with either a four-cylinder or V6 engine and a
choice of five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.
The Solara is the first Toyota to have a new JBL premium sound
system with 200 watts and eight speakers ``that will achieve a
level of performance and sound reproduction previously unavailable
in a Toyota.''
</P>
<P>
   The coupe craze extends throughout the auto world. Reading
Automobile magazine's 1999 Buying and Leasing guide, I counted 59
coupes ranging in price from $9,000 to $319,900. Both in looks and
convenience, one of the best buys is the Saturn SC with a third
door. Yes, hidden near the driver's side door is a hinged third
door, just like those on extended cab trucks. You'd never know it's
there until you need it. Then you'll love it.
</P>
<P>
   For $9,000, you can get the Chevrolet Metro and have the EPA's
overall winner in the fuel economy listings. If you wish to spend
$319,900, you could buy the Bentley Continenta. It isn't much on
mileage, but if you've got this much money to spend, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   The Honda Accord is another distinct coupe. Like the Volvo and
Camry coupes, the Accord has its own sheet metal package, setting
it apart from the four-door sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Among other new '99 models to check out are the Oldsmobile
Alero, Pontiac Grand Am, the Plymouth/Dodge Neon, Ford Mustang,
Daewoo Lanos, and from Volkswagen, the new Golf or the very catchy
Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Joining in the coupe craze is Audi, which this spring will bring
out a striking-looking TT coupe with a 180-horsepower turbocharged
1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine. You'd never know it shares a
platform with the VW Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   So are two doors enough? Unquestionably, especially in two-car
families where the second vehicle is a people-mover.

   (itals)I arrive at Pochentong Airport in Phnom Penh amid a
fusillade of two dozen 107mm rockets, a welcome delivered by the
Khmer Rouge. In a few weeks they will control all of Cambodia. For
now, they are just making their presence felt. I join other war
correspondents on the scene. It is March 4, 1975.(unitals)

<P>
   PHNOM PENH _ I'm back at Pochentong, a middle-aged man
revisiting a part of the world that figured prominently in my life
and my country's. I am trying to make sense of it all through the
lens of the quarter-century that has passed since my last visit. It
is Jan. 19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The day I arrived all those years ago, I got up off the cool
tiled floor of the airport when the rockets ceased, hastily signed
up a driver/interpreter. We turn right out of the airport, headed
for town.
</P>
<P>
   Today, I am accompanied by Indira Lakshmanan, who holds the post
I once held as the Globe's Asia bureau chief. We are met by Bernie
Krisher, a retired American journalist-turned-philanthropist who
offered to show us around. This time we turn left out of
Pochentong, headed for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In five minutes we are at the Future Light Orphanage, which
Krisher supports with both his own money and money he raises from
Japan, the states, and elsewhere. It's a few simple but clean
buildings in the middle of pretty country. The sun is just setting
as we are ushered into the orphanage's rare treasure: an
air-conditioned computer lab.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by generators (there are no power lines this far from
town), the unit was built with help from several private sources,
including the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge. The Lab's founder and
director, Nicholas Negroponte, visited a few days ago for the
dedication. On 33 computers of varied vintage, the children learn
the future. Most know how to get onto the Internet. (E-mails will
be waiting when I return to Boston.)

   (itals)March 1975: In a small orphanage operated by Canadians, I
write about a premature baby girl found in a gutter of Phnom Penh
shortly before dawn a few weeks earlier. In an incredible
coincidence, she is adopted by a Cambridge couple, Rikk and Pam
Larsen. By the time I learn this in the early '80s, Siri Larsen is
already a talented gymnast. She goes on to star at Michigan State
University. Siri was a very fortunate child, rescued weeks before
the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh.(unitals)

<P>
   Today, children at Future Light are similarly blessed. There is
still much poverty and political uncertainty in Cambodia, but
clearly there are signs of a better world.

</P>
<P>
   (itals)March 12, 1975: St. Joseph's Hospital has been in
business less than two weeks. I file a story reporting that seven
children have already died there from malnutrition. A Filipino
doctor tells me, ``What we really have to do is to change their
standard of living. To do that, of course, we have to end the
war.''(unitals)

   Jan. 20, 1999: Today we visit the Sihanouk Hospital Center of
HOPE, where two doctors from the Boston area, Graham Gumley
(Carlisle) and Cameron Gifford (Wellesley), are training Cambodian
doctors and nurses and giving the locals the best medical care they
perhaps have ever had. But the rising incidence of the HIV virus is
alarming, and cholera is another problem.

<P>
   (itals)In the Boston Sunday Globe, I report that this ``city is
considered virtually indefensible against two North Vietnamese
divisions, plus reinforcements, poised to attack, reliable
intelligence sources said last night.'' The dateline is Saigon, the
date April 6, 1975.(unitals)

   Jan. 22, 1999
</P>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY _ I wrote a few things back then that were
wrong about Vietnam, but that Page One story was dead on. One of my
sources (it's probably OK now to say he was a US intelligence
officer) had told me, ``The NVA (North Vietnamese Army) right now
are maneuvering for a major assault on Saigon and if they don't
come straight to the Continental Palace (a downtown hotel where the
interview was taking place), it's only because they don't want
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, the North Vietnamese marched right into
Saigon. I had been out of the country for seven days, under orders
from Globe publisher Davis Taylor, who was worried about my health.
Neither of us realized that premature departure would haunt me
professionally for years. A reporter wants to stick with a story to
the end, and I sometimes regret I did not _ especially since the
end came, as it turned out, just seven days after I departed, and
all those correspondents still on the scene managed to get out
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Today I walk through the lobby of the refurbished Continental
Palace, lamenting only the disappearance of the open-air veranda
where reporters, soldiers, spies, and bar girls shortened their
hours back then.
</P>
<P>
   Indira and I go the next day to visit the Museum of the Ho Chi
Minh Campaign. Inside the gate, in the blazing sun, sits what
appears to be an American jet fighter, an F-5E. There's a legend in
Vietnamese and English.
</P>
<P>
   The words leap out at me. I tell Indira, ``I saw this plane
fly!'' On the morning of April 8, 1975, Lieutenant Nguyen Thanh
Trung, a defector from the South Vietnamese Air Force, disregarded
his flight plan and set off for Saigon. He flew low over the city
on two runs, dropping a total of four bombs and slightly damaging
his target, the presidential palace. He then flew to the safety of
North Vietnamese territory. I was among the reporters who saw it
all from a nearby restaurant. I can still see the plane, flying
slowly, it seemed, against an unusually clear sky for Vietnam, and
dropping its final two bombs. Rarely is one confronted with a
museum piece one saw in its functioning phase. It does not make one
feel young.
</P>
<P>
   At last report, Nguyen Thanh Trung is working as a pilot for
Vietnam Airlines. For all I know he could have piloted my flight
from Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s, my colleagues and I used to speculate about
how Saigon might change under what seemed to us the inevitable
victors from the north. Nearly 28 years later, I am seeing it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Phnom Penh _ which except for the addition of two or
three first-class hotels and restaurants looks virtually the same _
Saigon is transformed. It's brightly lit skyline includes perhaps a
dozen mini-skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this city (not often called by its new name) beggars
still crowd the sidewalks, and haphazard hordes of Honda motorbikes
dominate the streets. (Note to aging warhands: The bikes are
infinitely quieter than they were back then.)
</P>
<P>
   A Vietnamese journalist tells us the Hanoi government still puts
too many restrictions on the economy but is learning slowly to open
up some areas. Collective farms are giving way to private
ownership, mirroring the American ``Land to the Tiller'' program
that legendary American adviser John Paul Vann pitched to me in my
first reporting trip as one of the best roads to possible victory
over the communists.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (itals)We have been out on night patrol in Thang Binh, just
below the demilitarized zone that separates North and South
Vietnam. Colonel Nguyen Minh Dang, 38, is now holding court over
tea. ``We are happy to receive the help of the Americans,'' he
tells me and Peter Jay of The Washington Post. ``But I like my
people to be proud. The Americans came six years ago. Now you must
move out.'' It is April 1971.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last Americans of the war era left four years later, their
departure captured in a famous photograph of an evacuation
helicopter rising from the roof of the US Embassy. That building no
longer exists. In its place, a modern new consulate, representing
``The United State of America'' is being built.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Brinks'' _ the high-rise Bachelor Officers' Quarters from
which I watched the early morning attack by Lieutenant Trung _ is
being renovated. According to a sign on the construction perimeter,
this concrete remnant of the American war machine will soon be a
Park Hyatt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   An item in the Vietnam News notes that the United States is the
leading importer of the much-admired Vietnamese coffee bean. A
letter to the same newspaper from a businessman, perhaps a
foreigner, asks, ``Why do people all over the world buy Adidas, La
Coste, and Nike products? Because it is a status symbol. Why should
Vietnam be different?''
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, of course, Vietnam is different: 58,151 of our
fellow citizens died here. After nearly a quarter-century, it would
perhaps seem that something about that period would either make
more sense, or yield to greater understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders then of American foreign policy might argue now that
forcing yet another stand against communism was a part, albeit a
sad part, of a long march toward 1989, the crumbling of the Berlin
Wall, andthe dissolution of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell you that today's Vietnam, so peaceful and prosperous
compared with 1975, seems nothing so much as isolated from those
major currents of a larger world. So far from Berlin, Moscow, and
from that dark, glossed wall in Washington with its thousands of
names.

PRESIDENTS' LEGACIES ON RACE GET A FRESH LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abraham Lincoln said he didn't believe that blacks should vote,
marry whites, sit on a jury, or hold office. Still, with the stroke
of a pen, he freed millions of slaves when he signed the
Emancipation Proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has spoken eloquently on matters of race. He has
frequently talked of ``One America.'' But critics complain that he
has done little to create the policies to translate his words into
action.
</P>
<P>
   From George Washington, who struggled with the issue of slavery,
to the varied race-relations records of recent leaders, presidents
always have had to perform a balancing act between political
reality and their personal views on the role of African-Americans
in society.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say it's appropriate that Presidents' Day should fall
in the middle of Black History Month, since issues of race _ from
slavery to affirmative action _ have dogged the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But as a new generation of high school and college students
explores the contradictions between the public statements and
private acts of their leaders, teachers and historians are seeking
ways to tell the full story of the relationship between
African-Americans and US leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the presidents did everything right. . . . It was
a red, white, and blue kind of history,'' said Walter Lambert,
chairman of the history department at Boston Latin School. ``Now we
need to tell the truth, but also put it in context.''
</P>
<P>
   How important is it that Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the Civil
Rights Bill of 1964 into law, used racial epithets when cozying up
with Southern politicians? Does it matter, according to some
historians, that Richard Nixon expanded affirmative action not to
help minorities but to stir white resentment and a backlash?
</P>
<P>
   Of all the presidents, historians say, only Johnson and Lincoln
stand out for what they did to improve the lives of
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have their baggage, but even with their baggage, it's
hard to criticize them,'' said Kenneth O'Reilly, author of
``Nixon's Piano,'' which examines presidents' views and actions on
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond those two, it's a stretch (to rank others),'' O'Reilly
said. ``Maybe Truman. . . . He did desegregate the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that if contemporary standards were applied to past
presidents, most would fail to measure up. It is more important to
look at what they ultimately accomplished rather than focus on
their personal views, in the opinion of Wendall Bourne, a content
specialist for the Massachusetts Department of Education and a
seventh-grade teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Lincoln's views, Bourne said, the 16th president
nonetheless changed the course of history and the direction of race
relations. ``I tell the students that you probably wouldn't be
looking at me (a black man) if history had been different.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gibbons, of Harvard University's Graduate School of
Education, says a close study reveals that most presidents are
reluctant to push civil rights issues at election time for fear of
losing white votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frederick Douglass was very angry with Lincoln for not ending
slavery fast or quick enough, but when Lincoln signed the
Emancipation Proclamation, he became a hero in his eyes,'' Gibbons
said. That is significant, scholars say, because of Douglass's
clout among African-Americans and other abolitionists of the time.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy was criticized for taking too long to act on
civil rights. ``He was more concerned with keeping the white
vote,'' Lambert said. ``You won't see Kennedy at the rally in
Washington in 1963 or the (other) Kennedy brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   But some historians give Kennedy credit for initiating the
sweeping civil rights bill that Johnson later signed into law. It
was Kennedy who sent the National Guard to the University of
Alabama in June 1963 when the all-white school had to be forced to
admit two black students.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons, who travels around the country talking to students
about the tarnishing of heroes, said youngsters often bring up
Thomas Jefferson's record on race. ``It's a tough one,'' he
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, maintained
that the worst thing a slave owner could do is exploit a female
slave, Gibbons said. Yet advances in science, such as DNA testing,
and dogged detective work have shown that Jefferson apparently did
just that.
</P>
<P>
   Most students today have a hard time dealing with the fact that
Jefferson owned slaves and fathered a child by his slave mistress
Sally Hemings, Gibbons explained.
</P>
<P>
   Even Washington, a slave owner who did not free his slaves until
his death, ranks higher than Jefferson in the eyes of most young
people.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 to 15 years, according to Lambert, textbooks
largely have been rewritten to include a more diverse portrait of
the past. And teachers are beginning to ask questions to make
students think more critically about the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because Jefferson was a hypocrite, does that mean we
should discount him?'' he asked. ``Kids come out with mixed views,
and in some cases, that leads to cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the 20th century presidents, only Johnson's record on
race passes the test, in Lambert's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we have had a lot of conversations (on race),'' he said
in reference to Clinton's national race initiative, ``but I can't
think of any real acts or decisions by a recent American
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians like O'Reilly say Clinton and his dialogues on race
place him on the same level with Kennedy _ among the better
preidents, but not at the top.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Clinton distanced himself from the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, criticized rapper Sistah Souljah, and was accused of
abandoning law professor Lani Guinier after her nomination to head
the Justice Department's civil rights division was challenged _
acts seen as traitorous by many blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Reilly said, Clinton's dialogue on race is admirable
and proves that he believes race relations still is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is a smart fellow,'' he said. ``He looked at how race
(relations) deteriorated during the Reagan and Bush
administrations.'' And Clinton, mindful of his legacy _ however
tarnished it may now be _ was determined that the same would not be
said of him.

 &HT;    Postwar surge shifts racial tide

   DAYTON, Ohio _ The postwar years brought an unprecedented rush
of prosperity to America. Returning veterans flooded colleges,
corporations and factories, their brainpower and labor transforming
the nation into the world's premier economic superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of the country's blacks were denied a fair piece of
this bountiful pie. Many were no longer willing to accept that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregated public
schools violated the Constitution. A year later, housekeeper Rosa
Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus, sparking a boycott that
kick-started the modern civil rights movement and vaulted Martin
Luther King Jr. to prominence.
</P>
<P>
   There was much to overcome. In Dayton, nearly all blacks lived
south of Wolf Creek, their efforts to settle in other areas
thwarted by nervous bankers and real estate agents. But people like
Ned Wood gradually did move, only to watch whites stream to the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Racial brutality accelerated in the South as many whites sensed
power shifting. Yvonne Walker-Taylor, whose life in Wilberforce was
largely discrimination-free, experienced this cruelty when she
spent two summers teaching in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Still, progress was made. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
Voting Rights Act of 1965. These inspired thousands of blacks to
cast ballots for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Many attitudes seemed to change as well. Ellen Lee Jackson moved
from Dayton to Tennessee and found her new white neighbors
congenial. George Cooper became Dayton's first black city
government department head.
</P>
<P>
   The advances didn't mean the end of violence. A series of urban
riots erupted across the country, including one in Dayton in 1966
that doomed much of a West Dayton commercial district to
abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   But the convulsions had done their work. As the 1960s ended,
equality was the law, and America was a new nation.

   TAKE-BOS  
 SALT LAKE CITY: ... reports found.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson soon found there was a growing queue of
outstanding individuals with hungry hearts and open hands. IOC vice
president Kim Un Yong of South Korea had a son who had been laid
off in New York and needed a job to keep his green card. The
bidders hooked him up with a Salt Lake telecommunications company
and subsidized nearly $100,000 in wages.
</P>
<P>
   Kim had a daughter who was an aspiring pianist. The bidders
landed her a solo with the Utah Symphony and a $5,000 fee. Kim knew
a Russian woman who needed a scholarship to Utah. The bidders set
it up and paid $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing, it seemed, that Salt Lake wouldn't do to make
its Olympic friends part of the family. Sonia Essomba, daughter of
now-deceased IOC member Rene Essomba of Cameroon, got more than
$100,000 for tuition at American University, as well as living
expenses. When she changed apartments, finance director Rod Hamson
and Welch's secretary flew to Washington to help her move.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Rignault Arroyo, daughter of IOC member Agustin Arroyo of
Ecuador, was divorced and distressed in Texas. Welch got her a job
painting murals at the Utah Fair Grounds, put her up in the Santa
Fe Apartments, and paid the $23,000 tab.
</P>
<P>
   Bjarne Haeggman, husband of IOC member Pirjo Haeggman of
Finland, wanted a forestry job. Welch and Johnson got him a phantom
$34,000 consultancy with an Ogden engineering firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the bid committee's favorite family, by far, was the Gangas
from the Republic of Congo, who visited Salt Lake more than half a
dozen times. They flew first class from Brazzaville and stayed in
the best hotels. They got free medical care: IOC member Jean-Claude
Ganga was treated for hepatitis, his wife had cosmetic surgery, and
his mother-in-law had a knee replaced.
</P>
<P>
   And they shopped until their hosts' credit cards were maxed out.
Ganga's wife was a Wal-Mart whirlwind, stocking up on carpets and
draperies; a committee employee helped her plan the decor for a new
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The bidders had decided that the biggest reason Salt Lake had
lost to Nagano (other than the saltwater taffy/Honda differential),
was that too few IOC members had sampled the legendary Utah
hospitality, had seen the gorgeous Mormon temple, or skied down the
white-capped Wasatch mountains.
</P>
<P>
   So the bidders brought members from around the planet to their
capital and treated them like royalty. Their guests sat in
front-row seats at Utah Jazz basketball games and were introduced
at halftime. They ate gourmet dinners at local restaurants, went to
the symphony, skied at Snowbasin, went white-water rafting. Arroyo
and his family spent two weeks in a Park City ski condo at a cost
of $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   If local attractions proved insufficient, the IOC members were
jetted off to Las Vegas, to Disneyland, to New York City, to
Yellowstone Park, to Niagara Falls, or to Florida for the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Lords and their families got tokens and keepsakes by the
armful _ coffee-table books, ski parkas, watches, spurs, crystal
globes, porcelain bells, neckties, and scarves. Samaranch received
a limited-edition Browning pistol worth $9,000. IOC member Jan
Staubo from Norway got a replica of the Spitfire he flew in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, HealthRider exercise machines, perfumes, purebred
dogs, golf clubs, English lessons, skiing gear, kitchen appliances,
violins, bathroom fixtures, video games, decorative doorknobs _
there was always a smiling bidder with a credit card or an in-kind
account to charge it to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was to extol the virtues of Salt Lake City,'' the
ethics report concluded, ``and use the power of persuasion with
these newly made friends.''
</P>
<P>
   When 1995 and the IOC vote grew nearer, and ``giftage'' and
scholarships weren't enough, persuasion evolved into straight cash
by check or wire transfer. In some cases, the IOC members openly
asked for money.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, Charles Mukora of
Kenya, who had already received $5,200 from Welch, sent him a
plaintive letter begging for more assistance. ``I am considering
leaving Kenya, at least, for a period of time as I am so depressed
that I may develop ulcers or more serious ailments as I personally
feel I cannot cope,'' Mukora wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is a great testing field where even the strongest must
walk through their own Garden of Gethsemene (sic),'' Welch replied.
``. . . I am greatly disappointed that others have not responded to
your need, and look forward to being with you in Lillehammer when
we can discuss this matter first hand.'' Welch ended up paying
Mukora another $29,000.
</P>
<P>
   IOC member Zein El Abdin Mohamed Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan had
already received $17,000 in ``tuition payments'' for his son. Now,
he wanted $1,000 a month for his fictitious daughter Zema. Johnson
eventually wired Gadir $7,000. Essomba, whose daughter was still
living in Washington on Salt Lake cash, got $60,000 for himself.
IOC member Sergio Santander-Fantini of Chile got $20,000 for his
political campaign. Ganga got $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bidders had also hired lobbyists and middlemen who claimed
they could influence voters. Mahmoud El Farnawani, a Toronto
businessman with connections in northern Africa, received nearly
$150,000. Muttaleb Ahmad, who directed the Olympic Council of Asia,
got $62,000. Alfredo LaMont, the US Olympic Committee's director of
international relations, received $18,000, much of which was passed
on to IOC member Austin Sealy of Barbados, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Though Welch said every trustee up to Governor Mike Leavitt of
Utah was aware of the payoffs, they all denied it. They had gone to
the meetings or sent permanent alternates, glanced at the line
items on a bare-bones summary budget, and saw nothing amiss, even
though the budget nearly doubled between 1994 and 1995 with the
``slush fund'' soaring sevenfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Board members, especially executive committee members, have a
duty to oversee the activities of management,'' the ethics panel
scolded. ``This is especially true where, as here, the trustees
believed that the CEO was undisciplined in his expenditure of
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet every year through 1995, the accountants from Ernst &AMP; Young
gave them a clean audit, overlooking mysterious five-figure
payouts. Welch had told them that the executive committee had
approved undocumented payouts to IOC members, and the accountants
took him at his word.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 1995 vote, the Utahans took $30,000 in cash
and traveler's checks to Budapest, where the final decision was
being made, for expenses and last-minute influencing. Salt Lake
breezed on the first ballot, 54-14, one of the most lopsided votes
in Olympic history. The outcome was never in doubt, IOC officials
said then and now. ``Salt Lake won on the merits,'' insisted vice
president Richard Pound of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until last December that the price of winning hearts
and votes was revealed. Somebody from the organizing committee
leaked a copy of a 1996 letter from Welch to Sonia Essomba, telling
her that the committee could no longer pay her tuition. Marc
Hodler, the Swiss lawyer who has been an IOC member for 36 years,
shrugged and said that Salt Lake hadn't done anything other cities
hadn't been doing for years. If anything, he said, the Utahans were
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what happened here wasn't right,'' Leavitt said last
week. The payoffs had been ``disgusting and disguised,'' said
Garff, the board chairman. What the bidders had done was clearly
unethical, the ethics panel declared, but it wasn't criminal.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence of bribery. In the 50,000 pages of
documents that the panel thumbed through, Jordan said, nobody
offered or asked for anything in exchange for a vote. ``The flavor
of the interactions was much more along the lines of currying
favor,'' said Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   What Salt Lake did, the ethics panel concluded, was about
treating foreigners like family. For bribery, you needed a quid and
a quo. As much as the bidders spent, they never knew what they got
in return. The IOC's balloting, as always, was secret.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The Utahans doused their fact-crammed ``bid
books'' with pine scent and slipped them into leather saddlebags
for a distinctive Western touch.
</P>
<P>
   They packed up jars of local honey, white Stetson cowboy hats,
logo-emblazoned duds, souvenir pins, disposable cameras, and boxes
of home-style mementos and brought them to England in the spring of
1991, where the Lords of the Rings were awarding the 1998 Winter
Olympics. But when they arrived in Birmingham, the Salt Lake
bidders realized that they were putting a rummage table up against
Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Their Japanese rivals were feeding sushi and champagne to the
International Olympic Committee members and giving them jewelry,
luggage, laptop computers, and video recorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were giving out saltwater taffy,'' a Utah bid official
mused after underdog Nagano had edged Salt Lake by four votes out
of 88 cast. ``And they were giving out Hondas.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that Salt Lake had the best technical bid _
superb venues, a modern airport, huge hotels, superhighways,
state-of-the-art telecommunications, and the ``greatest snow on
earth.'' The Utahans had been playing the wrong game.
</P>
<P>
   Landing the Olympics wasn't about luge runs and cloverleafs, bid
chief Tom Welch and his team told the trustees and local
businessmen when they returned home. It was about ``winning
hearts,'' about getting to know the Lords and their wives and
children and making them feel part of your family _ and ultimately,
about winning their votes.
</P>
<P>
   So Welch drew up a mission statement for 2002 with one goal: to
``establish and maintain long-term, vote-influencing relationships
with IOC members.'' What resulted was a bid that went haywire and
created the worst scandal in modern Olympic history. Salt Lake's
corrupt quest for the Winter Games was a seven-year cornucopia of
cash handouts, tuition payments, free medical care, jobs, lavish
trips, shopping sprees, and gifts ranging from shotguns to golden
retrievers.
</P>
<P>
   A 300-page report issued last week by the organizing committee's
ethics panel and interviews with Olympic insiders paint a sordid
portrait of two ``relentless'' men (Welch and Dave Johnson) who
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in secret, of trustees who
asked few questions, of independent accountants who gave clean
audits without demanding details, and of greedy IOC members who
broke their oaths and succumbed to temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is plenty of blame to go around,'' said ethics panelist
David Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of the IOC voters have since been implicated. Nine
have either resigned or been forced out, and more than a dozen
others still risk expulsion. The US Department of Justice, US
Olympic Committee, and Utah attorney general are all probing the
Salt Lake Organizing Committee. The committee's top two officials,
Frank Joklik and Johnson, have resigned, and Welch, who stepped
down in 1997 amid charges of spousal abuse, lost his pension and
$10,000-a-month consultancy. The board of trustees and executive
committee have been reshuffled.
</P>
<P>
   And Salt Lake City, which prides itself on hospitality and
rectitude, has been profoundly embarrassed before the world. All
was to guarantee an Olympics that IOC insiders say was never in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake easily won on the first ballot, collecting nearly
twice as many votes as the three other bidders (Sion, Switzerland;
Ostersund, Sweden; and Quebec City) combined. It didn't need any of
the IOC members that it paid to influence. ``We won the vote fair
and square,'' board chairman Robert Garff said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did Salt Lake try to rig a game it had already won?
Because after five failed bids, it was determined to win the Games
at any cost. Because after losing to Nagano despite having the best
package, it concluded that merit meant little. And because it
believed that the IOC's unwritten rule was that you won hearts by
filling hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told that was the way business was done,'' said
Jordan, referring to explanations by the Salt Lake bidders. ``And
they were not in a position to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the Utahans just didn't get it, said IOC
marketing director Michael Payne. They should never have bid for
1998, not when Atlanta had already won the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Salt Lake, `There's not a chance in the world you'll
get them,' '' recalled Payne. ``We can't go back to America two
years later. That's the simple geopolitical reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States had already hosted the 1980 Winter and 1984
Summer Games, and the IOC was sensitive to criticism that Uncle Sam
was turning the Olympics into its own backyard block party.
</P>
<P>
   Asia hadn't had the Winter Games since 1972; it clearly was
Japan's turn. If the IOC members hadn't sensed that, one of IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch's top aides told them the night
before the vote that Samaranch favored Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City would have its turn in 2002, the IOC hinted, but
the Utahans set out to win hearts anyway, targeting voters in
developing nations just as Atlanta had. The Africans and Latin
Americans had no stake in where the Winter Games were held, and
conversations with middlemen offering blocs of votes in Birmingham
had convinced Welch that they were eager _ even asking _ to be
influenced.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1991, with the 2002 vote still nearly four years
away, the wife of IOC member Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa wired
Welch asking for a $30,000 loan to help a friend in a ``serious
situation.'' Welch raided his daughter's trust funds, meant for
tuition at Wellesley College and the University of Utah, and sent
the cash.
</P>
<P>
   IOC member David Sibandze of Swaziland wanted his son Sibo to
attend Utah. The bidders helped get him admitted, wangled him a
visa, and spent more than $100,000 in committee funds to pay for
his education.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a ``scholarship program'' purportedly allowing
Olympic committees from developing countries to send ``outstanding
individuals'' to Utah colleges at bid committee expense. It turned
into a slush fund that the ethics report said Welch and Johnson
tapped liberally for payoffs to IOC members and their children _
with no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Though the executive committee knew about the program and was
supposed to approve the recipients, it never asked where the money
was going, the report concluded. That became the Salt Lake pattern.
The board's job was to raise cash. Welch's and Johnson's jobs were
to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The executive committee paid less attention to specific
expenditures so long as the overall budget balanced,'' the ethics
report found.

THE CONSTITUTION STILL STANDS TALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that the impeachment process is finally over,
it doesn't hurt to recall that there have been four genuine
impeachment imbroglios in the history of the American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Three of them have been real dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest is merely the ugliest and least reputable. Off the
stats alone, the temptation would be to declare the constitutional
provision for impeachment flawed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it stands tall, still an awesome power, but on the
shelf for only the gravest of contingencies. In this revival season
for the English language's greatest Bard, the fault is not in the
provision but in ourselves, a truth the framers acknowledged by
inserting the Everest-sized requirement that a two-thirds vote in
the Senate is required for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Our experience with it, at a minimum, teaches that we have yet
to make the same mistake twice.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, just the majority vote required to proceed in
the House of Representatives was enough to stop impeachment
proceedings against John Tyler in 1843. The two-thirds provision
was, of course, central to Andrew Johnson's survival 25 years
later, and it played at least an ancillary role in the case against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When it worked, magnificently, during Watergate, the two-thirds
mandate was correctly interpreted even in the House Judiciary
Committee to require the meticulous assembly of hard and direct
evidence of felonies that were also ``high crimes'' that could
command support beyond the Democratic Party. Richard Nixon was
toast even before the ``smoking gun'' tape recording produced his
unique resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton case was clearly a regression in an age of lowered
standards, but the decisive character of its rejection blunts its
force as precedent.
</P>
<P>
   So do its origins. It is enough to note that the actions of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr in getting jurisdiction over the
Monica Lewinsky mess are themselves the subject of official
inquiry. But it is more important to note that this is the first _
and, one trusts, the last _ impeachment case based solely on work
done outside Congress. In every other one, Congress did its own
work to make its own case.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton case, however, the House first played politics
with Starr's referral by dumping it unexamined into the public
domain, and then carelessly re-writing it into an impeachment case.
Even Representative Henry Hyde now acknowledges that the failure to
check the facts and fill the holes in an admitted rush to judgment
was a fatal flaw that a longer trial in the Senate would only have
demonstrated more conclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Now that nearly all the statements made during the closed-door
speeches last week in the Senate have been made public, it is clear
that more than 33 Democrats and at least one Republican (Rhode
Island's John Chafee) voted to acquit solely on the facts of the
case. What took the number to 50 senators were additional opinions
that the offenses alleged were not worthy of the capital punishment
of removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   This rejection was unique. In no other impeachment trial has a
case failed to attract even a bare majority of the Senate to any of
its elements.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton case, the lesson is as old as the Constitution's
specific design to guard against impeachments pushed by one
political faction. And it may be as modern as an implicit rejection
of personal misbehavior (in this situation, arising out of alleged
misbehavior in another case that preceded his presidency) as proper
grounds for impeachment. The problem was not with the Democrats who
saw it one way and the Republicans who saw it another, for
partisanship is a natural crutch in relatively close decisions; the
problem was with the case itself.
</P>
<P>
   The House's decision not to proceed against Tyler showed that a
failed presidency and massive unpopularity would not become grounds
to alter election, or in Tyler's case, succession results after
William Henry Harrison's death made him president. Johnson's
survival meant that impeachment would not be used to change
national policy, in this case post-Civil War Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nixon precedent stands, leaving impeachment precisely
where it was intended to be, as protection against presidents who
directly threaten constitutional government by corruptly using
their official powers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton case was a dog recognized correctly by the public
from the beginning. That the Senate rescued the country from Ken
Starr's overzealousness and the House's irresponsibility may be
small consolation; but it is real consolation.

DESPITE OLYMPIC SCANDAL, US CITIES CARRY TORCH FOR 2012

<TEXT>
<P>
   Each city has a fancy logo, a multimillion-dollar budget, and
more endorsements from Olympic medalists than a mountain of
Wheaties boxes. Most of all, each has a dream.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, they all have the same dream.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cascading revelations of corruption within the Olympic
movement, a record eight US cities are vying to host the 2012
Summer Games _ the next potential chance to stage the Olympics on
US soil after the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer number of US cities bidding for the 2012 Olympics is,
by itself, a tribute to the enduring lure of top-flight athletes,
five-ringed flags, two weeks of the world's undivided attention,
and billions and billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of all eight bid efforts, contacted last week, said they
were thoroughly unruffled by the still-unfolding scandal involving
allegations that IOC members took payoffs and gifts from Olympic
host cities, including Salt Lake City and Sydney. All expressed
nothing but the upbeat optimism and blithe enthusiasm expected of
Olympic hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scandal has actually helped us,'' said Nick Vehr,
president of Cincinnati 2012 and, fittingly, a public relations
executive. ``It has convinced everybody that the playing field is
going to be level in the future. That other game that occurred off
the field won't be going on. We view that as a silver lining in
what is a very dark cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Loder, bid coordinator of the San Francisco-based Bay Area
Sports Organizing Committee, said: ``The Olympics is a dream, an
ideal, and neither this scandal nor any other that I could imagine
is going to tarnish the beauty of the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cincinnati and San Francisco, the 2012 bidders
are Dallas, Houston, a combined Baltimore-Washington effort, New
York, Los Angeles, and a Florida proposal that includes Tampa and
Orlando. Each has paid $100,000 to $150,000 to secure its place as
a bidder, and each has won required support from local government
officials to pursue the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Three other cities, Boston, Chicago, and Seattle, had been
expected to bid, but all dropped out before a Dec. 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Olympic Committee will choose one of the
cities as the US candidate for 2012 based on comprehensive final
bids due in March 2000. The USOC winnowing process will occur in
late 2002, and the US choice will then go before the International
Olympic Committee. The IOC is scheduled to choose the 2012 host
city in the fall of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the US bidders are focused on the domestic
competition _ stressing to anyone who will listen their cities'
natural beauty, easy access, modern facilities, love of tourists,
and can-do spirit. At the same time, all are downplaying potential
problems such as 100-degree summer days, drenching humidity,
traffic gridlock, and acts of God large and small, from mosquitoes
to tornadoes to earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the ideal choice. Florida is differently positioned than
any other place on the planet,'' said Ed Turanchik, president of
the Florida 2012 bid effort. ``Atlanta was traumatized by the
crowds. We handle those crowds every year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is the only international capital that has never
hosted the Olympics,'' countered Dan Doctoroff, head of NYC-2012.
``There were 197 nations at the Atlanta Games. Every single one of
them could have found a neighborhood in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is a natural,'' offered Susan Bandy, executive
director of the Houston 2012 Foundation. ``We're a well-known
international city with great amenities, wonderful airports, plenty
of hotel rooms, and probably the best corps of volunteers in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, all eight bidders eagerly boast about the
luminaries who have loaned their names and reputations.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area group is heavy on skaters, including Peggy Fleming,
Kristi Yamaguchi, and Brian Boitano, with former secretary of state
George Shultz thrown in for good measure. Houston trumps Shultz
with former President George Bush, plus Olympic stars Carl Lewis
and Mary Lou Retton, whose father-in-law is an executive with the
bid team.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas weighs in with Ross Perot Jr., Cowboys owner Jerry Jones,
and sprinter Michael Johnson. DC-Baltimore has the longtime
television host of the Olympics, Jim McKay, as well as Oriole Cal
Ripken. Cincinnati has astronaut legend Neil Armstrong and
basketball great Oscar Robertson, a 1964 Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has decathlon hero Rafer Johnson and swimming star
Janet Evans, as well as Olympic impresario Peter Ueberroth, who led
the city's organizing committee for the 1984 Summer Games. Florida
has Olympic softball star Dot Richardson and soccer phenom Michelle
Akers. New York, which had hoped to bid for the 2008 Olympics until
the USOC decided there would be no US bidder for those Games, is
still rebuilding its all-star list.
</P>
<P>
   Though each bid group says its venues, supporters, and plans are
far and away the best, all try not to violate the first rule of
Olympic diplomacy: Never trash the competition.
</P>
<P>
   But with promises of anonymity, several bid organizers and close
Olympic observers were willing to handicap the field. There is a
vague consensus that Washington-Baltimore will offer a hard-to-beat
bid on the strength of location and already advanced organization,
and that either Dallas or Houston will be in the running until the
very end. San Franciso gets credit for the best scenery, and
Cincinnati is considered a potential spoiler that benefits from a
wholesome image. Florida is viewed as a mixed bag, with excellent
resources but doubts in some minds that the IOC would share the
world stage with Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles and New York are wild cards, having waged low-key
stealth campaigns, thus far. New York is still getting its plans
together and Los Angeles is banking on its reputation as a
successful past host.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the current tumult, the USOC is positively
buoyant about the number of bidders and the prospect that by the
time one is chosen, the scandal will be a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on now is a painful exercise for us. It is
excruciating,'' said USOC spokesman Mike Moran. ``It took 100 years
for us to build the brand, and in less than 100 days it has been
tarnished. We've got a job to build this back up. But the cities
still want it. The Games are the Games and the athletes are the
athletes. But the other stuff has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Each city expects to spend millions of dollars in the domestic
phase of the competition, with Los Angeles working with the
smallest budget and most others budgeting between $3 million and
$10 million. None has a firm idea how much it will cost 13 years
from now to actually host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the process, all the cities will have to conform to
rules the USOC enacted in November 1997, more than a year before
the scandal broke, that strictly limit contacts with USOC and IOC
members, set a $50 cap on gifts (rising to $150 in the final phase
of competition), and spell out detailed ethics and disclosure
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   At an October 1998 conference of bid cities, ``We gave a fanny
pack, a pin, and a water bottle, with a combined value of $7.63.
And I think we might have been the big spenders in the pack,'' said
Turanchik, head of the Florida 2012 effort.
</P>
<P>
   One unresolved question for all the bidders is a requirement
that arrangements be made _ either through local governments or
some other ``third party'' _ to pick up the cost of any budget
shortfalls if the 2012 Games run in the red. That requirement
helped to knock Seattle from the bidding, and at least some others
are expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Once a winner emerges from the US field, it will face the rest
of the world. Among the international cities expected to be in the
competition are the losers in the chase to host the 2008 Summer
Games, the winner of which will be chosen in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Early handicapping gives Beijing front-runner status for 2008,
with bids also expected from Toronto; Paris; Osaka, Japan; Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia; Buenos Aires; Istanbul; and Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The US bidders have to hope that Toronto doesn't pull away from
the crowd and win the 2008 Games; under Olympic protocol, the Games
are expected to rotate from continent to continent. If Toronto were
to win the 2008 Games, the US cities probably would have to keep
smiling and bidding at least until 2016.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK, I'm young enough to hang in there,'' said
Turanchik. ``Whenever it comes, it'd be worth the wait.''

SCANDAL'S EFFECT ON JOURNALISM IN DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Big stories always change media,'' says media critic Jon Katz.
``The death of Elvis created the tabloid culture. The Gulf War
legitimized cable as a medium.''
</P>
<P>
   So how has a mind-boggling year of sex, lies, and impeachment
altered the media landscape? Will it change the way journalists
pursue the confounding ``character issue?'' Has it permanently
damaged press credibility in the eyes of the public? Does it mark
the coronation of the instantaneous ``new media'' embodied by the
Internet and cable news networks?
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky affair may have triggered the
quickest orgy of media introspection in history. One week after the
story broke, journalists were guiltily assailing their pursuit of
the tawdry details on a CNN program tellingly called ``Media
Madness.'' Yet more than a year later, the story's impact on
journalism is as murky and as ambiguous as the lessons of the
scandal itself.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious conclusion is CNN analyst Jeff Greenfield's
assertion that ``even though (``Monica-gate'') led to an
extraordinary event, I don't think it blew anybody's mind in the
way that Watergate did.'' And not just because the president
survived. Watergate spawned a movie starring Robert Redford and
Dustin Hoffman as hero journalists and steered a generation of
starry-eyed students to journalism school.
</P>
<P>
   When University of Virginia government professor Larry Sabato
recently asked his class of 500 students how many of them planned
on entering journalism, not a single hand shot skyward. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The new media &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first big story since journalism had changed,''
says ABC's Cokie Roberts. ``We never had a story like this, with
three 24-hour channels and all the `dot coms.' None of us knew how
to operate in that world.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a scandal introduced on the Internet when cyber snoop
Matt Drudge pirated Newsweek's reporting and broke the Lewinsky
tale several days before the mainstream media. It was maintained at
a screeching decibel level by the unceasing
``all-Monica-all-the-time'' punditry on cable news stations like
MSNBC, Fox News Channel, CNBC, and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a sad moment for America, a fine moment for Fox
news'' acknowledges John Moody, Fox News Channel vice president for
news.
</P>
<P>
   The cable channels have come in for serious criticism for
trivializing the story and for grinding it to a pulp. But no one
expects them to fold their tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it ends, you've still got all of these networks with 168
hours a week to fill,'' says television and cultural critic Steven
Stark. ``They're on to the next tabloid crisis if they can find or
invent one.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoes Wall Street Journal executive editor Al Hunt: ``I can't
wait to hear (CNBC talkhost) Chris Matthews do a whole show on
Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the National Press Club last June, Drudge lauded the
virtues of cybernews as ``an era vibrating with the din of small
voices . . . a future where there'll be 300 million reporters,
where anyone from anywhere can report for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Internet's peformance left plenty to be desired.
Drudge hyped a bogus story about a supposed Clinton ``love child''
and The Wall Street Journal and Dallas Morning &UR;  &LR; News had to retract
erroneous stories hastily posted on their web sites. Still,
analysts think the ``disconnect'' between the public and mainstream
journalism over this scandal plays into Drudge's scenario,
hastening the fragmentation of news and the further decline of the
traditional gatekeeper press. Whether it be a talk radio host, a
web site, or cable TV pundit of choice, citizens will be more
likely to customize their news in an era of expanding outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is much less dependent on journalism,'' says Katz.
``They're reaching their own conclusions. We have this spectacle of
a very, very well informed citizenry that is reaching different
conclusions than Washington journalists.'' Adds Sabato:
``Everyone's going to have a different set of sites. Everyone's
going to believe in a different reality.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The character issue &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread agreement that the salacious
Clinton-Lewinsky affair marks a high _ or low _ point in the public
scrutiny of the ``character'' issue that has been on the front
burner since Gary Hart's adultery-plagued 1988 presidential
campaign. In the wake of the scandal, there's some feeling that
journalists may be less eager to sniff around the bedsheets for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel that we've come to the end of the road with this
stuff,'' says Newsweek's chief political correspondent, Howard
Fineman. ``Every reductio ad absurdum has been reached. We've
almost gone real time in the private lives of public people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, (journalists) are the idealists here. We believe
there are good and bad public servants,'' says U.S. News &AMP; World
report columnist and CBS analyst Gloria Borger. She believes there
may be more emphasis on the positive aspects of government as part
of a mini-backlash to the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato worries, however, that to compensate for the Monica
scandal ``the next wave could easily be a truly lowered standard, a
feel-good journalism where we basically go back to the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are dissenting votes. Hunt thinks the post-Monica
media will still be eager to ``define character in terms of sex and
I think it's going to be a travesty. We're going to cover
pseudo-character.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A press in disrepute: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even David Broder, the painfully well-mannered dean of
Washington political columnists, doesn't mince words when gauging
his profession's current standing. In all likelihood, ``we're in
the crapper,'' he says. The public is ``very angry at us for our
yearlong proccupation with this.'' Echoes Greenfield: ``It
certainly didn't make heroes out of journalists. As a general
statement, Washington does cover politics with its head up its own
intestinal tract.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the widespread belief that this story exposed a
yawning gulf between the media and the citizenry, there are some
hopeful signs. For one thing, polls indicate that as the scandal
dragged on, people were inclined to think more favorably of the
media's performance _ even as they fervently hoped for an end to
the story. In January 1998, only 36 percent of the respondents to a
Media Studies Center poll considered coverage of the Lewinsky story
``excellent'' or ``good.'' A year later, the number of satisfied
customers was nearing 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors that ``seemed to be so outrageous and out there at
the beginning, basically were confirmed,'' says Media Studies
Center research director Larry McGill. ``I think the media, in a
funny way, have escaped relatively unscathed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that may depend on whether journalism has absorbed
some of the lessons of the last 12 months. One lingering fear is
that the media have become so addicted to covering the likes of the
O.J. Simpson trial, the death of Princess Diana and the White House
scandal, that they will transform the frantic hunt for the next
mega-story into a full-preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether this story is a kind of crack cocaine
. . . and whether we find a way of telling other stories,'' says
Fineman. ``I don't think things will ever slow down again. . . . A
huge apparatus has been built to keep the pace up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about this business is there's always another
story,'' says Moody, who seems to be confirming Fineman's theory.
``We're not too far from a presidential cycle; we have an unsolved
murder in Colorado; we have an institution we thought was
incorruptible, the Olympic Committee. When does it end? It never
ends. That's why it's called news.''

CHANGING THE WORD, BUT NOT THE POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those unhappy Macbeths are hardly the ideal Valentine's Day
couple, but here they come, thanks to a recent query from Bob
Michel. He's bugged, he says, by the media's use of sticking point
to mean a point of contention: ``My recollection is that the phrase
comes from `Screw your courage to the sticking point,' '' he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   Almost right. When Shakespeare's Macbeth begins to waffle on
whether to murder Duncan, his tough-talking spouse tells him to
``screw your courage to the sticking-place'' _ not point _ ``and
we'll not fail.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, sticking point (no hyphen) is the one in the
dictionary and in everyday use. Like many a familiar quotation _
from gilding the lily to blood, sweat, and tears to play it again,
Sam _ it's been edited, as time goes by, to roll more trippingly
off the collective tongue. Sometimes, as in these examples, the
essential meaning stays the same.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, it's misconstrued: When Juliet asks ``Wherefore
art thou Romeo?'' she doesn't mean ``Where are you, Romeo?'' but
``Why do you have to be from that family?'' (English teachers seem
to be making no progress on this front: In newspaper citations,
misuses dominate by better than 3 to 1. Dave Barry punctuates it
correctly, putting William F. Buckley Jr., among others, to shame.
Whether Monica would have gotten it right we can't say; for her
1997 valentine message to the president, she chose a verse from a
bit later in the balcony scene.)
</P>
<P>
   In the case of sticking point, the appeal of the change from
sticking-place is easy to see. After all, the Macbeths are planning
to kill the king with daggers _ and sticking was a common synonym
for stabbing at the time. Sticking-place also meant the part of the
neck you sliced to slaughter an animal. It sure sounds as if Lady
Macbeth means to say, ``Pull up your socks, gird your loins, and
stick in the shiv, Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Oxford English Dictionary has a different take on
Shakespeare's sticking-place: ``The allusion seems to be to the
screwing-up of a peg of a musical instrument until it becomes
tightly fixed in its place,'' it says. (Not that this meaning
couldn't coexist happily with the more bloody connotations, of
course.)
</P>
<P>
   If that's the primary meaning, then today's sticking point is
not so different from Lady Macbeth's: Both mean the place at which
a process stops, fixed and immobilized. Her sticking-place meant
steely resolve, while our sticking points tend to be roadblocks in
negotiations, but the modern variation is no further from the
original image than Shakespeare's was. If we want to castigate
ourselves for sticking point, the grounds should be overuse, not
misquotation.

   Words for the wary
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our recent discussion of the flap over niggardly _ an innocent
word tainted by its taboo sound _ prompted some stories from
readers about other endangered words.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Quay said the whole thing reminded him of his attempt to get
his wife to read the Sherlock Holmes mysteries. ``She was quite
taken aback because Watson kept ejaculating every time Holmes
astounded him with some example of his ability, as in `My dear
Holmes!' Watson ejaculated.'' This ejaculation is, of course, a
sudden and forceful exclamation (the word comes from the Latin for
javelin); once upon a time, that's the only meaning we would have
encountered in everyday, nonscientific parlance.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine McGuire of Sudbury offered a similar story: She was in
charge of a plaque honoring a dean, and its wording referred to his
seminal textbook in his field. ``People actually asked me to remove
the plaque and change the word seminal, she recalled, ``even though
I explained that it meant `first' or `beginning.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Alpert of Newton spoke up in defense of niggardly,
arguing that ``a well-educated population would not have this
problem'' of confusing an inoffensive word with a racial slur.
That's true, of course, if a well-educated population means a
nation of people who know every word in the language. But in the
absence of that utopian state, less familiar words often change
their meanings in response to popular associations or
misunderstandings (see internecine, livid, and shambles, for
starters). When meanings are in flux, caution is advised; the goal,
after all, is not to have a fight but to make your point.

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WHILE I WAS GONE &QL; 
 &UR; Sue Miller (Knopf, $24)
</P>
<P>
   After a very slow start, Miller's fifth novel blossoms not only
into the story of a marriage and a family, but of an unsolved
murder that haunts the past of her main character and resurfaces in
a most unexpected way. Jo Becker is a veterinarian who lives with
her husband, a minister, in a small town in Massachusetts. They are
quietly happy _ their three daughters are grown and making their
own ways in the world, leaving Jo and Daniel to lavish time on
their jobs and on their enviable relationship with each other.
Then, one day, a new patient comes to Jo's practice, a dog whose
owner is a figure from Jo's shadowy past. Eli Mayhew was one of her
six housemates in Cambridge during the summer of 1968, when she was
on the run from her stifling first marriage and living under an
assumed name. For Jo, the house had been a place of liberation and
camaraderie until the terrible night when one of its residents _
Dana, Jo's closest friend _ was stabbed to death by an intruder who
was never caught. Now Eli, a prominent research scientist, has
moved to town with his wife, and Jo begins to feel the seductive
pull of the past. The suspense is potent as Miller hints that we
will discover, over the course of the novel, just what happened to
Dana and why, and yet the final third of the book is oddly
unsatisfying. This is partly because Jo inexplicably takes three
weeks to make a moral decision that should have taken three minutes
(and then weathers its consequences with baffling ease), and
because her husband and youngest daughter respond to her dilemma
with a self-interest that strains credulity. Indeed, the best
passages here are the quiet ones in which Miller displays her
remarkable ear and eye for the understated interplay among members
of a family _ among mother and daughters, among sisters, between
husband and wife. If the mystery brings us into the story, it is
these moments, deeply rendered, that keep us there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TRAVELING MERCIES &QL; 
 &UR; Anne Lamott (Pantheon, $23)
</P>
<P>
   Here we have an odd book, a sort of ``Bird by Bird'' of faith
and redemption. Those of you who have read ``Bird,'' Lamott's
treatise on the process of writing, and Operating Instructions,''
her memoir of her son's birth and first year, will recognize much
of the territory here, and many of the people. There's Sam, the
little boy who is the center of Lamott's life, and Pammy, her dear
friend who died of breast cancer, and a host of other friends,
relatives and acquaintances. If you've read her previous books you
also know that Lamott has had demons in her life, and she has come
to some sense of equilibrium with the arrival of Sam and with the
continuing, if somewhat incongruous, help of her faith. Here is how
she puts it, in the very first sentence of this book: ``My coming
to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers
from what seemed like one safe place to another.'' In that spirit,
this is more of a memoir, a collection of anecdotes, than a book on
religion (although faith is at its core, and in its subtitle). It
has the same disarming humor and meandering but dumbfoundingly
readable voice of her previous books of non-fiction. If you're a
fan, you'll probably like this one, too. If you're new to Lamott,
this isn't a bad place to start. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GETTING OVER JOHN DOE &QL; 
 &UR; Suzanne Yalof (Morrow, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   Morrow sent no less than six copies of this book, so we took a
look, and now we're here to save you from the same fate. Yalof is a
fashion editor at ``Glamour'' magazine. John Doe was a Wall Street
trader who wooed her, then inexplicably dumped her. This is her
story, of the wooing, dumping, post-breakup distress and eventual
emergence from an abyss of confusion and despair (this last step
involved eating beef jerky and not shaving her legs). Our attention
died on the first page. Here's a paragraph from the early stages of
the relationship, just so you know what we're dealing with: ``We
would sit up all night and talk about our families. His parents
insisted on good grades _ mine settled for a clean room. He won
Most Likely to Succeed in his high school yearbook _ I was Class
Clown. What did we have in common? Would you believe sushi?'' If
you insist on more, you go alone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BE COOL &QL; 
 &UR; Elmore Leonard (Delacorte, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Chili Palmer is back, and he's talking movies, which is good
because Leonard is the crown prince of dialogue and he (begin
itals) knows (end itals) movies. He used to be a lowly screenwriter
before his novels hit it big, and now he's impossibly rich because
his novels become movies, one right after the other. This sequel to
``Get Shorty'' opens with Chili meeting at a sidewalk cafe with a
record producer who tries to talk Chili into making a movie about
him. When Chili takes a trip to the men's room, the record producer
is gunned down by a wiry little man wearing a toupee. And even as
Chili stands there, the star witness, he's rewriting the scene in
his head, because ``you couldn't have the star get popped 10
minutes into the picture.'' What follows is a typical Leonardian
farce full of record producers and the threat of Russian gangsters.
We'll probably see it in theaters soon. &QL;

STARR, TRIPP DESERVE GRILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people have spoken.
</P>
<P>
   While it's time now for President Clinton to move forward, it is
also time for the judicial process to look back and consider the
potentially illegal conduct of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
and former White House aide Linda Tripp. After all, their
potentially illegal, not to mention unethical, conduct is largely
responsible for dragging this nation through one of the most
disgraceful episodes in its history.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the people. They spoke Friday through the votes of
the 55 US senators _ 45 Democrats and 10 Republicans _ who
acquitted President Clinton on the charge of perjury; and the 50 US
senators _ 45 Democrats ands five Republicans _ who voted against
the charge of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the outcome fall far short of the required
two-thirds support of the Senate for removal of the president,
neither measure received even a majority vote, denying the House
Republicans even a symbolic, though meaningless victory.
</P>
<P>
   While not a vindication of Clinton's personal conduct, the vote
to acquit is a complete repudiation of the Republican effort to
oust a popular president against the wishes of 70 percent of the
people, based on the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But even this repudiation does not bring the entire sordid
process to an end. There are still ongoing investigations related
to this impeachment that must be brought to a conclusion, if not to
justice. Starr, who is still using his office to both persecute and
prosecute Clinton's friends, still has to answer to potential
allegations that he misled Attorney General Janet Reno on getting
her approval to pursue the Monica Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of alleged illegal leaks from the grand jury to the
news media must also be resolved. And his alleged tactics of
keeping Lewinsky a near-prisoner and trying to force her to wear a
wiretap to trap Clinton must also be investigated. His links and
connections to Tripp, who has her own legal problems, must also be
pursued.
</P>
<P>
   As for Tripp, who is trying to rehabilitate her negative image
by making the media rounds, she ought to be fully investigated for
her alleged illegal wiretapping of her conversations with Lewinsky.
No amount of spin can change the reality that she wiretapped
Lewinsky to get at the president.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual links between Tripp, Starr, the religious right,
lawyers for Clinton accuser Paula Joness, and the right-leaning
elements in the House and Senate suggest a widespread, partisan
effort that might have brought down most other presidents, but not
the resilient Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Tripp, Starr and other Republicans argue that it was
Clinton's reckless behavior, not the subsequent wiretaps and the
investigation that bled this nation through the impeachment
process. But Starr, knowing that Clinton would not exactly proclaim
in a grand jury proceeding that he had sex with Lewinsky, set him
up for a fall.
</P>
<P>
   Although many legal experts became divided over the issue of
whether Clinton committed either perjury or obstruction of justice,
it became clear to the national audience that this was a political,
not a legal, proceeding against Clinton. It also became clear to a
majority that even if he committed perjury and obstruction of
justice, it was over a private sexual affair that, however wrong,
posed no threat to this nation. Such a case was not what the
Founding Fathers wanted the impeachment process to be about.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Starr's partisan political zeal to use and abuse that
office to get Clinton and his friends, there can be no doubt that
an office with such unlimited power and resources can be a
dangerous weapon in unsteady hands. The vast powers of this office
that made the impeachment fiasco possible ought to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   If Reno can show that she was misled by Starr regarding the
Lewinsky investigation, he should be fired. If he was the source of
illegal leaks from the grand jury, he should be prosecuted. If it's
discovered that Starr have performed other illegal acts in his
pursuit of Clinton, those allegations should be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, he can now focus on getting much of his agenda
approved over the next two years. And he can simply deny, if not
ignore, media reports that he will seek revenge against the House
Republican managers who brought the impeachment case to the Senate.
Of course, that should not dissuade Clinton from taking his
popularity on the campaign trail and working hard to return the
House, and possibly the Senate, to a Democratic majority.
</P>
<P>
   If the voters agree in the 2000 election to return Congress to
the Democrats, the Republicans will have no one to blame but
themselves. After all, if they had listened to the people earlier,
they could be spending more time working to retain control and less
time trying to wipe off the egg on their faces.

LOST BIRD: REUNION WITH TRIBE WAS BITTERSWEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
LOOKING FOR LOST BIRD 
by Yvette Melanson with Claire Safran (Avon Books, $22) 
 
 By CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a cloudless May morning in 1996, Yazzie Monroe, a Navajo
medicine man, guided his long-lost daughter through the throng of
reporters and well-wishers who wanted to witness her miraculous
homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe's daughter, Yvette Melanson, had been missing for 43
years, stolen with her infant twin brother from a hospital and
whisked into a black market that placed Indian babies with White
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of these ``Lost Birds,'' adopted illegally from the
1950s to 1970s, have never been found.
</P>
<P>
   But on that day, Yvette Melanson _ the woman who was raised
White and Jewish _ would walk with her birth father into the
chapter house of the tiny reservation community of Tolani Lake, 55
miles from Winslow, where she would be wrapped in a sacred blanket
and welcomed by her Navajo cousins with old songs and booming war
dances.
</P>
<P>
   Melanson's return to the high-desert plains of Tolani Lake had
begun just a month earlier, when her 20-year search for her roots
led her to a posting on the Internet that linked her to her Navajo
family.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the story of the reunion of the Jewish woman and
her Navajo kin was making national headlines, and Melanson and her
family were making their way to the reservation for the rousing
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   However, that is only the beginning of the complex, but clearly
told story that unfolds in Melanson's just-released 240-page
memoir, ``Looking for Lost Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-written by journalist/novelist Claire Safran, the book steers
clear of the deep, dull waters of self-revelation. Instead, the
writing is breezy, touching, a conversation with your best friend,
not your shrink. And as Melanson struggles to understand her
new-found family, she gives readers a tantalizing taste of the
soulful ceremonies that continue to define ancient Navajo culture
in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   The book opens a year after the homecoming. Yvette; her husband,
Dickie; and their two teenage daughters, Heather and Lori, are
loaded into an aged black van. Pulling a horse trailer stuffed with
their furniture, they are headed across country from their farm in
Palmyra, Maine, to Tolani Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a woman in a hurry, as usual, driving across the country
toward an unpredictable future,'' Melanson writes. ``With every
mile, I was leaving an old identity behind and coming closer and
closer to a new one.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Melansons coaxed their van cross-country, they clearly
were not prepared for what lay at the end of the journey:
joblessness, poverty, doubt, and, at times, brutal rejection _
familiar themes in Yvette's life.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper stories drew a broad sketch of Yvette Melanson. The
book completes the portrait of a woman troubled by painful memories
of the underground adoption, devastated by the rejection of her
once-loving adoptive father, and tormented by the disappearance of
her own son, Brad.
</P>
<P>
   Young Yvette languished for what she believes was three years in
the adoption underground. Then, suddenly, she was pulled away from
her foster mother and whisked to another unfamiliar family.
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Bea Silverman, a well-to-do Jewish couple in New York
City, dressed her in frills, gave her music and ballet lessons, and
tucked her into a pink canopy bed at night. They told her she was
adopted and had a twin brother, but if they knew, the Silvermans
never told her she was Indian.
</P>
<P>
   After Bea died, Yvette's world imploded. Her adoptive father
remarried, and her stepmother wanted the teenage Yvette out of the
house. Homeless, she moved from the home of one friend to another.
At age 17, her stepmother shipped her to Israel, where she became a
soldier and was wounded in a skirmish in the days before the 1973
Yom Kippur War.
</P>
<P>
   After returning home, she served in the Navy, married for a
short time and gave birth to a son. In a stunning parallel to her
birth mother's life, Melanson's emotionally troubled son was ripped
out of her arms at age 15 and sent by state officials to live with
strangers. Brad became Yvette's own Lost Bird, a runaway who melted
into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what my mother must have been feeling because I, too,
have lived with that emptiness,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she married Dickie Melanson, a retired
scallop-fisherman who, like his new wife, had a big heart and small
bank account.
</P>
<P>
   He encouraged the family's 1997 move to Tolani Lake. But in
time, he became embittered by the lack of jobs. He felt isolated
and unaccepted, once the target of an ominous warning, ``Kill
whitey,'' scribbled on a water tower in front of their home.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as life was on the reservation, Melanson wanted to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   She was learning to weave, savoring Navajo stories about
Changing Woman, the corn people and mischievous coyote. While
Melanson burrowed deeper and deeper into the Navajo culture, she
was unaware that her daughters were being taunted at school.
Heather was beaten up on the school bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deep in denial and finding it hard to dig my way out,''
Melanson writes.
</P>
<P>
   But the gritty Melansons persevere, find a way to pay their
bills and stay in Navajo Country. There is more to this story,
another beginning that begs to be written. &QL;

WEIGHING WILLES'S RECORD AT THE LA TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 16 months since he took over the reins as publisher of
the Los Angeles Times, Mark Willes, 57, has become the most
debated, dissected, and discussed newspaper executive in the
country. The topic at hand: Is he leading the Times to the promised
land or on a suicide mission?
</P>
<P>
   When he became publisher, the former General Mills executive
generated reams of bad press with heretical pronouncements about
breaking down the sacred ``wall'' between the paper's editorial and
business departments. No story was complete without references to
the ``Cereal Killer'' and ``Captain Crunch'' nicknames that mocked
his proclivity for cost cutting and for passing out pink slips. The
fear was that a major paper had been hijacked by a man who'd
specialized in packaging cereal boxes, a bottom-line buccaneer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Willes _ along with new editor Michael Parks _ is
amassing a record as he tones down the rhetoric. That record is
controversial, lauded and assailed within media circles. But it has
reinforced his reputation as the industry's flashiest riverboat
gambler, a marketer in search of a magic formula.
</P>
<P>
   That Holy Grail is Willes's audacious goal of bolstering the
Times's circulation of 1,067,540 by 500,000 new subscribers. Beyond
that is his heartfelt belief that newspapers, including his own,
are in dire need of major surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at a media conference last October, Willes, who is
also the Times-Mirror CEO, warned that ``newspapers have been, for
almost two decades now, a declining industry. You can either say,
`That is inevitable.' Or you can say, `We can do something about
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the Times has feverishly tried to ``do
something about it.'' It created an 11-person ``Latino desk'' to
win hearts and minds in the growing Hispanic community; produced a
new Southern California Living lifestyle section targeted at women;
cranked out ultra-localized Our Times supplements to address
complaints about community coverage; and embarked on an ambitious
Reading by 9 project that makes the paper a partner in a sweeping
child literacy campaign. It has also launched a new national
edition and a major redesign is slated to be completed within the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire the fact that he's really trying to do something
different. He's willing to take risks,'' says Tonnie Katz, editor
of the rival Orange Country Register. ``On the other hand, I'm not
sure how much he has tried to learn the industry. I wonder about a
person who can blithely say, `I'm going to pick up 500,000
circulation.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous skepticism about where he's going to get
those 500,000 readers,'' says Jill Stewart, an ex-Times employee
who writes for the weekly Los Angeles New Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally unrepentant on that subject,'' says an undaunted
Willes. ``The same people who thought I was crazy when I started
talking about that still think I'm crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Financially, 1998 was what LA Times CEO Kathryn Downing has
called ``a tough and disappointing year.'' There was a modest
17,000 circulation gain, but operating profits were expected to
drop by about 11 percent from 1997. Even as the paper expands into
new initiatives, it eliminates hundreds of jobs and seeks a 25
percent decrease in entertainment and travel budgets. In December,
Downing told a PaineWebber Media Conference that ``we have scrubbed
significant expenses out of the Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Willes sees nothing contradictory about growing and
shrinking simultaneously, nothing dangerous about juggling so many
balls at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just too slow,'' he laments, confounded by the newspaper
culture's cautious approach to change. ``You have to try a lot of
things to find out what works.''
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of the Times's new Latino desk tells you
everything you need to know about Willes's modus operandi.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst was a circulation dilemma: In a market that is
roughly 40 percent Hispanic, less than 20 percent of Latinos buy
the Times. Willes initially suggested creating a separate Latino
section of the paper to entice those readers. That generated a
furor as Times staffers complained about ghetto-izing Latino news.
Then Willes relented and this past fall, the Times created a Latino
desk consisting of 10 Spanish-speaking reporters and a photographer
assigned to different editors and beats scattered throughout the
paper. The idea is to cover the growing Latino population in a more
concerted and sophisticated fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a separate Latino section was ``one of the
rhetorical flourishes that got Mark in trouble,'' says Frank del
Olmo, who heads the Latino desk. ``That went over just awful. It
was clear he was throwing out ideas and looking for feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   The ill-fated plan for stand-alone Latino coverage reflects
Willes's tendency to raise eyebrows in his search for readers. Last
year, he talked about creating quotas for quotes by minorities and
women in the paper and told The Wall Street Journal that to attract
women, stories need to be ``more emotional, more personal, less
analytical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't come out of the newspaper tradition,'' says media
analyst John Morton, who calls Willes ``a beneficial influence. He
does things in untraditional ways. . . . Clearly, he's gonna put
his foot in (his mouth).''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Latino desk succeeds in bringing in new readers, it
may improve upon the Times's traditional coverage of Hispanics as
what del Olmo calls a ``problem people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see things that we're covering that we've never covered
before,'' says Parks. ``I'm looking for the paper to recognize in
its journalism the huge demographic changes that have occurred.
This is reality and we need to wake up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Like the Latino experiment, Southern California Living _ which
debuted on Nov. 1 _ is an editorial answer to a demographic
problem. There are 500,000 women who read the Times on Sunday, but
do not buy it the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, rumor had it that the lead story in the first
Southern California Living section would explain how to fold
sheets. That didn't materialize. But the new section is widely seen
as too fluffy, with its page of ``news, trends, gossip, and stuff
to do'' and a Section Gee! featuring a diet of astrology and
advice.

CLINTON'S BIG MISSILE THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Has it occurred to anybody else that the United
States might be this-close to a national security crisis because
our indisputably hyper-libidinous commander-in-chief may no longer
be getting, um, any?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton survived impeachment, but, thanks to the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, his public life will never be the same.
It's safe to assume his personal life has been similarly altered?
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of his days in the White House _ and there are
nearly two years of days remaining _ what chance has Bill Clinton
got of getting, um, any from anybody? How close do you suppose a
female White House intern gets to the Oval Office these days? (Are
there any female interns left?) How many private, one-on-one
meetings are scheduled between the leader of the free world and
women under the age of 85? How often do you figure the president
gets away with, ``Oh, I'm just going to take Buddy out for a little
walk''? And how loose is the agenda on trips to the Middle East or
The Hague?
</P>
<P>
   Given the astounding humiliation that he has visited upon his
wife of 22 years, it doesn't seem too large a leap to assume that
Bill Clinton is not getting, um, any at home. (As many of my gal
pals have pointed out, the president is darned lucky not to have
joined John Wayne Bobbitt in the surgical capon hall of fame.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Ha! Only what he deserves!'' shout all the moral absolutists.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but before they bruise one another from so much triumphal
back patting, they ought to think long and hard about the
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   A 52-year-old, physically healthy man _ who may or may not be a
sex ``addict'' but who certainly is an above-average horny toad _
has been forced to go cold turkey. After three decades-plus of
relatively unbridled freedom, at least 30 years of riding the
endorphin roller coaster of seduction-and-conquest, this man now
has no outlet.
</P>
<P>
   How many times can Clinton run around the outdoor track at the
White House? How many rounds of golf can he play and raise, not
lower, his endorphin level? In the short run (like until January
2001), how much stress can he relieve in weekly counseling sessions
with three mainstream Protestant ministers? Absent his customary
quota of getting, um, any, President Clinton is bound to turn, more
and more, to some sublimated activity. Drinking, doping and binge
eating probably can be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a long-held tradition of male leaders and on
not-so-little hints that the president has ordered the military to
literally drop over the past year, I suggest we all ... Think
Missiles.
</P>
<P>
   While most folks yelled ``Wag the Dog!'' each time Clinton OKed
the bombing of Iraq or Afghanistan or Sudan, I suspected folks were
barking up the wrong Douglas fir. Instead of Clinton wasting $200
million in cruise missiles to distract the nation from his
political troubles, my guess is that it was just the next-best
substitute he could find for his own prodigious rocket launchings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, my guess looked like prophecy when I read about the
Clinton administration's escalated activities in Iraq and its
expanded get-tough policy on harboring terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Desert Fox,'' the Iraqis need not fire on U.S. or
British aircraft to court a missile drop. All they must do is fix
an aircraft on their radar, and it's bombs away.
</P>
<P>
   As for terrorists, according to Richard Clarke, Clinton's
coordinator for counterterrorism: ``We may not just go in and
strike against a terrorist facility; we may choose to retaliate
against the facilities of the host country, if that host country is
a knowing, cooperative sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   Such facilities could include host countries' government
buildings or other such ``assets.'' Heaven help us. That could mean
a lot of cruise missiles, which could mean a lot of mistakes and
civilian casualties, which could mean a lot of re-retaliatory
attacks by Saddam Hussein and less-than-stable leaders of host
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time for a bipartisan funding bill to prevent such an
outcome. Let's call it the, um, Heidi Fleiss Act.

 UNDATED: ... and advice.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a piece she wrote for the New York Press, Times watcher
Catherine Seipp derided the section and the Reading by 9 campaign
as ``back-of-the-cereal-box journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The paper strikes a lot of readers as furlongs and furlongs of
froth,'' adds Bryce Nelson, a journalism professor at the
University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Parks thinks the new lifestyle section is ``more
focused and structured than it was a year ago. Features are always
derided as soft and fluffy.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, that's the way the Times's local coverage has
been characterized as well. In the October speech, Willes admitted
that readers ``think we do generally a lousy job on local news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The longstanding belief internally at the LA Times is that we
are a national paper and cannot get all caught up in the parochial
stuff,'' says Stewart. ``Under Willes, nothing has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's not quite true. Starting in early 1998, the Times began
publishing very localized, zoned supplements called Our Times.
Billed as ``the 100 percent all-local newspaper for your
community,'' these inserts carry everything from sports schedules
to police logs and have that cozy garden-club tone. There are seven
current Our Times editions with about 10 more on the drawing board,
says Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics dismiss the Our Times supplements as amateurish
community rags. But Parks contends that ``community journalism is
different from covering Washington. People are interested in what's
going on in their neighborhood. . . . I think we have a sense of
what a zone needs to be now. It needs to be a social community as
opposed to a ZIP code.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to community outreach, the Times's most ambitious
effort may be Reading by 9. Unveiled last October, the project _
backed by a five-year, $5 million Times commitment _ is designed to
combat poor third-grade reading performances.
</P>
<P>
   In playing Good Samaritan, the Times is publishing stories on
childhood literacy and a Southern California Living feature called
``The Kids' Reading Room.'' It is soliciting corporate volunteers
to purchase books and pay for tutor training and enlisting Times
employees to read to children.
</P>
<P>
   With Reading by 9, Willes has injected the Times into a major
media debate. Detractors complain that such journalistic activism
is the first step on the slippery slope to advocacy. But it fits
Willes's style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of a phony debate. Newspapers have always
had a point of view,'' he insists. Student illiteracy ``is the
biggest single tragedy in southern California and (we should) see
if we can't become part of the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate raging here is whether Willes is an outsider bringing
fresh ideas to a stagnant industry or a market-driven agent of
journalistic erosion. And can he be both?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things people like about him is he does seem
committed to saving the newspaper,'' says USC's Nelson. He adds,
however, that Willes's most ``visible impact'' is that ``he's cut
the number of employees.''
</P>
<P>
   One Willes asset is Parks, the Pulitzer Prize-winning longtime
foreign reporter. There were concerns that Parks was not ready for
prime time when he succeeded Shelby Coffey III, the high-profile
Times editor whose sudden resignation coincided with Willes's move
to publisher. But analysts say Parks has earned his staff's respect
as a smart newsman who balances Willes's more impulsive nature.
</P>
<P>
   Parks admits that becoming editor when Willes was generating
nasty headlines and scaring his own staff with remarks about
melding journalists and bean counters was ``a rather strange entry
in that I was dealing with a whole set of issues that weren't mine,
that were good concerns that were based on misunderstanding and
frankly, some miscommunication on the part of the Times.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Parks harbors doubts about Willes's lofty goals, he keeps
them to himself. ``At many newspapers in the United States, a good
year is 1 1/2 percent growth in circulation,'' he says. ``That's
crazy. I think newspapers continue to have far more potential as a
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that Willes is fixated on the bottom line and
that he only respects what he can measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think making the numbers better is his plan,'' says Sara
Fisher, a reporter at The Los Angeles Business Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a way to measure the quality of international
coverage? I don't have a clue,'' he responds. ``On the other hand,
can you measure readership? Of course you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times publisher says he recognizes the intrinsic qualities
of good journalism and the incalculable value of the Times's
reputation. ``What's unique about journalism is the editorial
side,'' he says, sounding all the right notes. ``We haven't cut out
coverage of foreign news. We haven't cut out coverage of national
news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he isn't one of us, he talks the talk, he speaks
like a journalist,'' says an admiring Jan Schaffer, executive
director of the Pew Center for Civic Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   But in his high-powered crusade to save his newspaper _ and
perhaps the entire industry _ the man who began his career as an
assistant professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania
has sealed his fate. He is someone who will ultimately live or die
by the numbers.

WOMEN'S MAGAZINES RELY ON SEXUAL INSECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; University of Chicago sex study published last week revealed
that nearly half of all women and one-third of men have serious
sexual problems. The findings shed light on a range of hitherto
dimly lit corners, among them the question of why women's magazines
feature so many stories about sex. Sex sells, of course, but why
does it sell? The answer may not be as obvious as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   This month's crop of women's magazines has even more sex than
usual. Blame it on St. Valentine's Day, when editors' minds turn
not-so-lightly to thoughts of love. Or blame it on February, the
shortest, nastiest month of the year, when readers need a reason to
go on living. Or blame it on Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Sex shouts at us from the newsstand, in headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Allure: ``Rated X. Sex Lessons of a Paris Madam.''
</P>
<P>
   Glamour: ``Is He Your Secret Sexual Soulmate? How to Meet or
Make Your Man the Lover of Your Steamiest Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Max Frankel wrote a column in the New York Times
Magazine about the surfeit of sex in women's magazines, suggesting
that it accounts for the nation's surprisingly blase attitude
toward the steamy details of the presidential sex scandal. Prurient
stories in mainstream women's magazines have shaped our attitudes
about sex, Frankel said, so that we are now a nation of cynical
sexual sophisticates.
</P>
<P>
   But which came first? Monica or the magazines? It used to be
that only Cosmopolitan could be relied upon to put sex on its
cover. Now even traditional women's magazines like Redbook hook
readers every month with headlines about sex.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in the New York Post, Redbook's editor
Lesley Jane Seymour said the events in Washington have shaped the
content of women's magazines. ``The reality is we are all talking
about sex and this makes (the subject) more accessible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days after Frankel's column appeared came the results
of the University of Chicago sex survey, published in the Journal
of the American Medical Association. Are we a nation of sexual
sophisticates? We're anything but, if the study can be believed.
</P>
<P>
   The results of this survey may have come as a surprise to many,
although probably not to the editors of women's magazines who know
their readers are as insecure about sexual matters as they are
about weight, aging, hair, makeup, and a host of other issues.
Readers crave information about sex, and they turn to women's
magazines in search of it. Lately they've been getting more advice
than ever, some of it good, some of it nonsense. Sexy headlines are
major weapons in fierce circulation skirmishes, so perhaps it's not
surprising that the headlines are often racier than the stories.
For example, a piece in Mirabella provocatively titled ``Hot and
Heavy. Does More Body Fat Mean Better Sex?'' turns out to be an
interesting but non-titillating report on the relationship between
weight and estrogen levels. (The answer? Maybe. It depends on how
much fat you own and where you carry it _ just in case you're
wondering.)
</P>
<P>
   The women's magazine industry has always played upon readers
feelings of inadequacy. When it comes to sex, editors don't even
have to try to make readers feel as though something's missing in
their lives. Once you might have felt inadequate because your
sponge cake didn't measure up. Now you have to worry that your
orgasm potential doesn't meet the standard.
</P>
<P>
   What ordinary woman really feels equal to this Cosmo challenge:
``Be the Best Sex of His Life _ How to Tease Him Mercilessly,
Seduce Him Slowly, Then Rock His World in Ways He's only Dreamed
About!'' The University of Chicago sex survey revealed, among other
things, that women suffer almost as much as men from performance
anxiety. Readers of women's magazines probably suffer more than
most.

THERE'S COLOR AMID THE DARKNESS OF MEN'S FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fall '99 menswear collections opened with an edgy
salvo from Kenneth Cole, who didn't even bother to acknowledge that
there were any other colors but black, gray and navy.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's collection, however, set the pace for everyone else in
terms of cut (sleek and boxy at the same time) and attitude (young,
urban, futuristic).
</P>
<P>
   Cole showed his Darth Vader blacks and silvered modernisms (such
as padded microfiber and leather outwear paired with slick, black
microfiber snowboarder zippered pants and overalls) and his totally
New York approach to jeans and suitings alike, in Grand Central
Terminal's Vanderbilt Hall, with its soaring 40-foot ceiling and
marble floors. It was a salvo buyers will not forget and set the
bar fairly high for every other designer who followed.
</P>
<P>
   The minute the show ended with actors Kevin Bacon, Billy Baldwin
and Jeremy Piven strolling the runway, those hard-bitten and jaded
buyers and other spectators stood up and gave Cole a warm ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Trends broke down into two separate and highly divergent areas.
The first was Millennial Modern, with utilitarian clothes like
cargo pants, jeanswear, blue-collar uniforms worked up in high-tech
fabrics such as oiled cottons and boiled wools, microfibers,
rubberized chino, and light-reflective and plastic-coated man-made
fibers. Then there was the Young Urban Dandy, who is not afraid of
color, dramatic pieces or luxurious fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any message to men for fall it was: Women stole our
styles from us and we're stealing them back. Where the women's
collections for spring featured body packs, drawstring pants (a
take-off on men's pj bottoms), hooded sweaters, ponchos and
anoraks, men's fall collections have reclaimed them with a stylish
vengeance. The one proviso: Don't be afraid to affect these pieces
in vivid, arresting color.
</P>
<P>
   Here is some of the other talent:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sandy Dalal. When Wilkes Bashford mentions that he's ``looking
at Sandy Dalal,'' then you know this designer, 23, is definitely
one to watch. Dalal uses his Indian heritage to good effect with
this collection, which is a romance with color and texture more
than adventuresome cut.
</P>
<P>
   Dalal has taken conservative clothing like the three-button suit
and juiced it up with sensuous color. His jewel-toned velvet
tuxedos are just the ticket for men who are leaving their penguin
suits behind. He uses color as accent on thick, luxurious cashmere
sweaters (slashes of contrasting color holding down shoulder or
side body seams); in playful floral jackets and trousers; and as
shirtings atop waxed and oiled fabric trousers that look like
flexible leathers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Everett Hall. He's in love with color. Showing only
well-tailored suits and sports jackets, Hall went for the dramatic
_ like a gorgeous twilight blue, three-button draped suit worn with
a black silk charmeuse shirt and matching tie or a black six-button
double-breasted suit with a retro-gangster feel.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's clothes are well-in-keeping with the accent on youthful
experimentation, but it takes a really secure, adventuresome guy to
carry them off. Fabrics are lightweight and creaseproof; cuts are
the sleek/boxy look, which might seem like an oxymoron, but these
are stand-away from the body cuts that require well-tailored
shoulders to hang right and no beer gut to look good.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gene Meyer. It is expected that he will play with color and
push the envelope. But with this collection, someone should have
put a tether on him. Meyer's outwear, particularly the shearlings
and hooded duffel coats were swell; and his jersey and flannel
draw-string pants were sexy and body-hugging, but to gussy them up
with massive cargo pockets in front and a built-in fanny pack in
back screamed ``unclear on the concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the pink, acid green, and graphic red, white and
black shirts decorated with beads and sequins. Very festive,
circuit party stuff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Perry Ellis. He is forever reminding me of a big, playful dog
who makes you laugh. The line has always been youth-oriented and
super preppie and still is, but with certain gentrified country
twists. Color reigned here with a fall palette of browns
(everything from walnut and bark to tobacco and earth tones),
greens, burgundies and cranberry (a deep red/cranberry leather
jacket was a major shock). The best pieces: dramatic shin-swept
ponchos and short-sleeved cashmere T-shirts. The tuxedo look is
winter white, nothing the young urban pioneer would even attempt
unless he had a good dry cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   _ R. Scott French. This first-time menswear designer sent real
men in real clothes down the runway, but since a lot of them were
famous baseball players and Alan Cumming, the Tony-winning star of
``Cabaret,'' it was the guys who were noted, not the clothes. Which
was too bad. Some of French's designs were right on, like the
stretch drawstring trousers. Putting a pair of them on Boston Red
Sox pitcher Bret Saberhagen may have been a mistake though, what
with his tree-trunk thighs and double ax-handle butt. However,
French's sportswear was colorful and body-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Chu for Nautica. Using eerie, Prada-esque blue neon
lighting on the runway and an ear-splitting electronic score, Chu
may have alarmed and turned off more people than he charmed. Chu's
inspiration was the American worker. There were jeans, overalls,
carpenter pants and vests _ done up in cyber gray, black and navy
tones in rubberized and space-age fabrications. His clothes go
beyond edgy. They're threatening. Chu's outerwear is heavy and
winterized, equipped with face-obscuring hoods and created out of
high-tech, waterproof (and probably bullet-proof) fabrics.
Personally, I like his bright yellow sailing parkas better.

SHARON ISBIN WINS WORLD FAME BY PICKIN' AND GRINNIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 20 years ago, Boston broadcaster David Brudnoy called
up to say, ``I have this cousin who plays the guitar.'' The answer
shot back too fast: ``Who doesn't?''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know then that Brudnoy's cousin was Sharon Isbin. In
1975 she had already won major competitions in Toronto and in
Munich; later in that decade she played a wonderful Boston debut
recital in First and Second Church and appeared with the
Brandenburg Ensemble in Symphony Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Isbin has become one of the world's most celebrated
guitarists _ and the first woman to enter the top rank of solo
guitarists. Today Isbin has more than 20 CDs to her credit, plays
60 concerts in America every year (and more in Europe and Japan),
and heads the guitar department she created at the Juilliard School
in New York. One of her CDs has traveled into outer space, and she
has her own Web site (www.sharonisbin.com) where you can see a
picture of her CD floating weightless.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by phone from New York last week, Isbin talked about
her career and her commitment to new music; she speaks with the
vigor, the color, the emotional investment she brings to her
playing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
First interest was science &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She says she had no intention of becoming a guitarist. ``My
father, who is now retired, was a professor of chemical engineering
at the University of Minnesota; my mother's side of of the family
was full of musicians and theater people. I was planning to be a
scientist and spent hours dissecting anything that leaped or
crawled. I also spent many hours a day on model rockets. When I was
9, our family went on sabbatical to Italy. My oldest brother
expressed an interest in taking guitar lessons, but what he had in
mind was Elvis Presley. What was available was classical guitar
lessons, so I volunteered, not really having any idea of what the
classical guitar was. I loved it immediately because it was so
exotic, so out of my immediate world, and also because it was so
very personal. The resonance spoke to me right away, the contact of
fingers against the strings _ there was something very sensual
about it. After all, you cradle the guitar almost like a human
being. This was something very different from my previous
experience with the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Isbin's talent was immediately apparent. Fortunately she came
along in time to take some lessons with the legendary Andres
Segovia, who created an honored place for the guitar in the concert
world. ``I had a number of lessons with Segovia when he would come
to town, and I also traveled to take lessons with him. He was not
known for being a great teacher _ his approach was to say, `Do it
like I do it.' But what was nice was to hear his sound up close. It
was so especially beautiful and remarkable, something to strive
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Isbin was never able to hear in live performance
the most prominent woman guitarist of an earlier generation, Ida
Presti, who played as half of the famous duo-guitar team with
Alexandre Lagoya. ``Ida Presti died in her early 40s, so I never
heard her, but she was one of the finest guitarists ever to be
produced in France, and she was a role model for me. In France, far
more women study guitar than in the United States _ I'm sure that
the many years of her prominence encouraged that. Today some of my
top students have been women. If I ever encountered any prejudice,
I wasn't consciously aware of it. Of course, when I would show up
for a master class and there would be 40 to 50 male guitarists
there, I was very aware of pressure. But that had a positive effect
on me _ it made me work harder. I didn't want there to be any
question about the quality of what I was offering. Nurturing my
talent like that laid aside any question anyone might have.
Ultimately you are in competition with yourself, and with no one
else.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A personal association &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rodrigo ``Concierto de Aranuez'' is the most popular guitar
concerto, and one of the most widely performed 20th-century
concertos composed for any instrument. Written in 1940, it has been
with Isbin throughout her career, and she prizes her personal
association both with the piece and its composer, who is 97. ``When
I won a competition in 1979 in Spain, Rodrigo heard about it and
tracked me down. I met him and his wife and forged a friendship
that has lasted ever since. This is a man, blind since the age of
3, who changed the future of the guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   The story behind the piece explains why it has so powerful an
effect. ``Rodrigo's wife was expecting her first child, but had had
a miscarriage; she was hospitalized, and he didn't know whether she
would live or die,'' Isbin says. ``He had already begun work on the
concerto. Every night he'd return from visiting her, devastated,
and sit at the piano; what emerged was a beautiful theme for the
second movement _ he was remembering their honeymoon, in the
Aranuez, so the music is a mixture of passion for their love and of
intense pain and loss. She didn't die until last year, which was
devastating to him; he is touched by some kind of cosmic grace _ he
has such a potent connection to his emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Isbin has forged her own emotional connection to this piece.
``Two and a half years ago, when my brother was dying of AIDS, he
said he wanted my recording of the second movement of this piece
played at his memorial service. This sent me into shock _ two days
later I was scheduled to play just that movement with the Baltimore
Symphony. I wondered how I was ever going to get through it, but it
went as if he had commanded it. It was one of the most powerful
experiences of my life, and now I have that association whenever I
play this music.''
</P>
<P>
   Isbin has been interested in extending the repertory for her
instrument since she was a teenager. In the 1980s, she embarked on
a collaboration with the eminent Bach pianist Rosalyn Tureck that
revolutionized the way Bach is interpreted on the guitar, and the
two women collaborated on an edition of Bach's lute suites. Isbin
has also commissioned many new works for the guitar _ including
pieces by Aaron Jay Kernis, Lukas Foss, Joseph Schwantner,
Christopher Rouse, William Bolcom, and Bruce McCombie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Success with ``Troubadours'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of number of performances, John Corigliano's
`Troubadours' is probably the most successful to date _ since the
premiere at the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in 1993, I have played
it more than 40 times, and people always love it. It was inspired
by the courtly love tradition of the French troubadours, and the
piece is conceived as a song by a woman troubadour. It evokes the
spirit of the past, a return to childhood innocence, but it is also
steeped in sadness and nostalgia because of what happened to the
troubadours when they fell out of favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Isbin plays an 11-year-old guitar made by Thomas Humphrey in New
York. ``What I like about it is the projection, the very round and
full treble, and the ability to respond quickly to different timbre
changes. How each note sustains is critical _ lyrical playing
depends on evenness and balance, the sustain, and the intonation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Corigliano work, the guitar is first heard offstage, and
Isbin must play it while moving around. To make that happen, she
had to take a step in a new direction. ``I knew that the sound
would require electronic reinforcement, but I wanted to control the
quality of the reinforcement, so that it would sound so natural
that nobody would know it was there. That required something that
no one could see, so it is a wireless sound system. I began to use
it not only for `Troubadors,' but also for other concertos and solo
dates. It gives the listener the depth, resonance, and roundness of
the guitar sound and it sounds as natural as if it were in a living
room. The contexts in which most people hear the guitar are very
different _ in the living room, on a recording, or in a concert
hall. What is important to me onstage is that the sound of the
instrument should have all the intimacy, the nuances, the wide
dynamic range you would hear in a living room or on a recording.''
</P>
<P>
   Isbin says she is the only guitarist so far who has the system.
``It is a pain in the neck to travel with because it weights 94
pounds in its shipping case. But it has revolutionized my career.
It has not proved controversial _ quite the opposite. Critics who
had no idea it was there write about how easily my unamplified
guitar filled the hall! It's not much fun for a performer to
struggle to be heard; this way the audience can feel the energy of
the instrument. I've had the system for six years now, and since
I've had it, I enjoy performing a lot more _ I can do everything I
have in my mind, and know it will come across.''

STUDENTS SYMPATHIZE WITH PRESIDENTIAL AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Here's an argument not heard in the impeachment
trial of President Clinton: If the sex helps him do his job better,
so be it.
</P>
<P>
   No, those words were not uttered by presidential defenders as
the Senate voted to clear Clinton of perjury and obstruction of
justice charges stemming from his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
Rather, they were uttered by Kelly Davis, who was telling the more
than 100 students attending the ``Sex, Lies and Impeachment'' class
at the State University of New York at Albany that the president
should be held to a lower standard than most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has responsibilities we can't possibly fathom,''
said Davis, an archaeology major from Yonkers, N.Y. ``I don't think
he should have to explain why he had sex with an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the Senate voted to acquit Clinton on Friday,
Professor Martin Edelman asked his class how they would vote.
</P>
<P>
   The students turned out to be more pro-Clinton than the Senate,
with roughly two-thirds raising their hands for acquittal. But
freed from the restraints of political convention, they gave
reasons seldom heard in Washington _ at least not publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Sean Carroll, a political science major from Brooklyn.
He's a Republican, but don't expect to hear arguments from him in
favor of punishing Clinton. Rather, he advocated acquittal for
political reasons: If Vice President Al Gore became president, he
argued, it might increase his chances for election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd vote to acquit, just so the 2000 election is more
competitive,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   The course, which for the past month has been probing the
historical and cultural forces behind Clinton's impeachment, took
on the air of a Capitol hearing room Friday. Far from sounding
jaded and tired of the scandal, students were impassioned, railing
against factions in society they blame for the scandal: Republicans
(obsessed with sex), Democrats (morally bankrupt), the news media
(narrow-minded) and the American people (complacent).
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken by Edelman revealed that all but a handful of
students believed that Clinton would have been convicted during an
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Democrat, so its hard for me to say, but I think he
should just walk away with whatever dignity he has left and
resign,'' said Susan Idiculla, a political science major from
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``I was hoping it would not come to impeachment
and it did. I was hoping it would not come to removal and it did. I
can't believe all this has happened and his approval ratings are
still sky high.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, while admitting Clinton's wrongdoing, said they feared
his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's something worse about people who can't forgive
Clinton for human failings,'' said Matthew Reif, a political
science major from Syracuse, N.Y.

WATCH WHAT YOU EAT WITH YOUR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's no mystery that many prescription drugs
don't mix well with others and that taking drugs with alcohol is
almost always a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But it may surprise you to learn that sometimes food and drugs
interact in ways that may be bothersome or even harmful.
</P>
<P>
   The culprits, under certain conditions, include such seemingly
benign and healthy foods as milk, leafy green vegetables and
grapefruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   A single glass of grapefruit juice, for example, can boost
concentrations of some blood pressure medicines, including Plendil,
Procardia, Sular and Verelan, to potentially harmful levels.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen in birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy
may also be affected, as well as the antihistamine Hismanal. Take
grapefruit juice with cyclosporin, a drug that fights organ
rejection in transplant patients, and it may cause confusion and
trembling.
</P>
<P>
   Those potential interactions are getting more attention these
days as the number of Americans taking prescription medicines
continues to increase. Most side effects aren't so dramatic: upset
stomach, diarrhea, fatigue and irritability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approximately 85 million American adults take one or more
prescription medicines,'' said Linda Golodner, president of the
National Consumers League, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C.
``Yet despite this widespread use, many consumers do not know about
potential risks, side effects and possible drug interactions.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been compounded in recent years with the advance
of newer medicines, many of which have subtle effects on different
enzyme systems in the body.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many medical conditions, including the AIDS virus,
require patients to follow a complex and difficult prescription
regimen with some drugs taken on an empty stomach, others taken
with food, to ensure best results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very difficult depending on what regimen they're on
to know when to take them,'' said Bonnie Purdy, a clinical
pharmacist at the Albany Medical Center. ``Some drugs if you take
them with food, absorption is closer to 90 percent. If you take
them on an empty stomach, absorption is closer to 40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   To increase awareness about potential problems, the National
Consumers League, in cooperation with the Food and Drug
Administration, has recently published a brochure to alert
consumers to possible food-drug interactions for some of the most
common prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the consumers league has received about 120,000
requests from across the country for the brochure, which includes
information on how to take everything from antibiotics to
anti-anxiety drugs.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take penicillin and amoxicillin on an empty stomach, unless it
causes upset, in which take them with food.
</P>
<P>
   _ For Cipro, Levaquin, Floxin and Trovan, other antibiotics, the
key is to avoid calcium-containing products such as milk, yogurt,
antacids and any iron-containing vitamins and minerals. Such foods
and vitamins significantly decrease drug absorption.
</P>
<P>
   _ With the anti-anxiety drugs Xanax or Valium, be aware that
caffeine may cause excitability, nervousness and hyperactivity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid eating foods high in the chemical tyramine, such as
cheese and sausage, if you are taking antidepressants known as
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. The mix can cause a potentially
fatal rise in blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts welcome the National Consumers League's effort,
but emphasize that the best defense against any harmful food-drug
combination is open and frequent communication among patients,
doctors and pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should perform as a team,'' said Kathleen M. Bonnier,
a pharmacist at Lindsay Drug Co. in Troy, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (For a copy of the National Consumers League's brochure on
food-drug interactions, send $2 to the National Consumers League,
1701 K St. NW, Suite 1200, Washington, DC 20006.)

HARRIS THRIVES IN THE GRAY AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CLEA SIMON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ARCHANGEL 
By Robert Harris 
Random House, $24.95, 373 pp. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Harris deals in futures. In his sure-footed treks through
the worlds of political thriller-mysteries, he takes historical
situations and asks ``What if?'' His first fictional outing, the
best-selling ``Fatherland,'' imagined a world in which Hitler had
won World War II, and where one lonely cop bent on investigating a
mysterious death becomes tangled in Reich bureaucracy. For
``Archangel,'' his third mystery, the setup is more subtle.
History, at least the big facts, isn't changed. Instead, the gray
areas, the possibilities, and the rumors come to life. The
present-day Russia that our hero, an alcoholic academic named
``Fluke'' Kelso, finds himself wandering through is recognizable
from today's news reports. The future, however, couldn't be
scarier.
</P>
<P>
   Harris knows his history. The British writer was a BBC
journalist and the author of the nonfiction ``Selling Hitler''
(about the fake Hitler diaries) before turning his hand to
breathless pop fiction. And though his specialty seems to have been
Germany, he's up on the former Soviet Union as well. In its 1955
Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage, The New York Times reported the
possibility that Josef Stalin's death two years earlier had been
murder. Harris takes that idea and runs with it, flicking back and
forth through time to witness a conspiracy that may have hastened
the mad tyrant's death but that couldn't stop one of his schemes
for controlling the future. Uncovering that plan in the present day
_ Kelso is desperate for a research coup _ brings 40-year-old
factions into play, evoking terrible echoes of Germany immediately
before Hitler took control. As Russia teeters on the edge of a
political collapse that too closely recalls Weimar Germany's, the
flailing academic must fight for both his life and world peace.
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a load to dump on poor Kelso, an antihero with
flaws big enough for Harrison Ford to fly a jet through. He's not a
well man. His drinking has caused the end of several marriages, and
ego-driven career choices have left him jobless and unable to
write. And while these factors help force him into action, they do
detract a bit from his appeal. Unlike the innocent Nazi cop of
``Fatherland'' or the unstable codebreaker hero of ``Enigma,''
Harris's second thriller, Kelso is a difficult protagonist with
whom to identify. Unlike those earlier characters, the sloppy sot
has few attractive vulnerabilities and lots of nasty habits, not
the least of which is his tendency to be bullied by an even slimier
fellow, an American TV reporter named R. J. O'Brian.
</P>
<P>
   To further hamper Kelso, he and his colleagues are forced to
clamber through prose that has grown simpler with each successive
book. O'Brian's flat characterization _ he's a stereotypically
self-important American _ serves the plot but little else. Hands
grow ``slippery with blood'' and silence must be ``utter.''
</P>
<P>
   But mystery-thrillers have their own laws, and sometimes their
limited range just sounds right. The sometime prostitute Zinaida,
for example, is a tough babe; we pick that up from her walk, her
tight apparel, and her relative nonchalance about her profession.
But her character is tamped down when she digs out her father's
gun: ``She had discovered that she could still strip and load it
without looking at it _ like riding a bicycle, it seemed: one of
those childish accomplishments you never forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris has the pitch just right in other minor characters as
well. Rapava, the old-timer who tells Kelso about Stalin's last
days, is a grand storyteller in Harris's hands, bringing to life
his youth as a naive young recruit and his innocent observations on
the half-mad Stalin. The way Rapava's murder reverberates through
Kelso's mind, along with images of wolves, is equally chilling. And
Harris knows how to play up the action: A harrowing, extended hunt
through the Russian subarctic works every element for tension,
setting Kelso against not only a crazed enemy and government
killers, but also the crushing cold that puts a time limit on
survival. These are the factors, ultimately, that hook readers, and
in these Harris excels. ``Archangel'' may not live up to its
predecessors, but it will keep readers awake till the small hours
in fear of endless night.

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ After fleeing Castro's Cuba in 1962, Abelardo
Morell, his parents, and his sister eventually landed in New York
City, where Morell's father took a job as a building
superintendent. With the job came a basement apartment with only
one window, high up on the wall, which gave the 14-year-old Morell
an odd perspective on the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   He's kept that. In the camera obscura photographs that have
occupied him for the last few years, he's created upside-down
images of cities, mountains, and the Empire State Building, the
exterior world projected onto the walls of various interiors,
giving new meaning to ``A Room With a View.'' As his home east of
Havana had been during the revolution, as the family digs in
Manhattan became, the rooms in Morell's photographs are a refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his camera obscura works are in ``Abelardo Morell and
the Camera Eye,'' a show organized by the Museum of Photographic
Arts in San Diego and opening Wednesday at the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts. Although the exhibition comes from California, Morell is
a local. Since 1983 he's taught at the Massachusetts College of
Art, whose director of exhibitions, Jeffrey Keough, first showed
his work 14 years ago. ``Abe's art is the quintessential
immigrant's search for identity in a new country,'' Keough says.
Morell's MFA appearance, meanwhile, is a rare example of the museum
paying serious attention to a living Boston artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artist'' is a label Morell has only recently come to accept.
Sitting in the dining room of the modest triple-decker here where
he lives with his wife and two children, he says, ``In college I
wasn't an art major because I couldn't think of myself as an
artist. When I have to draw, I do stick figures. I'm lousy at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The art world, on the other hand, has gone mad for Morell these
past few years. He's constantly asked to lecture or serve as artist
in residence, internationally, although he says that ``as an exile,
I hate to travel. I like being at home.''
</P>
<P>
   He's the recipient of awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship
and an honorary degree from his alma mater, Bowdoin College in
Brunswick, Maine. He's been the subject of numerous shows and of
one of the Smithsonian Institution Press monographs ``Photographers
at Work.'' His art is in important public collections: the Museum
of Modern Art in New York, the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, the Art
Institute of Chicago. His New York dealer, Bonni Benrubi, sells his
work for $1,500 _ $7,500 a print, one to the Whitney Museum of
American Art just last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abe's popularity is endless,'' Benrubi says, ``which is why
he's so backed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Language and music have played pivotal parts in Morell's
development. The role of language is clear to anyone who's seen his
images of stacks of children's alphabet blocks, his poignant
close-ups of Braille texts illuminated by shafts of light, his
photographs that make books as monumental as the pyramids. His
earliest exploration of books _ in his uncle's Havana library _ was
physical. He appreciated them more for their shapes, sizes, and
even their smells than for their content.
</P>
<P>
   Music is no less key, but far less obvious. ``I'm a CD addict,''
he confesses, ``everything from Bartok to Lauryn Hill. I listen
constantly when I'm in the darkroom. And I'm starting to take piano
lessons now. I had a sophisticated knowledge of music without even
knowing where middle C was.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child, music and dancing were a way to belong,'' he says.
``I was 8 or 9 when my parents taught me how to dance. It was
important to them, a passport into culture in Cuba. They're in
their mid-70s now and they still go dancing twice a week, in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuban music is probably the world's most exciting and
rhythmically complex. But the dancing is very formal, a contrast to
the brassiness of the music. That combination of form and something
sexy and hot shaped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Morell's family left Cuba after his father, who had been a
sergeant in Batista's navy and was twice arrested during the Castro
regime, was tipped off that he'd been marked for a firing squad.
``He managed to negotiate `tourist' visas,'' Morell says, which
involved giving everything you owned to the government before you
left on your `vacation.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We were walking to a KLM prop plane and two secret service
agents stopped my father and interrogated him for an hour,'' Morell
recalls. ``Finally they let him go. When the plane took off, all
the adults started to cry. They knew that was it. They had no
illusions about going back. I'm still angry about having to leave.
I was just beginning to become a person in a society. That was
taken away from me. I had to be an instant grown-up. I learned
English more quickly than my parents, so I had to be their
negotiator.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that travel from the United States to Cuba is possible in
certain situations, Morell says, he has a ``complicated reaction to
the idea of going back.''
</P>
<P>
   What he calls ``the Spanish-English thing'' made his early years
in this country tough and made language and literature all the more
crucial. The part-time jobs he held in high school and college left
little time for socializing, and his imperfect English didn't help.
To improve his command of his new language he read Hemingway. ``I
liked its concreteness,'' says the artist who would later give his
photographs no-nonsense titles Hemingway would have approved of.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, he bought himself a Brownie camera, with money earned
from being Drugstore Delivery Boy to the Stars, working for a
pharmacy that counted Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme among its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Images became a way to deal with things,'' Morell says, ``to
tell my own story.'' He holds up one of his earliest photographs, a
shot of his parents, his father bare-chested and shoveling coal
into a boiler in a dank basement, his mother standing nearby.
``They're smiling,'' notes Morell, who himself smiles almost
constantly during a two-hour interview. ``The place was Dickensian,
subterranean, a complete contrast to Cuban light. But they were
happy. In America, no one could come and take them away.''
</P>
<P>
   An admissions officer from Bowdoin College arrived at Morell's
New York high school when he was a senior. ``They were trying to
recruit people not like them,'' he says. He was offered a
scholarship. His parents looked up Maine on a map. He took the bus
to Brunswick for his freshman year, and the more rural the terrain
became during the ride, ``the more frightened I got,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A sophomore-year photography course with Bowdoin professor John
McKee sparked Morell's passion. ``From the first roll of film,'' he
says, ``it was clear I was going to do this forever.'' Music also
figured in his college career. He had his own program on the
college radio station, where he played everything from Cage to
Coltrane. ``I admire John Cage's use of form to explore the
unknown,'' he says. ``This was the Woodstock era. Rampant
formlessness.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``An absurd place'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He went on to earn an MFA from Yale, working in the
street-photography tradition of Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert
Frank. His images were urban, gritty, full of angst. ``The world
was an absurd place, where I was a Camus-like observer,'' he says.
That's as close as he comes to art philosophy. Otherwise, he's
allergic, wincing as he speaks the dreaded word ``deconstruct'' and
proclaiming that ``I can pronounce Foucault and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Diane Arbus, he initially found truth edited by his own eye
to be stranger than fiction. An early photograph taken in a bike
shop, for instances, stars a little blond girl who looks eerily
irradiated, even possessed, as if she's auditioning for ``The Turn
of the Screw.''
</P>
<P>
   Morell and his wife, filmmaker Lisa McElaney, had their first
child, Brady, in 1986, and Morell turned his time _ and lens _ to
things domestic. ``The child is father of the man,'' Wordsworth
wrote, and so it was with Morell. Brady's birth prompted the first
body of work that earned him a place as one of America's foremost
contemporary photographers. Getting down on the floor with his son,
he made a whole series of photographs from a rugrat's perspective.
A tower of blocks became a skyscraper; a view from the top of a
metal playground slide seemed a virtual Everest, terrifyingly
steep; a floor-level view of bathroom tiles with a trail of muddy
footprints suggested both a baby about to crawl into them and the
sheer gooey mess of early childhood.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BROOKINE, Mass.: ... early childhood.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long exposures his works require turn humble objects into
testaments to the passage of time. ``It's part of being a lapsed
Catholic,'' he jokes. ``Exposures of five to six minutes are my
hair shirt. I'm impatient; the waiting settles me down.'' In the
San Diego show catalog, curator Diana Gaston writes of the effect
of time in Morell's ``Water Pouring Out of a Pot'': ``An otherwise
ordinary stream of water becomes a weighty column, achieving its
shape over the course of a five-minute exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes is nothing, though, compared with the eight hours
Morell's camera obscura works take. The principle of the camera
obscura is that if all light is blocked from a box except for a
tiny hole in one side, the image of the exterior world will pass
through that hole and appear on the opposite side of the box _
upside down. The device dates back to Leonardo, possibly even to
Aristotle. Morell uses it to create an eight-hour record of
shifting clouds and perambulating people, like Warhol's famous
six-hour film of someone sleeping, but condensed into a single
image.
</P>
<P>
   It's photography at its most basic, which pleases Morell. ``Most
of what I do, anyone can,'' he says. ``I'm 50. If I were 20, I'd
feel forced to master all this digital stuff.'' He regularly
delights a lot of 20-year-olds with the camera obscura technique,
though, which he demonstrates each semester to his Mass. Art
students, turning a classroom into a giant example. ``They're
astonished,'' he says. ``They don't expect it, as much as I prepare
them. They say things like, `Oh, my God, it's in color! People are
moving! It's like doing card tricks for your kids.' '' When the
results are shown in galleries, people tend to list while looking
at them, Morell says, as if they wanted to stand on their head.
</P>
<P>
   The purest and most transparent of the camera obscura pieces is
the 1991 ``Light Bulb,'' an ode to photography's origins, an
entirely visual explanation of how the camera obscura works. A
light bulb shines outside the hole cut in a cardboard box. A dim
bulb appears inside, inverted. When viewers look at it, a light
bulb goes on in their heads, with an ``aah!'' of recognition. On
one occasion, Morell turned a room in his house into a camera
obscura and his family settled in to watch this homemade theater,
like a '50s family in a car at a drive-in. The neighborhood
appeared on the living room wall, upside down. ``It was slightly
perverse,'' says Morell, ``like being peeping Toms.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole Morell family occasionally collaborate on a piece.
``Sometimes I even pay the kids,'' he says. In the 1994 ``Laura and
Brady in the Shadow of Our House,'' shot from a third-floor window,
the two children lie sleeping on the ground, in the shadow of a
house defined by its roof line. Using sticks, Morell and his wife
drew windows and doors. The children look like they're floating,
weightless. ``It's like Chagall,'' says their father. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Compared with Hopper &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Often, though, his photographs are unpopulated. Their lonely
stillness has been compared with that in the paintings of Edward
Hopper. ``I think I'm as good as Hopper,'' Morell says, quickly
adding, ``That's a joke.'' On the hierarchy that still ranks
painting above photography, he adds, ``It's not a concern to me,
politically. But if I'd been segregated and only shown in the
context of photography, I'd resent it. That's happened to some
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Morell also photographs other art, transforming its context. In
residencies at the Boston Athenaeum and the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum, he's photographed artbooks and paintings, using odd
vantage points to create sly commentaries. He shows the shifty-eyed
subject of Raphael's ``Portrait of Ingharami'' reproduced in a book
open at a 45-degree angle, then photographs the real painting with
Ingharami's face confined to a corner, as if it's going to drop out
of the picture. Odd perspectives have been a specialty all along:
In ``Looking Down _ Miami 1974,'' a precipitous balcony view
resulted in a shot with a head popping up from the bottom and legs
coming down from the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking Down'' was made after Morell dropped out of Bowdoin.
(He eventually returned to graduate.) He migrated to Miami, took a
job as a janitor, and started photographing the Cuban exile
experience. But, he says, ``I've tried not to be labeled `The Cuban
Photographer.' I came to the US to be free. Some contemporary Latin
American artists make pictures of peasants holding skulls,
specifically targeted to the Yankee market. That's not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Play with scale is part of his fun. So it's no wonder that
Morell would turn his talents to that masterpiece of surreal scale,
Lewis Carroll's ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.'' His new
version, just published by Dutton, is an homage to the original
illustrator, Sir John Tenniel, and a continuation of Morell's
art-about-art and art-about-books. He photographed Tenniel's
figures, then, as if they were paper dolls, put them in new
settings. ``I used books as the architecture of the story,'' he
explains. ``I had a dream where the hole Alice goes down was a hole
in a book.'' So he drilled a hole in a picturesque leatherbound
tome and photographed it. He acknowledges that harming a book is,
to some, ``a violation, something naughty.'' But in a world
routinely scandalized by the Mapplethorpes of the field, Morell's
``naughtiness'' seems downright quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Morell is a big Wallace Stevens fan, and his show's catalog
opens with a quote from the poet's ``The Planet on the Table'':
``His self and the sun were one / And his poems, although makings
of his self / Were no less makings of the sun.'' To Morell, the
lines summarize his search for a place in a world he wasn't born
into, a search accomplished through art. ``It's through looking at
the outside world,'' he says, ``that you reckon with the things
inside you.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(``ABELARDO MORELL AND THE CAMERA EYE'' is at the Museum of Fine
Arts, from Wednesday through April 1. On March 24 at 7:30 p.m., in
Remis Auditorium, Morell gives a slide talk, ``A Picture Account,''
about his work. Admission is $9 for museum members; $12 for
non-members. Call 369-3306 for tickets.)

   NEW RELEASES: ``Snake Eyes'' _ Ever since Nicolas Cage won the
best-actor Oscar for ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' he's been on the
Stallone road to nowhere (unless, of course, you consider the bank
an appropriate destination). This outing with Brian De Palma at the
helm is another failed action movie with a great title and little
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday'' _ This low-key story about an old actress and a
homeless man whom she mistakes for a film director is marvelously
understated. Though flawed, the characters never look for pity, and
by the film's conclusion they've risen above our stereotypes and
achieved true artistry.

A MOTHER'S FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 1:37 a.m. The small apartment, jammed with playpens,
swings, and toys, throbs with the incessant, urgent cries of a
baby. A frazzled new mother, wild with frustration, begs her
husband to take their wailing daughter out of her sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie, I'm losing it, I swear to God,'' the sleep-deprived
young woman hisses. ``I swear I can understand child abuse now. I
can picture myself just throwing her out the (expletive) window!''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Savoca gets downright giddy talking about that moment
midway through her latest film, ``The 24-Hour Woman.'' She calls it
``a universal truth'' that Savoca, a mother of three, has
experienced in her own life, and knows resonates with millions of
other parents, especially mothers.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, it should be approved as a form of birth
control.
</P>
<P>
   But Savoca insists this scene from her film, which she describes
as ``a real-life comedy,'' isn't meant to steer anyone away from
parenthood. She simply wanted to tell a warts-and-all story of a
woman trying to balance having a career, a child, and a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to scare people off. I just like the idea of
reality,'' said Savoca, during a recent visit to Boston. ``Really,
it's about creating empathy. It's about saying, `Hey, this is your
life up here.' Every parent understands the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 24-Hour Woman,'' which opens Friday, stars Rosie Perez as
Grace Santos, producer of a daily morning show in New York which
serves as the film's title. She's married to the show's co-host,
the unbelievably handsome Eddie (Diego Serrano), an aspiring actor.
It's a pressure-cooker life of Nielsen ratings, deadlines, and
everything that can unravel during a live television show.
</P>
<P>
   Into this whirlpool comes Grace's pregnancy, which is announced
on the air by Eddie's bubbly co-host Margo (Karen Duffy).
Immediately the program's executive producer Joan (Patti LuPone)
sees it as a grab for ratings. She wants the pregnancy tracked on
the air, from weekly weigh-ins to dire predictions from experts
ticking off all that can go wrong during childbirth. Even better,
at least as far as Joan is concerned, is the baby's November due
date, smack dab in the middle of an all-important television sweeps
month.
</P>
<P>
   Once her daughter Lily is born, Grace finds herself alternately
overwhelmed with love for her baby, and just plain overwhelmed. On
the other side of the equation is Madeline (Marianne
Jean-Baptiste), who returns to the work force as Grace's assistant
after spending the past six years at home with her three children. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tale from a life &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Savoca calls her film ``an emotional autobiography,'' one that
has been brewing in her mind for years, its fibers and fables taken
from her own life.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular morning, Savoca got her kids off to school
before hopping into the family car with her husband and writing
partner, Richard Guay, to drive from their Rockland County, N.Y.,
home for a day of interviews in Boston. They intended to be back
home by the time their children settled down to do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   Savoca still feels the nagging tug between her career, which has
yielded such films as ``True Love,'' ``Dogfight,'' and ``Household
Saints,'' and her children. It's an uneasy sensation that never
really subsides or ebbs, a knife edge of guilt along which most
parents precariously tread.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The 24-Hour Woman'' is a mother's film. The struggles of
parenthood are viewed mainly through Grace's eyes and experiences,
although Savoca rejects calling her work ``a women's film.'' That's
one of the reasons she wanted the film to be a comedy, instead of a
heavy feminist tome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought these things we talk about would be so painful and
embarrassing that I felt I should make it comedy,'' Savoca said.
``We could laugh through it, but we could still keep it real. I
always saw it as a comedy. The stuff happening emotionally is taken
very seriously and realistically, and I think good comedy is
usually born of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also thought making it heavy would make it melodramatic, and
I don't like melodrama,'' Savoca said. ``I was just fearful that
making it heavy would turn off people. I didn't want it to be a
woman's film with a capital W; this is a human thing, a
straight-across-the-board thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What Savoca didn't want to make was a film about a struggling
father. Been there in ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' and ``Kramer vs. Kramer,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been done. It's guys trying to figure out how to make the
father in them to come out. It was also annoying to me when we went
looking for money, and people said, `Well, didn't you see `Baby
Boom'?'' said Savoca, referring to the 1987 comedy that starred
Diane Keaton as a career woman who inherits a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Both films ``lightly touch on the same subject, and everything
else is so different,'' she said. ``Grace isn't a woman without an
ounce of maternal instinct. `Baby Boom' was about a woman who was
so careerist, she could put a diaper on the baby's head. This is
about someone who is sort of ambivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the film, Grace and Eddie discuss why they want to be
parents _ or at least they make an attempt. When Eddie asks Grace
to name three reasons that she wants to be a mom, she can't come up
with one, let alone three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace doesn't know, because I don't know,'' said Savoca, with
a hearty laugh. ``Why did I have three kids, why not one? Wanting a
baby is an irrational thing. It's something you either want to do
or you don't want to do. It's one of those mysteries of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the Bronx, where she was born 39 years ago, Savoca
always knew she wanted to be a wife and a mother. Raised in a Latin
household _ Savoca is half-Italian, half-Argentine _ she was
brought up with the image of the mother as ``the beginning, the
end, the center of all things.'' It wasn't until the 1970s when she
realized that there were opportunities for females beyond the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you see Mary Tyler Moore on TV, and you think, `Hey, I
could be that,' '' Savoca said. ``And those things collide, and no
one gives us the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   From its earliest version, Savoca knew she wanted the lead
character to be a Latin woman. (The film is dedicated to her late
mother, Maria Elvira Savoca.) ``On a purely personal
gut-instinctual level, I knew I could write this character if she
came from that background.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the script was done, friends and potential backers
suggested she change the character's ethnicity to something more
``universal'' _ meaning, of course, white. For a year, Savoca
peddled her script with its Latina lead, and found no takers.
Fearing the film would never be made, she tried to compromise. She
changed Grace Santos's name to something more Anglo-acceptable. She
yanked every cultural reference, every abuelita, every mira. She
pulled the savory colloquialism, and every song by Joe Cuba and
Celia Cruz. By Savoca's own description, the character was ``whited
out,'' and the filmmaker lapsed into an ``angry, depressed
period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People said, `It's still funny,' but for me it was flat,''
Savoca recalled. ``I didn't understand who she was, and I didn't
understand her reason for being the way she was.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Perez to the rescue &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While auditioning white actresses for the lead, Savoca offered
the smaller role of a Puerto Rican secretary to Perez. She
declined, and told Savoca, `No, thanks, I've done that role
before.'' But Perez asked to be considered for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Once Perez got the part, Savoca knew she could make the film she
originally envisioned. But some questioned the casting of Perez,
who is best known for her high-pitched, shade-throwin' homegirl
persona in such films as ``White Men Can't Jump'' and ``Do the
Right Thing.'' But Perez is also an Academy Award-nominated actress
for her role in the 1993 drama ``Fearless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the shoot I kept thinking I needed to talk to Rosie
about what her accent will be like, although I felt uncomfortable
about it,'' Savoca said. ``But I didn't need to do anything. For
Rosie this was always about Grace. She's a very smart, well-trained
actress.''
</P>
<P>
   Savoca's next project is a film biography of Janis Joplin, which
will likely star Lili Taylor, who worked with the filmmaker on
``Dogfight'' and ``Household Saints.'' The film is in the planning
stage, although she has secured use of Joplin's recording from her
estate. (There's also a big-budget Hollywood film on the legendary
singer in the pipeline, which Savoca refers to as ``that other
movie.'')
</P>
<P>
   For now, Savoca is doing what she has done for much of her adult
life _ juggling her career and family life, and trying to find
moments of solace and sanity in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of balancing a personal life with any kind of
professional life is a big overall theme for a lot of people,'' she
said. ``When people watch this movie, they ask, `How can she still
work?' It's simple _ because I still work, because many women still
work. And, you know what? We still love our kids.''

FRUSTRATINGLY, LEONARD'S `COOL' NEVER HEATS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BE COOL 
By Elmore Leonard 
Delacorte, 292 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elmore Leonard is unquestionably one of the finest crime and
action writers of our time. In three dozen novels over 45 years, he
has repeatedly given us characters and situations and shadings that
felt so real it seemed he was merely recording them, not inventing
them.
</P>
<P>
   That's why ``Be Cool,'' his follow-up to the highly successful
``Get Shorty,'' is so disappointing, and annoying, and puzzling.
Too many of these people, beginning with the once-cool Chili
Palmer, say and do things worthy of freshman English, not the
acknowledged master. And at times, it almost seems Leonard is doing
it on purpose. On the second page, Palmer says ``I was against
doing a sequel to begin with,'' and by the end, the obvious
inference is that character was speaking for the author.
</P>
<P>
   In that opening scene, Palmer is lunching with longtime pal
Tommy Athens, another former criminal who has gone legit _ or as
legit as Leonard considers the entertainment business to be _ but
this time it's music, not the movies. They're talking about ``Get
Leo,'' the movie that got made in ``Get Shorty,'' and about ``Get
Lost,'' the movie sequel that we learn bombed after ``Get Shorty''
ended. Independent of each other, they have similar ideas for
Palmer's next movie: It's ``Get Leo'' all over again, but set in
the music business.
</P>
<P>
   Chili gets up to go to the men's room, and just as he's
returning, the well-known black sedan pulls up and Athens is blown
to kingdom come. A friend of maybe 30 years has just been slain
before his eyes, but as he's heading to the police station for
questioning, Palmer's thinking of the scene that just happened,
``starting to rewrite it in his mind, the guy playing Tommy no
longer the lead. You can't have the star get popped ten minutes
into the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's how ``Be Cool'' unfolds, not as all-but-real
renderings of people worth caring about, but as a series of test
scenes for slick Chili's next movie.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was the first reason to love ``Get Shorty'': He was hard
but smooth, a guy who worked the angles but didn't hurt anyone who
didn't deserve it. This time, Leonard has left the likable patina,
but has changed Palmer into a pontificating manipulator who creates
circumstances to see how his ``characters'' will react, to see how
his movie would go next. ``So you have to know your characters, I
mean intimately. . . . Once you know who they are, they let you
know what the story is,'' he tells Athens before the hit.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know which is more repulsive, a guy who callously
pulls strings in the lives of people who trust him so he can study
plot effect, or a guy who goes around spouting lines like that.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Be Cool'' becomes a movie, it could provide fodder for
film-school study, but in the don't-do-this category. There is the
helpful cop cliche, for example: Darryl Holmes, the detective
assigned to the slaying, starts with Palmer as a suspect, but
quickly becomes his inside man, calling him whenever there's a
development, taking him on stakeouts, disturbing a crime scene
because Palmer really wants him to. But it's not totally
unbelievable: When it is evident that Palmer manipulated some
murderous gangsta rappers into a shootout with some murderous
Russian mobsters, and when Palmer unrepentently sasses Holmes about
it, at least Holmes raises an eyebrow before handing over more
confidential police information.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, ``Be Cool'' has at least flashes of the Leonard
we love, particularly in some of his observations from inside the
music business. We learn all we need to about Derek Stones, a minor
rocker, when Chili says, ``All you'll get out of Derek is a better
understanding of Beavis and Butt-head.'' And Leonard riffs
amusingly on what to call what we hear on the radio: One group is
described as doing ``sort of a low-fi indie pop, just left of
alternative center.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the film _ oops, book _ is set entirely on the West
Coast, it has a couple of Massachusetts ties. Linda Moon, the band
at the center of Palmer's move into record producing, is based on
the Stone Coyotes, a Greenfield, Mass., band that Leonard saw one
night in LA.
</P>
<P>
   Even more juicy is an encounter between Linda Moon and
Aerosmith. Tyler, Perry, et al., have actual speaking parts,
apparently an outgrowth of a friendship struck when they met up
with Leonard on the road in Detroit. The no-longer-Bad Boys recall
the days of destroying hotel rooms with chainsaws, and advise Linda
not to ``turn over your power to managers.'' That and ``don't let
them take the fun out of it'' are certainly allusions to their
falling out with ex-manager Tim Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, these points of interest are lost in this sea of
contrivance, and they didn't have to be. Early on, Palmer tells
Linda, ``A sequel has to be better'n the original or it's not gonna
work'' _ proving Leonard knew it all along, and could have spared
us.

SPY VS. SPY VS. SPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE HAUNTED WOOD 
Soviet Espionage in America _ The Stalin Era 
By Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev. Random House. 402 pp.
Illustrated. $30. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of the dozens of Americans who passed secrets to the Soviet
Union before World War II apparently did so for ideological and
philosophical reasons, not monetary ones. Often drawn from the
ranks of privileged intellectuals, American informants in the 1930s
and '40s trafficked in heady infatuation with Moscow's communist
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Dickstein was an exception. A New York Democrat in
Congress who worked early on to root out Nazi sympathizers,
Dickstein ran a lucrative trade in illegal visas for Soviet
operatives before brashly offering to spy for the NKVD, the KGB's
precursor, in return for cash. To wheeler-dealer Dickstein, to whom
the Soviets assigned the code name ``Crook,'' green, not red, was
the motivating factor.
</P>
<P>
   Dickstein's tale, new in the literature on Americans who spied
for the Soviet Union, is among the shortest and most startling in
``The Haunted Wood,'' a new investigation by American historian
Allen Weinstein and Russian spy-turned-journalist Alexander
Vassiliev. Over 1993-'95, the authors had unparalleled access to
selected, never-before-seen KGB files. Based on that research, they
have compiled a selective account of what they term ``the golden
age'' of Soviet espionage in the United States, casting new light
upon Moscow's intelligence machine from 1933 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh elements of cloak-and-dagger make cameo appearances
throughout this highly detailed, dense narrative. Martha Dodd
Stern, the comely and capricious daughter of President Roosevelt's
ambassador to Hitler's Germany, launches a love affair with a
Soviet diplomat in Berlin right under her father's eyes, becoming
``courtesan, agent, and student of communism.'' Years later she and
her husband, the financier Alfred Stern, flee suspicious US
officials for permanent exile in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   There are others. Hollywood con artist Boris Morros, a
fast-talking film producer-director who strings the Soviets along
by name-dropping Washington connections while two-timing as an FBI
double agent, played a melodramatic, flamboyant role that exceeded
his bit part in the film industry. His achievements _ installing a
Russian spy in Paramount's Berlin office, for example _ seem small.
One wonders why this windbag so interested his handlers, until one
recalls the central role played by film in the Soviet propaganda
machine, a cultural feature that may have led Moscow to keep up
ties with Morros.
</P>
<P>
   Better-known American spies _ Alger Hiss, Whittaker Chambers,
and Laurence Duggan among them _ are detailed, with fresh light
cast on their evident guilt. At the same time, the authors saw NKVD
documents suggesting that Robert Oppenheimer, the American
physicist, was a ``secret member of the compatriot organization
(the American Communist Party)'' _ and nothing more. Weinstein and
Vassiliev note that despite vigorous efforts by Moscow to
infiltrate America's bomb-making program, there is no evidence to
suggest that the father of the Manhattan Project spied for the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Though not the first to do so, the two authors describe how the
NKVD, which carried out Stalin's purges, managed to contribute to
its own demise. Many of the organization's US-based Russian
operatives were recalled to Moscow and then exiled or shot, the
victims of a highly paranoid organization that saw traitors
everywhere. The suspicion extended to American operatives, too _
and sometimes justifiably so. By 1945, Elizabeth Bentley, a Vassar
graduate, had shifted her allegiance from the NKVD to the FBI, so
scaring the Soviets that they immediately shut down virtually all
of their underground US operations.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is obvious: In Weinstein's and Vassiliev's hands, much
of what has been alleged or suspected about Americans working for
the Soviets becomes highly probable. Yet by the time of the
McCarthy-era trials in the early 1950s, the Soviet spying machine
was in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Readers should not expect elegantly written, well-paced
narrative in ``The Haunted Wood.'' While the book is essential,
pathbreaking reading for anyone interested in Soviet espionage, it
is a trove of data and direct quotation from KGB files, and not a
fluid, readerly text.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authors gained access to certain Venona cables _ US
intelligence decryptions of coded Soviet diplomatic telegrams _
that in some cases corroborate the KGB files, lacunae abound. How
complete and unvarnished a tale do the files selected by the
cash-strapped SVR for Weinstein and Vassiliev's perusal actually
tell? The men write that ``Russian intelligence agencies received
substantial and sometimes critical information (including many
classified documents) concerning US government policies, its
confidential negotiating strategies and secret weapons
developments.'' Yet for all the detail in ``The Haunted Wood,'' it
is often unclear how much damage some of its characters actually
did. One exception is Harold Glasser, a US Treasury Department
official (code-named Ruble) who passed scores of key State
Department and Treasury policy documents to Soviet intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Vassiliev and Weinstein (who probed some of these issues in his
``Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case'') do not claim to have closed
the book on the nature and extent of Soviet spy operations. Until
more US and Russian intelligence files are opened and examined,
``The Haunted Wood'' will stand as a new and important chapter in
the literature of Soviet espionage, and not a final account.

FLOWER SEASON JUST AROUND THE CORNER, SHOWS REMIND US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure signs of spring are the many flower shows blossoming around
the country. And two of the best shows, the largest and the oldest,
are in Boston and Philadelphia, respectively. It's time to sow your
travel plans to greet spring.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Spring Flower Show in Boston is the third
largest in the world and will have a theme of Artistry in the
Garden with 40 landscaped gardens on display. The show at the
Bayside Expo Center, March 13 to 21, also will feature a number of
special events and presentations. For information on the 128th
gardening showcase, call 617-536-9280.
</P>
<P>
   Among displays will be one with favorite scenes from the classic
children's stories by Beatrix Potter of ``Peter Rabbit and
Friends''; another, a ``living'' room of furnishings made from
living plant material, will have some technological surprises; and
a third display will be an ``inspirational garden'' that might have
inspired composers of 19th-century music.
</P>
<P>
   Call the Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau (888-SEE BOSTON)
for information on hotel packages to the show. Adult tickets are
$16 weekends, $14 weekdays, with discounted weekday tickets
available at Stop &AMP; Shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Flower Show, March 7-14, is the largest single
destination event in the city. The Philadelphia show, the largest
in the world, is almost twice the size of the Boston show, its
theme will be ``Design on Nature . . . The Art of Gardening,''
recognizing the idealized natural visions of 19th-century American
Romantics.
</P>
<P>
   It will be held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center and also
will feature special presentations, Tea Time, and even a gardener's
playstation.
</P>
<P>
   Among displays will be 12 ``micro'' gardens, and four settings
inspired by the formal gardens of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation _ one of the gardens captures the elaborate
magnificence of the Kykuit gardens at the Rockefeller Mansion along
the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Since Philadelphia's show is downtown, visitors can receive free
same day reentry, allowing them to explore the city, then return to
the show. The show is $18 weekends, $16 weekdays. The city goes all
out for Flower Show Week and offers a free Bouquet Book filled with
discounts and special events (available at the show or by calling
215-988-8899). For information on hotel packages that include show
tickets, call 800-380-4683.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows feature extensive displays of products and plants to
purchase. For out-of-town visitors to these shows, when calling for
hotel packages ask about any discounted transportation deals.
American Airlines has a $99 companion fare from anywhere in the
continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among other garden shows upcoming is the Rhode Island Flower
Show, Feb. 18-21, at the Rhode Island Convention Center in
Providence.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 of southern New England's top garden designers,
horticulturists, and landscape architects will have exhibits
ranging from a spectacular Victorian greenhouse to an urban pet
garden, which suggests ways humans and canines can share outdoor
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   For show information, call 800-766-1670. For information on
discounted hotel packages, call the Providence/Warwick Convention &AMP;

<P>
   With Valentine's Day still in mind, it's nice to know that love
and humor can help you weather the most difficult times _ even when
those times are part of your honeymoon. Just ask these people, who
entered the fifth annual Thrifty Car Rental Honeymoon Disasters
Contest:
</P>
<P>
   --Paul and Leah Lusk of Sugar City, Idaho. Their trip to Nevada
was cut short when their car spun out of control, flipped, and
became submerged in flood waters. After hitting his head, Paul
couldn't remember the accident, recognize his bride, or recall that
they were newly married.
</P>
<P>
   --Kim and John Cross of Pittsburgh. John's new mother-in-law
joined them on their car trip to the beach. After an hour in the
car, Mom made them turn back when she realized she'd forgotten to
feed the cat. (Turned out she had fed him after all). At a
restaurant 40 miles out of their way, they stopped so Mom could
stick to her strict dietary regimen. And that's when the car got
stolen.

   --Joe and Veronica Frattaioli of Akron, Ohio. Their cruise
featured a tropical storm that made all of the passengers seasick.
And then there was the theft of Joe's wallet and ``green card'' to
let him back into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   --Allan and Skylar Stone of Chickasha, Okla. When Allan ran out
of money in Cozumel, Mexico, he didn't tell his wife he'd hocked
his wedding ring for $25 to pay a cab driver. Several days later,
he paid twice as much to get the ring back. Now that's devotion!

FIDELITY TO ADD SPECIALTIES TO ON-LINE TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ More of the thrills, fewer of the spills.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to tap into the growing popularity of on-line stock
trading while avoiding cyberinvesting's newly tarnished image,
Fidelity Investments is gearing up to offer some of the specialized
services more commonly found at fast-paced Internet-only brokerages
and so-called ``day trading'' shops.
</P>
<P>
   With investors flocking to the Web to buy and sell shares,
Fidelity's moves, still under wraps, are likely to shake up the
on-line investing boom and spark a new wave of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The new services Fidelity is eyeing might seem obscure:
real-time account balance updates; free, unlimited real-time stock
quotes; and souped-up market feeds, known as Nasdaq Level 2, that
show not just live prices but also buyers' and sellers' identities
and positions.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is better known as the nation's biggest mutual fund
firm than as the second-biggest discount stock brokerage. As an
on-line investing shop, it is less prominent.
</P>
<P>
   But in a world where one in four retail stock trades is now made
on line, and where on-line customers trade more frequently than
those who use a traditional bricks-and-mortar brokerage, Fidelity
now sees such tools as key in the battle for cyberinvestors.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking is that such investing weapons are usually
found not at the on-line brokerage units of full-service mutual
fund firms such as Fidelity or Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., but at
hundreds of smaller, Web-only shops including ETrade and Datek, a
scrappy outfit more akin to a day-trading firm.
</P>
<P>
   Such upstart Web brokerages are, of course, synonymous with more
than advanced tools and cut-rate prices. In recent weeks, they have
had embarrassing power outtages, software glitches, and price
delays resulting in trades costing customers tens of thousands of
extra dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil has bruised the already rough-and-tumble world of
on-line investing. But it has also highlighted how a new generation
of shops now dominates cyberinvesting, wielding tools and services
not yet offered by traditional firms such as Boston-based Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fidelity is going for the high-end on-line trader but also the
active traders'' who often frequent Web-based brokerages, said Bill
Burnham, an electronic commerce analyst at CS First Boston. ``They
clearly intend to build a big business.''
</P>
<P>
   With 1.8 million on-line brokerage accounts, Fidelity has 9.4
percent of all on-line trades, ranking fifth behind pioneer Schwab
(the first-place leader, with 29 percent of the market) and
Web-based firms Waterhouse Securities, ETrade, and Datek, according
to Gomez Advisors Inc, a consulting firm in Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity won't say exactly when it plans to launch its new
services, which will be closely watched by rivals. But persons
familiar with the firm's plans said Fidelity would unveil things in
the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to be specific, a Fidelity executive offered a
glimpse into the fund behemoth's view of cyberinvesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The on-line investing industry is going toward beefing up the
non-price aspects of their offerings,'' said Matthew Sadler, a
Fidelity senior vice president in charge of brokerage services.
``It is clearly evident that all on-line investors are not entirely
price elastic,'' Sadler said. ``There are other elements that are
critical to them, like service, reliability, tools, certain aspects
of information, and customization. ''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's new services target its 36,000 most-active on-line
clients. Trading at least 36 times a year, that top 2 percent of
Fidelity on-line customers already accounts for the bulk of the
firm's on-line transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity also wants to cut costs by having regular brokerage
customers do business on line rather than in person at a Fidelity
branch. While on-line investing constitutes less than 10 percent of
Fidelity's overall revenues, according to broad estimates, getting
brokerage customers to convert to cyberinvesting would give
Fidelity a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Since Fidelity's retail brokerage holds around 15 percent of the
firm's total $750 billion in assets, there is plenty of profit to
be made in directing that business on line as well as in attracting
new customers, according to Cerulli &AMP; Associates, a financial
services consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity earns a flat commission each time a client buys or
sells a stock on line. Its lowest rate is $14.95 for customers
trading at least 12 times a year. (Deep-discount shops like
Ameritrade charge $8 a trade, while Schwab charges a flat $29.95).
Fidelity also earns interest on money on-line clients borrow from
Fidelity to buy stocks, as well as fees from the cash clients keep
in Fidelity money-market funds to finance stock purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 18 months, Fidelity won new on-line customers by
revamping commission rates to make things cheaper for heavy traders
and more costly for dabblers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the firm increasingly views souped-up investing tools _
along with its investment research and improved, user-friendly Web
site _ as the lure to getting active traders to buy and sell more.
It recently added on-line bill payment features. Last month, it
introduced ``InstantBroker'' two-way pagers allowing clients to
make instant trades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry analysts said Fidelity had not ruled out another
pricing revamp, a move that would prompt responses from at least
some competitors. Said a top Fidelity executive recently: ``There
are ways to change the pricing system without instituting a pricing
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is not courting fly-by-night day-traders (at Fidelity,
such clients number only in the hundreds). On the other end, it is
closely watching the impending foray of powerhouse firms into
on-line trading, especially Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the nation's
largest stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   But with the number of Internet brokerage accounts to grow 40
percent this year to 10.5 million, according to Gomez, Fidelity is
keenly aware of the competitive threat posed by a new slew of
smaller, on-line shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``ETrade is a viable competitor of ours,'' said Fidelity's
Sadler, a former Schwab on-line executive. ``The game is very
different in the discount brokerage world now.''

STATE STREET OVERTAKES BANKBOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They're number two!
</P>
<P>
   With barely a notice, State Street Corp. has eclipsed BankBoston
Corp. to become Boston's second most-valuable public financial
services company, trailing only Fleet Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   It happened for the first time months ago and has not been the
case every day since. But the value of State Street's stock has
exceeded that of BankBoston during the vast majority of that time.
As of Monday, Wall Street valued State Street at $11.5 billion,
about $900 million more than BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   That says something about BankBoston, which only a decade ago
was still New England's undisputed banking leader. It says even
more about State Street, which has been known for most of its 200
years as a tony but second-tier bank.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the triumph of the fee model. State Street has been
transformed for years now, by decisions made even earlier, to wade
into the back-shop world of securities processing and caretaking
for giant institutional investors. Only about a tenth of its money
is made today from the conventional banking business of earning an
interest rate spread between borrowing and lending.
</P>
<P>
   State Street still trails BankBoston in many ways. The most
important: BankBoston remains a lot more profitable. BankBoston
earned $792 million even after some special expenses last year,
while State Street made $436 million.
</P>
<P>
   But State Street has convinced Wall Street its kind of business
is more valuable. Its shares are priced at about 24 times earnings
expected for 1999, within a whisker of the earnings multiple
awarded Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stocks and much more than the 13 to
15 multiple of a typical commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's stock trades at just over 11 times earnings, dead
last among the 24 big stocks in the Keefe Breyette &AMP; Woods Bank
Index. The weakness in comparison to other commercial banks is
mostly a reflection of investor fears over the Latin American
economies where BankBoston does business.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston stock could bounce back with a South American revival
(it was worth 60 percent more just seven months ago) and possibly
become more valuable than State Street again, at least for a while.
But a gap in earnings multiples that drastically favors State
Street stock is unlikely to disappear and makes the outcome of any
long-term value comparison almost certain.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that State Street's fee business is more predictable,
though that helps. It isn't even because the fee business is a lot
less risky way to make a buck than lending money, though that helps
a lot.
</P>
<P>
   State Street's real blessing is that it decided to serve a
business with a truly explosive growth rate. As mutual funds and
other institutions built up trillions of dollars under management,
State Street prospered with them.
</P>
<P>
   State Street's earnings per share have grown at 16 percent,
compounded annually, for the last 15 years. Chief financial officer
Ronald O'Kelley says State Street researched every stock with a
beginning market value of at least $200 million that had earnings
in each of those same 15 years and found only two companies that
did better: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   State Street executives insist they barely noticed that their
company's shares became more valuable than those at BankBoston, an
unlikely claim meant to emphasize a point. State Street doesn't
think of itself as a bank at all and would dearly like to break
away from any such comparison.
</P>
<P>
   As much of a premium as State Street stock wins compared to
other banks, it's not doing nearly so well in other leagues. State
Street wants to be thought of as an information technology company
and, in that field, it would be cheap.
</P>
<P>
   State Street executives would much rather compare themselves to
Automatic Data Processing Inc. than BankBoston, or to Electronic
Data Systems Inc. rather than Fleet. ADP shares sell for 36 times
earnings. EDS, which has been under pressure lately, sells for
nearly 26 times profits.
</P>
<P>
   O'Kelley said State Street is attracting a following among stock
analysts besides the usual bank-research crowd, like information
technology analyst Patrick Burton of Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   State Street's fee-based business neatly avoids the lending
risks that go with economic cycles, but it is saddled with another
kind of uncertainty: technology investment cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing when to plow money into new equipment, how much to
spend, and what to choose are big-ticket decisions for companies
like State Street. Bad timing or bad choices can be a disaster.
Even the good decisions are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   State Street estimates it will have spent $200 million on Year
2000 expenses before it is done, an investment it has yet to recoup
in its normal course of business.
</P>
<P>
   The company faced a less expensive problem when the Euro was
born on New Year's Day, but State Street still had to pull 4,000
Boston-area employees into the office over that weekend to convert
all its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the rewards, it's not such a bad risk to take.

 &LR; When it comes to milk, not many of us search out brands. It's such
a staple ingredient that we tend to buy whatever's available at our
neighborhood market _ which is frequently a house brand _ or we may
just buy what's on sale.
</P>
<P>
   But according to today's tasting panel, different brands of milk
taste distinctively different. The panel tasted nine brands of
whole milk (the results of a nonfat-milk tasting will be published
in an upcoming issue), and scores varied a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists agreed that their taste in milk comes from personal
preference. Some like mild flavors; others like stronger, grassier
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors went to &UR; Lucerne  &LR; (1/2 gallon, $2.20 at Safeway),
which scored high enough to make the Hall of Fame for products
earning 80 points or more. One panelist gave it a perfect score of
20 and called it ``picture perfect for taste.'' Three others
particularly liked the rich, creamy flavor, but another panelist
thought it tasted too sweet. Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Clover Stornetta &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $1.89 at Whole Foods) took
second place. One panelist labeled it thin and plain-tasting, and
another detected a slight bitter aftertaste. But three liked the
flavor and richness. Four would buy it; one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Castle Creamery  &LR; (1/2 gallon, $2.29 at Andronico's) scored just
three points lower. Panelists picked up both buttery and nutty
flavors. Two would buy it, and three might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Berkeley Farms &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $2.09-$2.29
at many supermarkets). Three panelists complained that it wasn't as
rich as other brands, but they liked the flavor. One panelist
described the taste as ``bland and thin without much character.''
Three would buy it, one might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dairy Glen  &LR; (1 gallon, $3.67 at Safeway) came in a close fifth.
Three panelists noted a slight grassy taste, but another thought it
was rich, with good flavors. One would buy it, three might and one
would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were divided on  &UR; Straus &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $3.29 at many
supermarkets), which was also the most expensive brand tasted. Two
panelists thought it had an off flavor, and another described the
taste as ``mineral.'' But one panelist liked its character, and
another thought it was less sweet and easier to drink than the
other brands. Two would buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Three brands scored too low to rate: Horizon, Sunnyside and
Michael's Organic.

HEALTH CLUB IN HOT WATER OVER FAT AD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A health club is defying protests and refusing
to budge from its new advertisement that suggests that overweight
people will be the first to be devoured by hungry space aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The billboard for 24 Hour Fitness depicts an artist's vision of
a space alien and reads, ``When they come, they'll eat the fat ones
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics find the ad demeaning and took to the sidewalk in front
of one of the fitness chain's outlets Monday to show their
displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat me!'' the 30-some protesters in front of 24 Hour Fitness
at Van Ness Avenue and Post Street chanted as they held an aerobics
class and waved signs that read, ``Bite My Fat Alien Butt,'' and
``I'm Yummy.'' Some handed out lollipops.
</P>
<P>
   Passing motorists honked.
</P>
<P>
   But the company, apparently unmoved, said it had no plans to
change its advertisement, the opening piece in a still-unfolding ad
campaign with a humorous, sci-fi theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we know, obesity is one of the leading causes of health
care costs in our society. It's no laughing matter at all,'' said
Craig Pepin-Donat, northwest division president of 24 Hour Fitness,
a chain of 284 gyms based in Carlsbad, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, the company said there was no intention
to offend anyone with its ad.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizer Marilyn Wann of the National Association to
Advance Fat Acceptance said she laughed when she first learned of
the advertisement from a television station that called her up last
week to ask her about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I got really angry,'' said Wann, a San Francisco
resident who publishes a ``zine'' and is author of a book, both
called FAT!SO?, that use humor and entertainment to promote fat
acceptance. Her motto is: ``Life is too short for self-hatred and
celery sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Wann describes herself as weighing ``270 cute, luscious
pounds.'' Like most of the other protesters, she said she is active
and healthy, and resents being constantly told that there is
something wrong with being heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, how can I take this and say, `This is not cool,'
and also have fun?'' she said, describing how Monday's protest was
hatched. ``I thought it would be great to get a bunch of cool fat
people out on a beautiful day to have fun and hold up signs saying,
`Eat me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among the three dozen people who showed up for Monday's protest
was Wann's personal trainer, who specializes in training large
women. She led an aerobics class on the sidewalk and, later, on the
street's median strip.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't just the protesters who found the ad
objectionable. Several 24 Hour Fitness members entering and leaving
the Van Ness gym said they thought the ad went too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (club) should be here to support us,'' said Nancy Cook, a
member of the club who is not slender. ``To have a sign like that
is one more slap in the face.''

DIRTY HANDS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Now that the impeachment trial is over, is it possible to
pardon everyone involved in it? To pretend that it never happened
and go back to discussing tax cuts and Social Security?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately not. The principal actors all have dirty hands. To
put this mess behind us will require an election cycle or, more
likely, two.
</P>
<P>
   What should be the priority of Congress in the next two years?
The answer is campaign finance reform. Uncertainty over the next
election may block action on big issues like Social Security and
health care. Nothing else on the legislative agenda can compete.
Citizens are disgusted with the power of back-door money in
politics; even corporate America is alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers of newspaper ink have been spilled to describe the
various new specimens of political corruption in the 1996
presidential election, the first time the Democrats and Republicans
alike exploited the soft-money loophole in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money'' is that which is raised by the national political
parties on their own behalf _ as opposed to the ``hard money'' that
candidates raise themselves. The size of the latter is strictly
regulated by legislation enacted in the wake of the Watergate
scandal in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   On ``soft money,'' however, there are no limits. There haven't
been since the loophole was first seriously exploited in the
presidential election in 1988. The national parties then turn
around and spend the cash on ``issue ads'' on behalf of the
candidates, more or less the way the candidates would have spent it
on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money spending tripled in 1996. Illegal foreign donors
showed up in significant numbers for the first time, especially
Asians _ in addition to the usual corporations, rich people, and
labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment-minded Republicans _ and a few misguided reformers _
have been clamoring for Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint yet
another special prosecutor to examine the Democrats' fund-raising
practices, especially those of Vice President Al Gore. Wisely, Reno
refused. Another freelance moralist roaming over the Washington
landscape is not what America needs.
</P>
<P>
   What we need instead is the Shays-Meehan bill. This measure
would ban all soft money and apply to political parties and
independent groups the same stringent federal guidelines that now
regulate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsored by Representatives Christopher Shays, a Connecticut
Republican, and Marty Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, the bill
passed the House last summer by a strong majority of 252 to 179.
Sixty-one Republicans crossed over to vote with the majority,
petitioning House Speaker Newt Gingrich to compel a vote.
</P>
<P>
   It was then immediately sidetracked in the Senate by majority
leader Trent Lott, who bottled it up with the threat of filibuster.
The Republicans' drive toward an impeachment trial provided cover.
</P>
<P>
   But Senators John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Russell
Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, backers of a similar bill, have
promised to bring their measure up again. It's just possible
they'll have the 60 votes necessary to circumvent a filibuster. The
majority may remain in the House.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where House Speaker Dennis Hastert, an Illinois
Republican, comes in. The amiable former wrestling coach, who was
catapulted to prominence when Newt Gingrich and Bob Livingston
resigned the post in quick succession, told reporters earlier this
month that he wanted to keep campaign finance reform on the back
burner _ until health care, tax cuts, and Social Security issues
have been attended to. That's a polite way of saying ``Not if I can
help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Hastert and his allies succeed in blocking the nationwide
interest in campaign finance reform? That's the single most
interesting question in Washington after the impeachment trial.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS:  
 Aqua's Souffle Release the Power of Mussels  
   
   
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ No other seafood restaurant in the city can compare
with Aqua, and no other dish in the city can compete with the
delicious Black Mussel Souffle served from the day the restaurant
opened.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The texture is light and airy, but because of a wine and shallot
reduction and the seasoned mussels that are stirred into the rich
egg base, the flavors are intense. To add another layer of flavor,
there's a sauce made from cream and the reduced broth from the
mussels.
</P>
<P>
   While many people are afraid to tackle a souffle, this one is
practically foolproof. Even if it falls, the flavors will be just
as good. The souffle may be made in individual dishes or in a
single larger dish.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned that this recipe, while straightforward, will
probably use every pot in the kitchen and take a good hour to
prepare. It's well worth the effort, though. To minimize
last-minute preparations, you can complete the shallots, mussels
and souffle base an hour or so ahead. Whip the egg whites right
before baking.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Mussel Souffle is only one signature dish at the
restaurant, headed by Michael Mina. There's also a unique pairing
of tuna and foie gras, and a rich lobster pot pie that's served
tableside.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the expensive four-star food, there's a four-star
ambience. In fact, with its curved walls, high ceilings, dramatic
lighting and impressive profusion of 6-foot-high fresh flower
arrangements, Aqua is probably the most beautiful restaurant in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Aqua, 252 California St. (at Battery), San Francisco; (415) &LR; 
 &LR; 956-9662. Lunch weekdays; dinner Monday-Saturday.  &LR;

 &QL; 
 &UR; Ingredients: &QL;  &LR; 
Butter and flour for greasing souffle molds
</P>
<P>
   13 shallots
</P>
<P>
   5 garlic cloves, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   6 cups Chardonnay
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Prince Edward Island (black) mussels, scrubbed and
debearded
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch parsley, chopped
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Souffle Base: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   11/4 cups whole milk
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   6 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   10 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   Pinch cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Instructions: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375. Butter and flour 10 four-ounce souffle
dishes. (You may also use one large souffle dish, if desired.)
</P>
<P>
   Finely mince 8 of the shallots and place in a large saute pan.
Add the garlic and 2 cups of the Chardonnay. Simmer over medium
heat until the wine has cooked away and the mixture is almost dry.
This should take 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Mince the remaining 5 shallots. Heat the olive oil in a large
pot over high heat. Add the shallots and saute until translucent,
about 1 minute. Add the mussels, the remaining 4 cups wine and the
parsley. Cover and simmer until the mussels open, about 10 minutes.
Discard any unopened mussels.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the cooking liquid and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the mussels from their shells and finely chop. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the souffle base:  &LR; Bring the milk and butter to a boil
in a large saucepan. Add the flour, stirring constantly, until a
stiff batter forms. Reduce the heat and continue to cook and stir
for 5 to 7 minutes, until the mixture is smooth and shiny. Pour
into the bowl of an electric mixer and mix on low speed for 5
minutes, until the batter has cooled. Beat in the egg yolks 1 at a
time, then blend in the shallot reduction and the chopped mussels.
</P>
<P>
   Using an electric mixer on high speed, whip the egg whites with
the salt and cornstarch until they hold medium-firm peaks, about 5
to 7 minutes. Use a spatula to fold the whites into the souffle
base. Portion into the prepared souffle molds.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 25 minutes, or until the souffles are golden and rise
about 11/2 inches above the rim of the molds. If making one large
souffle, bake for approximately 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the sauce:  &LR; While the souffles are baking, place the
reserved mussel-cooking liquid in a medium saucepan over
medium-high heat and cook until reduced by half. This should take
10 to 15 minutes. Add the cream and reduce for another 5 to 10
minutes, until the sauce has thickened.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the souffles the moment they come from the oven, with the
warm sauce on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 10.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Intimations of mortality, hard to avoid at any funeral, were
inescapable at King Hussein's.
</P>
<P>
   The large and diverse collection of world leaders who came to
Amman this week to pay their respects to an extraordinary man
included the elderly, the frail and the one-man rulers of several
volatile places that have no constitutional line of succession.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, such as Syria's Hafez Assad and the Palestinians'
Yasser Arafat, combine in quite a perilous way all three
attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago King Hussein himself was in this bracket. He
caused consternation with his last despotic act, emerging from
hospital to sack Hassan, his brother and longtime heir, and replace
him with his soldier son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators, The Economist included, brooded on the safety-nets
that would have been afforded by a genuine constitutional monarchy,
the folly of making oneself indispensable _ and the added folly of
inadequate provision for succession.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the early signals from Amman are promising.
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral, heads were bowed in honor of a king whose warmth
of heart and spirit even enemies respected. The new successor
conducted himself impeccably and so, most honorably, did his uncle,
Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has few natural advantages _ a sandpit of a place lying
like a bunker between states that hate each other _ but it gives no
impression of being about to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   What, however, of the others? What chance that the handover of
power in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Palestine will be as smooth?
</P>
<P>
   Take no bets on it. The rulers of these countries share a
certain myopia: all of them are despotic to one degree or another;
all are hitting 70, yet behave as though they were immortal,
without need of clear-cut succession plans.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion in any of these places would profoundly affect the
region. Saudi Arabia is the odd one out in that its king, Fahd, is
already disabled and the kingdom is competently run by Crown Prince
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saudi Abdullah is himself in his mid-70s, and it is far
from clear which of his extended family of brothers and
half-brothers will eventually take over from him _ or whether the
others will accept the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's Hosni Mubarak is confidently expected to be ``elected''
to a fourth six-year presidency this October, when he will be 71.
</P>
<P>
   Although his own role as vice-president helped Egypt to a smooth
transition when Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981, Mubarak has
chosen not to appoint a deputy. He prefers, it seems, to have the
driving seat to himself, without a potential rival fighting for the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   He looks robust, but what happens if he does not survive his
next term? Some Egyptians wonder, not entirely in jest, whether he
might not, in a monarchical way, be grooming a son.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this is what Syria's President Assad has long been
doing. After his favored son, Basil, died in a car crash, he turned
to Bashar, a former ophthalmologist, who is thought to be much less
of a chip off the harsh old block.
</P>
<P>
   The president may not be as frail as his gaunt looks suggest
but, when he does go, will Syrians quietly accept an Assad dynasty?
</P>
<P>
   And what of Arafat in this macabre actuarial exercise? At 69, he
looks poorly, and his trembling lip suggests the onset of
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   True, he takes good care of his health and his capacity for hard
work seems unimpaired. Moreover, he has shown survival powers that
match or surpass King Hussein's. But how reassuring is that, in the
circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters he holds two posts: president of the
Palestinian Authority (PA) and chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
   The man most likely to succeed him at the PA is still the
Palestinians' chief negotiator, Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu
Mazen). But West Bankers and Gazans, having nudged noses with
Israeli democracy, may not be content to have an old PLO hand
imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
   The dream of democracy was one of the reasons why they did not,
after Israel occupied their land in 1967, want King Hussein's
Hashemite rule back again. Instead, they got Arafat's erratic
authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Worse off by far are the Palestinian diaspora, whose members
have nobody to represent them but the PLO, a body that once made
history but has long since passed its best-before date.
</P>
<P>
   Will anything be left of the PLO when Arafat, whose name is
synonymous with it, joins his maker? The outlook for the hundreds
of thousands of Palestinian refugees who live stateless and ignored
in countries such as Lebanon is grim.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings matters back to Jordan, and its kings. Hashemite
rule was not the Palestinians' first choice, but refugees who
crossed the Jordan River were automatically given Jordanian
citizenship and the rights that go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional rule should be King Abdullah's goal, but
continuing his father's civilized, intelligent conduct would be a
splendid start. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Intimations of mortality, hard to avoid at any funeral, were
inescapable at King Hussein's.
</P>
<P>
   The large and diverse collection of world leaders who came to
Amman this week to pay their respects to an extraordinary man
included the elderly, the frail and the one-man rulers of several
volatile places that have no constitutional line of succession.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, such as Syria's Hafez Assad and the Palestinians'
Yasser Arafat, combine in quite a perilous way all three
attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago King Hussein himself was in this bracket. He
caused consternation with his last despotic act, emerging from
hospital to sack Hassan, his brother and longtime heir, and replace
him with his soldier son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators, The Economist included, brooded on the safety-nets
that would have been afforded by a genuine constitutional monarchy,
the folly of making oneself indispensable _ and the added folly of
inadequate provision for succession.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the early signals from Amman are promising.
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral, heads were bowed in honor of a king whose warmth
of heart and spirit even enemies respected. The new successor
conducted himself impeccably and so, most honorably, did his uncle,
Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has few natural advantages _ a sandpit of a place lying
like a bunker between states that hate each other _ but it gives no
impression of being about to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   What, however, of the others? What chance that the handover of
power in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Palestine will be as smooth?
</P>
<P>
   Take no bets on it. The rulers of these countries share a
certain myopia: all of them are despotic to one degree or another;
all are hitting 70, yet behave as though they were immortal,
without need of clear-cut succession plans.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion in any of these places would profoundly affect the
region. Saudi Arabia is the odd one out in that its king, Fahd, is
already disabled and the kingdom is competently run by Crown Prince
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saudi Abdullah is himself in his mid-70s, and it is far
from clear which of his extended family of brothers and
half-brothers will eventually take over from him _ or whether the
others will accept the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's Hosni Mubarak is confidently expected to be ``elected''
to a fourth six-year presidency this October, when he will be 71.
</P>
<P>
   Although his own role as vice-president helped Egypt to a smooth
transition when Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981, Mubarak has
chosen not to appoint a deputy. He prefers, it seems, to have the
driving seat to himself, without a potential rival fighting for the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   He looks robust, but what happens if he does not survive his
next term? Some Egyptians wonder, not entirely in jest, whether he
might not, in a monarchical way, be grooming a son.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this is what Syria's President Assad has long been
doing. After his favored son, Basil, died in a car crash, he turned
to Bashar, a former ophthalmologist, who is thought to be much less
of a chip off the harsh old block.
</P>
<P>
   The president may not be as frail as his gaunt looks suggest
but, when he does go, will Syrians quietly accept an Assad dynasty?
</P>
<P>
   And what of Arafat in this macabre actuarial exercise? At 69, he
looks poorly, and his trembling lip suggests the onset of
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   True, he takes good care of his health and his capacity for hard
work seems unimpaired. Moreover, he has shown survival powers that
match or surpass King Hussein's. But how reassuring is that, in the
circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters he holds two posts: president of the
Palestinian Authority (PA) and chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
   The man most likely to succeed him at the PA is still the
Palestinians' chief negotiator, Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu
Mazen). But West Bankers and Gazans, having nudged noses with
Israeli democracy, may not be content to have an old PLO hand

</P>

Hashemite rule back again. Instead, they got Arafat's erratic

</P>

   Will anything be left of the PLO when Arafat, whose name is
synonymous with it, joins his maker? The outlook for the hundreds
of thousands of Palestinian refugees who live stateless and ignored
in countries such as Lebanon is grim.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``But with the morning cool repentance came,'' wrote Walter
Scott. So it is in Washington at the end of the Clinton impeachment
saga.
</P>
<P>
   It is still more twilight than dawn; the city, mocked by the
rest of the country, seems sunk in political and physical
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to remember where it all began; only that, while it
lasted, almost everyone did things and said things they wish they
had not.
</P>
<P>
   As at the end of a drunken orgy, there is a need to clean up:
sort through the wreckage, sweep the floor, throw open the windows,
and repent.
</P>
<P>
   That time is now. The Senate impeachment trial is over.
President Clinton has been acquitted of both charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice. The seemingly interminable saga has finally
come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   What was gained by it all? It's hard to say, but two things were
made clear, at least.
</P>
<P>
   First, what has happened over the past year should never have
happened at all; second, there is no guarantee that it will not
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   The end of this awful tale still leaves in place the elements
that spawned it: a diminished presidency, a bitterly divided
Congress, an over-mighty prosecutor, and a media pack that is proud
to seek out scandal wherever it can.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, if not from the start then soon after, that the
president's impeachment should never have been undertaken. This
huge, ponderous machine, whose workings paralyze normal government,
should be activated only to remove a president who is agreed by
both political parties and by the people to be a menace to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's offenses, perjury and obstruction of justice _
not, it bears repeating, that he had a tawdry sexual fling _ were
in our view grave and shameful. Clinton disguised private lapses of
behavior with public lying, which had the public consequence of
destroying the people's trust in him.
</P>
<P>
   To this, the proper response of a man of honor would have been
to resign his office. But that was never the view of most
Americans; still less did most Americans feel that these crimes
justified the president's removal by another branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton would not go, his political enemies determined to
root him out, using impeachment to try to overturn, by a sort of
constitutional coup d'etat, the result of two elections.
</P>
<P>
   This is not impeachment's purpose, and no one has emerged from
the process untarnished: not the president, who refused even the
courtesy of answering senators' questions, nor the Republican trial
managers, who often exhibited pure vengeance, nor the Democrats,
whose scramble to embrace their president suggests a wholesale
abandonment of principle.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected (though nobody can be sure) that the Republicans
will reap the whirlwind in the elections of 2000 _ that they, not
the president or his Democrat apologists, will be blamed for taking
the country through this horror.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, impeachment once devalued may be used this way again,
not least by those who feel that vengeance and partisanship are
most neatly countered by more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Morning-after Washington also bears the scars of other excesses.
The scandal saw a sort of Faustian pact between the special
prosecutor, Ken Starr, and the press, whereby each seemed to feed
and encourage the prurient appetites of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's powers to investigate the president had long been
condemned as too far-reaching. But when the inquiry turned to sex,
rather than obscure tracts of scrubland in Arkansas, the press
became insatiable, and Starr obliged them with an extraordinary
flood of detail.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Internet dared, the old press followed. Rumor was
published before it had been verified; the prosecutor's office
sprang leaks for which no apology was offered; and Congress, when
the time came, pushed titillating material immediately and
unthinkingly into the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   This howling after sex stoked the fires of Republican moralists,
obscured the valid reasons for condemning this president, and made
the public think one thing: this prosecution was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   There is a grain of truth in that. No other president has faced
a man of Starr's resources and persistence (a persistence that is
still unsated); and none has had to deal with such a torrent of
explicit revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clinton's successors will not have to. In the present
mood of national regret, the overwhelming wish never to go through
that again, the office of the special prosecutor may well be
eliminated before the year is out. Yet something will have to
replace it; the executive cannot go unwatched.
</P>
<P>
   The press will be restrained for a while, no doubt. Yet the
modern trend to keep close tabs on the powerful, to comb through
their private lives, to expose them and pull them down, is not
about to disappear. Every would-be presidential contender now
working the malls of New Hampshire must expect to have to defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that during the presidency of Bill Clinton, the
perception of the office has changed and its authority has
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in history, it is said, America does not require a
leader to admire; prosperous and peaceful, it needs only a man who
can steer straight, and Clinton can do that capably enough. Respect
and special treatment are not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude was both confirmed and reflected during the
Lewinsky affair, by the Supreme Court ruling that the Paula Jones
civil suit could proceed against Clinton while he was in office.
But this ruling was misguided; this, too, should not have happened.
</P>
<P>
   A president in office is not an ordinary man, but the head of
state of the most powerful country on earth. He represents an
entity to which, above all, the world looks for guidance. His
accountability as a man before the law must always be balanced by a
sense of the importance of the office he occupies.
</P>
<P>
   But what if he himself cannot grasp that? When Americans look
back over the presidency of Bill Clinton, they will see much that
impresses them: economic good times, balanced budgets, reform of
the welfare system, the dogged pursuit of peace in Northern Ireland
and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all has been tarnished by what flowed from things that
should never have happened in the first place: the president's own
sexual wantonness and his own recourse to lying.
</P>
<P>
   It will be said of Clinton that, in some deep way, he never
seemed to feel or understand the weight of the office he held; and
from that carelessness, that squandering of his own authority, came
all the other excesses America has seen.
</P>
<P>
   Even after all that has happened, a genuine expression of regret
would mark an end, of sorts. There will be stage-managed
``sincerity,'' no doubt _ there has been an abundance of that
throughout. But a genuine expression of repentance? That has always
seemed too much to hope for. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ ``Luck and fate always seem to appear at the edge
of the road as Bill Clinton drives along his highway of ambition,
two friendly hitchhikers, thumbs out, ready to be picked up for
stretches here and there when other passengers appear less
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   That judgment, in a 1995 biography of the president by David
Maraniss, was true enough after the scandals and near-scandals of
dodging the draft, not inhaling marijuana and committing adultery
with Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   True, too, after ``Travelgate,'' when White House staff were
dismissed in May 1993 in favor of a team from back home in Little
Rock; after the puzzling death in July that year of Vince Foster,
the White House deputy counsel; after ``Filegate'' in 1996, when
the administration admitted to having wrongly collected FBI files
in 1993 on Republican opponents; and after Whitewater, a murky 1978
property deal which put presidential friends in jail and launched
the investigation of the Clintons by the indefatigable independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   But how much truer now, as Bill Clinton, buoyed by a
still-booming economy and high approval ratings, glides smoothly
away from his House impeachment and his Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his wake are demoralized Republicans; an independent
prosecutor who is loathed for his zealotry; and a Democratic Party
which did unexpectedly well in last year's congressional elections
and has a better-than-even chance of reclaiming the House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be, when only a year ago the pundits were
predicting a quick exit of the president from office?
</P>
<P>
   Fate in itself is too trite an answer. Arguably, the
provocations of Saddam Hussein were a timely help; but they also
gave the president's enemies the chance to accuse him of launching
strikes merely to deflect attention.
</P>
<P>
   The better argument is that Clinton, seemingly impervious to the
embarrassment that normal men might feel, makes his own luck, with
a mixture of personal charm, political brilliance, unshakeable
resolve and loyal allies _ not least his long-suffering wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has ``stood by her man'' (with incrementally nuanced
body language) even since last August, when the FBI confirmed that
Monica Lewinsky's blue dress was stained with the president's
semen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hillary alone is an insufficient explanation for the
Republicans' frustration, so ably expressed this week by the senior
senator from Washington, Slade Gorton: ``I cannot will to my
children and grandchildren the proposition that a president stands
above the law and can systematically obstruct justice simply
because both the polls and the Dow Jones index are high.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Clinton has always managed somehow to keep
separate the perceptions of his political and private lives.
</P>
<P>
   After all, ever since the Gennifer Flowers affair, the voters
have had no illusions about his moral standards (``He's slime,''
said one Washington doctor this week), but they have nonetheless
elected him twice to do what he calls ``the people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase cleverly trivializes his impeachment, a proceeding
Clinton characterizes by that other clever phrase, ``the politics
of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has conducted ``the people's business'' with unmatched
political flair. Apart from the debacle of health-care reform in
1993, a failure of presidential inexperience and hubris, the
Clinton administrations have rarely stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have taken credit for achieving the Republican
goals of a balanced budget and a smaller government, while
simultaneously demonizing the Republicans as the party whose
selfishness ``shut down'' the government at the end of 1995 and
whose instincts are to cut the entitlements _ Social Security,
Medicare and Medicaid _ that ordinary folks take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   In January last year, when the Lewinsky scandal first broke,
Clinton wrong-footed the tax-cutting Republicans with the call to
``Save Social Security first.'' And this year, even as the Senate
was conducting his trial, Clinton again wrong-footed the
Republicans with the mantra, ``Save Social Security for the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to such political skills a personality of extraordinary
warmth. Add a natural rapport with all Americans, regardless of
race and color (hence the ironic compliment that Clinton is the
country's ``first black president''). Add a team of defense lawyers
clever both in argument and in composition (including not just a
man in a wheelchair but a young black woman).
</P>
<P>
   Add, finally, the bungling of the House Republicans, first in
ruling out the alternative of a censure motion and then in needling
the Senate to be equally partisan. Given that total, perhaps the
president's escape was always certain.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the suspicion that fate smiles kindly on the president
remains.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in 1995, when the Gingrichian Republicans were
dominating politics, the Oklahoma City bombing of April 1995 gave
Clinton an occasion to be ``presidential,'' so too, as the Lewinsky
saga unfolded, have the peace process in Northern Ireland, the
antics of Saddam Hussein and the search for peace between
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as the Senate trial entered its final phase, Clinton
travelled to Jordan for the funeral of King Hussein. That event
brought a tear to the president's eye _ and it revived memories of
King Hussein's public praise for Clinton when announcing the Wye
River peace deal at the White House last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President,'' said the king, ``I've had the privilege of
being a friend of the United States and presidents since the late
President Eisenhower. (But)...I have never...known someone with
your dedication, clearheadedness, focus and determination.''
</P>
<P>
   High praise, indeed. Whether justified or not is another matter;
but ratings released this week by John Zogby, a well-known
pollster, claim that Bill Clinton has edged ahead of George Bush as
a great or near-great president, and is only a fraction behind
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the White House team, who have promised to celebrate
in a ``gloat-free zone,'' find it hard to hide their smiles. No
wonder the Republicans are so frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   As Zogby says of Clinton: ``He should continue to fascinate and
confound us for generations.'' &QL;

SALT LAKE CITY: NO LONGER A HOLIER-THAN-THOU HICKSVILLE  
 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Brigham Young's city in the Great Salt Desert has
been trying to get rid of its image as a holier-than-thou
Hicksville. Now it has managed it: the Olympics scandal has made it
a byword for bribery and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A report released on Feb. 9 shows that Olympic officials were
offered anything they fancied on their shopping trips to the city,
including curtains, bathroom fixtures, lawn equipment, even dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Not typical behavior, you might think, for the city of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But there is more to
Salt Lake City than Mormonism, just as there is more to the Olympic
scandals than Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the population of the city are non-Mormons,
including the mayor, who is also a Democrat who once supported Ted
Kennedy for president.
</P>
<P>
   The city is home to so many micro-breweries and coffee shops
that, after a few drinks, you can be forgiven for thinking that you
have ended up in Seattle by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake can boast many of the vices of modern urban life.
Gangs have become a serious problem, thanks largely to migration
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tramps gather around the Greyhound bus station, just as they do
in any other American city; tattooed youths ask for spare change;
and not all the girls who accost you are trying to explain the
principles of Mormonism.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4 the Rolling Stones played to a packed stadium; down
the road a less famous band, Evil Petting Zoo, entertained a
rowdier crowd. A local cinema is showing a film called ``Orgazmo,''
about a Mormon missionary who gets enmeshed in the porn industry.
</P>
<P>
   The city's boosters may prefer to keep quiet about ``Orgazmo.''
But in general they are desperate to prove that their city has
arrived in the big league.
</P>
<P>
   The city has acquired an impressive array of civic monuments in
the past few years, including basketball and football stadiums, a
huge courthouse, and a convention center for more than 20,000; and
building is proceeding at a furious pace, with a light railway
system under construction and new hotels emerging out of thin air.
</P>
<P>
   The locals are particularly proud that their basketball team has
been in the National Basketball Association Finals for the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   This explosion of civic pride has been made possible by an
economy that has been on a roll since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago Salt Lake was an isolated town, dependent
largely on mining and military expenditure. But Delta Air Lines'
decision in the mid-1980s to turn the city into its hub means that
it is easily accessible by air.
</P>
<P>
   And the computer revolution means that it can use its abundant
natural advantages _ notably its spectacular scenery and cheap but
educated labor force _ to attract companies from all around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 48 companies, including American Express and Dean
Witter, have moved their back-office operations to Salt Lake City,
where the growth rate in jobs has sometimes exceeded 6 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, that growth rate is slowing down at last. The
industrial core is being battered by the Asian crisis: the state's
exports contracted by 8.3 percent last year. At the same time, the
relocation gold rush is not what it was.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between pay in Utah and the rest of the country has
narrowed for the past nine years, and the service-sector received a
major blow recently when American Stores merged with Albertson's,
leaving the company's brand new $100 million headquarters empty.
</P>
<P>
   So where can the city look for renewed growth? Mostly to tourism
_ and particularly to winter sports. Utah is blessed with powdery
snow that is slippery without being particularly wet, a resource
that it shares with very few other places.
</P>
<P>
   The skiing industry is sinking hundreds of millions of dollars
into the slopes above Salt Lake. And winter sports are driving much
of the city's booming convention business.
</P>
<P>
   Early in February the city played host to 16,000 retailers of
outdoor clothes; later in the month it welcomes the National
Brotherhood of Skiers, a group of 4,000 African-American devotees
of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   It is this growing conviction of the economic potential of
winter sports, combined with a fierce local pride, that explains
why the city went to such lengths to secure the winter Olympics.
But the strategy is risky.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are acting as a huge economic stimulus at present,
as private investors build hotels and the city tries to cram ten
years of infrastructure investment into five. But once they are
over the construction bubble will burst, and the city could well be
left with thousands of surplus hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The occupancy rate has already fallen from 73 percent in 1996 to
63 percent in 1998. But ten hotels are currently under construction
in the region, and another 40 projects are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   All this sounds ominous. But Salt Lake still has one resource
that other bumptious cities cannot match (even though local
boosters tend to downplay it): the Mormon Church.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more to the city than the church, but the church
nevertheless remains a vital force in the local economy. Mormonism
is a business-minded religion with about 10 million adherents (half
of them outside the United States) and assets worth a minimum of
$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Its global headquarters _ a vast complex that includes a temple,
a huge tabernacle, a genealogical library, a museum, an
administrative complex and an apartment for the Prophet _ has long
protected downtown Salt Lake from the urban blight that is
commonplace elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There is every reason to think that it will continue to do so,
even if the current property bubble bursts spectacularly. The
church is currently building a $240 million assembly hall that
occupies an entire city block and will provide seating for 22,000.
It paid for the project in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The winter Olympics will be gone almost as soon as they arrive.
The fashion for skiing will wax and wane. But the thing that
guarantees that Salt Lake City will continue to grow is precisely
what built it in the first place: the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. &QL;

principles of Mormonism.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4 the Rolling Stones played to a packed stadium; down
the road a less famous band, Evil Petting Zoo, entertained a
rowdier crowd. A local cinema is showing a film called ``Orgazmo,''
about a Mormon missionary who gets enmeshed in the porn industry.
</P>
<P>
   The city's boosters may prefer to keep quiet about ``Orgazmo.''
But in general they are desperate to prove that their city has
arrived in the big league.
</P>
<P>
   The city has acquired an impressive array of civic monuments in
the past few years, including basketball and football stadiums, a
huge courthouse, and a convention center for more than 20,000; and
building is proceeding at a furious pace, with a light railway
system under construction and new hotels emerging out of thin air.
</P>
<P>
   The locals are particularly proud that their basketball team has
been in the National Basketball Association Finals for the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   This explosion of civic pride has been made possible by an
economy that has been on a roll since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago Salt Lake was an isolated town, dependent
largely on mining and military expenditure. But Delta Air Lines'
decision in the mid-1980s to turn the city into its hub means that
it is easily accessible by air.
</P>
<P>
   And the computer revolution means that it can use its abundant
natural advantages _ notably its spectacular scenery and cheap but
educated labor force _ to attract companies from all around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 48 companies, including American Express and Dean
Witter, have moved their back-office operations to Salt Lake City,
where the growth rate in jobs has sometimes exceeded 6 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, that growth rate is slowing down at last. The
industrial core is being battered by the Asian crisis: the state's
exports contracted by 8.3 percent last year. At the same time, the
relocation gold rush is not what it was.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between pay in Utah and the rest of the country has
narrowed for the past nine years, and the service-sector received a
major blow recently when American Stores merged with Albertson's,
leaving the company's brand new $100 million headquarters empty.
</P>
<P>
   So where can the city look for renewed growth? Mostly to tourism
_ and particularly to winter sports. Utah is blessed with powdery
snow that is slippery without being particularly wet, a resource
that it shares with very few other places.
</P>
<P>
   The skiing industry is sinking hundreds of millions of dollars
into the slopes above Salt Lake. And winter sports are driving much
of the city's booming convention business.
</P>
<P>
   Early in February the city played host to 16,000 retailers of
outdoor clothes; later in the month it welcomes the National
Brotherhood of Skiers, a group of 4,000 African-American devotees
of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   It is this growing conviction of the economic potential of
winter sports, combined with a fierce local pride, that explains
why the city went to such lengths to secure the winter Olympics.
But the strategy is risky.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics are acting as a huge economic stimulus at present,
as private investors build hotels and the city tries to cram ten
years of infrastructure investment into five. But once they are
over the construction bubble will burst, and the city could well be
left with thousands of surplus hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The occupancy rate has already fallen from 73 percent in 1996 to
63 percent in 1998. But ten hotels are currently under construction
in the region, and another 40 projects are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   All this sounds ominous. But Salt Lake still has one resource
that other bumptious cities cannot match (even though local
boosters tend to downplay it): the Mormon Church.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more to the city than the church, but the church
nevertheless remains a vital force in the local economy. Mormonism
is a business-minded religion with about 10 million adherents (half
of them outside the United States) and assets worth a minimum of
$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Its global headquarters _ a vast complex that includes a temple,
a huge tabernacle, a genealogical library, a museum, an
administrative complex and an apartment for the Prophet _ has long
protected downtown Salt Lake from the urban blight that is
commonplace elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There is every reason to think that it will continue to do so,
even if the current property bubble bursts spectacularly. The
church is currently building a $240 million assembly hall that
occupies an entire city block and will provide seating for 22,000.
It paid for the project in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The winter Olympics will be gone almost as soon as they arrive.
The fashion for skiing will wax and wane. But the thing that
guarantees that Salt Lake City will continue to grow is precisely
what built it in the first place: the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. &QL;

   AMMAN _ In death, as in life, King Hussein dominates Jordan.
Even at the swearing-in of his son and successor, Abdullah, on Feb.
7, he remained the focus of attention.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ceremony, a workman, busy dusting the podium on which
the new king was to take his oath of office, was called away to the
more important task of wiping clean a nearby portrait of Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah himself lingered longer in silent tribute to his
father's picture than over the oath itself. The wailing from the
gallery at every mention of the old king outdid the applause at the
inauguration of the new.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians seem consumed with genuine grief at the death of the
man who had been their king for nearly half a century.
</P>
<P>
   During the three days he lay dying in an Amman hospital,
thousands waited outside the gates. With the news of his death,
crowds of young men surged through the streets chanting, ``There is
no god but Allah and Hussein is beloved by Allah.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, perhaps a quarter of the population turned out for
the king's funeral, plus an array of foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   How can the huge void left by the king's death be filled? Quite
smoothly, at least to begin with. King Abdullah has been quick to
affirm the policies of his father, including peace with Israel and
a gradual (very gradual) process of democratization.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was promoted only two weeks before he took over and
has no political experience, he scarcely set a foot wrong during
the very public diplomatic encounters at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   His uncle and rival, Prince Hassan, who served as crown prince
for 34 years before being unceremoniously sacked last month, both
stood by his elbow and generously sent him an open letter of
submission and support.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Hamzeh, his 18-year-old half-brother and the elder son of
Hussein's widow, Queen Noor, was appointed crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of stability, and out of respect for the dead king,
the royal family, local politicians, ordinary Jordanians and a
panoply of world leaders have rallied behind King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The support is not only moral. The United States has announced
an extra $300 million in aid to Jordan over the next three years.
The United Arab Emirates has promised to deposit money in the
Central Bank, and Saudi Arabia, which fell out with Jordan during
the Gulf war over its forgiving stance towards Iraq, has promised
to resume its once-huge handouts.
</P>
<P>
   Amman's stock market barely budged in the face of King Hussein's
imminent death, and the Central Bank had little trouble defending
the Jordanian dinar. Jordan has not missed a beat, either
economically or politically.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, however, change is inevitable. Although Jordan
is theoretically a constitutional monarchy, its parliament has
always acted on the initiative of the king.
</P>
<P>
   During King Hussein's recent seven-month absence in America for
cancer treatment, an air of paralysis hung over the country.
</P>
<P>
   The government of the day lost popularity over a scandal about
contaminated water, but Jordan's political institutions were unable
to cope with the crisis. King Hussein had to intervene from his
sickbed to sack the prime minister and appoint a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Given the new king's lesser experience and stature, he will find
it hard to rule in such a hands-on manner. Already some liberal
members of parliament are calling for a revision of the restrictive
press and electoral laws, both of which were linchpins of King
Hussein's system of limited democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Although King Abdullah seems to share his father's suspicion of
political freedom, the role of future governments and parliaments
is likely to expand in the face of his inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the new king hope to exert anything like the influence
his father had on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 18 months, King Hussein forced Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israel's prime minister, to release the spiritual leader of Hamas
in exchange for captured Israeli spies, faced down Syria's
iron-willed President Hafez Assad in a vitriolic propaganda war,
persuaded both Bill Clinton and his Iraqi counterpart, Saddam
Hussein, to give Jordan financial aid, and intervened personally to
secure the agreement at Wye between Yasser Arafat and skeptical
Israeli negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine King Abdullah holding his own against such
seasoned politicians, let alone wringing concessions from them.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, epitomizing the faint air of
condescension exuded by many of the Arab leaders at the funeral,
called the 37-year-old king ``a very good young man.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Jordan, bereft of its famous ruler, will be cut down
to size.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah will have to concentrate on domestic affairs,
attempting to improve the faltering economy of a small, poor,
desert country with few natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has reached fully 15 percent, and economic growth
is nonexistent. Various privatization schemes have stalled, along
with IMF-inspired liberalization _ and the present cabinet is
closely associated with the sidelined Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein won the affection of most Jordanians not through
his labors as an international statesman but as someone who cared
about and, over the course of his reign, improved the living
standards of his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of his dynasty rests on the new king's ability to
provide for the masses who flocked to his father's funeral. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Judged by the ultra-conservative tastes of Japan's business
establishment, Tsutomu Shida's office is gloriously vulgar. The
decor is garish. The wall cabinets are marbled and mirrored.
Threatening to skewer the unwary guest is a giant, stuffed
swordfish. ``My hobby,'' offers Shida, helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   Self-made men like Shida attract ridicule and condescension in
snooty Japan. As a rule, they keep quiet about their success. But
Shida is as loud as his carpet.
</P>
<P>
   He pops up regularly in the Japanese media. He has a starring
role on a government committee to encourage business start-ups. He
has written two books about life as an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife scolds me if I'm in the newspapers,'' he smiles. ``But
in Japan we have no role models. Somebody has to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's shortage of entrepreneurs is a real worry. Big employers
are horribly overstaffed. They are now shedding jobs almost as fast
as American firms did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   More young companies are needed to hire these people instead.
Yet for over a decade Japan has been losing more companies than it
has created. More startlingly, Japan's entrepreneurs are aging even
faster than its population, suggesting that entrepreneurialism is
dying out with the post-war generation.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government wants to find out why. But Shida has no
small interest in the question himself. His latest venture is to
run a school that seeks to teach Japanese people how to be
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Shida made his own fortune in food. He once managed an ice-cream
factory. Later, he opened a restaurant. He started a catering
business with the money he saved, then opened a chain of karaoke
bars.
</P>
<P>
   He has since built his catering firm, Shidax Food Service, into
Japan's biggest caterer, dishing up YEN 52 billion-worth ($456
million) of meals to companies, schools and hospitals last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he floated Shidax Food Service on the stock market.
Later the same year, he launched a fund to invest in entrepreneurs
and an institute to train them.
</P>
<P>
   The fund had YEN 5.5 billion for early-stage investments. But
Shida quickly found that it was a shortage of know-how, not money,
that was holding people back. Since then, he has put much of his
effort into making entrepreneurs, rather than financing them.
</P>
<P>
   The institute runs three courses, each tailored to a different
stage of business development. Applicants are asked to submit a
business plan. The curriculum covers accounting, marketing,
distribution and fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a separate ``golden age'' class for elderly
entrepreneurs. At the moment, 160 pupils are enrolled in the
standard classes; and 200 in the golden-age program. The oldest
beginner is a sprightly 82.
</P>
<P>
   Shida talks expansively about repaying his debts to society, but
his motives are not purely charitable. Although the classes are
free, students who do well may be selected for investment through
his fund.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the fund's investments include a company making
microwave ovens that thaw frozen sushi evenly; a software developer
for the health-care industry; and a maker of digital maps for
car-navigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that the institute's graduates should take their
businesses public and recycle their wealth back into start-ups
themselves, forming what amounts to a business angels' collective.
</P>
<P>
   Shida readily acknowledges that there are barriers to starting a
business in Japan that no amount of schooling will get past.
</P>
<P>
   To set up a limited-liability company, for instance, you must
have at least YEN 10 million-worth of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Capital investments in early-stage Japanese companies do not get
the favorable tax treatment available in America, although Shida's
committee managed to get the rules changed modestly. Tax treatment
of business angels is also less favorable in Japan than in America.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists need sophisticated capital markets, such as
a welcoming stock market and a junk-bond market for speculative
debt investments _ both of which Japan lacks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the areas in which Shida thinks his school can help
that give the greatest pause for thought. Pupils need a lot of
support and encouragement, says Shida, if they are to cast off
their cultural inhibitions. For the traditionally conformist
Japanese, that is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Some handicaps are familiar in other countries trying to ape
American business dynamism. The stigma attached to failure
discourages start-ups; it also makes business plans less flexible.
Once launched, a business venture is not easily reversed for fear
of losing face.
</P>
<P>
   Other obstacles, such as its education system, are worse in
Japan. Japanese education gets flak for suppressing individuality;
encouraging group behavior and conformity; and cultivating amae, a
psychological reliance on other people. This behavior is reinforced
by bullying, which is sometimes even led by teachers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Shida's school is a valiant effort to fight against the tide.
Yet one class a month is unlikely to undo a childhood of such
things.
</P>
<P>
   Shida hopes that the way to inspire inhibited would-be
entrepreneurs is ``to show them the money.'' But even the appeal of
wealth has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shida is typical of most of those in her position when she
worries about being a nouveau riche: old money is classier money.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Judged by the ultra-conservative tastes of Japan's business
establishment, Tsutomu Shida's office is gloriously vulgar. The
decor is garish. The wall cabinets are marbled and mirrored.
Threatening to skewer the unwary guest is a giant, stuffed
swordfish. ``My hobby,'' offers Shida, helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   Self-made men like Shida attract ridicule and condescension in
snooty Japan. As a rule, they keep quiet about their success. But
Shida is as loud as his carpet.
</P>
<P>
   He pops up regularly in the Japanese media. He has a starring
role on a government committee to encourage business start-ups. He
has written two books about life as an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife scolds me if I'm in the newspapers,'' he smiles. ``But
in Japan we have no role models. Somebody has to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's shortage of entrepreneurs is a real worry. Big employers
are horribly overstaffed. They are now shedding jobs almost as fast
as American firms did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   More young companies are needed to hire these people instead.
Yet for over a decade Japan has been losing more companies than it
has created. More startlingly, Japan's entrepreneurs are aging even
faster than its population, suggesting that entrepreneurialism is
dying out with the post-war generation.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government wants to find out why. But Shida has no
small interest in the question himself. His latest venture is to
run a school that seeks to teach Japanese people how to be
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Shida made his own fortune in food. He once managed an ice-cream
factory. Later, he opened a restaurant. He started a catering
business with the money he saved, then opened a chain of karaoke
bars.
</P>
<P>
   He has since built his catering firm, Shidax Food Service, into
Japan's biggest caterer, dishing up YEN 52 billion-worth ($456
million) of meals to companies, schools and hospitals last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he floated Shidax Food Service on the stock market.
Later the same year, he launched a fund to invest in entrepreneurs
and an institute to train them.
</P>
<P>
   The fund had YEN 5.5 billion for early-stage investments. But
Shida quickly found that it was a shortage of know-how, not money,
that was holding people back. Since then, he has put much of his
effort into making entrepreneurs, rather than financing them.
</P>
<P>
   The institute runs three courses, each tailored to a different
stage of business development. Applicants are asked to submit a
business plan. The curriculum covers accounting, marketing,
distribution and fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a separate ``golden age'' class for elderly
entrepreneurs. At the moment, 160 pupils are enrolled in the
standard classes; and 200 in the golden-age program. The oldest
beginner is a sprightly 82.
</P>
<P>
   Shida talks expansively about repaying his debts to society, but
his motives are not purely charitable. Although the classes are
free, students who do well may be selected for investment through
his fund.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the fund's investments include a company making
microwave ovens that thaw frozen sushi evenly; a software developer
for the health-care industry; and a maker of digital maps for
car-navigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that the institute's graduates should take their
businesses public and recycle their wealth back into start-ups
themselves, forming what amounts to a business angels' collective.
</P>
<P>
   Shida readily acknowledges that there are barriers to starting a
business in Japan that no amount of schooling will get past.
</P>
<P>
   To set up a limited-liability company, for instance, you must
have at least YEN 10 million-worth of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Capital investments in early-stage Japanese companies do not get
the favorable tax treatment available in America, although Shida's
committee managed to get the rules changed modestly. Tax treatment
of business angels is also less favorable in Japan than in America.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists need sophisticated capital markets, such as
a welcoming stock market and a junk-bond market for speculative
debt investments _ both of which Japan lacks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the areas in which Shida thinks his school can help
that give the greatest pause for thought. Pupils need a lot of
support and encouragement, says Shida, if they are to cast off
their cultural inhibitions. For the traditionally conformist
Japanese, that is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Some handicaps are familiar in other countries trying to ape
American business dynamism. The stigma attached to failure
discourages start-ups; it also makes business plans less flexible.
Once launched, a business venture is not easily reversed for fear
of losing face.
</P>
<P>
   Other obstacles, such as its education system, are worse in
Japan. Japanese education gets flak for suppressing individuality;
encouraging group behavior and conformity; and cultivating amae, a
psychological reliance on other people. This behavior is reinforced
by bullying, which is sometimes even led by teachers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Shida's school is a valiant effort to fight against the tide.
Yet one class a month is unlikely to undo a childhood of such
things.
</P>
<P>
   Shida hopes that the way to inspire inhibited would-be
entrepreneurs is ``to show them the money.'' But even the appeal of
wealth has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shida is typical of most of those in her position when she
worries about being a nouveau riche: old money is classier money.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are fond of saying that ``the nail that sticks up
gets knocked back in.'' Until such attitudes change, the only
Japanese entrepreneurs will be those, like Shida, who are
impervious to the hammer. &QL;

<P>
   For Americans, lawyers seem to embody extremes of both heroism
and greed, sometimes at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   A film currently playing to packed cinemas across the country,
``A Civil Action,'' tells the true story of one crusading lawyer
(played by John Travolta) who bankrupted himself trying to sue two
big companies which had polluted a small town's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   But when they win, even lawyer-heroes expect to be well paid.
</P>
<P>
   The small group of contingency-fee lawyers who helped state
governments bring the tobacco industry to heel are about to collect
fees so colossal that they dwarf even the excesses of Wall Street
investment bankers in the mad, bad 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco remains a bonanza for lawyers in all kinds of ways. On
Feb. 10, a Californian jury awarded $51.5 million in damages
against Philip Morris to a woman with inoperable lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The award, by far the largest in a smoking-related lawsuit, was
a brusque reminder that, despite last year's settlement with the
states, tobacco companies remain vulnerable to suits brought by
individuals; and that as long as smokers want compensation, lawyers
will reap fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The legal profession is still trying to digest the implications
of the staggering $8.1 billion a three-man arbitration panel
awarded in December to lawyers for the work they did in helping
Florida, Mississippi and Texas win a settlement from the tobacco
industry for health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six months, the panel is expected to use the same
criteria to set fees for the lawyers who represented dozens of
other states in the negotiations which led to a national settlement
last November.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, some 250-450 lucky lawyers could collect between $20
billion and $25 billion in fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These amounts are grotesque and absurd,'' says Lester
Brickman, a law professor at New York's Cardozo School of Law.
``Most of this money should have gone to the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Brickman, an expert on legal fees, predicts that the flood of
cash going to a small group of trial lawyers will finance a wave of
mass litigation against other industries, including alcohol and
fast food, on similar public-health grounds.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is already being pursued by big-city mayors
against gun manufacturers and distributors with the help of some of
the same law firms which represented the states in their suits
against the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Others fear wider political consequences. Trial lawyers are
well-connected, politically savvy, and among the most generous
contributors to campaign funds. (Most of them support the
Democrats.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very worried that the additional clout these
amounts give the trial bar will impede any reform of the legal
system,'' says Mary Ann Glendon, a law professor at Harvard. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 425 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers involved in the tobacco suits insist that the awards
are fair, reflecting the risk they ran by taking on the tobacco
firms when no one, including the state attorneys-general, thought
they had much chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers worked without pay, and as part of the settlement
have now agreed to submit to arbitration rather than insist on a
share of the money the states will receive, which is what the
contracts they signed with many state governments would have given
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fees are huge,'' admits Philip Anderson, the president of
the American Bar Association. ``But these lawyers were able to do
something that governments have never been able to achieve on their
own _ assemble enough evidence to bring the tobacco industry to
account. And the fees were agreed by sophisticated parties on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much sophistication, in fact, may be the problem. Unusually,
neither plaintiffs nor defendants in these cases seem to have had
much interest in limiting the lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, these fees are being paid by the tobacco firms,
which spares the state attorneys-general the politically
embarrassing task of having to pay the lawyers huge amounts of
money out of their state's share of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers agreed to arbitration because they knew that state
politicians could never have honored their contingency contracts,
which would themselves have become the subject of prolonged
litigation. Most judges would have reduced the amounts the lawyers
would get.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the arbitration is a mere fig leaf. The money going
to the lawyers was clearly part of the overall amount that the
tobacco companies were willing to pay to settle the case. Whatever
the lawyers get, the states do not.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the tobacco companies has also been suspiciously
muted. Brown &AMP; Williamson, one of the firms, called the fee award
``obscene,'' but the other companies said little.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be that they do not really care about the size of
the total fee award. Their deal with the states caps the amount
they must pay all the states' lawyers at $500 million a year. This
will be divided by the lawyers according to their proportions of
the overall fee award.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies will also shell out another $1.25 billion over
the next five years to pay off those lawyers who do not want to
wait years to receive all their money. So the companies' exposure
is limited, no matter what the lawyers get. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the lawyers are becoming joint business partners with
the states and the tobacco companies in levying a tax on smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The overall settlement has been widely misreported as giving the
states $206 billion. But this is only the amount that they will
receive in the first 25 years. The settlement actually runs in
perpetuity, turning the tobacco firms into permanent tax-collection
agencies for the states.
</P>
<P>
   The firms have already raised prices by about 50 cents a pack to
pay for the settlement. The $500 million they will be handing over
to the lawyers annually will also be paid for by smokers.
</P>
<P>
   If the total fee award to lawyers reaches $25 billion, these
annual payments will continue for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the outstanding fees are inflation-adjusted, as the
arbitrators decided they should be in Florida, Mississippi and
Texas, the payments to the lawyers and their heirs could go on
forever, because the $500 million annual cap will not be
inflation-adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco firms are threatening to challenge the
inflation-adjustment provision in the courts because they say it is
not part of the national settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But inflation-adjusted or not, today's smokers _ 70 percent of
whom earn less than $40,000 a year _ will be paying the lawyers as
well as the states, via the tobacco companies, for the rest of
their (abbreviated) lives. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,125. 200-WORD TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Tobacco companies' bottom lines will barely be affected. This is
why tobacco shares rose after the settlement with the states was
announced in November and barely reacted when the first gigantic
fee awards to lawyers were made in December.
</P>
<P>
   How the arbitrators came up with such a huge figure is something
of a mystery. The awards range from 20-35 percent of what the three
states will receive. But this is far more than the 8 percent fee
agreed last May by the lawyers in Minnesota, the only state
actually to take its tobacco case all the way to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Brickman of Cardozo School of Law is lobbying Congress to impose
an excess-profits tax on the lawyers' fees. Few believe such a law
would withstand a constitutional challenge from the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   And the tobacco companies have other things to worry about. They
are now facing the prospect of a giant lawsuit from the federal
government. The Justice Department says that it, too, may hire
outside lawyers to help fight that case, but that if it does, they
will be paid a salary, not a contingency fee. Progress of a sort. &QL;

<P>
   One reason may be that they do not really care about the size of
the total fee award. Their deal with the states caps the amount
they must pay all the states' lawyers at $500 million a year. This
will be divided by the lawyers according to their proportions of
the overall fee award.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies will also shell out another $1.25 billion over
the next five years to pay off those lawyers who do not want to
wait years to receive all their money. So the companies' exposure
is limited, no matter what the lawyers get. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the lawyers are becoming joint business partners with
the states and the tobacco companies in levying a tax on smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The overall settlement has been widely misreported as giving the
states $206 billion. But this is only the amount that they will
receive in the first 25 years. The settlement actually runs in
perpetuity, turning the tobacco firms into permanent tax-collection
agencies for the states.
</P>
<P>
   The firms have already raised prices by about 50 cents a pack to
pay for the settlement. The $500 million they will be handing over
to the lawyers annually will also be paid for by smokers.
</P>
<P>
   If the total fee award to lawyers reaches $25 billion, these
annual payments will continue for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the outstanding fees are inflation-adjusted, as the
arbitrators decided they should be in Florida, Mississippi and
Texas, the payments to the lawyers and their heirs could go on
forever, because the $500 million annual cap will not be
inflation-adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco firms are threatening to challenge the
inflation-adjustment provision in the courts because they say it is
not part of the national settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But inflation-adjusted or not, today's smokers _ 70 percent of
whom earn less than $40,000 a year _ will be paying the lawyers as
well as the states, via the tobacco companies, for the rest of
their (abbreviated) lives. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,125. 200-WORD TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Tobacco companies' bottom lines will barely be affected. This is
why tobacco shares rose after the settlement with the states was
announced in November and barely reacted when the first gigantic
fee awards to lawyers were made in December.
</P>
<P>
   How the arbitrators came up with such a huge figure is something
of a mystery. The awards range from 20-35 percent of what the three
states will receive. But this is far more than the 8 percent fee
agreed last May by the lawyers in Minnesota, the only state
actually to take its tobacco case all the way to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Brickman of Cardozo School of Law is lobbying Congress to impose
an excess-profits tax on the lawyers' fees. Few believe such a law
would withstand a constitutional challenge from the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   And the tobacco companies have other things to worry about. They
are now facing the prospect of a giant lawsuit from the federal
government. The Justice Department says that it, too, may hire
outside lawyers to help fight that case, but that if it does, they
will be paid a salary, not a contingency fee. Progress of a sort. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just over a year ago, Monica Lewinsky was packing
up her belongings in Washington and preparing to leave for New
York.
</P>
<P>
   To most people, she was just another one of the thousands of
young people who move through the city every year, working as
assistants or interns before moving on to another job. Those who
met her at parties described her as shy, and not especially
striking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the time she made her first television appearance this
year, giving videotaped evidence to the impeachment trial of her
former boss, Lewinsky's name and face were amongst the most
recognized images on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Her trademark beret (by then swapped for a black baseball cap)
was an instantly-recognizable cliche. Her relationship with the
President had been set out in minute detail in newspapers and on
television programs around the world, and her most intimate
exchanges with her friends had been put on the internet or recorded
on tape.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House intern and Pentagon employee will not now
work for Revlon, as she had hoped when she left Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what will happen to her life. She says she lives
in California, as much as she lives anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   She will tell her own story through a forthcoming book,
``Monica's Story,'' by the journalist Andrew Morton, and she will
be interviewed by Barbara Walters for ABC and by Channel Four News.
</P>
<P>
   Once the last flush of media attention has drained, she will
doubtless try to resurrect something close to a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Monica is just one of the figures in the drama of the last year
whose daily existence has been transformed beyond recognition, but
few have seen their lives so wrecked as she.
</P>
<P>
   Most will carry on in their present jobs, or have a network of
supporters to call on. She has spent close to a million dollars on
legal fees, most of which she will recoup from the book and
television, but she has no easy return to normal life mapped out.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's first lawyer, William Ginsburg, did not help with the
presentational aspects of her case. He appeared to relish the
publicity, and arranged for a photo shoot with Vanity Fair that
made her look sexually alluring. But Ginsburg was quickly replaced
with two old Washington pros, who kept her literally and
metaphorically under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   She was initially described as a stalker by some (apparently
White House-inspired) reports, which stressed her parents' divorce
and her unstable nature. But everything that we have seen and heard
since belies that.
</P>
<P>
   She has appeared as a bright and composed figure with an
excellent recall of the events that took place around her. She has
a degree in psychology, which must have come in handy in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The last time she spoke to President Clinton was on Jan. 5 a
year ago, when she had already been subpoenaed to give evidence in
the sexual harassment suit brought by former Arkansas employee
Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   She was angry with the president, whom she had recently seen on
television with his wife ``being romantic on their holiday
vacation.'' They discussed her affidavit, and she said goodbye,
``very abruptly,'' she remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she felt for Clinton now, she said: ``I have mixed
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think he's a good president, and I assume you think he's a
very intelligent man,'' she was asked, and she responded, simply:
``I think he's an intelligent president.'' &QL;

   Once the last flush of media attention has drained, she will
doubtless try to resurrect something close to a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Monica is just one of the figures in the drama of the last year
whose daily existence has been transformed beyond recognition, but
few have seen their lives so wrecked as she.
</P>
<P>
   Most will carry on in their present jobs, or have a network of
supporters to call on. She has spent close to a million dollars on
legal fees, most of which she will recoup from the book and
television, but she has no easy return to normal life mapped out.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's first lawyer, William Ginsburg, did not help with the
presentational aspects of her case. He appeared to relish the
publicity, and arranged for a photo shoot with Vanity Fair that
made her look sexually alluring. But Ginsburg was quickly replaced
with two old Washington pros, who kept her literally and
metaphorically under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   She was initially described as a stalker by some (apparently
White House-inspired) reports, which stressed her parents' divorce
and her unstable nature. But everything that we have seen and heard
since belies that.
</P>
<P>
   She has appeared as a bright and composed figure with an
excellent recall of the events that took place around her. She has
a degree in psychology, which must have come in handy in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The last time she spoke to President Clinton was on Jan. 5 a
year ago, when she had already been subpoenaed to give evidence in
the sexual harassment suit brought by former Arkansas employee
Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   She was angry with the president, whom she had recently seen on
television with his wife ``being romantic on their holiday
vacation.'' They discussed her affidavit, and she said goodbye,
``very abruptly,'' she remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she felt for Clinton now, she said: ``I have mixed
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think he's a good president, and I assume you think he's a
very intelligent man,'' she was asked, and she responded, simply:
``I think he's an intelligent president.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The woman who alienated all America when she stood
on the steps of the Washington District courthouse and said: ``I'm
you...an average American,'' emerged Friday from half a year of
obscurity to start rebuilding her shattered image.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp, whose clandestine taping of Monica Lewinsky's most
intimate confessions won her the label ``most reviled woman in
America,'' was back as suddenly as she had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a new Linda Tripp, so comprehensively ``made over''
as to be almost unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy, clumsy, boxy woman whose ponderous frame inspired
Linda Tripp look-alike contests in gay bars across the country has
lost weight (a lot), softened her hair and her make-up and revamped
her wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   She is fragile _ breaking down in tears, reportedly, during a
two-hour interview with the New York Times _ but largely
unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   Her deepest regret, she said, was the pain she had caused her
young friend, Monica. She said she saw Monica ``as a kid'' and
wanted to save her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always saw her as a lost soul,'' she told the paper. ``I
believe she and the country will never understand that I believed
this was in her best interest, and that makes me very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   By revealing the tapes, she says, she wanted to ``sever''
Monica's relationship with the president once and for all. ``This
was a young girl who...fell head over heels in love with the
president. He clearly did not share those feelings, and his callous
abuse in discarding Monica Lewinsky made it look as if he thought
of her as a servicing contract.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mom, especially with a daughter close in age to Monica
(her daughter is 19),'' she said amid tears, ``I would hope some
other mom would do for my daughter what I did for Monica, despite
the fact that it looks horrible, that it looks like betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times interview, which appeared Friday, was the
first of three, so far announced. She also appeared Friday on the
NBC morning ``Today'' program, and Monday on CNN's ``Larry King
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   She insists, however, that she has no plans to write a book,
though it was her idea for a book-length expose of scandal in the
Clinton White House that inspired her to record her conversations
with Monica.
</P>
<P>
   As she told the New York Times, she blames the New York literary
agent whom she contacted _ Lucianne Goldberg _ for prompting what
are perceived as some of her more egregious acts of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   It was Goldberg, she said, who suggested she passed her tapes to
the independent prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, and Goldberg, who
suggested she talk to lawyers representing Paula Jones, the woman
suing Clinton for sexual harassment. (Goldberg had no comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, 49, remains employed by the Pentagon but has worked from
home since the Lewinsky affair broke.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of her ``relaunch'' on the metropolitan media
circuit was the surest sign that the 13-month scandal was drawing
to a close. &QL;

   BLACKHISTORY-VOICES-1900 _ DAYTON, Ohio _ America in the early
1900s was a nation in metamorphosis. Yet some things appeared stuck
in the 19th century. The nation's blacks, with more than 50 years
of emancipation behind them, were still brutally segregated and
subject to racial violence. More than 70 were lynched in 1920.
Abject conditions in the South prompted many to come north,
launching what would come to be known as The Great Migration.
George Cooper: ``The realization of racism came on me in a gradual
way. I think it came on most kids in a gradual way, both white and
black.'' Ellen Lee Jackson: ``Dayton was a prejudiced place. As far
as the jobs were, you didn't get to have the good jobs like they
have now.'' Yvonne Walker-Taylor: ``I liked school because I was an
only child and going to school was just my piece of cake.'' Ned
Wood: ``In the Depression, life sure changed. We lost our farm in
1931. One year, we had boll weevils.'' (Keilman, Dayton Daily News)

   BLACKHISTORY-WAR _ DAYTON, Ohio _ President Franklin D.
Roosevelt issued an executive order banning discrimination in
defense industries and government jobs. And though he maintained
segregation in the armed forces, he allowed some blacks to become
officers for the first time. One of them was George Cooper. Black
forces fought well. On the homefront, Ellen Lee Jackson continued
working in Dayton while two of her brothers served. Yvonne
Walker-Taylor, who had married a Tuskeegee Airman, moved to a
military base in Alabama. George Cooper never made it to combat.

blacks reaped the benefits. African-Americans began claiming more

found opportunities their parents could scarcely imagine. One of
Ned Wood's sons became a surgeon. George Cooper's daughter became a

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Only a few monarchs left in the world
really matter.
</P>
<P>
   And not one has mattered for longer than King Norodom Sihanouk,
Cambodia's master of dramatic intrigue for the last 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Sihanouk acted the playboy king with scores of
mistresses, the self-described ``randy rabbit.'' In the fifties, he
became the father of Cambodian independence from France and the
slippery Cold War neutralist.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixties, he occupied himself as the absolute ruler who
doubled as a film-maker. In the seventies, he became the figurehead
of the genocidal Khmer Rouge guerrillas and then the Khmer Rouge's
gilded prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when Sihanouk was an exiled prince with slim
prospects of reclaiming his country, he was told by former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that he was as good an actor as
Sir Laurence Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sihanouk is back on the throne, playing the most improbable
role of his checkered career.
</P>
<P>
   At 76, history has cast him as the indispensable pacifier in a
country still traumatized by the Vietnam War and the subsequent
butchery of up to 2 million Cambodians in the ``killing fields'' of
the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 12 million Cambodians are frightened that without
the king to balance the factions, Cambodia's 20-year civil war
could burst out again. Others fear that Sihanouk's death would
remove the last roadblock to dictatorial rule by Cambodia's Prime
Minister Hun Sen, a former communist with close ties to Vietnam and
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lucky to have the king around with us,'' says former
government adviser Ok Serei Sopheak, coordinator of the Cambodian
Center for Conflict Resolution. ``But we have to ask ourselves how
to prepare for the day when he is not around. It is too easy every
time there is a problem just to turn to the king to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expected that then-Prince Sihanouk would make so much
difference when the political parties agreed to allow him to
reclaim his throne in 1993, after United Nations-brokered
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was head of Cambodia's 800-year-old royal family and a
descendant of Cambodia's great 12th century god-king Jayavarman
VII, he was relegated by the new constitution to ``reign but not
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides that handicap, Sihanouk had been beset with colon
cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and several minor strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last six years, Sihanouk has emerged as a mixture
of Machiavellian politician and godlike Buddhist patriarch who is
summoned at the last moment by the squabbling politicians to save
his 12 million ``children'' from chaos. And for now, his cancer has
gone into remission.
</P>
<P>
   The king commands no armies. But when he enters a room, his
subjects kneel and try to touch him. When he wants to tame the
rival factions, he often does it by pulling one of his virtuoso
dramatic exits.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, King Sihanouk brought Prime Minister Hun Sen to heel
when he suddenly left his palace for the airport and caught a
commercial flight to Beijing, ostensibly for routine medical
treatment in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stay in Cambodia with those republicans because they
are terribly unjust and barbarous to me,'' complained Sihanouk, in
a message to his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   At first, a newspaper loyal to Hun Sen chastised Sihanouk,
saying if he couldn't be a full-time king, he should ``let someone
else be a real king for Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week later, Hun Sen backed down. ``We want to invite him
back,'' said the prime minister. ``The presence of the king is very
important for the continuity of the state . . . I beg the
newspapers not to criticize the king so harshly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Sihanouk's importance increased. Another round of
elections produced an uncomfortably narrow edge for Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party over the royalist FUNCINPEC party, led by
the king's 54-year-old eldest son Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, almost all ministries were paralyzed by
factional struggles, as the two main parties resisted a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
   With rumors of coups roiling the city, the king put out the word
that he was leaving Cambodia for medical treatment in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen all but begged Sihanouk not to leave the country until a
government was formed. ``If the king leaves, we will miss legal
procedure,'' said a spokesman for Hun Sen. ``For example, who would
be the acting head of state if one were needed?''
</P>
<P>
   After a show of reluctance worthy of Shakespeare's Hamlet, the
king canceled his departure and spent a month conferring with one
faction and then another. Finally he worked out the coalition: Hun
Sen would become the sole prime minister, and Prince Ranariddh
would become president of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   As the king approaches the 58th anniversary of his first
coronation this April, the Cambodian capital has been in the grip
of the latest royal intrigue: who will succeed Sihanouk?
</P>
<P>
   He does not have the power wielded by the late King Hussein of
Jordan, who just weeks before his death stunned his family and
nation by withdrawing the title of crown prince from his brother
and conferring it upon his son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Ranariddh, who has commanded Cambodian troops and served
as co-prime minister in the early 1990s, is easily the best-known
of the princes. But he is not the consensus choice.
</P>
<P>
   Sihanouk's current wife, Queen Monique, is widely suspected to
be collaborating with Prime Minister Hun Sen to arrange for the
eventual accession of the king's oldest son by Monique, Prince
Sihamoni, 46. Sihamoni _ a ballet dancer and U.N. official living
in France -- is viewed by many as a less contentious choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodian constitution leaves it to the Council of the
Throne -- made up of Buddhist leaders and top parliamentary and
government figures -- to choose a male successor from the royal
family within one week of the king's death.
</P>
<P>
   Though few believe it, King Sihanouk insists he won't be part of
the closing drama. ``I have no right to designate (or suggest the
designation of) my successor or a regent,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ These are among the twists and turns in
King Norodom Sihanouk's life:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1941 _ The French-educated prince is placed on the
throne at the age of 18 by Vichy French colonial administrators who
considered him pliable.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1940s _ Sihanouk takes his cousin Norodom(CQ) as his first
official wife and forms liaisons with scores of palace concubines.
``As king, we were not allowed to have more than one queen, but we
were allowed hundreds of mistresses,'' Sihanouk would later tell an
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1952 _ Sihanouk divorces Norodom and takes up with Monique
Izzi, the daughter of a French-Italian father and a Cambodian
mother, whom he spotted in a beauty contest. Monique would become
his lifelong companion and is now his Queen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1953 _ Sihanouk travels to France and convinces a weakened
French government to grant Cambodia independence. He remains bitter
at the United States because the U.S. State Department gave him a
brush-off.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1955 _ The king dumbfounds Cambodia by abdicating in
favor of his father. Retaining his princely prerogatives as
``Citizen Sihanouk,'' he would rule Cambodia as an autocratic prime
minister denying Cambodians democratic rights, but giving them
nearly 15 years of peace, prosperity and international prestige.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1955 _ Resisting American pressure to join the Southeast
Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), Sihanouk becomes a Cold War
neutralist. He reaches world prominence at the Afro-Asian
nonaligned conference in Bandung and befriends Yugoslavia's Tito,
India's Nehru, Indonesia's Sukarno and China's Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1963 _ Angry at American intervention in South Vietnam,
Sihanouk calls on Cambodians to wear red arm bands in celebration
of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and the
deaths of two right-wing Southeast Asian dictators. The three will
``all meet in hell,'' Sihanouk exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1965 _ Bored with statecraft, Sihanouk throws himself into
cinematography, horseback riding and playing jazz saxophone. In the
next four years, he writes, directs, and produces nine feature
films, sometimes acting the romantic lead opposite his wife
Monique.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  By 1966 _ Sihanouk makes a secret military alliance with North
Vietnam, under which the North Vietnamese win permission to station
troops inside Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  October 1967 _ Sihanouk signals a warming with the United
States by receiving the widowed Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy in
Cambodia's famed temples at Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  January 1968 _ Sihanouk tells U.S. diplomat Chester Bowles
that he wouldn't protest if American troops crossed into Cambodia
in ``hot pursuit'' of enemy Vietnamese forces.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1969 _ With Sihanouk silent, President Nixon orders a
secret operation in which B-52s drop 100,000 tons of explosives on
Cambodian villages and Viet Cong strongholds in eastern Cambodia
over four years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1970 _ Sihanouk is overthrown in a military coup led by
Cambodian Gen. Lon Nol. Though the right-wing general had tacit
approval from mid-level U.S. intelligence contacts, no clear
evidence has emerged to support Sihanouk's insistence that the CIA
overthrew him.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1970 _ Sihanouk goes into exile as guest of the Chinese and
North Korean rulers. He serves as figurehead leader of an alliance
of pro-Sihanouk and pro-Chinese guerrillas fighting against the Lon
Nol government. Sihanouk nicknames the latter group the ``Khmer
Rouge'' (Red Cambodians).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1975 _ Ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge guerrillas seize the
Cambodian capitol Phnom Penh, ordering a mass evacuation for forced
labor in the countryside. A murderous reign of terror begins under
the leadership of Pol Pot in which up to 2 million people perish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  September 1975 _ Pressured by the Chinese, the Pol Pot regime
allows Sihanouk to return to Cambodia as its nominal head of state.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1976 _ Upset by sights of destruction, Sihanouk tries to
resign and return to Beijing, but the Pol Pot regime refuses.
Instead, he and Monique begin three years of house arrest inside
the royal palace in Phnom Penh. Sihanouk later says that the Khmer
Rouge occupation led to the deaths of his five children, 14
grandchildren and four cousins.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1979 _ Vietnamese invaders defeat Pol Pot, capture Phnom Penh
and free Sihanouk, who flies out to resume his exile in Beijing.
Sihanouk becomes head of a guerrilla coalition that includes
remnants of the defeated Khmer Rouge. The coalition, now backed
both by the United States and China, aims to end Vietnam's military
occupation of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1991 _ With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Vietnamese
forces pull out of Cambodia. Cambodian factions agree to a United
Nations call for a cease-fire. The following month, Sihanouk
brokers a crucial agreement among the factions that leads to a
peace settlement, along with the decision to place him back on the
throne.

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ These are among the twists and turns in
King Norodom Sihanouk's life:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1941 _ The French-educated prince is placed on the
throne at the age of 18 by Vichy French colonial administrators who
considered him pliable.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1940s _ Sihanouk takes his cousin Norodom(CQ) as his first
official wife and forms liaisons with scores of palace concubines.
``As king, we were not allowed to have more than one queen, but we
were allowed hundreds of mistresses,'' Sihanouk would later tell an
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1952 _ Sihanouk divorces Norodom and takes up with Monique
Izzi, the daughter of a French-Italian father and a Cambodian
mother, whom he spotted in a beauty contest. Monique would become
his lifelong companion and is now his Queen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1953 _ Sihanouk travels to France and convinces a weakened
French government to grant Cambodia independence. He remains bitter
at the United States because the U.S. State Department gave him a
brush-off.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1955 _ The king dumbfounds Cambodia by abdicating in
favor of his father. Retaining his princely prerogatives as
``Citizen Sihanouk,'' he would rule Cambodia as an autocratic prime
minister denying Cambodians democratic rights, but giving them
nearly 15 years of peace, prosperity and international prestige.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1955 _ Resisting American pressure to join the Southeast
Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), Sihanouk becomes a Cold War
neutralist. He reaches world prominence at the Afro-Asian
nonaligned conference in Bandung and befriends Yugoslavia's Tito,
India's Nehru, Indonesia's Sukarno and China's Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1963 _ Angry at American intervention in South Vietnam,
Sihanouk calls on Cambodians to wear red arm bands in celebration
of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and the
deaths of two right-wing Southeast Asian dictators. The three will
``all meet in hell,'' Sihanouk exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1965 _ Bored with statecraft, Sihanouk throws himself into
cinematography, horseback riding and playing jazz saxophone. In the
next four years, he writes, directs, and produces nine feature
films, sometimes acting the romantic lead opposite his wife
Monique.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  By 1966 _ Sihanouk makes a secret military alliance with North
Vietnam, under which the North Vietnamese win permission to station
troops inside Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  October 1967 _ Sihanouk signals a warming with the United
States by receiving the widowed Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy in
Cambodia's famed temples at Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  January 1968 _ Sihanouk tells U.S. diplomat Chester Bowles
that he wouldn't protest if American troops crossed into Cambodia
in ``hot pursuit'' of enemy Vietnamese forces.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1969 _ With Sihanouk silent, President Nixon orders a
secret operation in which B-52s drop 100,000 tons of explosives on
Cambodian villages and Viet Cong strongholds in eastern Cambodia
over four years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1970 _ Sihanouk is overthrown in a military coup led by
Cambodian Gen. Lon Nol. Though the right-wing general had tacit
approval from mid-level U.S. intelligence contacts, no clear
evidence has emerged to support Sihanouk's insistence that the CIA
overthrew him.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1970 _ Sihanouk goes into exile as guest of the Chinese and
North Korean rulers. He serves as figurehead leader of an alliance
of pro-Sihanouk and pro-Chinese guerrillas fighting against the Lon
Nol government. Sihanouk nicknames the latter group the ``Khmer
Rouge'' (Red Cambodians).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  April 1975 _ Ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge guerrillas seize the
Cambodian capitol Phnom Penh, ordering a mass evacuation for forced
labor in the countryside. A murderous reign of terror begins under
the leadership of Pol Pot in which up to 2 million people perish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  September 1975 _ Pressured by the Chinese, the Pol Pot regime
allows Sihanouk to return to Cambodia as its nominal head of state.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1976 _ Upset by sights of destruction, Sihanouk tries to
resign and return to Beijing, but the Pol Pot regime refuses.
Instead, he and Monique begin three years of house arrest inside
the royal palace in Phnom Penh. Sihanouk later says that the Khmer
Rouge occupation led to the deaths of his five children, 14
grandchildren and four cousins.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1979 _ Vietnamese invaders defeat Pol Pot, capture Phnom Penh
and free Sihanouk, who flies out to resume his exile in Beijing.
Sihanouk becomes head of a guerrilla coalition that includes
remnants of the defeated Khmer Rouge. The coalition, now backed
both by the United States and China, aims to end Vietnam's military
occupation of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1991 _ With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Vietnamese
forces pull out of Cambodia. Cambodian factions agree to a United
Nations call for a cease-fire. The following month, Sihanouk
brokers a crucial agreement among the factions that leads to a
peace settlement, along with the decision to place him back on the
throne.

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Sitting on a bamboo-slatted bench, widow
But Lin crumbled dried lumps of cooked rice in a basket and talked
about what she wants to happen to the Khmer Rouge leaders who
brutalized her country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we arrest them, we should cut off their heads,'' said the
52-year-old. ``In fact, if they asked me to do this, I am willing
to do it myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost six children from starvation and my husband and parents
were killed,'' she went on. ``I am still alone today. We cannot
forget that regime. No Cambodian people can forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an outburst seemed incongruous from this fragile-boned
woman in simple clothes and rubber sandals, a poor woman who saves
burned rice.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after the Khmer Rouge fell from power, a day of
judging them approaches. But Lin hopes it will put her anger to
rest.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations team of three legal experts is scheduled this
month to recommend to Secretary General Kofi Annan whether to start
action against the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders living openly in
Cambodia. Some form of international tribunal likely will be
proposed to hear evidence against the men who masterminded the
madness that left as many as two million Cambodians dead in less
than four years, from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all Cambodians, including the leaders of this wary
country, view the prospect of trials with the same longing as the
widow But Lin.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who believe that only justice can release the ghosts
shackling their country often fear justice well might bring new
dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be cautious and consider how to avoid a civil war
before holding any trial,'' said Sau Sisovanna, a Cambodian
economics professor and government adviser, who sadly described
Cambodians as ``hostages to fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that 3,500 wiry guerrilla fighters finally abandoned
their Khmer Rouge jungle camps this month, switching allegiance and
uniforms to the Cambodian army, provided little relief from that
fear.
</P>
<P>
   These were believed to comprise the last sizable groups of
hard-line rebels holding out in jungle military bases. Cambodian
defense officials hailed their ``integration'' into the regular
army as the final dissolution of Khmer Rouge power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet photos of a ceremony in Anlong Veng, a rebel center in north
Cambodia, showed some fighters putting on their new army uniforms
over their old guerrilla fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodia Daily quoted one ex-guerrilla as pronouncing in one
breath, ``The Khmer Rouge is dead,'' but in the next adding that he
would keep his old uniform ``just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Some rebel commanders among the defecting troops were not
convinced they would remain government adherents, admitting they
would be tempted to go back to the bush if their old Khmer Rouge
leaders called on them for support.
</P>
<P>
   The key leaders now are living openly in Pailin, a town on the
Thai border the government virtually ceded them as an enclave when
they began agreeing to lay down their weapons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   These are the men most likely to face any international
judgment, and some have made it clear they will not do so quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Senior leader Leng Sary, once the number three Khmer Rouge
commander, warned that any trial could have disturbing
consequences. His new political union in Pailin issued a statement
that ``in order to make our nation live in peace'' the courts
``should not try this or that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Khmer Rouge were ultra-Maoist communists, who emptied the cities
and forced Cambodians into groveling peasant lives. They killed
almost one-sixth of the population through execution and torture,
and left others to die from starvation, exhaustion and disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge were ousted when Vietnamese troops swooped into
Cambodia in 1979, but thousands who were not killed or captured
continued fighting from jungle hideouts.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Most Cambodians interviewed believed the remaining Khmer Rouge
could not mount a large-scale civil war today, but feared they
could cause plenty of trouble in an unsettled, poverty-stricken
nation that can only pay its teachers the equivalent of (US)$20 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small troops cannot make war, but small troops with a will to
survive, to save their lives, could be a terrible source of
suffering for the country,'' said Ok Serei Sopheak, coordinator of
the Cambodian Center for Conflict Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia's autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has tried to break
the back of Khmer Rouge power by luring leaders and fighters to
defect from their fighting units and peacefully rejoin society,
demanding no accounting from them for the bloody tyranny they
imposed.
</P>
<P>
   His policy of appeasing them finally drew protests at home and
abroad last December, when two of the last major Khmer Rouge
leaders left their jungle hideouts. The prime minister treated them
like visiting dignitaries and suggested the past should be
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   After a public outcry, Hun Sen has vacillated over whether and
how the Khmer Rouge should be tried. Even if there is an
international tribunal, Cambodian government accord will be crucial
to making it work.
</P>
<P>
   Many here believe a trial is essential not only to reconcile the
past, but to assure the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of violence is in the mentality of our people,''
said Thun Sary, 47, the president of a Cambodian human rights group
called Ad Hoc(CQ). ``Impunity is the precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes a trial of Khmer Rouge principals is necessary if
Cambodia ever hopes to rein in its rogue police and military who
still torture and kill, if it expects to end official corruption
and judicial partiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still feel, 'If we have the force, we can do
anything,''' he said. ``We need to do something about this case.''

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Only a few monarchs left in the world
really matter.
</P>
<P>
   And not one has mattered for longer than King Norodom Sihanouk,
Cambodia's master of dramatic intrigue for the last 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Sihanouk acted the playboy king with scores of
mistresses, the self-described ``randy rabbit.'' In the fifties, he
became the father of Cambodian independence from France and the
slippery Cold War neutralist.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixties, he occupied himself as the absolute ruler who
doubled as a film-maker. In the seventies, he became the figurehead
of the genocidal Khmer Rouge guerrillas and then the Khmer Rouge's
gilded prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when Sihanouk was an exiled prince with slim
prospects of reclaiming his country, he was told by former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that he was as good an actor as
Sir Laurence Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sihanouk is back on the throne, playing the most improbable
role of his checkered career.
</P>
<P>
   At 76, history has cast him as the indispensable pacifier in a
country still traumatized by the Vietnam War and the subsequent
butchery of up to 2 million Cambodians in the ``killing fields'' of
the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 12 million Cambodians are frightened that without
the king to balance the factions, Cambodia's 20-year civil war
could burst out again. Others fear that Sihanouk's death would
remove the last roadblock to dictatorial rule by Cambodia's Prime
Minister Hun Sen, a former communist with close ties to Vietnam and
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lucky to have the king around with us,'' says former
government adviser Ok Serei Sopheak, coordinator of the Cambodian
Center for Conflict Resolution. ``But we have to ask ourselves how
to prepare for the day when he is not around. It is too easy every
time there is a problem just to turn to the king to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expected that then-Prince Sihanouk would make so much
difference when the political parties agreed to allow him to
reclaim his throne in 1993, after United Nations-brokered
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was head of Cambodia's 800-year-old royal family and a
descendant of Cambodia's great 12th century god-king Jayavarman
VII, he was relegated by the new constitution to ``reign but not
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides that handicap, Sihanouk had been beset with colon
cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and several minor strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last six years, Sihanouk has emerged as a mixture
of Machiavellian politician and godlike Buddhist patriarch who is
summoned at the last moment by the squabbling politicians to save
his 12 million ``children'' from chaos. And for now, his cancer has
gone into remission.
</P>
<P>
   The king commands no armies. But when he enters a room, his
subjects kneel and try to touch him. When he wants to tame the
rival factions, he often does it by pulling one of his virtuoso
dramatic exits.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, King Sihanouk brought Prime Minister Hun Sen to heel
when he suddenly left his palace for the airport and caught a
commercial flight to Beijing, ostensibly for routine medical
treatment in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stay in Cambodia with those republicans because they
are terribly unjust and barbarous to me,'' complained Sihanouk, in
a message to his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   At first, a newspaper loyal to Hun Sen chastised Sihanouk,
saying if he couldn't be a full-time king, he should ``let someone
else be a real king for Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week later, Hun Sen backed down. ``We want to invite him
back,'' said the prime minister. ``The presence of the king is very
important for the continuity of the state . . . I beg the
newspapers not to criticize the king so harshly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Sihanouk's importance increased. Another round of
elections produced an uncomfortably narrow edge for Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party over the royalist FUNCINPEC party, led by
the king's 54-year-old eldest son Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, almost all ministries were paralyzed by
factional struggles, as the two main parties resisted a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
   With rumors of coups roiling the city, the king put out the word
that he was leaving Cambodia for medical treatment in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen all but begged Sihanouk not to leave the country until a
government was formed. ``If the king leaves, we will miss legal
procedure,'' said a spokesman for Hun Sen. ``For example, who would
be the acting head of state if one were needed?''
</P>
<P>
   After a show of reluctance worthy of Shakespeare's Hamlet, the
king canceled his departure and spent a month conferring with one
faction and then another. Finally he worked out the coalition: Hun
Sen would become the sole prime minister, and Prince Ranariddh
would become president of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   As the king approaches the 58th anniversary of his first
coronation this April, the Cambodian capital has been in the grip
of the latest royal intrigue: who will succeed Sihanouk?
</P>
<P>
   He does not have the power wielded by the late King Hussein of
Jordan, who just weeks before his death stunned his family and
nation by withdrawing the title of crown prince from his brother
and conferring it upon his son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Ranariddh, who has commanded Cambodian troops and served
as co-prime minister in the early 1990s, is easily the best-known
of the princes. But he is not the consensus choice.
</P>
<P>
   Sihanouk's current wife, Queen Monique, is widely suspected to
be collaborating with Prime Minister Hun Sen to arrange for the
eventual accession of the king's oldest son by Monique, Prince
Sihamoni, 46. Sihamoni _ a ballet dancer and U.N. official living
in France -- is viewed by many as a less contentious choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodian constitution leaves it to the Council of the
Throne -- made up of Buddhist leaders and top parliamentary and
government figures -- to choose a male successor from the royal
family within one week of the king's death.
</P>
<P>
   Though few believe it, King Sihanouk insists he won't be part of
the closing drama. ``I have no right to designate (or suggest the
designation of) my successor or a regent,'' he said.

SETBACKS HAVE TO BE FACED TO BE OVERCOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In the moments after Ben Flaim opened the oh-so-thin letter
from Dartmouth College that told him he had not been accepted, he
remembers being hit with a second disappointment. ``The first thing
my mom said was, `Don't worry, it's not the end of the world' ,''
says Flaim. ``To me, it was a big deal, a very big deal, and here
she was discounting my feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaim is now a very happy junior at Boston University. That he
remembers his mother's words three years later highlights a
developmental need that often escapes parents: A child who
experiences disappointment can't get past it unless she has the
chance to face it. Our first job is to acknowledge the loss, not
try to cheer her up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't validate feelings, you negate them. It comes
across as a lack of understanding: `Mom doesn't get it,' '' says
developmental psychologist John Dacey of Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   This is true for any age child, for any disappointment, but the
advice is especially relevant for parents of high school seniors.
With some time yet before college envelopes arrive, Harvard
developmental psychologist Janine Bempechat urges parents to set
the stage for the possibility of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that you need to be a pessimist _ ``I don't think
you're going to get in'' _ because a child hears that as, ``Dad
doesn't believe in me.' But, says Bempechat, ``You could say, `This
is a great thing to try for, but you'll still be the same great
person even if it doesn't work out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That reality dose is as important for parents as children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the problem for the child isn't her own
disappointment, but the parent's,'' says Karen Levin Coburn,
assistant vice chancellor for students at Washington University in
St. Louis. She urges parents not to be overly invested in any one
college, or for that matter, in anything a child strives for, from
private school to a slot on a sports team.
</P>
<P>
   (at)5The burden of failure
</P>
<P>
   (at)7 ``It's a terrible burden when a child thinks he has failed
you,'' says Coburn. She is author of ``Letting Go: A Parent's Guide
to Understanding the College Years'' (Harper Perennial).
</P>
<P>
   For a teen, rejection from your first choice is more than a
horrible disappointment. ``He truly thinks his life is ruined,''
says psychologist Frances K. Grossman of Boston University. Dacey
says, ``He feels like a nonperson, a nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Our first instinct is to take that pain away and let them know
they are still a somebody. That's an important message, but not
just yet, says Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting when they are young, we tend to shield them from
disappointment. We distract them, we make something not happen.
That's a disservice,'' says Grossman. ``It doesn't give them the
coping skills they need for life's daily disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Begin the training early. ``If a 4-year-old isn't invited to a
birthday party, instead of saying, `We'll go skating that day and
have a better time than all those kids,' acknowledge that it feels
lousy. Help her to sit with the feelings and digest them: `You're
disappointed, aren't you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that's all you say, you have done something important:
established credibility. You're saying to your child, ``I know how
this feels, I understand you.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many parents are afraid to do this. ``They think
if they support a child's feelings, she'll think it really is a
catastrophe and not get beyond it. But kids don't work that way,
according to Dacey; they need to experience the present before they
can look to the future. There's also a difference between saying,
``Yes, you're right, this is as bad as you think it is,'' and, ``I
can understand how you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's subtle, but they hear it,'' Dacey says.
</P>
<P>
   The more you tolerate your child's sadness, the more you enable
them to, too. There are pitfalls, though. Empathize but not to the
point of taking over the disappointment. ``Don't go on and on about
how awful you feel,'' says Coburn. ``You rob him of his right to
feel badly.'' If you have a pattern of overreacting, he may not
even tell you he's upset. ``Your response can be frightening or
just plain aggravating,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean you can't be honest. ``It's OK to share your
disappointment as long as you do it in a way that also shows how
you're coping,'' says Grossman. In the case of a college rejection,
for instance, she might say, `` `I was hoping you could go there
because it's where I went, so I'm sad. But I'll get over it and
help you figure out the next step.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The way we handle our disappointments is critical, says
Bempechat, who is author of ``Against All Odds: How `At-Risk'
Students Exceed Expectations'' (Jossey-Bass). ``We're helping a
child develop a coping repertoire,'' she says. ``Whether we lash
out in anger or sit with a cup of tea and talk develops a different
mind-set in our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dacey tells parents to be prepared to stay in the empathy mode
longer than we expect. ``It takes as long as it takes,'' he says,
two hours or two days. ``Don't be in a rush.'' If you have been
impatient in the past with a child who you think is too easily
crushed by setbacks, this strategy may enable him to move on more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A good rule of thumb is to wait until he's no longer furious or
crying. Crying, Dacey adds, is something parents should encourage,
even for boys. ``Tears are literally loaded with adrenaline. The
crying expels the excess adrenaline so you can think clearly
again,'' he says. Physical activity helps, too.
</P>
<P>
   Once she's calm, encourage her to talk: ``How are you feeling?''
``What are you thinking?'' ``I know you're not ready to talk now,
but whenever you are, I'm ready to listen.'' Be prepared for some
pretty strong, even dramatic answers, including from young
children: ``My life is ruined!'' ``I'll never have friends!''
``I'll never go to college!''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the feelings, rephrase them without judgment: ``You're
worried no one likes you, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   The last step is to empower a child by helping him see he has
choices still available. ``Sometimes this requires a new way of
thinking about something,'' says Dacey, whose newest book,
``Understanding Creativity'' (Jossey-Bass), covers that subject.
</P>
<P>
   Start with general comments: ``OK, let's dust ourselves off and
figure out options.'' Leave it to him to come up with actual
solutions, though. ``As soon as you say, `I always liked your
safety school better,' he'll discard the idea,'' says Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you can float ideas, as long as they are only
suggestions: ``What about visiting that school again?'' The more
thoughts on the table, the more in control a child begins to feel.
With college, for instance, Coburn says, ``Talk through the pros
and cons of second vs. third choice so a child feels like she can
go someplace else not by default but by choice.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ben Flaim, two things helped him almost immediately. After
he read his rejection letter, he took the train from his home in
Queens, N.Y., back to school in Manhattan to tell his guidance
counselor. ``The hour alone on the train gave me time to think,''
he says. Once there, the guidance counselor called Dartmouth to ask
what had been his downfall. It was his SATs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a concrete reason helped,'' Flaim says.
</P>
<P>
   Dacey endorses calling the school. ``Let's say you learn
enrollment is up 25 percent this year, as it is at BC, and that in
a different year, you might have gotten in. That can take the sting
out of rejection and even give you options: Maybe you want to
reapply next year,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week after his rejection, Flaim was accepted at BU, his
safety school. In hindsight, he says it was the best thing that
happened. ``At BU, I could major in English and minor in music. I
couldn't have done that at Dartmouth,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As good as things have worked out and as supportive as his
parents were about BU, there's one thing that nags at Flaim: ``I
was worried I wouldn't get into any college, I had no idea what
would happen to me, and here were my parents being really calm,
saying I'd get in somewhere. That took pressure off me so it was
helpful, but if they had just said, `I understand why you're so
upset,' that would have made it easier.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DEALING WITH DISAPPOINTMENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Nonverbal messages can be very supportive: a pat on the back,
a hug, a sympathetic facial expression.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't take it personally if your child gets on the phone with
his best friend to talk about his disappointment before he talks to
you. Anything that helps him process it is valuable.
</P>
<P>
   --If you have a history of being judgmental or unsympathetic,
tell a child of any age: ``I know last time you were disappointed I
wasn't very supportive. I hope you'll try me again next time; I'm
going to try to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   --Relate setbacks you experienced as a child. Talk about what
happened and how bad you felt, but don't moralize unless your child
asks you, ``So what did you learn?''
</P>
<P>
   --Whether you agree or disagree with your child's reaction to a
setback doesn't matter; the feelings are real to him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ Once a baby reaches 26 inches tall and shows an
interest in climbing, he is at risk for falling out of his crib,
according to research at Temple University. Crib manufacturers'
current recommendations say infants are safe in cribs until they
are 35 inches. The research suggests manufacturers increase the
side height of cribs.

Wednesday, Feb. 17:
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-VINEGAR (Healdsburg, Calif.) _ Like a nurse bending over
cradle after cradle of sleeping infants, Paul Bertolli hovered
tenderly over the oak barrels in his loft above a small barn in
Sonoma County. For a decade, the 300-square-foot attic, banked with
neat wood bunks of barrels, has been the nursery for the aceto
balsamico that Bertolli is raising in the ancient Italian manner.

   WINE-HALF-BOTTLES (New York) _ She's ordered oysters. He's
ordered foie gras. The sommelier approaches. Tension mounts. What
wine? This question haunts the thinking portion of humankind. The
lone diner searches futilely for a wine that will split the
difference between a delicate shellfish appetizer, hard-wired for
chablis, and a lusty, truffly main course that has red Burgundy
written all over it. For two diners, a bottle each of red and white
is too much to drink. In most restaurants, the wines by the glass
are too humble to make a serious contribution to the meal. Unlike
the mind-body problem, the meat-fish problem has a solution. It's
the half bottle. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   NY-EXECUTIVE-CHEF (New York) _ By eight o'clock one evening last
week, a blizzard of orders were flying into the kitchen at
Lespinasse in the St. Regis and the cooks were ``getting slammed,''
as one of them put it. Christian Delouvrier, who became the
executive chef of the restaurant last summer, had shed his tall
white toque and was in the thick of it. Delouvrier has cooked in
Manhattan at the three-star level for nearly 20 years, but he is
relatively unknown to most New Yorkers. By Florence Fabricant.

VIETNAM VETERAN HONORED FOR ROLE IN KEY BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Thirty-one years after the Tet offensive in
Vietnam, Air Force veteran Alonzo J. Coggins still bears burn
scars, graying hair covers a bullet-size crease in his skull and a
slice of metal remains embedded under the skin above his right
knee.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no forgetting the sight and sound of swarms of enemy
soldiers in black uniforms advancing in the dead of night. But it
could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Bunker 051 was a front-row seat to the Tet offensive that
Coggins, then an airman 1st class, inexplicably survived, even
after waves of enemy attacks, tank and mortar fire, and deadly
aerial assaults ordered by American commanders desperate to avoid
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only one who got out alive,'' Coggins, 53, said
Friday. ``God placed angels around me to get out of the hell that I
went through.''
</P>
<P>
   A wily survivor, Coggins was an obscure hero until Lt. Gen.
David W. McIlvoy awarded him the Silver Star and Purple Heart
Friday at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   As a mostly military crowd of 250 cheered and applauded, Coggins
followed his salute of McIlvoy with a wave of a hand, followed by a
thumbs-up and a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I'm going to treasure for the rest of my
life,'' Coggins, a retired railroad machinist from Jamaica, N.Y.,
told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He received the medals years ago in the mail, but never received
them in a formal presentation as typically done by the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an emotional day,'' said McIlvoy, vice commander of
the Air Education and Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base
near New Braunfels, Texas, and a veteran pilot of B-52 raids over
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an experience, a saga, that's a part of our
history,'' said Brig. Gen. Richard A. Coleman, the Air Force
Security Forces Center commander and a Vietnam veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``And today this event recaptures some of the dedication and
sacrifice that some of those guys made, because Mr. Coggins here
was the only guy to come out of that bunker alive,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for the Tan Son Nhut Air Base just northwest of
Saigon began around 3:30 a.m. Jan. 31, 1968, as a force of more
than 1,500 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong waded into a smaller
group of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Troops with the 377th Security Police Squadron had been placed
on red alert only hours earlier after Lt. Col. Billy Jack Carter
and then-Maj. Carl Bender agreed that an attack was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt they were going to sucker us into something,'' Bender
said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next eight furious hours of battle, Bunker 051 would be
a vortex of violence, with Coggins first fighting, then playing
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old airman was manning the bunker with four others
when the North Vietnamese broke the annual holiday truce by
launching the huge Tet offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Coggins said enemy troops opened the battle with mortar rounds,
blasting a nearby bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see and hear them as they walked across a rice
paddy,'' he said. ``It was scary, very scary. You were in a fixed
position. What could you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Coggins and his men fought back and radioed information that
helped commanders launch a counterattack. They battled until the
bunker was hit by enemy rocket fire, killing everyone but Coggins.
</P>
<P>
   With enemy troops using captured American weapons and a
storehouse of ammunition in the bunker, Bender made the tough
choice to direct an airstrike on the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made in my
life,'' said Bender, a 69-year-old retired lieutenant colonel who
presented Coggins with a U.S. flag during Friday's ceremony. ``I
had to assume they were all dead.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reasonable assumption for Tan Son Nhut survivors Bob
Ott and Pat Bowden. The Americans were outgunned and outmanned, but
``also fought better,'' said Bowden, a retired Air Force chief
master sergeant living in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we were luckier, too,'' added Ott, then a 28-year-old
staff sergeant now living in Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Scarred by metal fragments that broke through his face for more
than 20 years after that battle, the crafty Coggins played dead and
prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total God's miracle that man is alive today,'' Ott
said.

YEAR 2000 PROBLEM IS OLD STUFF IN THE YEAR OF THE RABBIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _20John Kim doesn't like to discuss it, but
there's no getting around it: he was born in the Year of the
Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pleasure being a bunny,'' he said. ``At work, you
want to be taken seriously. If I was a dragon, I'd be saying,
`Don't mess with me.' But since I'm a bunny, I can't say
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbits do have their charms _ sentimental, emotional, romantic,
smart and persuasive _ and this is their year. By the Chinese lunar
calendar, Tuesday was the first day of 4697, time to say goodbye to
the tiger and hello to the rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese zodiac, which is also used by Koreans, Vietnamese
and Tibetans, has 12 animals which rotate through a 12-year cycle.
Famous rabbits include Albert Einstein, Andy Warhol, Fidel Castro,
Marie Curie, Helen Hunt and Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   By the Tibetan lunar calendar, which calculates the months
slightly differently, the new year, or Losar, begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On new year's eve, some families make offerings of fruit and
other food to their ancestors at an altar they have set up in their
homes. Tibetans make ``dresil,'' cooked rice with raisins and
sugar, which they consider very auspicious.
</P>
<P>
   While Kim, 23, a youth development coordinator for the Korean
Community Center of the East Bay, is not thrilled with his
astrological sign, he does cop to a few rabbit traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to admit it: I do like carrots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he can hop, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can jump pretty high, you know, on the basketball court,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim also thinks of himself as pretty romantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that I'm not, but I think I am,'' said Kim, who
lives in Oakland. ``I think you need money to be romantic, and you
need more time. Those are two things I don't have. (Otherwise) I'd
be swooning the ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Sung, a San Francisco astrology and feng shui consultant
who also owns a real estate business, predicted instability and
wars this year, just like in the rabbit year of 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more problems in the Middle East,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for rabbit people, they will have to make their own luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time it's their own sign, it's either very good or very
bad,'' Sung said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese zodiac differs from its Chinese counterpart by
just one animal: They consider this the Year of the Cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnamese like the cat,'' said astrologer Vuong Van
Truong. ``They say the cat is kind, but when they want to catch and
bite, they're very clever and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Truong is well-known among the Vietnamese in San Francisco, who
often like to consult astrologers for important events, such as
determining an auspicious date for a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Around Tet, as the Vietnamese new year is known, he expects a
lot of customers who will want to learn what good news may be
coming up and how they can avoid bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Vietnamese saying: `Good behavior can win
destiny,''' said Truong, whose father and grandfather were both
astrologers in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Lan Do, a board member of the Vietnamese Community Center in San
Francisco who also runs her own translation business, said she is
not superstitious but does believe she has many of the cat traits
of her zodiac sign, such as being sentimental and romantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can cry easily if I watch a soap opera or some movie,
especially a drama,'' said Do, 47. ``Most of the time, my children
bring a box of Kleenex next to me.''

   CALIF-VINEGAR (Healdsburg, Calif.) _ Like a nurse bending over
cradle after cradle of sleeping infants, Paul Bertolli hovered
tenderly over the oak barrels in his loft above a small barn in
Sonoma County. For a decade, the 300-square-foot attic, banked with
neat wood bunks of barrels, has been the nursery for the aceto
balsamico that Bertolli is raising in the ancient Italian manner.

   WINE-HALF-BOTTLES (New York) _ She's ordered oysters. He's
ordered foie gras. The sommelier approaches. Tension mounts. What
wine? This question haunts the thinking portion of humankind. The
lone diner searches futilely for a wine that will split the
difference between a delicate shellfish appetizer, hard-wired for
chablis, and a lusty, truffly main course that has red Burgundy
written all over it. For two diners, a bottle each of red and white
is too much to drink. In most restaurants, the wines by the glass
are too humble to make a serious contribution to the meal. Unlike
the mind-body problem, the meat-fish problem has a solution. It's

executive chef of the restaurant last summer, had shed his tall
white toque and was in the thick of it. Delouvrier has cooked in

TANGY CHICKEN IN A CRISPY SKIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prepared mustard is about as underappreciated as a staple can
be. It's all-natural (or pretty much so), completely fat-free,
ridiculously low in calories and notably high in flavor. But
despite these qualities, its main role in most households is as a
condiment for meat or perhaps as an ingredient in vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeknight chicken dish presented here, however _
essentially broiled chicken smeared with a spicy mustard paste _ it
plays a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   In cooking, the term ``deviled'' has several meanings, but it
most often implies a preparation with a sharp flavor, most often
derived from mustard, vinegar, cayenne or other chilies.
</P>
<P>
   In this dish, you don't need vinegar, because there is plenty of
acidity in Dijon mustard. Nor, strictly speaking, do you need
cayenne (and I omit it when cooking for children); the taste is
strong without it.
</P>
<P>
   I wrestled with the technique for this dish for a while before
hitting on one that worked. If you coat chicken before cooking, you
simply cannot get a crisp skin. Broiling coated chicken almost
insures a quick burn, and baking guarantees sogginess.
</P>
<P>
   So I broil the chicken plain, skin side up, until it's crisp.
(This has another advantage: You can prepare the coating after
beginning to cook the chicken, which cuts down on preparation
time.)
</P>
<P>
   Then I turn it over, flavor the underside and let that side cook
for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After coating the top, I return the chicken to the broiler for a
final browning; the result is crisp but not burned.
</P>
<P>
   You can make this dish with chicken breasts if you prefer; I
recommend bone-in breasts, which follow the same procedure.
</P>
<P>
   For boneless, skinless breasts _ forget crispness, of course _
smear the meat all over with the mustard mixture, then broil it for
just about six minutes, turning two or three times to prevent
burning.
</P>
<P>
   DEVILED CHICKEN THIGHS
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   8 chicken thighs, or a mixture of thighs and drumsticks
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup minced shallots, onion or scallion
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper or Tabasco sauce, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Minced parsley for garnish, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat the broiler to its maximum, and set the rack about 4
inches from the heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper on
both sides, and place it in a pan, skin side up. Broil, watching
carefully, until the skin is golden brown, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, combine the mustard, shallots and cayenne. (If you
have a small food processor, you can chop the shallots by throwing
them in with the mustard and pulsing the machine on and off a few
times.)
</P>
<P>
   3. When the chicken has browned, remove it from oven, and turn
it. Spread just a teaspoon or so of the mustard mixture on the
underside of the chicken, and broil about 5 minutes. Turn the
chicken, and spread the remaining mixture on the upper, or skin
side. Broil until mustard begins to brown.
</P>
<P>
   4. At this point, the chicken may be done. (There will be only
the barest trace of pink near the bone; an instant-read thermometer
inserted into the meat will read 160 degrees.) If it is not done,
turn off the broiler and leave the chicken in the oven 5 more
minutes or so. Garnish and serve. &QL;

<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

GOOD OL' BOY ROY D. MERCER'S ON A RAMPAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Name the funniest men in America.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Foxworthy? Yep.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rock? Adam Sandler? No question.
</P>
<P>
   But to this august list must be added Roy D. Mercer, a
consistently angry good ol' boy from Tulsa who spends much of his
life calling up people who he thinks have wronged him or owe him
money (usually both) and threatening them, often punctuating his
missives with the question ``How big'a boy are ya?'' This is
Roy-speak for not caring how big you are, he's gonna come right
down and put a pop-knot on your head, just as soon as you give him
directions to where you are.
</P>
<P>
   Roy D. Mercer, however, does not, technically, exist. Rather, he
is the brainchild of two Tulsa DJs, Brent Douglas and Phil Stone,
who hit upon the idea of a perpetually angry Everyman as a
ratings-booster for their station, KMOD-FM, back in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, Mercer's calls have been collected on five CDs, the
first four of which have sold more than a million combined copies
and stayed on the Billboard comedy chart for 89 straight weeks.
(The fifth came out Jan. 26). Last week's SoundScan report found
all four among the 10 most popular comedy CDs in the country, right
up there with Sandler and Seinfeld and Bill Engvall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a voyeuristic deal,'' says Douglas, who does
Mercer's voice. ``Everybody's been bent out of shape or gotten a
call from somebody who's bent out of shape. And everybody knows
somebody or is related to somebody like Roy.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy began life as a composite of various uncles and dads and
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hearing `How big'a boy are ya?' since I was
knee-high to a grasshopper,'' Stone says. ``I got uncles right now
that can put a good fistfight on you. It's just _ growing up _
people we knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early days, Stone and Douglas called people they
knew and unleashed Roy on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this until we ran out of friends,'' Stone says.
</P>
<P>
   Then they began taking nominations from listeners. The two would
sketch out an idea for what Mercer might say, and Douglas would
pick up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   A typical bit would be Mercer calling the administration office
of a mall and complaining that his wife, Sharon Gene, had slipped
in a puddle of something while the two were at the food court. She
has whiplash, and he has doctor bills that need to be paid _
pronto.
</P>
<P>
   Another one involved a music store where Mercer had purchased a
pair of drumsticks for his son, Raymond. His daughter, Leteesha,
somehow stuck a drumstick up her nose, the nylon tip came off, and
Mercer has doctor bills that need paying _ pronto.
</P>
<P>
   Some people get frustrated; others (invariably men) get angry.
Over the years, Stone and Douglas have learned one lesson: Watch
for people who are trying to be genuinely vengeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful,'' says Douglas. ``Words like `ex-wife'
or `stepfather,' you can tell if there's a real vendetta going on.
We try to avoid those. You might really be getting in the middle of
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The bits became so popular that they were collected on two CDs
and sold at a local auto-parts store. But there also were bootleg
copies everywhere _ particularly in truck stops. In 1996, Scott
Hendricks, at the time president and CEO of Capitol Nashville,
heard a bootleg record and was impressed enough to call the
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really weird,'' says Stone. ``I just got a message from
Scott Hendricks from Capitol Records, and I figured it was just
some guy who wanted us to play a record, so I nearly threw it in
the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   But he called back, and in February 1997 ``How Big'A Boy Are Ya?
Volume One'' and ``How Big'A Boy Are Ya? Volume Two'' came out.
Volume three followed in October 1997 and four in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Stone and Douglas are talking about turning the calls into an
animated TV show. Suggests Stone: ``It'd be like `King of the Hill'
with attitude.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DeLoach Vineyards Zinfandel 1997, Russian River Valley, Calif.
About $18.
</P>
<P>
   Deloach zinfandels are the defensive linemen of California wine.
They don't weigh 300 pounds, but the alcoholic content of some of
them, 16 percent and occasionally more, is the vinous equivalent of
football brawn. These are not wines for the faint-hearted, but then
very few zinfandels have ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we are talking about genuine red zinfandel here, not
the wimpy white stuff that is actually pink. A number of the
DeLoach zinfandels come from separate vineyards on the estate. This
one is a blend of wine from most of those vineyards, from vines
planted from 1895 to 1934.
</P>
<P>
   The wine has about 8 percent petite sirah in it, has spent 10
months in oak barrels and was bottled on the estate in August 1997.
Some 8,000 cases were made, so it should not be too hard to find.
It will go well with most hearty dishes, including game. Zinfandel
does not have a track record for aging like cabernet sauvignon, but
this wine will almost certainly be more elegant two or three years
from now.

SALTING COD IN A ROBUST TWIST ON POT-AU-FEU 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the third of eight columns by Rick Moonen, the executive
chef and an owner of Oceana in Manhattan. His collaborator on these
columns is Dorie Greenspan.  
 By RICK MOONEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This dish is my fish version of the classic meat stews known as
pot-au-feu in France, bollito misto in Italy or New England boiled
dinner here. In each of these, the broth is savory, the vegetables
generous and the meat big and important. And every version has its
pungent horseradish sauce.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was the sauce that inspired me to make cod-au-feu.
When I was the saucier at Le Cirque, we made bollito misto weekly,
and I made the horseradish sauce.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think I'd tire of the dish, the sauce or both, but when a
combination is this good, you just want more. To turn this classic
meat dish into a robust fish stew, the sauce would be key. So, I
kept its sharpness but added a handful of parsley to refresh the
palate after the first hit of horseradish and to draw the sauce and
other elements together.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetables are pot-au-feu perennials, sturdy root
vegetables. For the broth, I like to use a good chicken stock, but
this dish will be fine even if you use water. Just don't skip the
bacon. You need its smokiness, fat and fragrance; it provides the
underlying warmth of the dish and ties it to its roots.
</P>
<P>
   But the center of attention is the cod, which is poached atop
the vegetables and served surrounded by them. I'm a fan of cod,
fresh and salted. I love salt cod's texture _ think flaky brandade
_ and wanted to get that into the dish but also keep fresh cod's
clean taste. I got both by salting fresh cod. Thinking about how
meat is dry-aged and how its texture improves with aging, I lightly
salted the cod and refrigerated it overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The salt removes some of the moisture, creates a flakier texture
and concentrates the flavor. These fillets hold their own against
the root vegetables, stand up to the sauce and make the dish every
bit as satisfying as the classic from which it came.
</P>
<P>
   COD-AU-FEU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes, plus 24 hours' refrigeration
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   4 skinless cod fillets, each about 6 ounces and cut } inch thick
</P>
<P>
   1 small bunch parsley, stems reserved and leaves finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   20 white peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces double-smoked slab bacon, cut into 1-by-\-inch strips
</P>
<P>
   { small head green cabbage, cut into quarters, cored and then
cut into 1-by-3-inch strips
</P>
<P>
   3{ cups chicken broth or water
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   16 pearl onions, trimmed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   4 small Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and halved
</P>
<P>
   3 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, trimmed,
washed and cut diagonally into {-inch-thick slices
</P>
<P>
   2 medium white turnips, peeled, halved and cut into {-inch-thick
slices
</P>
<P>
   2 medium carrots, peeled, trimmed and cut diagonally into
\-inch-thick slices
</P>
<P>
   } cup creme fraiche (see note)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup bottled white horseradish, drained, with liquid reserved
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground white pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. On the day before serving, sprinkle a light dusting of kosher
salt on both sides of each cod fillet. Wrap fillets in plastic
wrap, and refrigerate for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Make a sachet by placing parsley
stems, peppercorns, thyme, garlic and bay leaf in a double
thickness of cheesecloth, folding into a packet and tying with
kitchen string.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place over medium heat a 12-inch saute pan with tight-fitting
lid, or a large flame-proof casserole. Add bacon, and cook until it
starts to render fat but doesn't color, about 1 minute. Place
sachet in center of pan, and spread cabbage evenly over surface of
pan. Add half the broth, and salt to taste. Cover, and bring to
boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer for 5 minutes. Layer onions,
potatoes, leeks, turnips and carrots in the pan, and add rest of
broth. Cover, and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer for 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place cod fillets on top of the layered vegetables in the
pan; the liquid will not cover the fillets. Cover pan, and place in
oven. Bake until fish is opaque in center and starts to flake, for
6 to 8 minutes. While fish is baking, prepare horseradish cream.
</P>
<P>
   5. To prepare horseradish cream: In medium bowl, whisk creme
fraiche until it holds peaks. Using a rubber spatula, fold in
parsley, horseradish and mustard. Add a little of the reserved
horseradish liquid to thin the sauce and sharpen its flavor; the
sauce should have the consistency of mousse. Season with salt and
pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve, spoon equal amount of vegetables and bacon into
each of four wide soup plates. Place a fillet in center of each
plate, spoon over some broth, and top each fillet with generous
spoonful of sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Creme fraiche is sold in specialty food stores. A
substitute can be made by mixing equal parts heavy cream and sour
cream, and setting aside at room temperature for 24 hours. Chill
until needed. &QL;

<P>
   And now for the fabulous 1997 Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Fabulous 1997s? That is not, I hasten to state, my description.
It comes from Orley Ashenfelter, wine iconoclast and bane of the
wine establishment, who is once again making waves with his
contrarian views.
</P>
<P>
   Ashenfelter is an economist _ the Joseph Douglas Green Professor
of Economics at Princeton University _ who judges wines with the
tools of his trade rather than with the traditional taste-and-sniff
techniques of the orthodox experts.
</P>
<P>
   For him, it's all in the numbers. Rather than slog through damp,
chilly cellars, he sits down at his computer, feeds in data about
heat, frost and rainfall in the Bordeaux wine country and comes up
with his predictions about what that year's wine will be like. On
the whole, his prognostications over the past two decade have been
consistently accurate.
</P>
<P>
   He publishes his often controversial findings twice a year in
Liquid Assets, a newsletter geared to serious wine buyers who
follow the prices wines command at auction. In his January issue,
he singled out for high praise the 1997 and 1998 vintages in
Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in the wine trade wants to admit it,'' he writes, ``but
the 1997 red Bordeaux vintage is the best since the great duo of
1989 and 1990. And now, hot on the heels of the fabulous 1997s,
Mother Nature has produced an excellent 1998 vintage as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Robert M. Parker Jr. and Steven Tanzer, and
columnists in the Wine Spectator and Decanter magazines, while not
entirely disagreeing with Ashenfelter about the 1997s, have been
considerably more circumspect. Parker called the wines ``well-made,
soft, user-friendly'' and suggested that buyers would hardly be
``knocked out by their depth or flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Decanter, a British publication, said ``the overall impression
is of attractive, fruity wines, with charm rather than intensity _
certainly a vintage for drinking ahead of the 1996s and 1995s.''
</P>
<P>
   The general conclusion among these critics is that the 1997s
will be attractive to drink when released but will not age as well
as the more intense, more tannic wines of 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing that the 1997s are ``very, very ripe,'' Ashenfelter
writes: ``This early drinkability will no doubt lead to many
concerns about the longevity. For the modern wine lover, we think
that these concerns are misplaced.'' Noting that the 1982 and 1983
vintages were also very ripe when released but are now considered
to be among the top vintages of the 80s, he says that ``well-stored
wines from the 1997 vintage will last just as long and they will
deliver even greater pleasure along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stripped to its essentials, his hypothesis runs something like
this: hot growing seasons with a minimum of rain at harvest time
produce the best wines. When the rains come just before picking, as
they often do, the grapes absorb the water and lose concentration.
He goes back to the earliest records of Bordeaux weather conditions
to support his claims.
</P>
<P>
   Using the weather as an indicator of what the wines will be
enables Ashenfelter to talk about very young wines, like the 1998s,
which haven't even been blended yet and won't be bottled for
another year. Noting that the hot, dry summer was followed by heavy
September rain, he concludes that '98s, ``although ripe enough to
make excellent wines, will not hit the heights achieved in 1989,
1990 or 1997.'' He compares them to the '95s, ``ripe wines with
good but not outstanding concentration of fruit extracts.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998s, he predicts, will not measure up to the '97s but will
be ``forward wines that can be drunk with pleasure early on.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing 1997 with 1990 and 1995, both outstanding vintages,
will irk some more orthodox enophiles. Indeed, Ashenfelter asserts
that the 1997s will be better than the 1996s, '95s and '94s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are better than all the vintages of the decade of the
1980s with the possible exception of 1989,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Better than 1982 and 1983? Better than 1988? Well, time _ along
with the Ashenfelter charts _ will tell.
</P>
<P>
   As for price, Ashenfelter believes the 1997s could command
prices comparable to what the 1989s are getting at auctions. He
thinks the two are similar in quality and that 1989 was the last
Bordeaux vintage that still represents a good buy.
</P>
<P>
   He could be right. The 1989s from top chateaus like Chateaux
Latour, Mouton-Rothschild and Margaux are selling for $125 a bottle
or more at the auctions, and prices on future contracts being
quoted for the 1997s by some merchants are not too far from that.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry-Lehmann in New York, for example, is asking $150 a bottle
for the 1997 Lafite-Rothschild, for Mouton-Rothschild and for
Latour, and $153 for Margaux.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers of wine futures contracts look forward to seeing their
wines appreciate in value over a long period. If the 1997s are
early maturing wines, it's unlikely that they will appeal to too
many of those buyers. Unless, of course, they are dedicated
followers of Orley Ashenfelter.

ANTI-ORGANIC, AND FLAWED

   Dennis T. Avery wants organic food to go away. And he doesn't
care what it takes. Four years ago, he said that organic food could
not feed the world without destroying the environment. Now, he says
it's lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the fall issue of American Outlook magazine,
published by his employer, the Hudson Institute, a conservative
research group, Avery wrote, ``Organic foods have clearly become
the deadliest food choice.'' This is the case, he said, because
organic farms use animal manure and do not use chemicals or permit
pasteurization. The last assertion is untrue, as were several other
statements in the article.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation might have gone unnoticed, but excerpts from the
article were published in The Wall Street Journal and continue to
be picked up around the country, by The Associated Press, The Tampa
Tribune and trade industry publications.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest definition of ``organic'' is food grown without
hormones, pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. Avery, however, used
the terms ``organic,'' ``free-range,'' ``natural'' and
``unpasteurized'' interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grant you that I've mixed together natural and organic,''
Avery, the author of ``Saving the Planet With Pesticides and
Plastic'' (Hudson Institute, 1995), said in an interview last week.
``But to me they are distinctions without significant difference in
terms of public health.''
</P>
<P>
   His most combative accusation is based, he said, on 1996 data
compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showing
that ``people who eat organic and `natural' foods are eight times
as likely as the rest of the population to be attacked by a deadly
new strain of E. coli bacteria (O157:H7).''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some of the foods that caused the outbreak, which he called
organic, were not, like unpasteurized Odwalla apple juice.
</P>
<P>
   Avery's claim that ``consumers of organic food are also more
likely to be attacked by a relatively new, more virulent strain of
the infamous salmonella bacteria'' was based on a Consumers Union
study in 1998 showing that ``premium'' chickens had higher levels
of salmonella than regular supermarket chickens. But the premium
chickens were not organic.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Avery took the Food and Drug Administration to
task for failing ``to issue any warnings to consumers about the
higher levels of natural toxins their researchers regularly find in
organic foods.'' In the interview, he said that that assertion was
based on a statement by Dr. Robert Lake, an official in the
agency's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Lake denied making such a statement, saying, ``We don't go out
of our way to sample organic food, and hence I don't think we are
in a position to say anything one way or another about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery wrote that because ``organic farmers use animal manure as
the major source of fertilizer,'' there are higher levels of
harmful bacteria in organic food. Katherine DiMatteo, the executive
director of the Organic Trade Association, said that manure is not
the major source of fertilizer on organic farms (it is also used in
conventional farming) and that, when it is used, certain rules must
be followed for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Avery said he had never ``bothered that much about consumer
safety aspects of organic food until O157:H7.'' His real goal, he
said, is to prevent organic agriculture from becoming the norm.
``My big concern is that we do not have room on the planet to feed
ourselves organically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on organic food by a well-financed research
organization suggests that, even though organic food accounts for
only 1 percent of food sales in the country, the conventional food
industry is worried.

A MALLET WITH MANY FACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Supermarket meat aisles, with their neat plastic packages and
uniform, heavily trimmed meats, have made meat buying fairly
boring. Buying meat this way, rather than through a butcher, makes
you think that all the work has been done for you and that all you
need to do is to take it home and cook it.
</P>
<P>
   But certain cuts can still use some improvement. Thinly sliced
veal scallops, for instance, can be pounded out so that they are
much thinner and much more tender once they're cooked.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to pound out veal, turkey or beef is with a meat
mallet, with a blunt, preferably heavy plain end for flattening the
meat. You just place the meat between layers of wax paper or
plastic wrap and pound until it is as thin as you like.
</P>
<P>
   Many meat mallets are made of wood, with one flat side and one
toothed side. Most are light and flimsy, however, and after several
uses, their toothed side dulls. Leifheit has come up with a
beautiful alternative: a sleek, chrome version shaped like an ax.
</P>
<P>
   It is solid and heavy: one side is flat, one has regular teeth,
and another has narrower teeth for breaking down tough, sinewy
meat. It is a mallet with muscle and durability.
</P>
<P>
   And for cooks with ambitions of serious home butchering, there
is the added feature of a curved cleaver blade. With the ample
weight of the mallet behind it, it is useful for breaking through
joints and chopping up bones for the stockpot.
</P>
<P>
   The mallet can also be used on tuna, which can be transformed
into carpaccio. When pounded paper thin, it melts like butter on
the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The mallet is $15.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street);
(212) 787-2000.

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While shopping recently on Lexington Avenue, I spotted a
paperback restaurant guide that I thought could be of use to my son
and daughter-in-law. Several times a month they take their two
small children out to eat and ``Kids Eat New York'' promised more
than 150 restaurants where ``kids have fun and grown-ups enjoy the
food.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-cover promotional copy said something like ``Give me
your tired, your bored, your cranky children whining for their
food.''
</P>
<P>
   As I was paying for my purchase, a gray-haired man behind me
said, ``I'll take one of those too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have grandchildren?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replied. ``But I figure that book will tell me the
restaurants where I don't want to eat.''

   The young man, probably in his late teens, wore baggy jeans and
a baseball cap. He scowled at the woman standing next to him, an
elegantly dressed matron sporting a large imitation leopard hat,
and finally gave vent to his anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, lady, someone killed an animal for your dopey hat,'' he
called out.
</P>
<P>
   The woman turned toward him and in a modulated tone replied:
``Young man, your ignorance is showing. If you cannot tell the
difference between a faux and a real leopard skin, you are a danger
to all animals. I suggest you close your mouth and open your
mind.''

   Lenore Nemeth and a young lawyer were sharing a cab when the
lawyer began coughing to such a degree that she was gasping for
breath. She flung $5 at the driver and asked him to pull over as
she had to get out to get some water.
</P>
<P>
   The cab stopped, and as the lawyer was gathering her briefcase,
the driver jumped out, clutching the money, and ran into a corner
delicatessen. In a minute he returned with a bottle of spring
water, a package of cough drops and the change. The drops and the
water, coupled with a good dollop of amazement, worked wonders.
Passengers and driver sped happily to their destination.

   Raleigh Mayer was in the East 60s when she noticed a casually
dressed father and his pre-teen-age daughter window shopping their
way down the block.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to something in a store display, the man addressed a
woman ahead of them, presumably his wife, ``Ah, Maman,'' he began.
Ms. Mayer pegged them as tourists until they passed her and she
heard the girl's plaintive plea: ``Dad, would you please stop
pretending we're French?''

   The cute little boy sat in the hospital waiting room and

Finally, he went to the receptionist and demanded to know when his

   The busy clerk sighed and said, ``Oh, about the time you can
count from 1 to 10 in German.''
</P>
<P>

   While shopping recently on Lexington Avenue, I spotted a
paperback restaurant guide that I thought could be of use to my son
and daughter-in-law. Several times a month they take their two
small children out to eat and ``Kids Eat New York'' promised more
than 150 restaurants where ``kids have fun and grown-ups enjoy the
food.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-cover promotional copy said something like ``Give me
your tired, your bored, your cranky children whining for their
food.''
</P>
<P>
   As I was paying for my purchase, a gray-haired man behind me
said, ``I'll take one of those too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have grandchildren?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replied. ``But I figure that book will tell me the
restaurants where I don't want to eat.''

   The young man, probably in his late teens, wore baggy jeans and
a baseball cap. He scowled at the woman standing next to him, an
elegantly dressed matron sporting a large imitation leopard hat,
and finally gave vent to his anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, lady, someone killed an animal for your dopey hat,'' he
called out.
</P>
<P>
   The woman turned toward him and in a modulated tone replied:
``Young man, your ignorance is showing. If you cannot tell the
difference between a faux and a real leopard skin, you are a danger
to all animals. I suggest you close your mouth and open your
mind.''

   Lenore Nemeth and a young lawyer were sharing a cab when the
lawyer began coughing to such a degree that she was gasping for
breath. She flung $5 at the driver and asked him to pull over as
she had to get out to get some water.
</P>
<P>
   The cab stopped, and as the lawyer was gathering her briefcase,
the driver jumped out, clutching the money, and ran into a corner
delicatessen. In a minute he returned with a bottle of spring
water, a package of cough drops and the change. The drops and the
water, coupled with a good dollop of amazement, worked wonders.
Passengers and driver sped happily to their destination.

workers on Fifth Avenue and 12th Street.

   Raleigh Mayer was in the East 60s when she noticed a casually
dressed father and his pre-teen-age daughter window shopping their
way down the block.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to something in a store display, the man addressed a
woman ahead of them, presumably his wife, ``Ah, Maman,'' he began.
Ms. Mayer pegged them as tourists until they passed her and she
heard the girl's plaintive plea: ``Dad, would you please stop
pretending we're French?''

   The cute little boy sat in the hospital waiting room and
fidgeted, not so patiently, as his mother had X-rays taken.
Finally, he went to the receptionist and demanded to know when his
mother would return.
</P>
<P>
   The busy clerk sighed and said, ``Oh, about the time you can
count from 1 to 10 in German.''
</P>
<P>
   As he began pacing the floor, my memory began returning. When I
was a child, my father had me recite the German alphabet and
numbers every night. It was all I ever learned of his family's
homeland.

   I whispered to the boy, ``Would you like to learn to count from
1 to 10 in German?''

   His eyes lighted up as though he had seen the tooth fairy, and
he turned out to be a quick study _ he had it down pat in about
five minutes. He proudly marched to the receptionist and rendered a
flawless performance. She had obviously forgotten her remark _ or
had no idea of what he had just said _ because she gave him a
puzzled stare.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, Mommy appeared at that moment. He tugged at her
sleeve, shouting German numbers. As they left, she looked back at

   Raleigh Mayer was in the East 60s when she noticed a casually
dressed father and his pre-teen-age daughter window shopping their
way down the block.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to something in a store display, the man addressed a
woman ahead of them, presumably his wife, ``Ah, Maman,'' he began.
Ms. Mayer pegged them as tourists until they passed her and she
heard the girl's plaintive plea: ``Dad, would you please stop
pretending we're French?''
</P>
<P>
   The cute little boy sat in the hospital waiting room and
fidgeted, not so patiently, as his mother had X-rays taken.
Finally, he went to the receptionist and demanded to know when his
mother would return.
</P>
<P>
   The busy clerk sighed and said, ``Oh, about the time you can
count from 1 to 10 in German.''
</P>
<P>
   As he began pacing the floor, my memory began returning. When I
was a child, my father had me recite the German alphabet and
numbers every night. It was all I ever learned of his family's
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   I whispered to the boy, ``Would you like to learn to count from
1 to 10 in German?''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes lighted up as though he had seen the tooth fairy, and
he turned out to be a quick study _ he had it down pat in about
five minutes. He proudly marched to the receptionist and rendered a
flawless performance. She had obviously forgotten her remark _ or
had no idea of what he had just said _ because she gave him a
puzzled stare.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, Mommy appeared at that moment. He tugged at her
sleeve, shouting German numbers. As they left, she looked back at

   ``A White House spokesman said today that President Clinton is
preparing a brief statement right after the vote tomorrow. He said
it'll be very brief, something along the lines of, `NAAA NANA NAAA
NA!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the dumbest story of the week. The Reverend Jerry
Falwell says one of the very popular Teletubbies, the purple one
named Tinky Winky, is gay. So you have the Teletubbies taking on
the telechubby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Falwell has moved on. See the latest thing? Now, Jerry Falwell
says that Snow White is a prostitute, because when the seven dwarfs
greet her they go, `Hi Ho!'''

   ``According to a new survey, they say laid-back coworkers get
more promotions at work than aggressive go-getters. Especially the

symptoms of PMS. Boy, there's a drug deal you don't want to go
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot book on the market is `Everything Men Need to Know
about Sex.' I guess there's some problems with it already, `cause
women read it page-by-page, whereas guys just rush through, trying
to get to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like the Senate will vote to acquit Bill Clinton on
Friday. Which is also Abraham Lincoln's birthday. Which is kind of
ironic, isn't it? Clinton dodging the bullet on Lincoln's
birthday?''
</P>

   ``New York Knicks fans are very upset over the new dancers. The
Knicks hired six new dancers to perform for the team: all male.

this, Jerry Springer immediately booked a show called, `My

the penis as half empty.'''

<P>
   ``Jerry Falwell has written an article warning parents that the
Teletubby Tinky Winky may be gay because he's purple and carries a

   ``Dan Quayle said that when he and Al Gore debate in the 2000
election, Gore will be asked to explain why President Clinton
ruined the White House. Meanwhile, Quayle will be asked to explain
why Jack and Jill went up the hill.''

<P>
   ``Sources in the Senate say they're pretty sure that by noon
tomorrow, a final vote will be held at the impeachment trial. It
also means by 1 p.m. tomorrow, President Clinton will be reclaiming
his old table at Hooters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was reported today that after losing the '92 election, Dan
Quayle called Richard Nixon for career advice. Reportedly, Nixon
told him, `You're calling me? Wow, you are dumb.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Tyson was sentenced to prison today for beating up two
people after being rear-ended in a car accident last summer. Now
that he's in jail, there's an even greater chance he'll be
rear-ended.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton was acquitted of both charges today and the
impeachment trail is finally over. There is bad news: Ken Starr is
now accusing the President of having an affair with the purple
Teletubby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a new poll, 75 percent of Americans say President
Clinton's faults are no worse than most other presidents. After
hearing this, President Bush said, `Hey, if that's the case
somebody owes me an intern.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a statement to the press this afternoon, President Clinton
said, `I believe that anyone who asks for forgiveness should be
prepared to give it.' The President went on to say, `I feel the
same way about oral sex.'''

   While shopping recently on Lexington Avenue, I spotted a
paperback restaurant guide that I thought could be of use to my son
and daughter-in-law. Several times a month they take their two
small children out to eat and ``Kids Eat New York'' promised more
than 150 restaurants where ``kids have fun and grown-ups enjoy the
food.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-cover promotional copy said something like ``Give me
your tired, your bored, your cranky children whining for their
food.''
</P>
<P>
   As I was paying for my purchase, a gray-haired man behind me
said, ``I'll take one of those too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have grandchildren?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replied. ``But I figure that book will tell me the
restaurants where I don't want to eat.''

   The young man, probably in his late teens, wore baggy jeans and
a baseball cap. He scowled at the woman standing next to him, an
elegantly dressed matron sporting a large imitation leopard hat,
and finally gave vent to his anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, lady, someone killed an animal for your dopey hat,'' he
called out.
</P>
<P>
   The woman turned toward him and in a modulated tone replied:
``Young man, your ignorance is showing. If you cannot tell the
difference between a faux and a real leopard skin, you are a danger
to all animals. I suggest you close your mouth and open your
mind.''

   The cab stopped, and as the lawyer was gathering her briefcase,
the driver jumped out, clutching the money, and ran into a corner

THE MESSAGE IN THE BOTTLE: A HALF IS HANDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She's ordered oysters. He's ordered foie gras. The
sommelier approaches. Tension mounts. What wine?
</P>
<P>
   This question haunts the thinking portion of humankind. The lone
diner searches futilely for a wine that will split the difference
between a delicate shellfish appetizer, hard-wired for chablis, and
a lusty, truffly main course that has red burgundy written all over
it. For two diners, a bottle each of red and white is too much to
drink. In most restaurants, the wines served by the glass are too
humble to make a serious contribution to the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the mind-body problem, the meat-fish problem has a
solution. It's the half bottle, and against the odds, it seems to
be making a comeback in New York restaurants, for common-sense
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Americans are drinking less, the half-bottle
format allows diners to get quality without quantity. It allows
customers who yearn for adventure to experiment without going into
debt, and because wine ages more quickly in half bottles, younger
wines show better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always looking for half bottles,'' said Dr. William
Schlansky, a dentist from Brooklyn who eats out four nights a week.
He likes wine. His wife drinks very little. ``We find a full bottle
is a little much, but I don't like wine by the glass,'' he said.
``I feel you're drinking what they pick for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Veritas, a new wine-theme restaurant, carries 30 half bottles
now and is adding to the list daily, with about 100 as the goal.
John Gilman, the new sommelier at Picholine, is expanding the
restaurant's half-bottle selection. ``I looked at the list here and
said, `We've got to get more,''' he said. ``We have a specific need
with our cheese course.'' At Gotham Bar &AMP; Grill, his previous
employer, Gilman worked with a list of 60 half bottles, one of the
biggest in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Half bottles also dovetail nicely with tasting menus, making it
possible for a table to match four or five different wines with a
multi-course meal. ``On any given evening, we may have as many as
five tasting menus circulating on the floor,'' said Joseph Nase,
the wine director at Lespinasse. ``That's a golden opportunity to
pair wines and establish themes for the meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nase usually carries 100 to 150 half bottles. He is currently
reworking his wine list so that he can offer 200 to 250 half
bottles, a monster list.
</P>
<P>
   French restaurants like La Cote Basque, La Caravelle and La
Grenouille have always carried well-chosen half-bottle lists of
perhaps 15 or 20 wines. Peacock Alley at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel
offers 30. But the half-bottle habit is being picked up by more
modest restaurants, like Cafe Centro, the Tonic, and Chelsea Bistro
and Bar, which all have about 20 half bottles on their lists. Coup,
a restaurant in the East Village, maintains a carefully pruned list
of only 25 wines in bottle. Eight are half bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are on the upswing of late,'' said Gilman of Picholine.
``Producers and importers are making an effort to get better wines
into half bottles.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the diner in the market for a good half bottle often
searches in vain, because most winemakers hate the format, with
some reason. Glassmakers charge a premium for the bottles, and
filling them often requires a separate bottling line. As a result,
supplies tend to be very limited.
</P>
<P>
   There are virtually no wines from Australia, New Zealand or
South America in half bottles. Almost all half bottle lists are
made up of French, Italian and American wines, with a few German
and Spanish wines. Within France, the winemakers of Burgundy have
traditionally been reluctant to use half bottles, while their
counterparts in Bordeaux have not.
</P>
<P>
   When half-bottle cases are available, they sell for as much as
20 percent more than the equivalent amount of wine in full bottles,
which gives a restaurant owner two choices: accept a lower profit
or invite customer complaints about half bottles that cost more
than half the amount of a full bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for winemakers' reluctance to use half bottles
has to do with the way wine ages. Because all bottles have the same
amount of air between the cork and the surface of the wine, the
ratio of air to wine is quite different for a half bottle, a full
bottle and a magnum. Half bottles age more quickly, and some
winemakers are nervous about putting their best stuff into an
inferior vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   They may be worrying needlessly. When Eberhard Mueller took over
as the executive chef at Lutece, he searched the cellar and came
across several half-bottle cases of top bordeaux dating from the
1930s and 1940s, about 400 bottles in all. ``I was worried about
their well-being, but to my surprise, every single one was in
perfect condition,'' Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, only one bottle remains, a 1949 Lafite-Rothschild priced
at $400. The restaurant does have a startling lineup of 11
Mouton-Rothschilds from 1979 to 1989, however, priced from $110 for
the 1981 to $775 for the 1982.
</P>
<P>
   A half-bottle list does not need a first-growth bordeaux, or
lofty prices, to command interest. Le Cirque 2000 has a Macon-Luny
for $11, only $3 more than a bottle of sparkling water. Windows on
the World and Gotham Bar &AMP; Grill have both given their lists a
distinctly American accent, while restaurants like Montrachet,
Daniel, the Tonic and Patroon have created distinctive
personalities for their lists by searching out unusual selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a number of producers you can reserve and get half
bottles, or you can ask the importer to put in a request,'' said
Daniel Johnnes, the wine director at Montrachet. ``It does take
some more effort, but to have a good list, you have to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The diner jaded by overexposure to half bottles from big
producers like Sonoma-Cutrer, Trefethen or Robert Mondavi can get a
new lease on life at the Tonic, where the 21-bottle list includes a
Sancerre from Lucien Crochet, a Bandol rose from Domaine Tempier
and a merlot from Georis in Monterey County.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Luc Le Du, the sommelier at Daniel, has introduced quirks
that match the cooking of Daniel Boulud, the restaurant's owner and
executive chef, demoting Bordeaux and promoting wines from Burgundy
and the Rhone. ``I think his flavors require something more
assertive than the cabernet grape,'' Le Du said.
</P>
<P>
   In the ideal meal, as conceived by Le Du, a guest might start
with a shellfish course paired with a half bottle of Savennieres,
move on to fish and a more substantial St. Aubin from Burgundy,
ease into a red burgundy like Morey-St.-Denis when the meat makes
an appearance, and finish strong with a big Cote Rotie from the
Rhone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little more work for us than if someone simply orders a
bottle of white and a bottle of red, but that way doesn't fit as
well with the philosophy of the restaurant,'' Le Du said.
</P>
<P>
   One meal. Four wines. It's true: less really is more. &QL;

WILL A GOVERNMENT PLAN GIVE STONEHENGE A LIFT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 21)  
 (bl)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Stonehenge, that stunning collection of artfully placed
rocks on Salisbury Plain, has always been one of Britain's
most-visited, and worst-managed, monuments. For years, officials
from the government departments responsible for culture, roads and
the environment; archaeologists; heritage groups; and surrounding
communities have been squabbling over how to balance a clutch of
competing interests, each with its own stake in Stonehenge's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the British government presented a plan that it hopes
will be acceptable to everyone. It would involve major alterations
to the roads around the monument, open up the monument to visitors
and establish a new visitors' center and parking lot farther away
from the site, which is about 85 miles from London. The plan is
designed to preserve Stonehenge and alleviate traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting everyone to agree to this scheme has been in itself a
huge achievement,'' said a spokeswoman for English Heritage, one of
the agencies responsible for the site. Almost all of the opposition
seems to be satisfied with the current plans, with the exception of
some neighbors worried about an increase in visitor traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But the $200 million proposal is far from being approved, and
still needs to wend its way through a long, arduous process that
will include a public hearing, environmental impact statements and
archaeological surveys, among other things. And even if approved at
every stage, work is unlikely to begin until well into the next
decade. ``We are aiming for the start of works within the next
seven years,'' British Roads Minister Larry Whitty said last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the proposal, the road improvements, would
involve diverting the A344 _ one of two narrow roads closest to
Stonehenge; the section closest to the monument would be closed
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the A303, the principal road used by visitors, would
be widened in some sections to two lanes in each direction, from
its current one lane. In addition, a 1.2-mile portion closest to
Stonehenge would be sunken into a tunnel, so that the road will
disappear from view for people walking around the monument. The
visitors' center _ an unsightly structure that consists mainly of a
small underground passage _ would be replaced, the government said.
It is seeking a private-sector partner to help with the financing,
and hasn't decided on a plan for the new structure.
</P>
<P>
   To restore Stonehenge and its surroundings to a more pristine
state, the plan calls for moving the visitors' center and parking
lot, currently next to the monument, to a new site some distance
away. Visitors would take a bus to the monument itself.
</P>
<P>
   The circle of stones that everyone comes to see is in a vast
area that contains some 450 considerably smaller points of
archaeological interest like burial mounds and longbarrows, which
were associated with burial rites and look like long ridges in the
ground. The site covers about 5,000 acres and is classified as a
World Heritage site, meaning that it receives special protection
and is subject to specific planning restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows who built Stonehenge or why, but the first parts of
it were constructed in about 3050 B.C., and it's pretty certain
that it was used for rituals or ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   A reconfiguration of the roads according to the plan is likely
to bring new birds, butterflies and plants to the area, the
government says, and a proposed new network of footpaths would
encourage visitors to wander around the whole area, which is known
as a chalk downland because of its chalky soil and preponderance of
little hillocks, or downs.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time in years, visitors would be able to walk
right up to the stone circle itself, rather than staying behind a
fence that keeps them some distance back.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the actual stones were closed to visitors because of
fears that the monument was being damaged by erosion. But by
ushering people through the whole site, and not just Stonehenge
itself, officials think that they can protect the monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can encourage visitor access in a way that
protects the monument, partly by distributing people more widely in
the surrounding landscape,'' the English Heritage spokeswoman said.
``We're confident that we can manage it and at the same time enable
people to visit it properly again.''

GETTING TO YOUR DESTINATION WITHOUT DROWNING IN DATA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 21)  
 (bl)  
 By L.R. SHANNON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many ways to smooth surfing on the Web for travel
information, or any other kind. One of the simplest is to take full
advantage of whichever browser is your vehicle. Internet Explorer
has ``favorites,'' Netscape Navigator has ``bookmarks.'' Their
exact capabilities vary from version to version, but at a minimum
each allows you to store the full addresses of sites you are likely
to return to so you don't have to type them in again. (It is also
vital to edit the list occasionally so it isn't stuffed with
addresses you don't return to.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No search engine is perfect, and the same terms typed into the
travel subsections of two or more search engines will give you
different results. If Altavista, say, is your usual stop, try
Yahoo, too, or Excite, or Hotbot, or Lycos, or Infoseek, or all of
them. At best, the biggest search engines index about a third of
all the sites on the World Wide Web, and not necessarily the same
third. Also, don't ignore smaller sites. The Mining Company has
been a longtime favorite of mine, and lately I've discovered
Dogpile, which has nothing to do with dogs, but allows you to go to
many other search engines from one home port. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you don't know the address of a site, often an educated
guess will work. Try ``www.nameofcompany.com,'' which works for all
the sites mentioned here, and you will probably land at the right
hotel, airline or cruise line. Don't forget that not everything is
a ``com.'' Educational organizations are ``edu''; government sites
are ``gov''; organizations, mostly nonprofit, are ``org,'' and
``net'' may stand for ``network'' or, then again, it may substitute
for ``com.'' Sites outside the United States end with a two-letter
country abbreviation, sometimes obvious, like ``ca'' for Canada,
and sometimes not, like ``mo'' for Macau. A complete list of
country codes may be found at
www.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/wwwstat/country-codes.txt.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All addresses on the Web begin with ``http://'' _ something more
recent versions of the browsers allow you to skip. Sometimes you
can also skip the ``www''and the ``com'' or ``gov'' or whatever.
But don't count on that. Search engines let you limit your request
by using what is formally known as Boolean logic, that is, with
``and,'' ``or'' or ``not.'' An ``and'' is easiest. In one search
engine, ``vienna'' yielded 136 sites, ``vienna and travel'' got 46
and ``vienna and travel and hotel'' brought out 13.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of overseas sites, try the foreign name of the city or
country if it differs from the English one. In a Vienna search,
searching for ``wien'' in the travel subsection of my search engine
brought eight matches, including ``Wienerschnitzel'' and
``Wienerbrod'' dough; searching for wien out of the travel
subsection found 149 sites, many of them in German, while ``wien
and travel'' in the travel subsection found one lean and useful
site in English.
</P>
<P>
   In whichever search engine you use, there will be an icon
labeled ``ad-vanced searches,'' or something similar, or a ``help''
icon, to show the syntax required for more complex searches. (The
syntax may differ from one to another.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot connect with one of those footlong addresses
favored by governments and educational institutions, shorten it to
the part before the first slash; 
``www.nameofuniversity.edu/nameofcollege.nameofbuilding/nameoflibrar
y.html'' becomes ``www.nameofuniversity.edu.'' That often gets you
to the top level of the site, and you can dig deeper from there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember the following advice, from the second edition
of Alfred and Emily Glossbrenner's excellent ``Search Engines for
the World Wide Web'' (Peachpit Press; $17.99), a book for would-be
power surfers: ``Don't assume that the Internet contains the sum
total of human knowledge. Part of being a good online searcher is
knowing when to stop. The information you want may or may not be
available on line. And if it is on line, it may be buried so deep
that it's not worth the time and trouble to locate it.''

BAKING WEB SITES; CHINESE NEW YEAR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Mouse in the Kitchen: Baking Tips on the Internet &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the winds shake the windows, what could be more comforting
than a warm oven and the smell of baking bread? Though a computer
is not essential to produce the effect, the Internet is ready to
help the baker, and for those who want the goods without the
baking, it also offers places to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to a baker's Camelot'' is the greeting at
www.kingarthurflour.com. The site, run by a company going back to
1790 and boasting that it has never added chemicals to its flours,
offers tips, recipes and even well-illustrated baking ``classes.''
</P>
<P>
   The tips are built into the recipes. For instance, an
introductory note for a recipe for the ``very lightest'' ciabatta,
an airy, slipper-shaped loaf for a sandwich or dipping in soup,
advises that more water will be needed this time of year than in,
say, August, when the flour has been in a humid kitchen all summer.
</P>
<P>
   The people at King Arthur describe themselves on the Web site as
avid bakers. It shows. A recipe for ``crusty Old World sesame
braid'' is in two parts _ for a starter, and then the dough _ and
both parts call for cool water, the temperature favored by
professional bakers to slow the action of yeast.
</P>
<P>
   The online classes are given by Barbara Lauterbach, who owns and
operates the Watch Hill Bed and Breakfast in Center Harbor, N.H., a
distant neighbor of King Arthur, in Norwich, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of photographs, she takes her charges through maple
walnut scones, whole-wheat granola bread and three other recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The King Arthur catalog, a mail-order storeful of bakers'
supplies and equipment, is pictured on the site, with a number to
call for a copy: (800) 777-4434. Unfortunately, none of that
baker's bounty can be bought on line.
</P>
<P>
   Another good flour company site is www.whitelily.com, based in
Knoxville, Tenn. Like King Arthur, White Lily says that its flour
is higher in protein than all-purpose flour because of a high
percentage of hard wheat. The site describes the company as ``a
Southern tradition since 1883,'' and biscuits are its specialty.
</P>
<P>
   There's a page with four steps and four pictures for light
biscuits. One of the tips is to place the unbaked biscuits on a
sheet an inch apart for crusty sides or almost touching for soft
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Other recipes include apricot orange bread and cranberry nut
bread, and some that change daily or weekly, like a cranberry
danish breakfast round and Italian turnovers with tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The flour can be bought on line, along with White Lily baking
mixes. There are also premiums, including T-shirts and posters.
</P>
<P>
   A surprisingly useful site is the Free Internet Bread Recipe
Archive (http://idt.net/wordup/bread.html). Surprising because the
laissez-faire principle of Rick van Valkenburg, who runs the site,
is ``send your favorite bread recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   He posts or links to what comes in, with the idea of making this
a worldwide recipe exchange. To judge by recipes from South Africa
and Norway, with ingredients in metric units (equivalents sometimes
given), he seems to have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Two perfectly bakable recipes from the archive's more than 100
traditional and bread-machine recipes are for Irish brown bread
(using American whole-wheat flour) and ``Duncan's rustic grain
bread,'' which Gerry Duncan, its creator, says is low in fat and
high in protein, freezes well and when toasted goes with chevre.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For answers to baking questions, a good place for prompt,
knowledgeable responses is Baker Boulanger (www.betterbaking.com),
the site of Marcy Goldman, a food writer in Montreal. Besides
answering questions, she has 400 bread and cake recipes on her
site. This month, she offers Mardi Gras pancake recipes, which can
be enjoyed even after Shrove Tuesday (aka Fat Tuesday or Mardi
Gras, which was Tuesday), and features like ``Ciao Chicago,'' which
tells how to make Chicago deep-dish stuffed pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The Baldwin Hill Bakery (www.baldwinhill.com) occupies an old
farm in rural Massachusetts, where a whole-grain sourdough bread
with macrobiotic overtones is baked in the Flemish desem tradition.
The desem is the sourdough starter, a fermented culture of the
stone-ground wheat (grown without synthetic fertilizer, herbicide
or pesticide) and water from a 500-foot-deep well. No yeast is
otherwise added.
</P>
<P>
   The breads also contain sea salt from the coast of Brittany. A
loaf made from spelt, an ancient member of the wheat family,
indicates that perhaps not enough sea salt is used. That bread is
tightly textured with a strong grain flavor. It is not like biting
into an airy brioche, but it makes you feel as if you are doing
something healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Other Baldwin Hill varieties are whole wheat, sesame wheat, rye,
raisin spelt, raisin cinnamon and rice. There are also lighter
breads. The site has a price list, and the breads cost less than in
stores but must be bought in quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Customers may buy a mixed batch of six loaves for $12 to $13.80,
plus shipping and handling charges. One bread baker advises that
loaves can be frozen without risking freezer burn by wrapping them
first in a plastic bag, then aluminum and then in another plastic
bag. The number for orders and information is (978) 249-4691.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Collin Street Bakery in Corsicana, Texas, has
been known for a rich Christmas cake that is as close to a solid
block of pecan as a cake can be. ``We have our own pecan shelling
facility in Corsicana,'' Bob McNutt, the president of the bakery,
wrote by e-mail. ``It is the largest single shelling plant in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The bakery is now on line at www.collinstreetbakery.com and is
selling that cake, from a century-old recipe from Wiesbaden,
Germany, all year round (regular size, almost two pounds, is
$16.15). True to its pecan mission, the bakery is also offering,
among other temptations, apricot pecan cakes, praline pecan
cheesecake, pecan pie, fudge pecan pie and apple pecan crumble.
Orders can be placed at the Web site or at (800) 292-7400. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the Rabbit &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Chinese lunar calendar, New Year's Day 1999 fell Tuesday.
This is the Year of the Rabbit, named for one of the 12 animals in
the Chinese zodiac, and the parades and feasts to celebrate it can
last from a week to a month.
</P>
<P>
   The event is being observed on the Internet at
www.usarice.com/domestic/recipes (click on ``Chinese New Year''),
the site of the trade association of the American rice industry.
</P>
<P>
   It offers a New Year origin legend, descriptions of Chinese
traditions for the season, a list of propitious foods and an essay
on rice in Chinese cooking by Grace Young, the author of ``The
Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen'' (to be published in May by Simon &AMP;
Schuster).
</P>
<P>
   There are also homey recipes, the sort that may appear on a
Chinese family's table rather than in a restaurant. These include
tender chicken on rice (made with chicken, ham, mushrooms and a
ginger sauce).
</P>
<P>
   Another site for the season is www.vitasoy-usa.com/recipe1.html,
run by Vitasoy, whose holiday recipes include tofu-mango stir-fry
and eight precious noodles with savory broth.

BUSH PRIORITY ON STATE BUSINESS MAKES SENSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ People don't get elected president of the United
States _ or governor of Texas _ by being too overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   They have to believe in themselves, their abilities and the
future and project that feeling to the voters. But the pitfalls of
the political process, especially the quest for a major office,
force even the most successful politicians to run scared.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gov. George W. Bush wasn't exactly petrified with fear
during his recent laugher of a re-election campaign, he ran as if
there actually was some doubt that he would win a second term.
</P>
<P>
   His aggressiveness was obviously motivated in large part by his
desire to help sweep Republicans into other state offices, which he
did, and to increase his own viability as a presidential contender,
which he also did.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who just four years earlier had unseated a popular
Democratic governor, wasn't taking his own future in the Governor's
Mansion for granted either.
</P>
<P>
   Once Bush's re-election was history, though, pressure
immediately started to build for the governor to announce his
intentions for the White House, which many people have long assumed
is his next desired political destination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has repeatedly refused to publicly say whether he will make
the big race. But he continues to fuel speculation that he is
running for president by entertaining a stream of national and
foreign visitors in Austin and becoming the subject of a
not-entirely-spontaneous draft by a large group of congressional
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The draft by Bush supporters from several states apparently was
designed to counter the early attention focused on other Republican
would-be presidents, including the recent splash Elizabeth Dole
made when she quit her post at the American Red Cross to test the
political waters.
</P>
<P>
   Dole and other GOP contenders and potential contenders are
touring the country _ including New Hampshire and Iowa, early key
stops in the nominating process _ while Bush remains in Texas and
lets others keep his name before the national media.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa and New Hampshire, whose early caucuses and primary,
respectively, give them much more clout in the presidential
nominating process than their population sizes deserve, take their
overblown roles seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican state legislators from Iowa even flew to
Austin last week to urge Bush to run. They bore letters from about
60 of their colleagues, some of whom hadn't even decided whether to
support a Bush candidacy. But they couldn't bear the thought of the
perceived front-runner for their party's White House nomination
snubbing their state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, not to be overconfident, assured the Iowans that he will
campaign there if he runs, although if anyone could win a
presidential nomination without having to build momentum _ or
create a winning perception _ in Iowa, it would be someone like
Bush, who has a name that is already nationally known and a large
fund-raising network in place.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors buy him more time than most presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has indicated he won't announce a presidential race _ if he
is running _ until at or near the end of the legislative session
late this spring.
</P>
<P>
   He says he needs to tend to the state's business while lawmakers
are in town. He does, mainly because that was what he was
re-elected to do but also because some of his legislative
priorities are important to a White House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to convince the Legislature to enact his proposed tax
cuts, for example, could hurt him in a national race. And failure
to win legislative approval of a voucher bill for private school
tuition or a bill to allow parents to be informed before their
minor daughters could have abortions _ two other Bush priorities _
could cost him the crucial support of social and religious
conservatives in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Most Texas voters certainly weren't turned off by the prospects
of a presidential race when 69 percent of them voted for Bush's
re-election in November. Many, if not most, of the people who voted
to give him a new four-year term in Austin probably assumed he
would run for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four percent of the respondents to the Texas Poll released
just last week said Bush should make the national race.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor may be concerned that some Democratic
legislators will use any overt presidential campaigning to fire
away at him and undermine some of his legislative proposals. They
probably would, but some Democrats will fight some of his
priorities anyway, simply because they oppose them.
</P>
<P>
   With a little luck, Bush probably could successfully juggle the
legislative session and some out-of-state campaigning, and most
Texans wouldn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be testing the limits of confidence.

   Microsoft is exploring the possibility of forming a strategic
alliance with Orange, a British mobile phone company, according to
industry sources.
</P>
<P>
   The entry of Bill Gates's company into the UK telecoms sector
would make Orange a much heavier hitter among companies jockeying
for position in the converging computer, telecoms, and broadcast
industries.
</P>
<P>
   It would also strengthen Microsoft's grip on another platform of
the converging technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft entered the UK cable TV sector on Jan. 25 when it
invested in NTL, Britain's third-largest cable TV company, and a
tie-up with Orange would be seen as another step down the same
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may or may not come off, but the Orange thing is part of a
larger picture,'' said a London banker. ``The idea is Orange and
NTL will link up, with Microsoft as the big brother.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mountford, UK head of the American Internet giant, Cisco,
added: ``A new generation of products linking computers, television
sets, and mobile phones is approaching. It makes sense for
Microsoft to invest in distribution systems for its products.''
</P>
<P>
   Orange denies it is in talks with Microsoft. A spokeswoman
declared: ``There is absolutely no truth in this rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources insist, nevertheless, that the prospect of an
alliance, including an infusion of Microsoft cash into Orange, is
the subject of discussion between Microsoft and Orange
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa owns 49.2 percent of the
mobile phone company. British Aerospace owns 5 percent. Since BAe
acquired Marconi, GEC's defense business, last month, there has
been speculation BAe might unload its Orange holding.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with ``The Independent on Sunday'' Feb. 5,
Microsoft UK managing director Neil Holloway declined to discuss
the possiblity of an Orange tie-up, but he did confirm the
company's interest in telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the company's strategy, he said: ``We want to focus
on what's slowing down growth. (That means) the deployment of
high-speed networks, whether cable, satellite, or wireless... We
need to give the communications infrastructure a push.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior industry executive characterized Microsoft's interest
in Orange in more aggressive terms: ``Microsoft almost missed out
on the Internet revolution,'' he said. ``They want to make damn
sure not to miss out on the distribution systems for their
software.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive pointed out that, in light of allegations by the
U.S. Justice Department that Microsoft violated anti-trust law, the
software giant is unlikely to do high-profile deals in the U.S.,
but would experiment and build a network in the cable TV and
telecoms businesses internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Microsoft also invested $300 million in UPC, a Dutch
cable TV company.
</P>
<P>
   One industry observer suggested that Orange would resist a
tie-up with Microsoft on the grounds that its future would be
better served in an alliance with other European mobile phone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Brussels are currently stymied in talks to
establish a single global standard for ``smart'' mobiles. The
outcome will influence whether Microsoft or the UK's Psion will
gain the inside track in linking ``smart'' mobile phones to
computers and TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orange would also be attractive to Microsoft because it has
always sold direct to customers rather than via intermediaries,''
an industry executive said. ``Orange would have a lot of data on
high-earning clients who would be interested in new Microsoft
products.'' &QL;

LAWSUIT MAY END SCHOOL DESEGREGATION IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (With: SCHOOLS-LOWELL; not optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Patrick Wong, Brian Ho and Hilary Chen were
turned away from the San Francisco public schools of their choice
for one undisputed reason: They are Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Wong, 14 in 1994, was denied a place at top-ranked Lowell High
School because, by policy, Chinese-American children must score
higher on admissions exams than students of other ethnic groups. Ho
and Chen, 5 and 8 at the time, were turned away from their
neighborhood elementary schools because the schools had reached
their quota of Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine, as a parent, seeing your son's hopes denied
in this way at the age of 14?'' said Patrick Wong's mother,
Charlene Wong Loen.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the families of the students finally get their day
in court, five years after they filed a class-action lawsuit
seeking to overturn San Francisco's desegregation plan.
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes trial, which began Tuesday has sweeping
ramifications for this city of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome could end the practice of limiting any one race at a
school to 45 percent, and stop the busing set up to achieve that
quota. It could cost the 62,000-student San Francisco school system
$37 million each year in state aid. And, perhaps no less
disruptive, it could shift the boundaries of virtually every
neighborhood school in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition to racial quotas comes not just from
conservatives or from high-achieving Asian-Americans often excluded
by efforts to open doors for blacks and Hispanics. It also comes
from black parents and activists tired of having children bused
across town to meet a diversity formula.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the desegregation plan resulted from a lawsuit filed
against the school district by the NAACP in the 1970s on behalf of
black children.
</P>
<P>
   But the passing years have created an alliance between the NAACP
and the school district. They are now the city's most ardent
defenders of the desegregation system.
</P>
<P>
   To prevail in court, the San Francisco school district must
prove that it still discriminates despite years of busing and
quotas. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that government may use
racial quotas only in the rarest of circumstances, such as when
state authorities deliberately defy federal orders mandating
desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district must say, `We're not bad anymore, but we were
really bad in the past. So we have to continue to pay for it,'''
said Professor Pamela Karlan, who specializes in civil rights law
at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Based on written statements by U.S. District Judge William
Orrick, who signed the federal desegregation order in 1983 and will
preside over the trial, the school district is headed for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Orrick said the district and the NAACP were ``utterly unprepared
to go to trial,'' and their failure to produce evidence in support
of the current system showed they had almost ``no likelihood of
prevailing at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is being closely watched nationwide because it raises
complex legal and social questions, such as whether the
desegregation order is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Girard, the lawyer representing the Chinese-American
families suing to overturn the quotas, said the use of racial
classification is a violation of the 14th Amendment guarantee of
equal protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district and NAACP will tell you the (desegregation)
consent decree has done all of these wonderful things and created
all these great programs,'' Girard said. ``But you can't use an
unconstitutional means to achieve a wonderful end.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the desegregation consent decree, San Francisco's 62,000
students are divided into nine ethnic and racial categories:
American Indian, black, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean,
Spanish-surnamed, other white and other non-white. No group may
exceed more than 45 percent of any school, and at least four groups
must be represented at every school.
</P>
<P>
   Since that formula was devised in 1983, the state has poured
$300 million into San Francisco schools to achieve desegregation.
The state now spends $37 million per year, roughly 12 percent of
the district's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   School Superintendent Bill Rojas defends the consent decree and
the racial quota system, saying blacks and Hispanics need certain
preferences because they are disproportionately ``denied the means
to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Harris, an NAACP attorney, said nagging inequities
remain in the school system. Black students are disciplined at
higher rates than students of other races, he said. Schools are
desegregated, but because students are clumped by ability, many
classrooms are still segregated. There also are not enough minority
teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task was given to the district to make whole these black
kids who had been pushed aside,'' Harris said. ``The district has
shown they're capable, but they must apply this to all black kids,
not just some.''

KEEP YOUR HEAD IN A MONEY CRISIS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world where layoffs have become an everyday occurrence and
so many people are without health insurance, you may well be face
to face with a financial crisis someday.
</P>
<P>
   When faced with more bills than you can possibly pay, it's easy
to panic and grab the first available stash of money you can lay
your hands on.
</P>
<P>
   For many workers, it's their 401(k) retirement savings plan.
</P>
<P>
   Others will be stuck with mounting debts they can't pay and a
powerful urge just to ignore the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, resist the urge.
</P>
<P>
   You give away your future when you tap retirement money early or
don't deal with your debts.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, debt takes on a life of its own if you don't
control it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RETIREMENT FUNDS ARE A LAST RESORT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pull money out of your retirement account only if you absolutely
have to.
</P>
<P>
   That means if you literally ``have nothing else,'' said John
Eadie, a partner in the personal financial counseling group at
accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The tax penalties for withdrawing your retirement money early
are awful, especially if you're younger than 59 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   If you must withdraw retirement money, take out the smallest
amount you can, so you don't take out more than you need.
</P>
<P>
   Eadie said the ideal order in which you should withdraw
emergency money is:
</P>
<P>
   1. Take out money from bank accounts first. There are no tax
consequences for doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a tax perspective, that makes the most sense,'' Eadie
said.
</P>
<P>
   2. If you need more money or don't have a savings account, sell
your investments in non-retirement accounts. If you've held those
investments for longer than a year and profit from their sale, you
will pay a long-term capital gains tax of up to 20 percent. That's
better than paying ordinary income tax rates of as high as 39.6
percent on money withdrawn from your retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax consequences of using those other funds would be more
beneficial than the tax consequences of dipping into (your
retirement account),'' Eadie said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would you be jeopardizing your future retirement if you
pull money out of your retirement funds, you would also have to pay
income tax on the funds, and, if you're younger than 59 1/2, pay an
additional 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal of retirement
funds.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to withdrawal of your 401(k) money is to borrow
from the account.
</P>
<P>
   I don't advocate this method either because, like total
withdrawal, the money you take out isn't able to compound and grow
for you.
</P>
<P>
   If you must take out a loan, you must repay it or there are
severe consequences.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to leave your job and you have a 401(k) loan
outstanding, most companies will want you to pay off the entire
amount.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't do that, the loan amount is considered a withdrawal
and you're taxed on it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IGNORING DEBTS WON'T WORK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Debts have a powerful effect on people. When you can't afford to
pay your bills, you may be tempted to ignore them and hope they
will somehow pay themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They won't.
</P>
<P>
   Treat your lenders with respect _ you'll need all the goodwill
you can get. If you've reached the point where you just can't make
all the payments _ even after you have cut your spending _ start
setting priorities so you can limit the damage somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Divide your loan payments between secured credit, such as a
mortgage or car loan, from unsecured credit, such as on credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Pay your secured credit first so you can hold on to your home
and car. You need a roof over your head and you need your car for
basic transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Call your unsecured creditors immediately and tell them that
you're experiencing financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait until you're late on payments and they start dunning
you. They'll be much less sympathetic to your plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them know your intentions are right and that you intend to
pay them,'' said Sharon McLean, executive director of Consumer
Credit Counseling Service of the Gulf Coast Area in Houston, which
helps consumers with credit problems.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of raiding your precious retirement assets, consider
borrowing money from your life insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to repay the loan and you don't pay tax on the
borrowed amount, but I urge you to repay the loan.
</P>

TOP SCHOOL AT GROUND ZERO OF QUOTA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At the votex of the highest-stakes lawsuit in
the history of San Francisco's public schools is Lowell High
School, a fiercely competitive campus that is being shaped by race.
</P>
<P>
   It is Lowell that required Chinese-American students to score
higher than children of other races. It is Lowell that uses a
system of racial percentages in an attempt to bring diversity into
its hallowed halls.
</P>
<P>
   And more than any other school, it is Lowell that sparked the
1994 lawsuit that now threatens to topple the 15-year-old federal
desegregation plan in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Many fates hinge on the federal trial to determine the fate of
racial quotas in San Francisco schools: Some $37 million a year in
state desegregation funds could be lost if the plan is ruled
unconstitutional. The trial began Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The district, now wedded to diversity, would face enormous
challenges if its practice of limiting any race to no more than 45
percent of students at a given school is struck down. Thousands of
children could be reassigned to different schools.
</P>
<P>
   But no other school would be altered as much as Lowell, the
city's oldest academic high school that traditionally admits
students based on their grades alone, not the neighborhood in which
they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you make real efforts, you won't find many
African-Americans and Latinos at Lowell,'' said Frank Wu, a Howard
University law professor who has written extensively on affirmative
action. ``At Lowell, a strictly by-the-numbers approach reportedly
results in an almost entirely Asian-American student body. That's
lamentable and should be unacceptable to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The best and the brightest students of all races in San
Francisco attend Lowell, and the high standards usually pay off.
Lowell sends a higher proportion of graduates to the University of
California than any other public school in California. It is the
alma mater of several Nobel laureates, the late Gov. Edmund Brown
and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   But because blacks and Hispanics overall have lower test scores
than whites or ethnic Asians, they're significantly
underrepresented at Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   And without the rule limiting any one race _ in Lowell's case
Chinese-Americans _ to 45 percent of the student body, the numbers
of blacks and Hispanics could shrink dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, blacks make up 17 percent of all San Francisco
public school students, but 4 percent of Lowell's 2,515 students.
Hispanics comprise 21 percent of the district's students, but 11
percent of Lowell's students. Chinese-Americans comprise 28 percent
of the district's population, but 43 percent of Lowell's students.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, between 70 and 80 percent of students are admitted
solely by their test scores and grades. The remaining 20 to 30
percent have slightly lower grades, but earn compensating
``value-added diversity points'' if their families are poor, if
they live in public housing, if their parents were not able to
attend college.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that without those value-added points, very few
black or Hispanic students would get into Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the diversity-points system note that all students
admitted to Lowell are outstanding. And students from disadvantaged
backgrounds may face greater obstacles in their efforts to study,
or even get to school.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Cohen, who heads Lowell's admissions committee, said that
if grades alone determine who gets into Lowell, the city's most
prestigious public school could become exclusively white and ethnic
Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the desegregation plan under fire began in 1983 to
settle a lawsuit filed against the school district and the state by
the NAACP, which argued successfully that San Francisco schools
discriminated against blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade later, it was three frustrated Chinese-American
families who filed the current lawsuit, angry that their children
were turned away from schools only because those schools had hit
their limit of Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese-American parents and students have suffered under a
quota system in San Francisco. It's risen its ugly head most
noticeably, but not exclusively, at Lowell,'' said Amy Chang, an
attorney who is on the board of directors with the Asian-American
Legal Foundation, a nonprofit bipartisan group formed in 1994 to
support the Chinese-Americans' cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard from parents whose children were saying, `I wish I
wasn't Chinese ... I don't know why I should do my homework when
ultimately I'm judged by my race,''' Chang said. ``We feel strongly
that all children should be treated equally.''

   AMMAN _ Whenever a crisis appears in Syria or Saudi Arabia or
Lebanon or Egypt, Israel usually comes up with a conspiracy theory
to stir the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble in Damascus is attributed to Jordanian security men or
Lebanese Christians. Violence in Saudi Arabia's eastern province is
put down to Iranian terrorism. Lebanon's turmoil is blamed on
Syria, Egypt's guerrilla war on Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   In all these scenarios, Israel is innocent, wanting only peace
for the region by honoring its treaties with Arab nations,
sometimes _ the story goes _ protecting regional minorities like
the Lebanese Maronites who were, of course, later abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   How soon, then, before the Israeli press pronounced on the
dangers to the Hashemite Kingdom, now that King Hussein is gone?
</P>
<P>
   It started on Jan. 21, with an intriguing article in the
newspaper ``Haaretz'' which should have sent a chill through those
members of the Jordanian royal family who believed that the
kingdom, with its Israeli peace treaty, might be immune.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Jordan was founded on part of the Jewish homeland (sic),
several attempts have been made by Arab states _ not us _ to
terminate its existence,'' Israel Harel wrote in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   If King Hussein had been assassinated, Harel continued,
``Jordan's `Arab sisters' would have pounced upon it like vultures
and torn it to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes on. The Hashemite Kingdom ``never became a single
nation... It has been Israel that has protected the Hashemite
crown... and rescued it from threats from the north or east and
from domestic enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   But then came the clincher: ``It will ultimately become
apparent... that two nations (i.e., Israel and Palestine) cannot
live on the small piece of land to the west of the Jordan (River)
and that two states cannot live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nations with vast stretches of land that have no need for
additional acreage are feasting their eyes on Jordan, Israel must
also stake its claim to Jordan...
</P>
<P>
   ``With that territory _ even part of it _ we (sic) could solve
in cooperation with our peace process partners, many territorial
disputes we have with the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, Israeli ``experts'' and American
``analysts'' _ most of them former U.S. government officials _ have
been turning up all over our television stations to express their
love for King Hussein and their concern for Jordan's future. It is
almost as if the fear of God is being put into Jordan's new king,
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out for Syria, the subliminal message goes. Watch out for
Iraq. We will protect you. But at what price?
</P>
<P>
   It is therefore worth finishing Israel Harel's article in
``Haaretz,'' which concludes with the suggestion that Palestinians
could take over part of Jordan, leaving Israel to ``annex those
parts of the West Bank that are still in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   If Israel promoted this plan ``instead of vainly expending our
energies to perpetuate the survival of a wobbly kingdom which will
inevitably collapse... we will serve our interests... and we will
also create an atmosphere conducive to a peace settlement and to
mutual trust and conciliation between the nations of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Could this piece of breathtaking cynicism be merely a minority
voice, you may ask?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's not that long ago that a well-known Israeli
politician _ now a declared enemy of the Oslo peace agreement _ was
publicly advocating the expulsion of Palestinians from their West
Bank and Jerusalem homes to an exile in Jordan. Jordan, he said,
would become Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   That man, Ariel Sharon, is now foreign minister of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah may admire Israel's paratroopers. But he might
also do well _ while watching the treacherous Saddam Hussein on his
east and the silent Hafez Assad on his north _ to keep a close eye
on former General Sharon as well. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that the U.S. Senate has wrapped up the
impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, and with it almost six months of
Congressional drama, it is surely time to recognize some of those
whose performances delighted and embarrassed us by turns for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   For services to politics, to America, to entertainment, and _ of
course _ to themselves, they have no peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We return you,'' said CNN after a spell from the Senate, ``to
our regular program, `Showbiz Today.''' Oh no you don't, we viewers
barracked quietly, we have been there all along.
</P>
<P>
   So, without further ado, we congratulate:
</P>
<P>
   BEST FEMALE LEAD: Who else but Monica Lewinsky, the 25-year-old
Valley Girl turned Presidential Consort, the only Monica in America
who no longer needs a surname?
</P>
<P>
   Her celluloid presence in the Senate convinced even the most
hardened Republican of Bill Clinton's unerring eye for the fair
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bright,'' ``impressive,'' ``poised,'' ``intelligent'' _ who
could not agree with these reviews? (What they meant, of course,
was ``sexy.'') She knew instinctively when to charm, when to act
the air-head, and when to deploy the formidable techniques of legal
hairsplitting she has recently mastered.
</P>
<P>
   She is the unchallenged mistress of the big occasion, if no
longer of the president. But maybe she could have another think
about the hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MALE LEAD: Dale Bumpers, 73, just-retired senator from the
president's home state of Arkansas, and pleasantly greying, who
drew on all his rhetorical and dramatic skills to plead for his
ally's acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   So at ease was he in the august Senate chamber that he seemed
almost to dance around his microphone.
</P>
<P>
   He struck just the right senatorial register, between his
down-home recollections of Bill, his deep respect for his former
colleagues, the anguish he felt for Bill's wife and family, and his
intimate lawyer's love of the Constitution of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was the performance of his life, that enhanced his own
reputation and that of the Senate. Too bad, it was his farewell.
</P>
<P>
   BEST LAWYER IN A SUPPORTING ROLE: Cheryl Mills, 33, a deputy
White House counsel, who was totally unfazed by being the only
black woman in the Senate chamber (and the presence of her parents
in the gallery).
</P>
<P>
   She was half the age of almost everyone except Monica, but rose
to her role with the smooth passion of a seasoned pro. ``A star is
born,'' the reviewers said next day, and they were right.
</P>
<P>
   Mills might have been on some shaky factual ground at times, but
she never, ever showed it. Her ringing refrain, ``It's those facts,
those stubborn facts again,'' delivered in her soft Southern drawl
with half the consonants missing, will long be remembered by her
adoring audience.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PERFORMANCE BY AN UNKNOWN (MALE): No contest here. Lindsey
Graham, 43, Republican representative for South Carolina, wins
outright. Graham's silk-smooth performances in the House judiciary
committee and the House impeachment debate marked him out as a new
force.
</P>
<P>
   A small-town lawyer in his pre-Congressional life, (and a
bachelor, girls!), Graham was that rare Republican prosecutor who
understood that bombast could be self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest the Republicans can get to a folksy communicator in
the Clinton mold, Graham also had some of the best lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I come from,'' he told the Senate of the president's
nocturnal phone calls to Monica, ``a person who calls someone up at
2:30 in the morning is up to no good.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST PERFORMANCE BY AN UNKNOWN (FEMALE): Susan Collins, 46,
Republican senator from Maine, in a close contest with her fellow
Mainiac, Olympia Snowe, and Texan, Kay Bailey Hutchison. But
Collins wins because of the depth of the obscurity from which she
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Smart, and above all sensible, oh so sensible, Collins dreamed
up an idea that put her, and her distant state, on the impeachment
map.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to square the Constitutional circle of convicting the
president without removing him, she devised the ingenious
``findings of fact'' that would allow senators to put Clinton's
offenses on record, then vote for his acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   After flourishing briefly, the idea was quashed, by the
one-dimensional male majority _ but she presented it well, for all
that.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PLAYER IN MORE THAN ONE ROLE: A tie between the Republican
chairman of the House judiciary committee, Henry Hyde, 74,
representative from Illinois, and the Democratic doyen of the
Senate, Robert Byrd, 81, of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, whose name was never mentioned without the qualification
``respected'' was exposed on the eve of his committee's hearings as
a clandestine adulterer and family-breaker, but went on to spirited
performances, wrapping together Biblical texts, the Gettysburg
Address, ``A Man for All Seasons,'' and a letter from a penitent
schoolboy.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd successfully carried off the epic feat of sponsoring a
motion to dismiss the charges against Clinton as unsubstantiated,
and a week later stating with equal assurance that he was convinced
of his guilt. Well done, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PERFORMANCE IN A CAMEO ROLE: Chief Justice of the United
States, William Rehnquist, 74.
</P>
<P>
   With a proper sense of occasion, Rehnquist had copied the gold
stripes on his black gown from a performance of ``Iolanthe,'' but
remained himself throughout, attracting criticism for wearing his
gown too informally, by leaving it open.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the faith with his legendary taciturnity, compensating
with a mean performance on the gavel. More moderator than judge, as
the impeachment trial required, Rehnquist nonetheless handed down
two landmark decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He enhanced the atmosphere of his court by allowing the senators
to call themselves ``senators'' rather than ``jurors,'' and he
memorably ruled against the Majority leader's call for a coffee
break. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that the U.S. Senate has wrapped up the
impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, and with it almost six months of
Congressional drama, it is surely time to recognize some of those
whose performances delighted and embarrassed us by turns for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   For services to politics, to America, to entertainment, and _ of
course _ to themselves, they have no peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We return you,'' said CNN after a spell from the Senate, ``to
our regular program, `Showbiz Today.''' Oh no you don't, we viewers
barracked quietly, we have been there all along.
</P>
<P>
   So, without further ado, we congratulate:
</P>
<P>
   BEST FEMALE LEAD: Who else but Monica Lewinsky, the 25-year-old
Valley Girl turned Presidential Consort, the only Monica in America
who no longer needs a surname?
</P>
<P>
   Her celluloid presence in the Senate convinced even the most
hardened Republican of Bill Clinton's unerring eye for the fair
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bright,'' ``impressive,'' ``poised,'' ``intelligent'' _ who
could not agree with these reviews? (What they meant, of course,
was ``sexy.'') She knew instinctively when to charm, when to act
the air-head, and when to deploy the formidable techniques of legal
hairsplitting she has recently mastered.
</P>
<P>
   She is the unchallenged mistress of the big occasion, if no
longer of the president. But maybe she could have another think
about the hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MALE LEAD: Dale Bumpers, 73, just-retired senator from the
president's home state of Arkansas, and pleasantly greying, who
drew on all his rhetorical and dramatic skills to plead for his
ally's acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   So at ease was he in the august Senate chamber that he seemed
almost to dance around his microphone.
</P>
<P>
   He struck just the right senatorial register, between his
down-home recollections of Bill, his deep respect for his former
colleagues, the anguish he felt for Bill's wife and family, and his
intimate lawyer's love of the Constitution of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was the performance of his life, that enhanced his own
reputation and that of the Senate. Too bad, it was his farewell.
</P>
<P>
   BEST LAWYER IN A SUPPORTING ROLE: Cheryl Mills, 33, a deputy
White House counsel, who was totally unfazed by being the only
black woman in the Senate chamber (and the presence of her parents
in the gallery).
</P>
<P>
   She was half the age of almost everyone except Monica, but rose
to her role with the smooth passion of a seasoned pro. ``A star is
born,'' the reviewers said next day, and they were right.
</P>
<P>
   Mills might have been on some shaky factual ground at times, but
she never, ever showed it. Her ringing refrain, ``It's those facts,
those stubborn facts again,'' delivered in her soft Southern drawl
with half the consonants missing, will long be remembered by her
adoring audience.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PERFORMANCE BY AN UNKNOWN (MALE): No contest here. Lindsey
Graham, 43, Republican representative for South Carolina, wins
outright. Graham's silk-smooth performances in the House judiciary
committee and the House impeachment debate marked him out as a new
force.
</P>
<P>
   A small-town lawyer in his pre-Congressional life, (and a
bachelor, girls!), Graham was that rare Republican prosecutor who
understood that bombast could be self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest the Republicans can get to a folksy communicator in
the Clinton mold, Graham also had some of the best lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I come from,'' he told the Senate of the president's
nocturnal phone calls to Monica, ``a person who calls someone up at
2:30 in the morning is up to no good.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST PERFORMANCE BY AN UNKNOWN (FEMALE): Susan Collins, 46,
Republican senator from Maine, in a close contest with her fellow
Mainiac, Olympia Snowe, and Texan, Kay Bailey Hutchison. But
Collins wins because of the depth of the obscurity from which she
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Smart, and above all sensible, oh so sensible, Collins dreamed
up an idea that put her, and her distant state, on the impeachment
map.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to square the Constitutional circle of convicting the
president without removing him, she devised the ingenious
``findings of fact'' that would allow senators to put Clinton's
offenses on record, then vote for his acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   After flourishing briefly, the idea was quashed, by the
one-dimensional male majority _ but she presented it well, for all
that.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PLAYER IN MORE THAN ONE ROLE: A tie between the Republican
chairman of the House judiciary committee, Henry Hyde, 74,
representative from Illinois, and the Democratic doyen of the
Senate, Robert Byrd, 81, of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, whose name was never mentioned without the qualification
``respected'' was exposed on the eve of his committee's hearings as
a clandestine adulterer and family-breaker, but went on to spirited
performances, wrapping together Biblical texts, the Gettysburg
Address, ``A Man for All Seasons,'' and a letter from a penitent
schoolboy.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd successfully carried off the epic feat of sponsoring a
motion to dismiss the charges against Clinton as unsubstantiated,
and a week later stating with equal assurance that he was convinced
of his guilt. Well done, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PERFORMANCE IN A CAMEO ROLE: Chief Justice of the United
States, William Rehnquist, 74.
</P>
<P>
   With a proper sense of occasion, Rehnquist had copied the gold
stripes on his black gown from a performance of ``Iolanthe,'' but
remained himself throughout, attracting criticism for wearing his
gown too informally, by leaving it open.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the faith with his legendary taciturnity, compensating
with a mean performance on the gavel. More moderator than judge, as
the impeachment trial required, Rehnquist nonetheless handed down
two landmark decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He enhanced the atmosphere of his court by allowing the senators
to call themselves ``senators'' rather than ``jurors,'' and he
memorably ruled against the Majority leader's call for a coffee
break. &QL;

FIND OUT IF SWEETHEART'S FAMILY HAS WARTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans don't generally practice arranged marriages; that is,
unless you count the occasional shotgun wedding, which in Texas we
just call ``real short engagements.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, however, we prefer the kiss-the-frog method
of selecting a mate. You know, you date a lot of incompatible
people until you find someone you like so much you can actually
break your mother's heart by telling her, ``I won't be home for
Christmas this year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That, my friend, is as good as saying ``I do.'' At the very
least it's a strong, ``I might _ if your family isn't totally
weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's important to know about your sweetheart's family
before you make any arrangements whatsoever. I encourage young
people to make an effort to meet their new love's family real early
in the relationship, preferably even before the first date. I tell
you it can save you a whole heap of trouble later on.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I once went over to a nice fellow's home and
discovered his entire family sitting in the den watching
television. I wondered what they were watching because they were
all laughing and enjoying themselves immensely &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a nice domestic scene until I noticed that the
television set wasn't turned on. In fact, there wasn't even a
screen in the thing. When my date's brother took a pair of pliers
and changed the station, I sort of knew that our relationship was
doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Then his mother said, ``Bubba, why don't you adjust the antenna
a bit and see if you can make them fuzzy lines disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubba, my date, complied, but he couldn't seem to get it quite
right. He finally started to walk away but his father said,
``Freeze boy! That's it. It's perfect now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubba had to stand there for an hour while his family watched
whatever it was they were seeing on the TV. I would have left, but
I couldn't get his stupid dog off my leg.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I had a few dating faux pas at my home, too. I'll
never forget the first time my future husband came over to meet my
parents. My mother spotted him first and said, ``Well, hello Bubba,
it's good to see you again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, ma'am,'' he said. ``My name is Alfred and we've never
met before but it's very nice to meet you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama!'' I hissed through clenched teeth, ``Don't you remember?
Poor Bubba died a year ago!''
</P>
<P>
   I was winking my right eye furiously trying to give her a clue.
She was going to ruin everything. I might have to call Bubba up
again if this new guy didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bubba died? But he was just over here last week, wasn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   She had the gall to look distraught. She didn't even like Bubba,
or his dog. Then she noticed that my eyes had rolled back in my
head, obviously seeking refuge from the humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong, Pumpkin?'' she inquired. ``You seem to have a
twitch in your right eye. Maybe you need glasses. You did walk
right into that door this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Mama, I don't need glasses. And don't you have something
to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually no. Let's take Allen into the back yard to meet your
father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Alfred, ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   My dad was in the back yard shooting cans with his rifle. He
stopped, looked Alfred over and said, ``Boy, did you hear about
Bubba?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yessir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you'll make sure she's home by 11, won't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yessir!''
</P>
<P>
   I was home at 9 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, a few years later, Alfred married me anyway, which
just goes to prove that love is as blind and crazy as Bubba's
family. Bubba's married too, by the way. He had a real short
engagement, but he's quite happy now.

FOLK TROUPE IS FOUNDER'S LIFE _ EVEN AT 93
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's proof that art endures while all else changes, it's
in the career of Igor Moiseyev, 93, who founded the Moiseyev Dance
Company in Moscow in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   One invasion, several regimes and a complete counterrevolution
later, Moiseyev, who started the company under Stalin (for whom the
company danced on several occasions), is still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   Though no longer state-supported as it was under the Soviet
government, the Moiseyev Dance Company is currently touring the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Catching Moiseyev by telephone in Jacksonville Beach, Fla.,
recently, we asked him the secret of his longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is work,'' he replied, speaking through interpreter
Tanya Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   Moiseyev, who began his career as a dancer in the Bolshoi
Ballet, quit dancing when he founded the new company, in order to
devote himself to choreography and to training the dancers.
Although the company's idioms are inspired by folk dance, Moiseyev
insists that it is not a folk dance company. Typically, the dancers
are trained in the company's attached school, in the classical
ballet style, starting at age 12 or 13, and join the main company
at about 16.
</P>
<P>
   The classical training ``makes them more fluid,'' says Moiseyev,
who not only tours with the company but also does its choreography
and drops in on class daily. ``I insist on that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the folk influence, drawing on the dozens of ethnic groups
within the old Soviet Union, is what makes the company unique and
what made it a cohesive influence under the Soviet regime. Moiseyev
traveled around the Soviet Union observing folk dance, and then
incorporated it into his ballets for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with 30 dancers, Moiseyev eventually built the company
to more than 200, with a resident accompanying instrumental
ensemble. They traveled around the Soviet Union for decades, and
made their first tour appearances outside the Soviet Union in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, like most formerly state-supported ensembles in
Russia, the Moiseyev Company tours as a way of earning hard
currency from abroad. The current touring company includes almost
80 dancers and appears with taped accompaniment when traveling.
Both on tour and in residence in Moscow, the company performs with
minimal props and scenery, colorful costumes _ and great
theatricality in the dances.
</P>
<P>
   But the demands of travel and the fall of the communist regime
have had a positive influence. Though he no longer scours the
Soviet countryside for folk dances as he once did, Moiseyev now
looks beyond the former Soviet borders for inspiration: The current
repertory includes an Italian-inspired ``Tarantella'' and an
``Egyptian Dance.'' And this may be the key to the company's
continued existence as an ambassador of dance in a world of
constantly shifting politics.

FALL FASHION IS MOLDED, BONDED, STIFF AND LEATHERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clothes with attitude and bold silhouettes are
marching up and down runways here as fashion designers preview
their fall '99 collections to retailers and the media this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie-cutter shapes, stiff fabrics, herds of leather, even a
couple of hoop skirts have been shown. Soft and cuddly these
clothes are not.
</P>
<P>
   It appears designers are rediscovering construction. Bodices are
boned. Leather suits are often sleek and shiny. Skirts have
everything from bustle-like back flaps to seams that curve around
the body. Sometimes these seams are topstitched, as if the designer
is eager to flaunt them.
</P>
<P>
   Take the collection Donna Karan created for her DKNY label. She
refers to her pant shapes as ``molded.'' That means they're
straight, tight and stiff-looking. Bonded fabrics are used for
skirts and for jackets with dolman sleeves. Even the padded
versions appear stiff. The result is jackets that look as if they
could stand without a hanger or body inside, and A-line skirts
resembling little triangles.
</P>
<P>
   According to the program, Karan's message was ``an urban study
of tech and nature.'' To the observer, however, it appeared to be a
group of costumes for laboratory workers in an old sci-fi film.
Maybe that's because she used so many white fabrics. White,
apparently, is now a fall color.
</P>
<P>
   Yeohlee is another designer who's fond of straightforward,
geometric shapes, but they're more supple. Her straight little
shifts, zip-front jackets and comfortable-looking coats come off as
chic and simple _ a combination that's not accidental. It takes a
great pattern, subtle tailoring, superb craftsmanship and quality
fabric to pull off such wearable shapes.
</P>
<P>
   For this designer, that meant wool gaberdine, wool jersey and a
wool that had been given a puckered texture.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sleekest, most sophisticated clothes shown this week
come from a British designer showing here for the first time.
Tomasz Starzewski's collection of leather suits, lavish fur trims
and bejeweled cashmere T-shirts had a kind of old-fashioned
Hollywood glamour. Models wore leather gloves, leather hats and
very, very high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Starzewski is a favorite of Sophie Rhys-Jones, the fiancee of
Britain's Prince Edward. She was wearing one of the designer's
suits when the engagement was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Will he design her wedding gown? That's what some are wondering.
And Starzewski did happen to close his show with not one, but three
bridal gowns: all ivory, and all feathered.
</P>
<P>
   Lavish fur trims were also featured in the Carolina Herrera
show. The fur collars were so big they looked like an entire stole
had been slung around a neckline. They were held in place by silk
cords tied neatly in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the starchiness in fall shapes comes from the fabric.
Leather, double-faced satin, felt (used by designer Marc Jacobs for
coats) and some high-tech synthetics aren't known for their draping
qualities. Put luggage-caliber nylon in a coat and it's going to
stand up to the world.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems a bit early to be previewing fall fashions, it is.
This is the first time American designers have shown before
collections in Milan, Paris and London. Several months ago the
Council of Fashion Designers of America decided to go first,
claiming the traditional previews set in early April didn't allow
them time to deliver goods as early as stores demanded.
</P>
<P>
   In reality it's more likely American designers were tired of
being last _ and sometimes accused of copying their European
counterparts.

ARRESTING RADIO HOAX COLLARS LISTENERS, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN AUSTIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Police in the studio. Dead air. DJs on the way to jail in cuffs.
More dead air. On paper, it sounds like the recipe for broadcast
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But listeners who tuned in to Metroplex radio station KEGL FM
around 10 p.m. one recent Friday heard an entertaining little hoax
when DJs Kramer and Twitch were seemingly collared on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The overgrown delinquents were not only arrested, but filmed by
a ``TV news crew,'' then dragged out in cuffs. Then, the only other
guy left at the station had to call the program director to explain
it all _ on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The bust was ostensibly the result of some outrageous, perhaps
illegal, prank call Kramer and Twitch had made earlier in the
evening. Of course, it was an act, but who knew for sure?
</P>
<P>
   For listeners who don't mind a little nonsense, the hoax _
engineered by morning KEGL jock Russ Martin as a payback for an
attempted car-towing prank by Kramer and Twitch _ was a nice
example of how a silly radio shtick can still create the old
``theater of the mind.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it wasn't Orson Welles-level stuff. But love 'em or
not, the hijinks helped Kramer and Twitch practically double their
market share in their first full ratings book.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, who did a stint on sister station KDMX FM before
management moved them to the Eagle, are No. 3 among all Fort
Worth-Dalles listeners age 12 and up, according to the fall
quarterly rating book.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get pretty crazy sometimes,'' program director Greg
Stevens said. ``But there's a little bit of junior-high boy in lots
of men 25 to 54.''
</P>
<P>
   The station's been in need of some good news. These guys dumped
Howard Stern in 1997, a decision that cost the rock station in the
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Eagle has landed on some decent ratings,
Stevens isn't through tinkering. He's not promising to reconnect
listeners to Stern, but called the Stern firing a ``debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was before I got here, so I'm allowed to say that,'' he
said, roundly dissing the now-gone owners. ``I told my wife, as
radio owners go, they make a great insurance company.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of morning radio, there's a new wheel on KRNB/105.7
FM's drive time. And in addition to Chicago native Joe Soto,
listeners should also hear some musical differences. And coming
soon: a taller tower, which will allow them to hit target
demographics in places such as south Oak Cliff.
</P>
<P>
   The classic R&AMP;B will continue at night but, for the most part,
program director Al Payne will leave the oldies to the likes of
KTXQ/102.1 FM. That's what the focus groups want, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling us they appreciate their oldies,'' he said of
his focus group listeners, ``but they don't want to `feel' old.''
</P>
<P>
   Good point. Fortunately, guys like Kramer and Twitch seem to
know that although we all age, it's never too late to get on the
radio and act immature for your age.

   Phase One is over. The University of Connecticut made its run,
holding the No. 1 spot in the national men's basketball rankings
for 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to Syracuse Feb. 1 knocked the Huskies to No. 2, though
they have run off three straight wins since then.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely the Huskies will climb back to No. 1 soon, and in
fact, it is still difficult for many longtime observers of the
program to fathom how they attained such a lofty status in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   You may question _ as many have _ whether the Huskies were a
legitimate No. 1 team. But no one can question their place among
the elite of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Calhoun's team has been too consistent over the past
two seasons _ winning 54 of 60 games _ to be considered unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism goes deeper than that, tracing back to when the
school was known as Connecticut Agriculture College and basketball
was something to do between football and baseball seasons; it was a
time when a big achievement for the Huskies was beating the
University of Rhode Island or Holy Cross or Providence, and it was
an honor to be regarded as the best team in New England.
</P>
<P>
   For longtime Husky watchers who remember those days, it
stretches the imagination to ponder how far the program has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 20 years the Big East has been in existence, we've had
a lot of Cinderella stories,'' said conference commissioner Mike
Tranghese, who can talk about the success of Georgetown and St.
John's in the early 1980s, Villanova's national championship run in
1985 (when the Big East sent three teams to the Final Four), Seton
Hall's magic run to the title game in 1989, and Syracuse and
Providence getting to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the emergence of UConn is the most amazing feat of all.
They are truly a national program now. And not just in men's
basketball. You look across the board at women's basketball and
everything they do. It's been phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   The link between UConn's emergence to national contender and the
growth of the Big East is undeniable. It's also remarkable,
considering that former commissioner Dave Gavitt had to politick
hard to get the Huskies in as a charter member in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there was potential for growth there,'' said Gavitt.
``But some of the schools had to be convinced.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced. Coerced. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Gavitt, like most people, thought the upside would be a nice
solid program that would represent the league well. Like most
people, he didn't foresee the quantum leap to a perennial Top 10
program that UConn has made under Calhoun. He recently became the
winningest coach in school history, surpassing Hugh Greer, who
compiled a 286-112 (.719) record from 1946-63 during what was then
regarded as the golden age of Huskies basketball, when they
competed evenly with every team in New England and occasionally
rose to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my wildest dreams did I foresee what Jimmy has done
in making the program so successful on a national level,'' said
Gavitt. ``We're talking about Storrs, Conn., not Carolina, Duke,
Kentucky, or UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the program was destitute when Calhoun took over from
Dom Perno in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of UConn basketball had been steady, dating back
to the turn of the century, when CAC was literally a cow college,
stuck in the hills of the northwestern part of the state. The
nearest train station was 3 miles away in Eagleville, and once
winter enveloped the area, there was precious little to do. Some
students paid their tuition by bringing eggs from their chicken
farms to school and selling them.
</P>
<P>
   The administration thought the new sport of basketball was an
``interesting game to watch'' and would provide a diversion between
fall and spring.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the Huskies, as they were soon called, developed a
reputation as a nice little New England team, though no threat to
regional powers such as Rhode Island, Holy Cross (stlll the only
New England school to win a national championship), and Providence.
</P>
<P>
   That started to change after World War II when Greer returned to
his alma mater. In 17 seasons, his teams won 12 Yankee Conference
championships and received seven NCAA tournament bids.
</P>
<P>
   The interest level was intense, as it is now. Husky basketball
was the main game in the state, and sellout crowds at the old
Hawley Armory and The Hangar, the Field House, and now Gampel
Pavilion, were common.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights were confined to the region, though, such as
February 1954, when the Huskies came to the Worcester Auditorium
and ended Holy Cross's 47-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   While the success was appreciated, it had a price tag. In 1961,
the program took a major hit when Jack Rose, a three-year
letterman, was indicted in a point-shaving scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Greer's reign ended tragically on Jan. 14, 1963, when he died of
a massive heart attack after a game of handball with assistant
coach George Wighton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Husky beat continued, still on a regional basis. The
hiring of Dee Rowe in March 1969 signified a new direction. Rowe
recruited black players from Connecticut's major cities, keeping
the best players in state, a major goal for any state school.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, who stepped aside for health reasons in 1979, credits
Calhoun with the Huskies' current elevation in status.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What Jim has done is take them to the promised land,'' said
Rowe, who remains at the university as a special adviser on
athletics. ``He has put them in rarefied air. When I was there, we
were working like crazy to get into the Final Four in New England.
Now the goal is to get into the Final Four in the country _ not
only that, but to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were strictly regional. We had no goals of winning the
national championship. We were strictly a bus league, going to
places like Orono, Burlington, Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change came when we entered the Big East and built Gampel
Pavilion. The commitment was there from the administration and from
Jim. What he has done _ to see us something like seventh in the
country in total wins for the past 10 years _ is mind-boggling.
It's beyond comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation came slowly, guided by Calhoun's persistence
and willingness to go anywhere in the world in search of players.
He has gone to Israel and plucked such stars as Nadav Henefeld and
Doron Sheffer. He has gone to Senegal to recruit 6-foot-11-inch
junior forward Souleymane Wane. He has gone to Katy, Texas, to get
6-11 center Jake Voskuhl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like it had been dormant waiting for a guy like
Jim Calhoun to come here and get a total commitment from the
university,'' said Rowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to see how the change in perception took
place,'' said Boston University coach Dennis Wolff, who played two
seasons for Rowe and Perno. ``We were competitive in New England,
but Providence and Holy Cross were thought to be a cut above
everybody else. Now it's UConn and UMass and more recently UConn by
itself. Not only in the region, but as a national power.''
</P>
<P>
   The defining moments include winning the National Invitation
Tournament in 1988 by beating Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The table-setter,'' Calhoun called it. ``That gave us
legitimacy. All of a sudden, we were making a little national
noise.''
</P>
<P>
   It became a lot of noise in 1990. The Huskies won the Big East
for the first time. Then came the first Miracle in the Meadowlands
_ a 71-70 win over Clemson in the NCAA East Regional semifinals,
highlighted by Tate George's last-second shot.
</P>
<P>
   With UConn trailing by a point and less than two seconds left,
Calhoun's will and George's skill prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Calhoun got us in the huddle and told us we were going to
win the game,'' said George.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the miracle went the other way when Duke's
Christian Laettner made a last-second shot to beat the Huskies,
79-78, depriving them of a trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The loss stung until thousands of UConn fans greeted the team on
its arrival in Storrs that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mended those broken hearts,'' said Calhoun, fighting back
tears himself.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, with the exception of 1992-93 and 1996-97, UConn has
been a player in the national picture at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is big at Connecticut,'' said Richard Hamilton,
last season's Big East Player of the Year. ``That's all people
think about. I like the style of play. Storrs is a college town.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than that. It's become like Chapel Hill and Durham,
N.C., and Lexington, Ky.: a mecca for basketball talent. It's the
lure of the Big East, the lure of a shot at the national
championship, the lure of playing for Calhoun, the former
Northeastern coach who has proven he can win at any level and get
his players to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at basketball as the front porch of the university,''
said athletic director Lew Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are still against UConn winning a national
championship, perhaps even of making the Final Four. But that does
not diminish what the Huskies and Calhoun have accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have,'' said Gavitt, with as much admiration as
amazement, ``carried the Big East in the 1990s.''

OOPS, I'VE GOT ANOTHER KARMA THING COMING  
 (EMBARGOED FOR THURSDAY, FEB. 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A couple of months ago, I wrote a nasty letter to
``This Old House'' because I didn't like how a Victorian mansion
was being restored. After I mailed it, I realized that, because I
was being so petty, karma _ which returns to you ten-fold _ was
going to be brutal. I now believe that the following letters are a
portion of my penance.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Laurie: You recently printed a letter (Dec. 31) in which a
reader (Unsigned, Scottsdale) corrected you on your use of the
phrase ``you have another think coming.'' I have to say that by
publicly insisting you were right, and Unsigned was wrong, you
really ``stepped in it.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you still don't believe this, I challenge you to come up
with a sentence in which you can correctly utilize the phrase ``you
have another thing coming.'' After considerable thought, the only
one I can think of is, ``You ordered two things in the mail, and we
only sent you one, so you have another thing coming.'' Hardly a
common phrase in the English language. I think you owe Unsigned a
public apology. ``Thing again.'' - David Heward, Mesa, Ariz &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dave: Oh boy, here we go AGAIN, and this time, you want to
CHALLENGE me. Dear God. This is more torture than having to change
out for PE in seventh grade! Dave, in 1982, Judas Priest released
``Screaming With a Vengeance,'' and there was a song on that album,
``You've Got Another Thing Coming,'' that became a pretty big hit
that everyone knew the words to. Turn your radio to KZZP and I bet
you'll hear it within an hour. Doesn't mean that Judas Priest wrote
``The Elements of Style,'' but it is common usage, and folks,
generally speaking, have no problem understanding it.
</P>
<P>
   At the Web site for Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and
Phrases (if you still don't believe me, it's www.thesaurus.com/), I
did a search on both phrases. ``Another think coming'' produced
``WORDS RELATING TO THE VOLUNTARY POWERS; INDIVIDUAL VOLITION'' and
``another thing coming'' produced ``WORDS RELATING TO THE
INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES; FORMATION OF IDEAS.'' So see? We're all
right, we're all wrong, and we're all bored to death of this
subject. In fact, I'm naming this entire chapter of my life ``The
Stupidest Fight I Ever Had With People I Don't Know,'' and am
officially closing the book.
</P>
<P>
   And sure, Dave, I will absolutely apologize: Norm, Steve and
``This Old House,'' I'm very, very sorry, and I SWEAR I'll never,
EVER do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Letter to the Rep editors: We have a problem with Written Off by
Laurie Notaro. She shouldn't put down people who are trying to quit
smoking and make themselves healthy. We're in the '90s and it's
really a shame that people are still addicted to tobacco. The
statistics have shown that it does cause lung cancer and a few of
my friends have died from lung cancer, and it's not too funny. And
about making fun of little old ladies _ she's going to be a little
old lady herself someday, and I'm sure people are going to be
making fun of her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Susie, Phoenix
</P>
<P>
   Dear Susie: When I was in college, sometimes I drank too much. I
usually ended up hurting myself by falling down on train tracks and
busting my head open, falling down the stairs or falling out of a
car and hitting my head on a big rock.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the hooch, my brain signals were getting all mixed up
and crazy, but eventually I figured out that if I covered one eye,
I understood my environment better _ mainly because there was now
only one of them _ and my injuries decreased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Susie, I think you should start reading these columns _ in fact,
start reading everything _ with one eye. You can use your hand to
do this, or create an attractive and vibrantly colored eye patch.
Be creative. You can add lace and decorate it with splashes of
metallic puff paint or shiny sprinkles. While I'm not suggesting
you were drunk when you read the column or wrote the letter, to be
on the safe side, I'd steer clear of any train tracks, stairs or
big rocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the column you wrote your letter about, (begin ital) I (end
ital)am the person who is trying to quit smoking; therefore, (begin
ital) I (end ital) am making fun of (begin ital) myself, (end ital)
and that's (begin ital) OK. (end ital) I'm allowed to do that. I
know lung cancer isn't funny, and that's why I'm (begin ital)
quitting. (end ital) And I don't have to wait until I'm old for
people to make fun of me, because that already happens (begin ital)
now. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Just to make sure we understand each other, let's take a simple
yet enjoyable quiz about what we've learned today:
</P>
<P>
   1) The person trying to quit smoking is: a) Laurie Notaro; b)
Susie; c) Norm.
</P>
<P>
   2) Laurie is quitting because: a) it's unhealthy; b) she has
only one eye; c) trains and large rocks frighten her.
</P>
<P>
   3) Laurie thinks cancer is: a) not funny; b) the Spanish word
for ``meat store''; c) a very big crab up in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   4) From now on, if I, Susie, read Written Off, I will do so: a)
with one eye; b) drunk; c) with two eyes, misunderstand the content
and write a mean letter about Laurie Notaro to her boss.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, Susie. I hope the world becomes a new and less
confusing place for you.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Laurie: The reason for this letter is your article on
smoking really interested me. I began smoking at the age of 26
after I had all of my four children. I was married to a controlling
husband and did it out of spite. Little did I know how hard it was
going to be to quit. I finally did it eight years ago, but 10
months ago I had the craving again, so I went out and bought
Nicorette. That was the biggest mistake I ever did. I am hooked on
it, have tried everything to get off it, but nothing seems to work.
I'd give anything to get rid of this bad gum. It's rotted out my
teeth and now I have to have them out.
</P>
<P>
   It makes my stomach hurt and all kinds of bad things happen to
you. If you know of any way at all how to get off this stuff, I
would be very grateful to you. I even wrote to the company and have
not gotten a reply as of yet. I am going on 60 years old and I know
I still have a good many years left in me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roslyn, Yuma, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Roslyn: One time a tooth came out of my own head as I was
eating a Gummy Bear on my 30th birthday, so I know how it feels.
It's icky and sad. But look on the bright side of things: You won't
have to floss anymore, and you won't have to worry that there might
be a piece of spinach on your front tooth when you're talking to
someone cute.
</P>
<P>
   But I do want you to get yourself clean. Honestly, I'd talk to a
doctor or quit cold turkey. If you've given birth four times,
sister, you already know you can do anything. &QL;

REGGIE WHITE'S DEFENDERS TURN PLOWSHARES INTO SWORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The advertisement ran in USA Today: ``In tribute
to Reggie White,'' it said, with a picture of the recently retired
Green Bay Packer below, smiling under the words: ``A man of God
needs but one defense.''
</P>
<P>
   A short letter followed, signed by more than 100 NFL players,
including Player of the Year Randall Cunningham, Atlanta safety
Eugene Robinson, Carolina linebacker Kevin Greene and San
Francisco's Merton Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   The letter started by lauding White's football success. Off the
field, it said, ``the world has often tested the strength of his
character and his commitment to Godly principles of behavior.'' The
conclusion was bold-faced: ``So get ready, America, because we're
standing with Reggie to defend the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   The point, however carefully veiled, seemed clear. White has
been criticized for his brand of Christianity only once. He took up
the anti-gay cause last spring, using religion as a cover for
bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Now a bunch of football players are supporting him. It's not all
that surprising, really, given how many NFL players praise Jesus
after a touchdown, or gather at midfield to pray after a game. In
the last 10 years, religion has become as much a part of football
culture as the end-zone dance.
</P>
<P>
   But the tone of this ad last week evoked another tradition of
the game, the need to dominate, to be forever at war. In place of
God's humble servants, we have schoolyard bullies.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, they use their bodies as weapons. Off the field,
they use their fame. Religion is their steroid, used for
unprescribed means, creating bogus muscle.
</P>
<P>
   This is not meant to discount the spirituality of athletes
grateful for their health, for their superior physical gifts, and
for the joy that sports offers. For the most part, Reggie White
seemed to fit that mold _ charitable, decent, a moral beacon to his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But he also had an alarming tendency to make football success
sound like validation of Christian grace. Green Bay's Super Bowl
victory was God's will. White's back healed because God wanted him
to play another year.
</P>
<P>
   But if God spoke through Reggie White's football career, what
did it mean last month, when he finished in defeat in the gay
capital of America?
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect his supporters to answer that one. Their religion
is one of convenience, of self-justification. If it doesn't make
them winners, they take their toys and go home.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's how Bill Horn portrays them. He lives in Iowa
and helps arrange public-speaking appearances for White. They
connected last year, after White kicked off his anti-gay campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was Horn who put together the ad in USA Today. He said that
athletes around the league had started calling him last spring,
after White's holy war began. He cited Kyle Brady of the Jets as
one of the leaders. Horn found an ad agency to write the text,
persuaded three religious organizations to underwrite the cost and
then sent copies of the ad to team chaplains around the league to
recruit signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Horn was asked whether the players planned to defend
Christianity by asking the NFL to stop playing on Sundays. He
seemed to consider the question impertinent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people work on Sundays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what about keeping holy the Sabbath?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that depends on the Sabbath as defined by the
Christianity that you espouse,'' Horn said. He was referring to
Seventh-day Adventists, and sounding very Clinton-esque for a man
who has no love of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the gospel, in other words, isn't a priority if it
means offending the NFL and risking the huge paychecks it doles
out.
</P>
<P>
   There are some voices of reason in the NFL. One of them belongs
to Leigh Steinberg, the most powerful agent in the game. He insists
that his clients perform public service, and he tries to position
them all as role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``They trigger imitative behavior,'' he said. ``They have an
especially profound effect on young, adolescent males, and this is
a group that is in the middle of forming attitudes and behavior.
And while I think it's laudable to model Christianity and spiritual
values to that group, this is exactly the danger group in terms of
intolerance. You know, teen-age boys have been a major source of
anti-gay violence. So I think that athletes have to be particularly
careful that comments they make not be deemed toleration for
anti-gay violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Horn is willing to allow certain sins to slide.
</P>
<P>
   Take Eugene Robinson's alleged pre-Super Bowl dalliance with an
undercover vice cop. After the incident, Horn said, he never
considered removing Robinson's name from the list of signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all not perfect. We all make mistakes,'' Horn said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Kevin Greene's sideline attack on an assistant coach
disqualify him from enlisting in the holy war. Now, if he'd kissed
the man instead ...

THE TAX CUT FOLLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By launching a national crusade for a 10 percent
across-the-board tax cut this week, Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott is getting too far out in front of his Republican troops.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are that when he looks around, he will find few
soldiers standing behind him. Republicans traditionally love tax
cuts, but this time not necessarily this one.
</P>
<P>
   It is odd that Lott, normally a cautious fellow, is sticking his
neck out on an issue that divides rather than unifies his party.
</P>
<P>
   He is eager to change the political subject from the impeachment
charade that consumed Washington and hurt the Republicans in the
polls. But the overarching need of the GOP congressional majority
is to demonstrate that it can govern without becoming sidetracked
by an intraparty ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Senate Republican caucus voted to give broad tax
cuts a high priority. House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich
quickly introduced a similar plan. But the idea had already lost
steam by the time Lott began a series of town meetings Monday to
promote it as the centerpiece of a new GOP agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the projected federal budget surplus, there are plenty
of warning signals that a substantial across-the-board tax cut has
no wings.
</P>
<P>
   One important sign came recently from Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who announced flatly that
he prefers targeted tax reductions that would help families with
specific needs, such as education expenses. ``I don't really favor
the across-the-board (approach),'' he said in a CNN interview.
</P>
<P>
   The charm of targeted tax cuts is that they might actually pass
Congress and be signed by President Clinton, giving both Democrats
and Republicans an achievement on which to run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most Democrats and moderates are not fans of
across-the-board cuts. And without their support, GOP conservatives
cannot carry the day. They must move to the center, and that means
compromising.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been clever at stealing traditional GOP themes by
repackaging them with middle-class ribbons. In spite of his
impeachment troubles, he seems to have done it again.
</P>
<P>
   The president included specific tax cuts in his State of the
Union address, from breaks for child care to help for long-term
care for the elderly and disabled. Many Democrats and GOP moderates
endorse those proposals, in addition to some others such as wiping
out estate taxes and the marriage tax penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The president has been persuasive in labeling across-the-board
cuts as a sop to the wealthy, who would benefit proportionately
more than lower and middle-income families. He has transformed the
issue into a test between saving money for Social Security or
giving it away to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have also countered GOP complaints that Americans
are overtaxed by noting that while overall tax revenues have gone
up in the booming economy, the rate has actually gone down for
ordinary folks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, voters are not clamoring for broad tax cuts. They tell
the pollsters that other goals are more important, such as spending
on education and Social Security or reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans made it a point of honor to ignore the
polls that indicated a majority of voters did not approve of their
drive to remove Clinton from office. Even their own party
consultants now agree that such indifference to the public will was
stupid politics. The GOP would be foolish to let their image as
runaway legislators harden by ignoring the voters again so soon.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York Times, Lott's initial appearance
before about 500 people in Warren, Mich., on President's Day fell
somewhat short of a rousing rally for an across-the-board tax cut.
When asked who would like to pay less in taxes, dozens of those in
the audience failed to reflexively raise their hands. In interviews
afterward, many expressed more concern about reducing the national
debt than reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This begins to look like another Republican miscalculation,
beating a political drum to a rhythm nobody hears. Lott may in fact
be having second thoughts. He said after his speech that maybe
Congress could pass both the broad tax cuts and the targeted ones.
And then what revenues would be left to pay for Social Security?

LAID OFF: WHAT TO DO BEFORE AND IF IT HAPPENS TO YOU  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By PAMELA YIP 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The sight of energy companies announcing enormous
layoffs can send chills down the spines of even the best of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you've been doing a great job, you are likely to fear
that the ax will fall, throwing your financial life into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just stew about the possible loss of your job, take
some positive steps now to gain control of your life in case the
worst happens.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're spared from a layoff, you will be better off
having gone through these financial exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take action. The more control you take over the situation in
the beginning, the less stress you will have when the actual event
takes place,'' said Stephanie Cummings, a financial adviser at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Houston, which has conducted seminars
for workers at the United Paperworkers International Union in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The goal here isn't complicated. You want to see now if you
could pay the bills if your income took a hit.
</P>
<P>
   The key steps include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider your living expenses. Could you cut your spending if
you needed to in order to live on a smaller income?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anticipate any big financial hits in the near future, such as
a bill for insurance or income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Determine if you have any spare cash to make up for a possible
decline in income.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you escape this round of layoffs, you'll have a better
idea of where your money is going, which is the first and often the
hardest step in building for the future.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start with a financial checkup. Consider how much a layoff
will hurt your total income. Factor in your severance package,
which could include the company paying for your health insurance.
If you're married, factor in your spouse's income.
</P>
<P>
   Include how much you will be receiving in unemployment benefits,
but don't count on them solely to get you through this.
</P>
<P>
   Jobless benefits are taxable and they're short-term.
</P>
<P>
   After considering how much money you've got coming in, calculate
how much money you'll need in your checking account to pay the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to have an understanding of what type of pressure do
I need to put on myself to find a new job?'' said John Eadie, a
partner in the personal financial counseling group at accounting
firm Ernst &AMP; Young in Houston, which is providing financial
counseling to employees who lost their jobs in the BP Amoco
layoffs. ``You need to understand how much in terms of savings I
have accumulated to convert that into a number of months before I
need to find a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Make a financial worksheet and put down what you spend each
month on such things as food, car needs, utilities, laundry and
cleaning, mortgage and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   This will give you an idea of how much money you've spent.
</P>
<P>
   Put down what your bills are, how much you owe on them, the due
dates and establish a budget.
</P>
<P>
   If your income comes up short, know where you can find sources
of immediate cash, such as from savings and investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it take to live on the lifestyle that you would like
to have, to continue it?'' Eadie said.
</P>
<P>
   Find part-time work you can get should the ax fall. Tap your
network of friends and business associates for job leads.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have much cash on hand, cut your spending as much
as possible now and put the money you save in a savings account.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your company is anticipating an acquisition, a merger or
downsizing, start preparing and having at least six months of your
monthly expenditures in a savings account,'' said Sharon McLean,
executive director of Consumer Credit Counseling Service of the
Gulf Coast Area in Houston, which helps consumers with credit
problems. ``It might take you that long to find a job.''
</P>
<P>
   If your company just announced a layoff, chances are you don't
have enough time to do that.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to sell some investments and stash the money away
in a money market mutual fund, where you can get to it easily,
Eadie said.
</P>
<P>
   With stocks selling at such inflated prices now, it may be the
best time to take your profits before prices start tanking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to really take a look at, `Do I need to reposition
some of my investments?''' Eadie said. ``Because you need to be a
little bit more conservative because that's the money you need for
very short-term goals. If I invested that money in stocks, I would
move into cash or no more riskier (investments) than bonds until I
got back on my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tighten your belt.
</P>
<P>
   A layoff will completely throw your lifestyle for a loop, so you
need to look ahead of time for ways to cut back on spending on the
little extras.
</P>
<P>
   Stick to your budget and spend only on the essentials, such as
food, shelter, utilities and transportation. This isn't the time to
splurge on a meal at a fancy restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Involve the whole family in making sacrifices during this time
of need by doing such things as borrowing books from the library
instead of buying them and renting movies instead of going to the
theater. Remember that when you get laid off, your family also is
laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid using credit cards, but if you must do so for emergencies,
use the card with the lowest interest rate. If you overdo it, you
will find yourself in a tough situation even after you've found a
job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Live off your severance pay first.
</P>
<P>
   If you have severance pay, use that as your first source of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a severance package, it must be included in
taxable income,'' Eadie said. ``It's after-tax money, whereas if
you pulled money out of an investment account and earned capital
gains, that's money you have a choice of whether you pay taxes on
or not because you have a choice of whether to sell or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoard your severance money if possible. This pay is meant to
cover your living expenses between the time you lose your job and
when you find a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a $10,000 severance check, you want to be vigilant
that you don't take that money and buy a new car with that,'' Eadie
said. ``You need to use that just as if it was your salary.''
</P>
<P>
   Slice off a portion of that money that's equal to your monthly
salary and deposit it in your checking account to pay the bills.
Stash the rest away in a savings account or money market fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those psychological things that, `Oh, that's my
savings account,''' Eadie said. ``It tends to make people think
about it more than if it were sitting in your checking account.''
</P>
<P>
   In handling your severance payment, be sure to calculate how
much tax you will have to pay on it and set aside enough money to
pay that tax.
</P>
<P>
   Companies typically withhold 28 percent of the severance amount
for income tax, but they're also required to withhold 1.45 percent
for Medicare tax and 6.2 percent for Social Security, Eadie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still may owe more if you're in a higher tax bracket, and
you need to be concerned about whether you need to make estimated
tax payments, or will you owe the difference when you file your tax
return?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't drop insurance.
</P>
<P>
   As you do your budget you will be tempted to cut your spending
by avoiding some costly premiums. It's crucial that you keep paying
for your health benefits and other necessary insurance during this
crisis period. Scrimping on health insurance premiums to save money
would be pound-foolish because one serious illness or accident will
land you in worse financial condition than before your layoff.
</P>
<P>
   If you're married, the lowest-cost option may well be to have
your spouse add you to his or her health plan at work.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, consider Cobra. That is the acronym for the law that
requires companies to tell you that you're entitled to continue
your health care coverage. The acronym stands for the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that the continuation of health coverage last
for generally 18 months, during which you, the employee, pay the
full health insurance premium, plus a 2 percent administrative fee.
</P>
<P>
   Group insurance rates are far lower than what you can find for
individual coverage, but they're still expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to make the decision right up front without
looking at both of your options,'' said Michelle Miears, a
principal at Buck Consultants in Houston, an employee benefits
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Some plans may not allow you to get on your spouse's health plan
until your Cobra coverage has expired, she said.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a member of a labor union, contact the union because
it may have negotiated arrangements on continuation of health
insurance with your employer, Miears said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes (benefits) end immediately on your last day of work
or they may go for the rest of the month,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't try to go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Take advantage of outplacement assistance and job retraining
programs your employer, union and community organizations offer.
</P>
<P>
   This may also be the perfect time to go into an entirely
different career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can find a better time to change your
career, to start your own business,'' said Greg Nakanishi, who was
laid off from Tenneco in 1990. He started his own business, GN
Resources in Houston, a human resources consulting firm.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Loco moco is the original fusion food. Created in the
1940s in the kitchens of Hawaii as a lunchtime alternative to
American sandwiches and more time-consuming Asian entrees, it's a
homey combination of two scoops of rice topped with both a seasoned
hamburger patty and a fried egg, all generously covered with thick
brown gravy. Thighs, watch out!
</P>
<P>
   Traditional loco moco turns up in cafes and lunch wagons all
through the islands, but in recent years, it has also morphed into
something more sophisticated, as Hawaiian chefs have converted the
old ``local food'' into Pacific Rim cuisine. Alan Wong's has its
own elegant take on loco moco, with fried rice bound with nori, the
Japanese seaweed, and crowned with a tiny shrimp-and-pork-hash
patty and a quail egg. This handsome little mouthful _ labeled mini
loco moco _ sits on a bed of reduced chicken and veal jus, giving
no clue to its lowly origins.
</P>
<P>
   At Sam Choy's, the loco moco is a crab cake on sauteed Maui
onions on top of fried rice with a shiitake butter-cream sauce. And
a chicken is responsible for the egg.
</P>
<P>
   Loco moco, like plate lunch, crack seed, manapua, Spam and poke,
is a food that bonds the islands' population of Asians, Caucasians
and Polynesians. Visitors to Hawaii may catch sight of a sign
advertising manapua or plate lunch as they are driven to an
obligatory luau, but only persistence will get them to a lunch
wagon serving loco moco.
</P>
<P>
   Natives are certain that mainlanders will make fun of ``local
food.'' With good reason. This Hawaiian version of soul food puts
McDonald's to shame: The fat-laden portions are huge, with nary a
green thing in sight. But the locals can't live without it. ``It's
comfort food,'' said Joan Clarke, food editor of The Honolulu
Advertiser. ``And we all know that fat tastes good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, these are the same dishes that chefs like Alan Wong,
Russell Siu and Sam Choy are using as inspiration for aspects of
their very ambitious menus. ``This came about naturally,'' Wong
said. ``I should be cooking what I grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's is a polyglot history: migrating Pacific islanders,
European explorers, New Englanders and Chinese, Japanese,
Portuguese, Korean, Philippine and Southeast Asian immigrants, who
came to work on the sugar and pineapple plantations. Local food
began to appear in the 1920s and '30s, when housewives, lunch-wagon
cooks and mom-and-pop shop owners made the best of what was
available and when schoolchildren, as well as plantation workers,
began trading the lunches they brought from home.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of local food is plate lunch, cheerfully
described by Hawaiians as ``a heart attack on a plate'': two huge
scoops of rice (the Asian influence), a heaping portion of meat or
fish, a scoop of macaroni or potato salad with mayonnaise, and a
nice thick coating of gravy, all ``haole,'' or white American,
elements. It is to be seasoned with soy, teriyaki or hot sauce and
eaten with chopsticks or a knife and fork.
</P>
<P>
   The myriad variations reflect the national origins of the cook.
A Korean plate lunch will have Korean grilled beef and meat
dumplings; a Caucasian version will have spaghetti and meat sauce
mixed up with hot dogs and Spam. (Spam has more fans in Hawaii than
in any other state.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Hawaii is probably the only place in the world where you can
get spaghetti and meat sauce, garlic bread, two scoops of rice and
a macaroni salad all on one plate,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   Choy often sticks closer to the original than chefs like Wong
do. ``I took everyday local food that everyone was ashamed of and
blew it right out of there,'' Choy said as he sat in Sam Choy's
Diamond Head, one of his eight restaurants. ``When people come to
Hawaii, you want them to have a taste of Hawaii, not froufrou
stuff.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So his favorite plate lunch has the traditional shoyu chicken,
but it is made with five-spice powder and cilantro. The gravy is
from the pan, not the can.
</P>
<P>
   Poke (it rhymes with OK and means bite size) has also become
popular in the last 20 years. Eaten after work with a beer, it is
the casual Hawaiian version of Japanese sashimi. Morsels of raw
fish are cut into bite-size pieces and traditionally seasoned with
Hawaiian salt, chopped seaweed and ground candlenuts, called kukui.
Today, there are at least two dozens kinds of poke, ranging from
ahi tuna to octopus, with almost as many kinds of seasoning.
They're all good with beer, but Wong has taken them into another
dimension by creating a dish called Poki Pines, ahi-poke balls
encased in strips of wonton wrappers, deep-fried and served on
avocado with wasabi sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiian chefs have also taken inspiration from the luau,
particularly from kalua pig, the pit-roasted centerpiece of the
feast, usually served with poi, the bland paste made from taro
root, which is beloved only by those who have eaten it since
infancy.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant 3660 on the Rise, the owner, Siu, fills spring
rolls with sauteed kalua pig, made with onions and Chinese cabbage,
and serves them with a poi vinaigrette and lomi tomatoes. The
tomatoes are taken from a dish called lomilomi salmon (raw salted
salmon mixed with tomatoes and onions), another staple of the luau.
Lomilomi means to rub between the fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Manapua, the Hawaiian street-food version of Chinese steamed
pork buns filled with barbecued pork, or char siu bao, is barely
recognizable in Wong's revision. The char sui is in a tortilla, not
a bun, along with mozzarella. The whole quesadilla is grilled and
served with a tomato relish and chili oil with lemongrass and
cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Even crack seed _ fruits dried and seasoned with sugar, salt and
star anise _has found its way to Wong's menu. Li hing mui is an
extremely sour and salty version of crack seed. Every Hawaiian
child snacks on it after school. ``You got used to the intensity,''
Wong said. ``The sides of my jaw start to hurt when I think of it.
But to us, it's like the potato chip is to you.''
</P>
<P>
   He uses the flavor in a chutney that alternates with vanilla ice
cream with Jack Daniel's on it, between layers of macadamia nut
puff pastry. The name alone is a mouthful: li hing moi
mille-feuille.
</P>
<P>
   All these innovations are the essence of the new and old Hawaii,
but don't look for them in New York, though the Honolulu chef Roy
Yamaguchi has just opened a restaurant in lower Manhattan. There is
no loco moco or manapua in any form and certainly no Spam on the
menu at Roy's New York, said Troy Guard, the executive chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't want people to think we're doing Hawaiian
food,'' he said. ``It's Euro-Asian cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
   But then again, it always was.

`PIZZA ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT!': PIZZA WORTH AN EXCLAMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to pizza, it is difficult to get people to jump
out of their seats over new recipes. Perhaps that is why in ``Pizza
Any Way You Slice It!'' (Broadway Books, $20), Charles and Michele
Scicolone do nothing more emphatic than put an exclamation point in
the title.
</P>
<P>
   The book has a few enticing pictures _ bubbling fresh mozzarella
dripping down the side of a puffy pizza crust, and focaccia
sprinkled with rosemary and brushed with golden olive oil _ and a
list of classics we've all heard of.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing really to get excited about, until you try the
recipes. If you use good-quality ingredients and follow the
instructions carefully, you find that they are not just familiar;
they are superb.
</P>
<P>
   The Scicolones have tried to make the recipes as easy as
possible without destroying their authenticity. And they have
managed to strike a good balance.
</P>
<P>
   The wine focaccia, for example, is made in the food processor,
but the dough is made with a yeasty, frothy starter and is soft and
supple. Once baked, the foccacia is crisp, fragrant and just a
little bit sour, sprinkled with the perfect amount of coarse salt
crystals.
</P>
<P>
   The pizza margherita is fresh tasting and creamy, with a pool of
fresh mozzarella and a thin slick of olive oil. Rather than asking
the reader to hunt down tomatoes in the winter, the authors offer a
tomato sauce made with canned, peeled tomatoes, good olive oil and
a little salt. It is a brave stand, and the results are
surprisingly good.
</P>
<P>
   Piadina, a flat disk of dough that is browned in a skillet and
folded around fillings _ for example, sliced prosciutto and salami,
or arugula and soft goat cheese, or sauteed greens _ is lovely and
a cinch to throw together for a weeknight dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems slightly off the point, there is also a chapter
on antipasti. In it is a recipe for olive and fennel salad _
nothing groundbreaking. The olives and fennel make a pleasant
contrast of sweetness and acidity, and a pinch of red pepper flakes
gives the salad just enough kick. But just as with the other dishes
in the book, after you try it, you want seconds. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PIADINA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Pizza Any Way You Slice It!'' by Charles and
Michele Scicolone
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 10 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3{ cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup soft fresh goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   8 handfuls arugula. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In a food processor or heavy-duty mixer, combine the flour,
salt and baking powder. Add the water and oil. Process or mix until
the dough is smooth and elastic, about 1 minute. Remove from the
machine, and knead briefly by hand on a lightly floured surface.
Shape the dough into a ball. Cover with a bowl, and let rest 20
minutes to 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut the dough into 8 pieces. Cover all but 1 piece with a
bowl. On a lightly floured surface, shape the piece into a ball.
With a rolling pin, roll out the dough to an 8-inch circle. Place a
piece of wax paper on a large dinner plate, and put the circle of
dough on it. Roll out the remaining dough, stacking the circles on
the plate with wax paper in between.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat the oven to 175 degrees. Heat a nonstick skillet over
medium-high heat. Test the temperature by flicking some droplets of
water onto the surface; if the water sizzles and evaporates
quickly, the griddle is ready. Place a circle of dough in the
skillet. Cook 30 seconds, or until the dough begins to stiffen and
turns golden brown. Flip the piadina, and brown the other side.
Place the piadina on a piece of foil in the oven, and keep warm
until serving.

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Hillary Rodham Clinton, it seems, is standing by her
man after all.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Wynette redux. Cookie-baking optional.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sex scandal that crippled the presidency and
devastated the Clinton marriage, Hillary appears to remain a loyal
_ if icy _ spouse. Bet that farm in Arkansas that when Bill Clinton
leaves the White House at the end of his term in 2000, he'll be
leaving with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   What happens after that is not such a sure thing, says
journalist Gail Sheehy, who has been following the Clinton union
since the campaign of 1992. Could Hillary split once they leave the
White House?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, and I don't think she knows,'' Sheehy said.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has not accepted the scandal docilely. She has flicked
her anger at her wayward husband. Buddy is not the only resident of
the presidential dog house.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's putting him through the wringer, and every woman
applauds that,'' Sheehy said by phone from her office in Berkeley,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy is one of the nation's foremost magazine writers and
author of such seminal books as ``Passages'' (1976) and ``The
Silent Passage: Menopause'' (1992).
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy wrote a comprehensive deconstruction of the Clinton
marriage, ``Hillary's Choice,'' in the January issue of ``Vanity
Fair.'' Over a five-month period of exhaustive interviews, she
gleaned the details of the rocky union from Clinton friends and
colleagues bold enough to share their insights.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary herself declined to be interviewed, Sheehy said,
although White House advisers tried to persuade her to open up.
</P>
<P>
   Scandal has taken its toll on the first lady, Sheehy said,
leaving her in no mood to bare her soul to a reporter. The
spontaneity is gone. Her smile is fixed and enigmatic. Prying eyes
are kept at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always been a woman with a secret,'' Sheehy said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Monica Lewinsky affair, the secret of her husband's
infamous dalliances was blown wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very deeply painful for her,'' Sheehy adds.
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime journalist and bestselling author, Sheehy knows
well of the intrusions into a celebrity's life.
</P>
<P>
   She was born Gail Henion in 1937 in Mamaroneck, N.Y. Her father
was an advertising executive, her mother a beauty
consultant-turned-homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   After marrying Albert F. Sheehy in 1960, two years after
graduating from the University of Vermont, she parlayed a stint as
a fashion consultant into a job as fashion writer for the
``Democrat and Chronicle'' in Rochester, N.Y. She came to
prominence as a tough-minded reporter while working at the ``New
York Herald Tribune'' and then as a contributing editor of ``New
York'' magazine in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Felker, ``New York'' editor and founder, became her mentor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, she published a series of explosive articles in ``New
York'' on prostitution. In one, she created a composite of a
prostitute when the woman she wanted to interview refused to talk.
Without Sheehy's knowledge, Felker deleted Sheehy's explanation
that this was a composite, believing it intruded on the article's
literary style.
</P>
<P>
   She must have forgiven him. In 1985, divorced from Albert
Sheehy, she married Felker and now divides her time between New
York and Berkeley, where Felker teaches in a magazine journalism
program at the University of California.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers and book lovers know Sheehy best for ``Passages,''
her chronicle of midlife that warned adults what lies ahead as time
marches on. Decade by decade, she spelled out the inevitable
decline when adulthood gains a foothold.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote, ``As such thoughts gather thunder, the continuity of
the life cycle is interrupted. They usher in a decade that can be
called, in the deepest sense, the Deadline Decade. Somewhere
between 35 and 45 if we let ourselves, most of us will have a
full-out authenticity crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Sheehy would pen two books addressing the topic of
second adulthood, approaching maturity with optimism and assurances
that life can begin at any age.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy is also known for her in-depth profiles of such global
personalities as Saddam Hussein, Margaret Thatcher, George Bush and
Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her jam-packed schedule of speaking engagements, a
book about Hillary Clinton is in the works, even as other
journalists, including former ``Washington Post'' reporter Carl
Bernstein, begin penning their own Clintonographies.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy could have the inside track with an insider's knowledge.
Since meeting Hillary six years ago, Sheehy has tended the
relationship, meeting her at least once a year at the annual New
Year's Renaissance Weekend, a gathering of political intelligentsia
on Hilton Head Island, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I know her,'' Sheehy said.
</P>
<P>
   And to know her is to admire her: ``I think Hillary is the most
intriguing political figure on the national stage today.''
</P>
<P>
   However, 1992 was one of the last times Hillary Rodham Clinton
permitted herself to be shadowed, Sheehy said. The beleaguered
first lady has since drawn curtains around herself and her family,
finding no personal advantage in exposing them to dissection.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clintons recently expressed outrage when ``People''
magazine published an in-depth article on the relationship between
Hillary and daughter, Chelsea. Although nothing negative was
revealed in the text, Hillary felt the piece was an intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her instinct is always to be mum,'' Sheehy said. ``She has
always had no tolerance for people knowing about her what she
doesn't want them to know.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that fails to recognize the prominence of her
position, Sheehy said. A private life under public scrutiny is an
oxymoron that won't serve her well if, as rumored, she runs for
office once the Clintons have left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   However, although she has been touted as an attractive candidate
to run for the U.S. Senate from New York, Sheehy doubts Hillary
would tolerate the inevitable revisitation of past scandals that
would come with a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Her post-Washington role is more likely non-political, perhaps
as head of a foundation, Sheehy said, where she could enjoy power
without fear of the smears politics can engender.
</P>
<P>
   In her ``Vanity Fair'' article, Sheehy quotes Clinton friend
Betsey Wright as saying, ``That man would lie down and kill himself
before he would let her leave him. There have been other tempt
ations, but Hillary is the love of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   While avoiding psychobabble and the temptation to analyze the
Clinton marriage from a Freudian or Oedipal perspective, Sheehy
does hint of a relationship forged between a needy man and a take-
charge woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is this damaged child who has never been healed,'' she
says. ``He is this id walking around.''
</P>
<P>
   The damaged child, however, developed superb political skills
the likes of which Sheehy said she has never before seen in her
lifetime _ exceeding even the celebrated charms of Ronald Reagan
and John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In marrying Hillary, Bill Clinton found his perfect complement.
She brought discipline to his emotional political style and a
toughness drawn from her own childhood, when she learned to punch
the noses of children who ill-treated her.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy's article sums up that relationship in one pithy phrase:
``It took a Hillary to raise a president.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clintons are the most scrutinized couple in the
country, Americans know little about the people behind the
headlines and the sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have become stick figures,'' Sheehy said. ``I wanted to
flesh them out, to fill in some of the blanks.''
</P>
<P>
   She determined that Hillary may be a woman wronged, whose
identity has been sorely shaken, but she is no victim and no
martyr.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Sheehy said, ``It is Hillary who is holding our
country together. It is Hillary who is holding our values together
even as her own house is being shattered by their political
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, Sheehy gave Hillary an advance copy of the
``Vanity Fair'' article. The magazine had gone to bed, but out of
courtesy she gave the subject of the piece a preview.
</P>
<P>
   Feedback from the White House was succinct: Hillary ``had no
reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good news for the writer,'' she said. &QL;

SHORT NEWS ITEMS ON FOOD AND DINING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ajvar, Anyone? (Now, That's Balkan)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A food shop named Ljuljhami sounds as if it should be
selling Finnish specialties, or maybe Hawaiian. But the stock in
trade at Ljuljhami (pronounced lool-AH-mee), a tiny, white-tile
market at 4408 30th Avenue, Astoria, N.Y., is Balkan food,
especially items from the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro. It is
owned by Dino Redzic, the maitre d'hotel at the James Beard
Foundation, and his brothers, Hajaro and Ago, and sister, Emira.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the shop is the combination of the names of my
father and grandfather, who had a butcher shop in Plav, in
Montenegro,'' Dino Redzic said. ``We're using family recipes for
some of the things we sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them are several kinds of excellent, lightly smoked
salami-style beef sausages, sweet and hot, and sausages made with a
combination of beef and lamb. There is also smoked, air-dried beef,
called pastrma, which is similar to pastrami. All are $7 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned fresh beef patties and the same meat in a sausage
shape, delicious hot off the grill, are $5 a pound. Since the shop
is only a few blocks from Grand Central Parkway, weekenders could
stop to buy these.
</P>
<P>
   Ljuljhami also sells a condiment called ajvar (pronounced
EYE-var), made from sweet red peppers and garlic, $2.49 for a
10-ounce jar. The delicious hot version goes with the meats but
could double as rouille in a bouillabaisse. Emira Redzic also makes
homemade pickled vegetables, $4 a quart, and the shop sells sour
cherry syrup, $3.99 a liter. It also caters. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shad Season Is Here &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this part of the country, the arrival of shad and shad roe in
the market has always been a better sign of the fading winter than
an entire nest of groundhogs. And shad is now here, from Southern
waters.
</P>
<P>
   The fish, which is related to herring and packed with tiny
bones, is rich and succulent and is usually sold filleted. It is
best cooked under a broiler or on a grill. Prices are on the steep
side, many shopkeepers say, because this is the first shad of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Shad is now at Agata &AMP; Valentina, 1505 First Avenue (79th
Street), $7.95 a pound; Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas
(Ninth Street), $12.99; Citarella, 2135 Broadway (75th Street) and
1313 Third Avenue (75th Street), $7.99; Eli's Manhattan, 1411 Third
Avenue (80th Street), $10.95; the Vinegar Factory, 431 East 91st
Street, $10.95; Fairway, 2127 Broadway (74th Street) and 2328
Twelfth Avenue (132d Street), $8.99; Grace's Marketplace, 1237
Third Avenue (71st Street), $9.99; Leonard's, 1385 Third Avenue
(78th Street), $9.95; Rosedale, 1129 Lexington Avenue (79th
Street), $7.50, and Wild Edibles, 255 Elizabeth Street (Houston
Street), $10.95.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these shops also have shad roe, good to poach and serve
in brown butter.
</P>
<P>
   Shad is also superb with a tart sorrel sauce, a dish that the
French call alose a l'oseille (pronounced ah-LOZE ah loh-ZAY).
Fairway sells delicious fresh sorrel sauce imported from France,
$2.99 for 6 ounces. The sauce is also available in a shelf-stable
package, $2.49 for 7 ounces. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By 8 o'clock one evening last week, a blizzard of
orders were flying into the kitchen at Lespinasse in the St. Regis
and the cooks were ``getting slammed,'' as one of them put it.
Christian Delouvrier, who became the executive chef of the
restaurant last summer, had shed his tall white toque and was in
the thick of it, shoulder to shoulder with the chefs at the fish
station, arranging seared scallops against knots of spinach, then
grabbing an immersion blender to froth a truffle sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Could anyone beyond his staff have picked this compact, slightly
balding cook, who was not saying a word, as the one running the
four-star show? Probably not. Unlike most top chefs these days, his
face is not known to millions from a book jacket, a television show
or a line of products.
</P>
<P>
   He is almost easier to describe by what he is not. He is not, so
far anyway, a globe-trotting businessman like Wolfgang Puck, the
model for so many modern chefs. Nor is he a path-blazing culinary
innovator in the style of Jean-Georges Vongerichten.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Delouvrier is a cook whose entire culinary life is
testament to tradition. He acquired his restaurant skills
methodically and slowly in France, migrated to the United States
and continually honed his art, modernizing it only after
considerable contemplation. He is a taskmaster on the job, but is
self-effacing, almost shy, in public. About the only way to know
what Delouvrier is about is to eat his food.
</P>
<P>
   He has cooked in Manhattan at the three-star level for nearly 20
years, from 1991 until last year at Les Celebrites in the Essex
House, where he has been replaced by Luc Dimnet, and at Maurice in
the Parker-Meridien before it closed. But he is relatively unknown
to most New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be the case much longer. Since arriving at
Lespinasse late last summer, Delouvrier has been causing a stir
with food that has exceeded expectations, and in December the
restaurant received four stars in a review in The New York Times.
He has managed to dig deep into his experience and creative
reserves to scale new heights. In his first two months at
Lespinasse his cooking changed, and in the process, it soared.
</P>
<P>
   Delouvrier, like a director looking at rushes, examined every
frame of his food to see what he could do to bring the flavors more
into focus. It often meant airbrushing out unnecessary details,
like an extra vegetable garnish, or daring to offer an utterly
simple and rustic chunk of burnished suckling pig on a bed of
tender beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took this job I said to myself, `This kitchen is where
I'll have the exposure and a real chance at four stars,'''
Delouvrier recalled. ``It was something I never thought was
impossible, but this is like a renaissance for me.''
</P>
<P>
   At 52, an age when some chefs have retired at the pinnacles of
their careers and others are considering doing so, Delouvrier has
finally reached the top. He has seen to it that on his watch,
Lespinasse would not lose any of the four stars it received in 1994
with the chef Gray Kunz, who left last summer to pursue other
ventures. Delouvrier said he cares mainly about doing his job, and
plans to keep at it for at least 10 years more.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cotter, the hotel's general manager, said that in
seeking a replacement for Kunz, ``we looked for somebody with the
potential to be great.'' He said Kunz had recommended hiring
Delouvrier, ``but we did see a little bit of a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunz was known for inspired, often flashy Asian touches and
exotic seasonings. Delouvrier brings to the table the quiet comfort
of a refined French palate and a sure technical hand. He does not
prowl the markets in Chinatown in his free time, as Kunz did. He is
happy to spend his days off at home, in Harrington Park, N.J.,
sitting down to a pot-au-feu or a good roast chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, Christian's food and his approach to
cooking are more in keeping with the decor, the Beaux-Arts style of
Lespinasse,'' Cotter said.
</P>
<P>
   Delouvrier, a soft-spoken man who whips around the kitchen in a
quick, Chaplinesque gait, spreads the credit around. He says his
accomplishment would not have been possible without the
professionalism of the dining room staff, the depth of the wine
cellar, the support of the hotel management and the high-quality
atmosphere at the St. Regis. Also, being in a restaurant that
serves lunch and dinner (Les Celebrites does not serve lunch) keeps
him closer to the kitchen all day long.
</P>
<P>
   He is even making some changes in Kunz's lavish kitchen, which
the hotel spent more than $1 million renovating. He has added a
rotisserie, and wants to install a Spanish plancha griddle and more
convection ovens to vary the searing and roasting.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Annis, the 32-year-old executive sous-chef, who was also
Delouvrier's second in command at Les Celebrites, recognizes a
change in the chef's cooking. ``It's deeper, slower, more
intense,'' he said. ``It looks simple, but the flavors are rich and
true.''
</P>
<P>
   You know what you are eating with his food. The tastes are
familiar but passionately focused. In a satisfying salad, the
earthy flavor of cepes enriches the warm sweetbreads in natural
juices perfumed with a tantalizing whiff of hazelnut oil. Poached
free-range hen stuffed with foie gras, carrots, leeks and black
truffles is at once succulent and light. The rosy braised veal is
played off against bittersweet caramelized endives. Escoffier-style
dishes _ hare stewed in red wine, for example, or tender shredded
beef cheeks in a lustrous wine sauce capped with mashed potatoes
and black truffle _ are his stock in trade.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find the brilliant dazzle of fish splashed with
kalamansi, an Asian citrus fruit, or stir-fried pea shoots a la
Kunz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could relate to Gray because of my Asian heritage,'' said
Craig Kokutsu, who has been at Lespinasse for four years and is now
the expediter, barking out the orders as they flood in and adding
finishing touches, like drizzles of sauce from a squeeze bottle or
slices of truffle. ``I haven't done a lot of classical French
cooking, so for me it's now back to basics.''

 NEW YORK: to basics.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Nase, the sommelier, said that Kunz's spices and
sweet-and-sour flavors made for some tricky wine matches, but
``Christian's food makes me look good.''
</P>
<P>
   And Chris Broberg, the pastry chef, who worked with Kunz for
three years, said that Delouvrier has given him more freedom, and
that the challenge now is to simplify. ``With Gray there was more
layering of flavors,'' he said. ``But I believe desserts should
follow the food.'' Gone are the fruit soups splashed with passion
fruit or scented with lemon grass. Caramel reigns.
</P>
<P>
   Like many accomplished chefs, Delouvrier has vivid memories of
the aromas and flavors of the food of his childhood, especially in
his grandmother's kitchen. He grew up in Boulogne-sur-Gesse, near
Toulouse in Gascony, the region in southwest France that is devoted
to foie gras and duck confit. His father was in the lumber business
but his paternal grandfather had a cafe in Montpellier. By the time
he was 12 he had developed a passion for cooking. Twelve seems to
be the age at which budding chefs in France see the light. He
entered hotel school in Toulouse when he was 14.
</P>
<P>
   His says that his goal, both in school and in the restaurant
kitchens where he began working while still a teen-ager, was ``to
be a good technician, to follow the rules.'' Slowly he rose,
becoming a chef-saucier at the Cafe de la Paix in Paris, later
working at some restaurants in the provinces and eventually moving
to Montreal, to be a chef at Le St.-Amable, a well-known
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the United States in 1971, after overhearing that the
Swiss Hutte, an inn in Hillsdale, N.Y., was looking for a chef.
Except for a brief but significant interlude, he has worked here
ever since. It was in Hillsdale that he met and married Mary Dunn,
who now teaches eighth-grade social studies in Tenafly, N.J. They
have two children, Christine, 14, and Marc, 17. Delouvrier said it
takes him 42 minutes to drive home to Harrington Park at about
midnight, when he leaves the restaurant _ ``maybe 44.''
</P>
<P>
   His first job in Manhattan was in 1973 at the Chateau Richelieu
in midtown. He then became the executive sous-chef when Windows on
the World opened in 1976. He was the chef at La Folie, a slightly
bizarre combination of disco and haute cuisine on the Upper East
Side, before returning to France in 1978 for the chance to work
with Alain Senderens at L'Archestrate in Paris. ``Senderens is a
genius and a more spontaneous cook than I could ever be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Senderens, whose Paris restaurant, Lucas Carton, holds
three Michelin stars, became the consultant to the new Maurice in
1981, he brought Delouvrier back to New York to be the executive
chef, knowing that he could faithfully execute Senderens recipes
without going off on wild detours. Those were the days of lobster
with vanilla sauce and the thinnest, most gigantic tuiles New York
had ever seen. Delouvrier stayed until 1989, eventually moving on
to Les Celebrites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Les Celebrites was a challenge, and I was motivated to do new
things,'' he said. ``But after a while it started to become
routine. And I began to wonder whether trying to be a superb
technician was a mistake. And then you think of Joel Robuchon. Was
there ever a better technician?''
</P>
<P>
   A trip to France about a year ago revealed food that seemed
younger, lighter and more up to date. ``As a chef, you know what
you do, and sometimes the idea of changing is not in your mind,''
he said. ``But that's unthinkable today.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, Delouvrier said, Kunz called him to discuss the
job at Lespinasse. It was all the inspiration he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Or nearly all. One senses a certain tension in Delouvrier. How
far can he _ or should he _ relax his devotion to the classics and
to technical finesse? How much can he experiment, and yet not
compromise his style?
</P>
<P>
   Delouvrier said he relies on Annis to add touches of youthful
modernity to his food, like placing a salad of venison carpaccio
alongside the roasted loin and chops. Annis' touch of cumin in a
lobster salad was welcomed. ``Neil will be one of the great
chefs,'' Delouvrier said.
</P>
<P>
   On that evening last week when the fish orders kept coming,
Annis implored the waiters to try to sell more meat and poultry
dishes. ``The fish station is stressed out,'' he bellowed.
</P>
<P>
   Delouvrier plans to increase the selection of seafood dishes on
the spring menu. ``I'm more comfortable cooking meat, but I have to
do more with fish,'' he said. ``The important thing is that you
never stop learning'' _ even at 52, when you feel the thrill of an
athlete who has finally won.

   PHEASANT WITH CHARTREUSE OF CABBAGE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Christian Delouvrier
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 1/2 hours
</P>
<P>
   1 pheasant, about 2 pounds, preferably female
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 quarts well-seasoned chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   4 large leaves savoy cabbage
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-size white turnip, peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, plus 2 sprigs for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Season pheasant inside and out
with salt and pepper. Place on a rack in a small roasting pan, and
roast 15 minutes; pheasant will not be fully cooked. Remove from
oven, and set aside. Reserve any fat from pan. Reduce oven setting
to 300 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bring broth to a simmer, and add cabbage, carrot and turnip.
Remove cabbage leaves after about 3 minutes, and cook carrot and
turnip 10 minutes longer, until al dente. Leave broth on burner
with heat off.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove end of heavy core from cabbage leaves. Quarter carrot
lengthwise, then slice 1/4 inch thick. Cut turnip into 1/4-inch
dice. Combine carrot and turnip in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cut pheasant breasts from the bone, and remove skin. Set
aside. Remove legs and thighs, and set aside. Remove skin from
remainder of carcass. Break carcass in a few pieces, place in broth
over low heat and simmer about 30 minutes, until the meat clinging
to it is fully cooked. Remove carcass from broth. Strain broth
through a very fine strainer lined with cheesecloth or a coffee
filter into a clean saucepan, and season to taste with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   5. Cut all meat off pheasant carcass, and dice it. Heat reserved
pheasant fat in nonstick skillet; add diced pheasant, carrots and
turnips, and saute briefly. Add thyme, moisten with a few
tablespoons broth and season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide
this mixture between two cabbage leaves, and bring up the sides to
make a bundle. Place each bundle, seam side down, on another
cabbage leaf, and wrap tightly. Place the two bundles, seam side
down, in a small baking dish, and place in oven to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   6. Reheat skillet, add pheasant legs and sear over high heat
about 5 minutes. Turn them, add breast meat and continue to sear,
turning breast once, until pheasant is browned on the outside but
still very pink and slightly undercooked. Remove from pan, and
season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   7. Bring broth to a simmer.
</P>
<P>
   8. Place each cabbage bundle in the center of a large, shallow
soup plate. Cut each piece of pheasant breast in half, and separate
legs and thighs. Place 2 breast pieces, a leg and a thigh around
cabbage bundle, and pour hot broth over it; this will finish
cooking the pheasant. Garnish with a sprig of thyme, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 servings.

   4 slices fresh duck foie gras, 1 1/2 to 2 ounces each.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut a thin slice from each side of potato the long way so it
lies flat. Slice potato lengthwise into four slabs of equal width.
</P>
<P>
   3. Heat duck fat in a heavy saucepan that will hold the potatoes
in a single layer. Place potato slices in pan and cook over medium
heat about a minute on each side. Pour off and reserve excess fat.
Add 1/2 tablespoon butter and 1/4 cup veal stock to saucepan,
season potatoes with salt and pepper, cover pan and braise potatoes
until tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from pan and place on a
baking sheet in oven.
</P>
<P>
   4. Return duck fat to saucepan; add endives cut side down and
cook over moderate heat about a minute. Turn endives, season to
taste with salt and pepper, add remaining butter and saute, turning
once, until they are tender and well caramelized. Remove from pan
and place on baking sheet with potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   5. Add vinegar to saucepan and stir to dissolve caramelized bits
clinging to the bottom. Stir in remaining veal stock and cook over
high heat about 5 minutes, until sauce is syrupy and reduced to
about 1/2 cup. Check seasonings. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   6. Heat a nonstick skillet until very hot. Season foie gras with
salt and pepper on each side; place in pan and sear about a minute
on each side, until browned but rare in the middle. Drain on paper
towels.
</P>
<P>
   7. To serve, place a slice of potato on each of four warm
medium-size plates; top each with an endive half and then with a
slice of foie gras. Briefly reheat sauce and drizzle a little
around the plate and on top of foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

TV NOTES: MIKE WALLACE, DRUG-TEST REPORT, `STORM OF THE CENTURY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Wallace in Double Time
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Walters gets Monica Lewinsky; Diane Sawyer gets Kenneth
Starr; Jamie Gangel on NBC's ``Today'' show gets Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Who at CBS is still out there getting the big interviews? How
about Mike Wallace, 80 years old and still chasing down stories now
not just for one weekly news magazine program but for two.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is in London this week, where he interviewed Louise
Woodward, the nanny at the center of one of the most closely
followed murder trials in both the United States and Britain. The
piece will appear on ``60 Minutes'' later this season, he said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   All he would say about the interview with Ms. Woodward was:
``There is evidence that that which she was convicted of she did
not do. I shouldn't say any more than that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Ms. Woodward was convicted of manslaughter in
the death of a Massachusetts infant left in her care.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, the lead correspondent for ``60 Minutes'' since its
inception in 1968, has become almost as ubiquitous a presence on
``60 Minutes II,'' the spinoff introduced by CBS in January. The
program appears for a sixth time Thursday night and Wallace will be
back with his third update of a piece he previously reported for
``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   This time it is a new look at Bruce Cutler, a former lawyer for
convicted New York mob boss John Gotti. The occasion for the
revisit: Cutler now represents Gotti's son, John A. Gotti, in his
fight to stay out of federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   After Cutler managed to get the elder Gotti acquitted in three
trials, the government separated him from Gotti in its last case
against him. ``He was suspended from practicing in Brooklyn,''
Wallace said. ``He was off in Chicago and Kansas City and other
places. The piece is, in effect, how the mighty have fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler didn't exactly agree with that premise, Wallace said,
pointing out that Cutler had argued that he had been doing
important things in Detroit. ``I told him that just wasn't the
same. We show a lot of the old stuff with him, declaiming in the
courtroom, quoting Shakespeare. He's such a performer. I must say I
like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace also said he now likes the entire concept of ``60
Minutes II,'' which he ardently opposed when it was first
suggested. The turning point, he said, came when the show named
Jeff Fager, once a news executive on the original ``60 Minutes,''
to be the executive producer of ``60 Minutes II.''
</P>
<P>
   That persuaded the entire correspondent staff of ``60 Minutes''
as well as its founding father, Don Hewitt, to sign on to the plan
to update classic reports from the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have been doing it on our own broadcast,'' Wallace
said. ``There are thousands of stories we did where people want to
know what happened to the individuals involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace acknowledged that he has more than enough material of
his own to update. ``I've done 25 stories a year for 30 years.
There's more than enough there to go back and look at again.''

   Bad Hair Days
</P>
<P>
   A report on ``The CBS Morning News'' this week finds a
disturbing increase in the use of hair tests to screen job
candidates for past drug use _ disturbing because many experts say
the tests are unreliable and possibly racially biased.
</P>
<P>
   The tests can detect drug use over a longer time period than
urine tests (which typically detect back only three days), but they
may also register false positives, even from exposure to drug
particles in the environment. And, as Roberta Baskin shows in the
conclusion to her three-part series Wednesday, different labs came
up with widely different results on samples from identical heads of
hair and with different results on hairs of darker or lighter color
but exposed to the same level of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's promising technology when used with other kinds of tests,
for forensic purposes,'' she said. ``But used by itself to decide
if someone gets or doesn't get a job, or custody of a child, for
example, it could be very unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baskin's report might strike many viewers as something they
would be more likely to see on the ``CBS Evening News,'' or a
prime-time news magazine. But Al Berman, the executive producer of
the ``Morning News,'' wants stories like these to distinguish his
show from the other breakfast shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate to have an investigative team dedicated to
this broadcast,'' Berman said. Ms. Baskin has won many
investigative-reporting awards, including two prestigious Alfred I.
Dupont-Columbia University silver batons, one of them for revealing
serious flaws in the National Football League's drug testing
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998 Winter Olympics, Ms. Baskin got into trouble
with Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News, when, in a letter to
him that was leaked to the press, she protested some CBS reporters'
wearing parkas with a Nike logo and she accused the network of
killing a report she had done on Nike.
</P>
<P>
   In unusually angry terms, Heyward denounced Ms. Baskin for her
letter, which she said she had not leaked. Her on-air appearances
dwindled; last July she joined ``The CBS Morning News.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she had wanted to work there, she said, ``I like to
tell good stories wherever I can tell them,'' and would not comment
on her relationship with Heyward or whether it had influenced her
move.
</P>
<P>
   She did object to the notion that morning programs only do
gentler, consumer-oriented reporting. ``I hate labels,'' she said.
``I'm interested in stories that affect a lot of people, and I like
breaking stories that people haven't heard about yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman has offered her series on hair drug-testing to ``CBS
Evening News'' but has not heard yet whether it will run there as
well.

   `Storm' Subsides
</P>
<P>
   It's far from the disappointment of the century, but the latest
ABC Stephen King mini-series certainly qualifies as the
disappointment of the month.
</P>
<P>
   After two parts, King's ``Storm of the Century'' has delivered
ratings that would look good under most circumstances, but not
after a promotional blizzard that had buried the nation since
September.
</P>
<P>
   ABC got winning results both Sunday and Monday night from the
series with the audience of 18-to-49-year-old viewers it covets
most, but the numbers were lower than any previous King novel
translated for television.
</P>
<P>
   And talk about scary endings: Part 3 is scheduled for Thursday
night, up against the episode of NBC's ``ER'' in which George
Clooney says goodbye to the show.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hyams, ABC's vice president of research, said, ``We expect
there will be high VCR usage Thursday night.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC clearly expected better things from ``Storm of the
Century.'' After weeks of frequent clips from the show, the
network's entire promotion this month was highlighted by the
omnipresent tag line: ``ABC is taking February by storm.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC even caused a flap last week when it ran a crawl (a written
message along the bottom of the screen) during its Wednesday night
comedies that began: ``ABC storm alert.''
</P>
<P>
   The message distressed some stations and emergency services.
More distressed were the producers of ``Dharma and Greg'' and ``The
Drew Carey Show,'' who had not known that their episodes would
include promotional distractions.
</P>
<P>
   For all of that, ABC surely had expected to draw better ratings
than it did two years ago with a remake of King's ``Shining,'' a
version that most critics did not deem successful. In contrast,
most critics praised ``Storm of the Century''
</P>
<P>
   Even NBC was concerned about how well ``Storm'' might do. Lindy
DeKoven, the head of NBC's movie division, said she was gratified
that NBC's mini-series ``The '60s'' was the highest-rated movie of
the season, but added, ``At least until that little storm arrives
on ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyams said, ``We thought the same thing.'' And why did this
``Storm'' pack less punch than expected? ``Who knows?'' Hyams said.

   JOURNAL-RUSSIA _ ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Not tonight honey,
they're showing ``Planet of the Apes.'' Zookeepers in St.
Petersburg have learned the hard way about the power of television.
Hoping TV would show orangutans Monika and Rabuhow to be good
parents, zoo officials rigged up a set outside their cage to show
them videos on proper childrearing. But Rabu, the male orangutan,
became so captivated with TV that he has been ignoring his mate,
who was upset over being neglected. The TV must go, but zookeepers
now fret that the pair is so addicted, their incapacity for passion
may only deepen with video withdrawal. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   HONDURAS _ To bring relief to some of the most remote and
hurricane-ravaged areas of Honduras, Westley Wiles of Missionair
has been flying his 1966 Cessna on a wing and a prayer, often
landing in cow pastures full of ruts and on dangerous gravel
runways. As a result, his plane, and especially his propeller, has
taken a beating. Having heard of his plight in a recent DDN story
about local relief efforts in Honduras, the McCauley airplane parts

Necropsies of three dead dogs, including Chances Are from West Palm
Beach, showed the dogs had severe internal bleeding. One of the
dead dogs had bacterial pneumonia associated with `e. coli' as a

impeachment year might generate a big turnover in the next
congressional elections is being discounted both by Republican
strategists, who have reason to hope it won't be so, and Democrats,
who want to hedge their bets. All these predictions have the
classic earmarks of capital self-denial. Within the Beltway it is
hard to see this or admit it, but the most obvious impact of the
impeachment year is the profound toll it has taken on the prestige

By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ John Greenewald Jr. can often be found in his
Northridge home tinkering with his Web site that challenges the
U.S. government to tell the truth about aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The feds are crafty, though. They've learned that Greenewald
won't start badgering them until around 3 p.m. each day. That's
when the 17-year-old gets home from Alemany High School in Mission
Hills, where he's a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Greenewald is part of a two-hour special based on Whitley
Strieber's best seller, ``Confirmation: The Hard Evidence of Aliens
Among Us?'' airing at 8 tonight on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen unusual things in the sky,'' Greenewald
admits. ``I'm driven by curiosity. I have a lot of fun writing
letters to the government. It's fun to think the CIA is working for
me. It's a great hobby, and I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV special, hosted by Robert Davi (FBI Agent Bailey on NBC's
``The Profiler''), examines evidence that the Earth has been
visited by UFOs and alien beings. Included is footage of an alleged
alien implant being removed on camera.
</P>
<P>
   Greenewald began writing the government citing the Freedom of
Information Act in summer 1996 just to see what they would give up
on the issue of aliens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the initial document I asked for, which was five pages
long,'' Greenewald explains. ``Then I wondered just how much was
available at other agencies. Those five pages have turned into more
than 7,000 pages. I've discovered there's definitely something the
government is hiding. What it is, you can't be sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the documents I've received are blacked out due to
national security. What's under the black ink, we can't be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenewald posts his finding on his Web site
(www.blackvault.com), which gets more than 30,000 inquiries per
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just continue my letters and requests,'' the teen said.
``I'm sure I cause a lot of work for the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenewald says his parents think his extracurricular interest
is ``really neat. They're happy I'm focused on something. My sister
doesn't know how to view it. She's a skeptic, and it's always fun
to make her think.''
</P>
<P>
   The local teen, who plans to attend California State University,
Northridge, in the fall, came to the attention of the producers of
TV's ``Confirmation: The Hard Evidence of Aliens Among Us?'' when
an article was published about the boy in a Baltimore newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``They e-mailed me asking if I was interested in being
interviewed for the show,'' Greenewald said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenewald says his Web site doesn't detract from his school
work, and his grades have always been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the work is done on my free time,'' he said. ``A lot
of the kids at school have no idea what I've done. But those who do
know think it's great.''

A JUROR'S-EYE VIEW AT THE SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have to fight the urge to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   As a juror for the dramatic category at the 1999 Sundance Film
Festival, reading dispatches about the festival that were being fed
to the rest of the world, I found myself constantly amused and
bewildered. A report in the New Yorker alluded to Sundance founder
Robert Redford making himself scarce in response to the commercial
air that now surrounds the festival.
</P>
<P>
   But you couldn't miss him in the festival's ski-town base, Park
City, Utah: There he was, tapping his toes at a Lyle Lovett
concert; here he is, leading a camera crew down Main Street.
Perhaps my definition of keeping a low profile differs from that of
the New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Redford made a stirring, extemporaneous speech about the nature
of the festival at a luncheon honoring its filmmakers. He despaired
of the buzz that starts trailing the films at the festival, noting
that such crackle hardly guarantees box-office success. A little of
the weight of his speech was mitigated by the phalanx of
photographers blasting away at him, shooting Redford as if he'd
just got back from a 30-year stint on ``Gilligan's Island.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove his point, the comedy ``Happy, Texas'' _ which
became the object of a bidding war among the distributors _ had
become the hottest ticket of the festival even before its first
screening. (Miramax won the battle, laying down the largest
Sundance purchase price ever, $10.5 million, which bested the $10
million spent for ``Spitfire Grill.'')
</P>
<P>
   People who couldn't get into ``Happy'' were already going on
about it being the contender for the jury prize. (The rule of thumb
was that people who acted as if they were the most in-the-know
hadn't seen the pictures they were talking about.) However,
``Happy,'' which stars Steve Zahn and Jeremy Northam as a pair of
escaped convicts masquerading as beauty-contest coordinators in a
small Texas town, won neither that nor the audience prize. (Zahn
did receive a jury award for his performance.)
</P>
<P>
   The audience winner was ``Three Seasons,'' a gorgeously
photographed reverie set in Vietnam that featured Harvey Keitel,
whose participation helped to get it made. (One joke going around
was that Keitel should've gotten an award for keeping his clothes
on.) ``Seasons,'' which reduced audiences to tears and got standing
ovations each time it screened, also won the jury award, repeating
the feat that ``Smoke Signals'' pulled off last year. (''Seasons''
also copped the cinematography prize.)
</P>
<P>
   The hardest-working woman at Sundance was the talented Canadian
actress Sarah Polley, who appeared in two films. She starred in
``Guinevere,'' a seriocomic tale of a young woman involved with a
bohemian photographer (Stephen Rea) 30 years her senior, which won
the dramatic screenplay award. Polley also appears in ``Go,'' the
second feature from ``Swingers'' director Doug Liman. ``Go'' _ a
combination of ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``After Hours'' as conceived
for the WB _ was a hot ticket because it co-stars ``Dawson's
Creek's'' Katie Holmes. Disconcertingly, it was a Columbia release,
like another noncompetitive big-budget feature, ``Thick as
Thieves,'' starring Alec Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   The other hottest noncompetition ticket was ``The Blair Witch
Project.'' One of the first psychological thrillers to be accepted
at Sundance, it featured neither big names nor professional
production values. This low-budget suspense film, much of which was
shot on high-definition video, followed three college students
whose video project _ debunking a horror legend in a remote forest
_ led to chilling results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair'' was mostly a fun and effective scare whose lack of
resources and insularity was reminiscent of the original ``Night of
the Living Dead.'' But audiences were so exhilarated over its
difference from many other Sundance films that they rhapsodized
over its ``originality.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Sundance prize winners, the funny and provocative animated
short ``More'' and the documentary ``Regret to Inform,'' received
Oscar nominations this week. Unfortunately, the marketplace has
clearly become the predominant motif at Sundance. Several of the
pictures in the dramatic competition _ ``Seasons,'' ``Guinevere,''
``The Adventures of Sebastian Cole'' _ already had distribution
deals when they arrived at the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly enough, neither the black-and-white comedy ``Judy
Berlin,'' which won the best director prize, nor ``Joe the King,''
a film written and directed by actor Frank Whaley that tied for the
best screenwriting prize, had distribution deals before they
entered the festival.
</P>
<P>
   The cliche that Sundance is America's Cannes, like all cliches,
has a chewy truth at its center. The boldness and invention that
most of us still, in our idealism, attach to the world of
independent film has long been supplanted by stars, production
values and stories that would feel just as comfortable on screen in
the mainstream cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Redford's impassioned remarks about the insidious and
less-than-subtle pressures of the marketplace made more and more
sense as we made our way through the 16 movies in this year's
dramatic competition.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors on my panel made a pact that we wouldn't discuss our
deliberations after the awards had been announced. Despite some
disagreements, the discussions were conducted with civility, and we
all ended up on speaking terms after we'd cast our votes.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the competitors, though polished and competent in
storytelling, probably left a hunger in all of us to see some rules
broken, to be shaken up and challenged by movies with a true
independent spirit. The films seemed to be divided between movies
featuring well-known actors and coming-of-age stories about young
people on the verge of discovering their sexual identity. That is,
when they didn't feature both elements.
</P>
<P>
   We longed for some anarchy and risk-taking, which was perhaps
the reason ``Treasure Island,'' a dense and unusual film directed
by Scott King, garnered a special Jury Award for Distinctive
Vision. It is flawed, but there was nothing else like it in the
competition. Perhaps it can serve as a model for next year's
Sundance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with all of these attendant problems, and the big-deal
parties, and celebrities like Michael Stipe wandering the Park City
streets, Sundance generates a feverish excitement about movies that
ameliorates the LA-on-the-slopes feel.
</P>
<P>
   Running from one theater to the next to catch a foreign film
with no hope of U.S. distribution _ or catching the thunderous
applause for a plucky, ragged documentary like ``Genghis Blues,''
the film on Tuvan throat singers _ I got high on more than just
oxygen deprivation from the high altitude. And as a member of the
jury, I got to hear the three words I've longed for all my life and
may never hear again: ``Your car's waiting.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moderate to heavy rains will develop Wednesday across the
eastern Gulf States as a developing low-pressure system over
Alabama teams with a trailing jet stream disturbance to lift
increasingly humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. Rain will be
accompanied by thunder in some areas, with isolated thunderstorms
approaching severe levels in northwest Florida later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will spread into the Middle Atlantic States Wednesday night
as the low ripples northeastward along a slow-moving cold front. By
Thursday morning, the heaviest rains will have fallen from Georgia
to eastern Virginia, with rainfalls of one inch or more possible in
some areas. Moderate rains associated with this system will reach
southeast Pennsylvania, New Jersey and southeast New York by
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Broken areas of generally light snow will develop across upstate
New York and northwest New England associated with a cold front
extending southward from a low-pressure system in Ontario. In the
wake of the low, scattered snow showers and flurries will dust
parts of the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, moderate to heavy snows will fall atop the peaks of
the northern and central Rockies as a conveyor of moisture flowing
eastward from the Pacific is forced to rise over the sloping
terrain. Rain and mountain snow will continue to affect parts of
western Washington, western Oregon and northwest California as
moist onshore winds persist. But these winds will gradually weaken,
keeping precipitation generally light to moderate in most places.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Rocking the Boat
</P>
<P>
   A rare February surf rocked boats anchored along south-facing
shores of Hawaii Tuesday. In winter, high surf is usually
restricted to north-facing shores, where large waves generated by
intense storms over the north Pacific Ocean finally break after
dispersing thousands of miles over open seas. About a week ago, an
unusually intense summer storm southeast of New Zealand (in the
southern hemisphere) generated ocean swells that spread north
across the equator and headed toward Hawaii. Waves as high as seven
feet arrived Tuesday on the Waikiki Beach, replacing the typically
tame February surf.

FEW VISIT THE NATION'S GREATEST LOOKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. _ America's greatest lookout,
normally crowded beyond comprehension, can now be visited with only
a few souls within miles.
</P>
<P>
   It is Glacier Point, where the scope of view is unparalleled,
looking down at Half Dome and silver-tasseled Nevada and Vernal
Falls on one side, and the entire 2,425 feet of Yosemite Falls on
the other and the north rim of Yosemite Valley, with a panorama
beyond of miles of wilderness peaks topped by remote peaks, with
Matterhorn (12,264 feet) and Cathedral (10,940 feet) among the
prominent.
</P>
<P>
   Half Dome looks like a giant iceberg, and the entire landscape
is jeweled in white, with ice crystals sparkling in the sunlight
like tiny diamonds. Out near Washburn Point, scanning up the Merced
Canyon, it is so quiet that it is eerie, where the only sounds are
those of your thoughts, and each breath speaks with a thousand
voices over he awesome magnitude of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   There's a catch, of course: You can't drive here.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what makes it so special for the handful of
explorers willing to go the extra mile to capture this
extraordinary experience.
</P>
<P>
   There are only two ways to get here, cross-country skiing or
snow-shoeing, a 10-mile trip with an overnight snow camp at the new
lodge, complete with indoor plumbing. To facilitate people with the
required zest for this trip, and also to keep it safe, a guided
overnight trip with meals and a bed rack in a small lodge (a store
converted for winter) is available for $110 per person.
</P>
<P>
   The trip starts at the Badger Pass Ski Area and then roughly
follows the snow-covered Glacier Point Road out to Glacier Point.
The route is mostly flat, though there are a few small hills, then
climbs a bit at Seminole Dome, with one switch-backed drop at the
end of the trip down to Glacier Point.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is so pristine and quiet, that it can be difficult to
believe that this is the same place that gets thousands of visitors
each summer day.
</P>
<P>
   For a brochure, phone the Yosemite cross-country ski school at
209-372-8444 and leave your name and address at the tone; for ski
and park information during winter, phone 209-372-1000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Del Valle Reservoir, and its beautiful park and boating facility
south of Livermore, has become another testimonial to the paradox
of different parts of government spending your tax dollars to work
at cross purposes. On one hand, the California Department of
Boating and Waterways just provided more than $1 million to improve
the boat launching facility at Del Valle Reservoir and the work is
now under way.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Zone 7 Water Agency is in the planning
stages to sell the water from Del Valle to accommodate growth in
the Livermore-Amador Valley, lowering the lake level by 85 percent
each summer, which would render useless the new boat ramp, picnic
area, swimming area and campground, and turn one of the jewels of
the East Bay Regional Park District into a dust bowl.

`CONFIRMATION: THE HARD EVIDENCE OF ALIENS AMONG US?':

   If it were possible to bring unidentified-flying-object
enthusiasts down to earth, Wednesday night's two-hour treatment of
the popular controversy over visitors from out there might do the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confirmation: The Hard Evidence of Aliens Among Us?'' is so
cluttered with hocus-pocus atmospherics _ faked-up images,
far-fetched re-creations, eerie sounds and a heavy-breathing
narrator, Robert Davi, who shows up periodically out of the smoke
of what seems to be a Transylvanian spooker _ that you have to
suspect the producers don't trust their own evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC Entertainment program, based on a best seller by Whitley
Strieber, who claims to have experienced ``a close encounter'' in
1985 that may have left him with an object implanted in his left
ear lobe, brings together most of the by now familiar assertions of
sightings and kidnappings, some apparently owed to
memory-refreshing or fantasy-inducing hypnosis.
</P>
<P>
   There are also charges of official cover-ups, which continue to
occupy conspiratorialists of the Internet. All are countered by
debunkers, leaving viewers to select or reject the strange tales
and shaky photographs as it suits them.
</P>
<P>
   The strangest tale offered Wednesday night comes from one Jesse
Long, who says he was abducted several times over many years; he
reports being subjected to crossbreeding and claims to have wound
up with quite a brood of extraterrestrial descendants. You can
watch Long going through some sort of trauma under hypnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The best-publicized publicists of the paranormal, including Dr.
John Mack of Harvard University and Budd Hopkins, described as ``a
world-renowned abduction expert,'' are heard from, and so are their
critics. Much is also made of an extended dramatized version of
something peculiar that several Ohio police officers say they saw
in the sky in 1993, which an astronomer dismisses as twinkling
stars.
</P>
<P>
   The one sure thing about Wednesday night's offering is that no
responsibility for it is taken by NBC News.

NORTHERN IRELAND APPROVES POLITICAL REFORMS TO AID CATHOLIC
MINORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The Northern Ireland Assembly on
Tuesday approved sweeping changes in the political structure of
this predominantly Protestant British province. The changes are
designed to give the Roman Catholic minority more power and to end
the sectarian violence that has killed more than 3,200 people in
the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the process is the creation of an Assembly
executive cabinet to carry out the changes. But the continuing
dispute over disarmament of the Irish Republican Army threatens to
delay formation of the cabinet, which is supposed to be completed
by March 10.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of the changes, after two days of acrimonious
debate in Belfast, was hailed by mainstream Protestant and Catholic
leaders as a historic move toward permanent peace. The vote was
77-29, with all the Catholics and about half the Protestants in
favor of the measure and half the Protestants against.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, the mainstream Catholic deputy first minister,
said, ``For the first time since partition, the representatives of
unionism and nationalism have agreed on constitutional issues, on
political issues, on social issues and on economic issues _ for the
first time in 80 years.'' He was referring to the agreement under
which southern Ireland became independent, leaving the North a
British province.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic nationalists, or republicans, seek closer ties with
the rest of Ireland, while the Protestant unionists seek to
maintain ties with Britain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The vote was also seen as a victory for First Minister David
Trimble, who held his party, the Ulster Unionists, together in
favor of the changes despite attacks and defections by hard-line
Protestant Assembly members.
</P>
<P>
   The changes would also give the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish
Republic more influence in the North's affairs and pave the way for
the restoration of home rule powers by the British government in
London. Britain has ruled here directly since 1974, with local
councils controlling only burials and garbage removal.
</P>
<P>
   But the final enactment of the changes was still threatened by
the bitter dispute over the disarmament of the IRA, which has
observed a cease-fire for 19 months but refuses to surrender a
single bullet or pound of Semtex explosive from its estimated 100
tons of weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants contend that Sinn Fein, the IRA political wing, must
not be included in the cabinet until the IRA starts to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   But a kind of IRA disarmament was shown Tuesday night on
television along with the political news. There were pictures of an
arms cache discovered in the Catholic part of West Belfast. Police
said the arms _ an automatic rifle, several pipe bombs, coffee-jar
bombs, fuses and hundreds of bullets _ belonged to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials and experts said the timing of the disclosure was
significant, giving the public impression that even though the IRA
is refusing to disarm, some of its weapons are going out of action.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams missed the vote in Belfast to visit
British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London. He said later that
there had been a ``good discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the debate Monday, hard-line Protestants hooted when Adams
made his opening remarks in Gaelic, a language few in the Assembly
chamber understand.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestants considered his choice of Gaelic to be a
taunting reminder that Adams represents Catholics dedicated to
Irish, rather than British, culture. During the voting Tuesday,
Sinn Fein members said ``ta'' and ``nil,'' the Gaelic terms for yes
and no.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line Protestant unionist Peter Robinson contended in
Monday's debate that Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness
was an active member of the IRA military command. McGuinness, who
has often denied this, then held up what he said was a fragment of
a grenade thrown at Catholics by a Protestant in his home city of
Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
   A former Protestant paramilitary leader, David Ervine, who was
imprisoned in a British jail as a terrorist and is now leader of
the Progressive Unionist Party, objected to the vilification of
Sinn Fein, normally his sworn enemy. He said that many of the
Protestant leaders in the Assembly had met with him frequently, at
his home, during the guerrilla war, when Ervine was a leader of the
Ulster Volunteer Force.
</P>
<P>
   The debate continued Tuesday, with hard-line Protestants
attacking Sinn Fein, contending that it is a front for IRA
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hutchinson, also a Progressive Unionist and a former
Protestant paramilitary who served time for his involvement in a
sectarian killing, chilled many in the Assembly. He said his party
supported the changes, but that ``If Sinn Fein and the IRA start
supporting killing again in Northern Ireland, I know where I'll
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, the Protestant first minister of the Assembly, supports
the position that until disarmament actually begins, Sinn Fein
should not be allowed to participate in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Without Sinn Fein representing the IRA in the new structures,
their work would be futile, and the situation could lead to a
resumption of paramilitary violence by the IRA and by smaller
Protestant guerrilla groups. Some of the Protestant groups have
threatened attacks in Ireland if the peace effort fails.
</P>
<P>
   Adams notes, accurately, that the peace agreement approved last
year does not require disarmament before May 2000 and contends that
the sustained cease-fire reflects the IRA's support of the peace
effort. Trimble says that this is not enough _ that the Protestant
majority needs assurance in the form of a surrender of arms.
</P>
<P>
   Some mainstream Catholic leaders are straddling the issue. They
affirm the need for disarmament now, but acknowledge that it is not
actually required by the peace agreement approved by leaders last
spring and overwhelmingly confirmed in June in referendums in the
North and the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that Trimble and Adams will have to blink soon,
approving a solution to the disarmament dispute that both can
describe as a victory. One possibility, they say, would be a
statement by the chairman of the disarmament commission, John de
Chastelain, a former Canadian general. But no one has proposed
exactly what de Chastelain could say to finesse the problem and end
the growing sense of crisis in the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measures approved Tuesday, Northern Ireland is to have
10 government departments to deal with most matters, excluding
security and taxation, and a North-South Ministerial Council of six
units comprising officials from the North and from the Irish
Republic to cooperate in areas that include the economy, tourism
and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant hard-liners, like the Rev. Ian Paisley, see this
cooperation as an abominable prologue to a united Ireland, free of
British control, run from Dublin. But the peace agreement
stipulates that there will be no end to British sovereignty in
Northern Ireland without the consent of the majority, which is
likely to remain Protestant well into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, supports the
new structures, but he must deal constantly with attacks by
Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, who accuses
him of consorting with the enemy. The two parties contend for seats
in provincial elections for local councils and in the British and
European Parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   The overall peace agreement was reached after the Irish and
British governments made important concessions to Sinn Fein and the
IRA, including the early release of paramilitary prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But republican dissidents, castigating the agreement as a
sellout that does not guarantee the withdrawal of British authority
from the island, have continued deadly attacks designed to make the
political process collapse and to plunge the province into renewed
guerrilla warfare.

   NEW YORK _ In tasting 24 balsamic vinegars, I discovered you
can't judge a vinegar by its price tag or its label. A number of
vinegars staking a claim to tradizionale status _ or at least
priced as if they were _ were in fact decent vinegars for cooking
but nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   I divided them into three categories: aceto balsamico
tradizionale, for samples that rise to the level of the best
artisanal vinegar; those best for cooking because of their complex
flavors; and salad vinegars, light and thin but often a good
alternative to wine vinegar. Sampled brands are listed in order of
preference.

 (For release Tuesday Feb. 23)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat

<TEXT>
<P>
   I wanted to say that Annie Lamott, who has written about being
Christian in ``Traveling Mercies,'' in the same naked, irreverent
way she wrote about becoming a mother in ``Operating Instructions''
and watching a father die in ``Hard Laughter,'' is a role model for
the Religious Left. Her approach to religion is such a refreshing
antidote to the Thought Police of the Religious Right, who say you
can't be a Christian if you don't bash gay people and do as your
husband commands.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Annie defines herself as Christian and liberal
and a feminist. And not just a regular Christian but a ``born
again,'' who blesses her gay friends' wedding and alternately
refers to God as She and He.
</P>
<P>
   Hallelujah.
</P>
<P>
   So, I asked if she were a spokesperson for the Religious Left
and she fittingly protested, ``Oh God, no.''
</P>
<P>
   She is her own believer. As she put it, ``I am one cell of the
great body of believers.'' She paused and added, ``One cell with a
loud mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a brave thing that she has done. It's one thing to be a
former druggie and boozer and have slept with inappropriate men and
confess to sometimes being tough on your kid and not being always
loving to your mother and having unkind thoughts about other
people's children, as she does in her books. It is a huge
confession and a risk to your reputation for being hip and
wonderfully oddball to go on about prayer and Jesus trailing you
around like an insistent kitten until you let him in.
</P>
<P>
   Religion is what we don't talk about at the dinner table.
Religion is what many gave up when they became intellectual and
sophisticated and challenged everything their parents held dear.
</P>
<P>
   Same with Annie. ``It was not what a left wing intellectual
did.'' Being drawn to religion, especially ``the Jesus part,'' she
said was right up there with being a Moonie or a Scientologist.
</P>
<P>
   But I think this loud mouth, with her asides to God as well as
her sweet devotion to all manner of weird human beings, is going to
make an impact with this book. Maybe readers won't be lining up to
be baptized into her Marin County church, St. Andrew Presbyterian,
but she has opened the door to something that has laid dormant and
been uncool for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   She admits that she'd like her book to be ``the great Shalom,
the great welcome to the un-churchable,'' those unwilling or shy
about investigating their own personal faith.
</P>
<P>
   People are shy. Talking about what you believe in is like
walking around town naked. It's showing too much. Someone will
laugh or never think of you the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier, maybe, if you call it spirituality because that
allows for some movement in belief. It takes it out of a church,
puts it into a redwood grove or around a bonfire at the beach.
Gives you a religion you can dance to.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be an embarrassing subject, even with all the trend
stories lately on how Boomers and others facing mortality are
starting to shop around for a church or temple or looking into
Buddhism. Maybe people find a community in a goddess circle they
don't get in their town.
</P>
<P>
   But Annie's is regular church. It has a gospel choir that rocks
and the congregation is racially diverse and the minister is a
woman. The fact that it's in economically disadvantaged Marin City,
the non-yuppie part of Marin County, makes it anti-chic. But,
beyond that, Annie explains, it's a ``very traditional church,
Bible-based, very Scriptural, very Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   She says in her book that her friends tried to edit her
self-definition of ``born again.'' They would modify it to
``Christian-ish,'' but she sticks with ``born again,'' and writes,
``I could go to a gathering of foot-washing Baptists, and except
for my dreadlocks, fit right in.''
</P>
<P>
   Her hair in dreadlocks, set off by a gardenia at a recent
reading, coil and jump over the gold cross around her neck. Like
her religion, her hair was a surprising fit. She thought she wanted
smooth hair with bangs but she was stuck with frizzy hair which no
amount of moussing could tame.
</P>
<P>
   But a few years ago she found that her hair twists into splendid
dreadlocks and now people come up and ask her who does it, which is
a miracle for anyone who has lived 40 years thinking she wanted
something else.
</P>
<P>
   This devout Christian, who obsesses about hair and cellulite and
says the F word, has faith galore but she doesn't have answers to
why little kids suffer and best friends die. But she has something.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it out there in her neurotic Peter Pan style she's bound
to convert a few. She's aiming for people who rejected the church
of their childhood and people offended by the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks there's an ``invisible hunger'' for people to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the millennium. Maybe it's simply that we don't want
any group thinking they have exclusive rights to God. Even an
un-churchable type can find herself seeking out a cathedral in a
new city and needing to light a candle. Or sometimes just feeling
compelled to go outside and meet with the stars.

MAGIC POTIONS THAT STIR FOOD TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By MOLLY O'NEILL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEALDSBURG, Calif. _ Like a nurse bending over cradle after
cradle of sleeping infants, Paul Bertolli hovered tenderly over the
oak barrels lining a loft above a small barn in Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-square-foot attic, banked with neat wood bunks of
barrels, has been a nursery of sorts, the place where Bertolli is
raising aceto balsamico in the ancient Italian manner.
</P>
<P>
   It is winter, the season of sleeping vinegar and the time of
year when sturdy dishes beg for a splash of the mysterious, sweet
and sour elixir that was elevated to an art form in the Po Valley.
</P>
<P>
   From a tidy bunghole in the barrel, Bertolli inhaled. As he
exhaled, his breath looked like smoke in the air. The chill, he
said softly, had caused the vinegar to precipitate used bits of
bacteria and yeast, causing the particles to settle and the liquid
to clarify. Even when it is sleeping, aceto balsamico is alive and
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ordinary wine vinegar, aceto balsamico is made from
crushed grapes, which ferment, acidify and oxidize as the liquid
ages and evaporate in smaller and smaller barrels for at least 12
years. The vinegar is thick, more a condiment or a cordial.
Infusing it with the essence of different woods, shepherding the
natural sweet and sour flavors, is one of humankind's greatest
culinary balancing acts.
</P>
<P>
   The balsamico allure has prompted a deluge of imitators in
specialty shops and supermarkets across the country. But a tasting
by the writer showed that modern mass production has not simulated
the balsamic vinegar made and aged traditionally.
</P>
<P>
   Vinegar sold as balsamic can be as sweet and thick as port or
terribly astringent, muddy or flat. Neither price nor package
guarantees quality. In one case, there was no discernible
difference between a $36 bottle and one that cost $2.99.
</P>
<P>
   Aged aceto balsamico, at its best, has toasted caramel tones,
hints of spice and honey and a soft, mellow acidity. The aged
vinegar was described in centuries-old Italian archives as a tonic,
a digestive, a condiment and a liquor.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``balsamico'' is thought to relate to balm, to connote
a healing potion. Among connoisseurs in Italy and the United
States, serious balsamic vinegar is tasted like a fine old port.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, the venerable condiment is most often
diluted with ordinary vinegar in commercial bottles and used for
salads. ``Our customers don't want connoisseur quality,'' said
Steven Jenkins, an owner of the Fairway markets in New York. ``Most
of them are looking to make an interesting vinaigrette.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Marcella Hazan, the cooking teacher and author,
introduced America to the condiment from the provinces of Modena
and Reggio Emilia. Cooks seized on the condiment to add a subtle
sweet and sour note to soups and stews, to bring out sweetness in
winter vegetables, to elevate salads and to make pale, hard
strawberries resemble ripe fruit.
</P>
<P>
   As a leading ingredient in the pastafication of America,
balsamic vinegar coincided with an appetite for leaner food; it
adds a toasted depth to steamed and grilled dishes, a note of
mystery to salsa, chutney and slaw. The Japanese use well-aged
balsamico as a variant on soy sauce with sushi and sashimi.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the balsamic vinegar sold in the United States is
imported from Italy, said Darryl Corti, an owner of Corti Brothers,
an importer and specialty food purveyor in Sacramento. The company
was the first to import connoisseur-grade aceto balsamic
tradizionale and remains the country's premier source for it.
</P>
<P>
   As industry has cashed in on balsamico chic, the traditional
artisanal elixir has been diluted to almost just another vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Italian immigrants may well have produced balsamic vinegar in
New World attics, but Bertolli is the first known vinegar
aficionado to create a consortium to support his efforts in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 22 families invests the hundreds of dollars and
thousands of hours it takes, over a decade, to produce a few liters
of the syrupy vinegar, which they will share.
</P>
<P>
   Bertolli's first vintage should be ready for his friends,
partners and his restaurant, Oliveto in Oakland, in about two
years. A chef and cookbook author, he is also part-parent,
part-scientist, part-high priest to his battery of 122 barrels.
</P>
<P>
   He is a determined champion of an ancient, time-gobbling
tradition. Still, his efforts measure less than a drop of dew in
today's multimillion-gallon tide of balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest mass-produced versions can cost as little as $1.99
but are typically concoctions of ordinary vinegar and caramel, aged
as little as a day. The moderate to expensive kinds are one-sixth
traditional, aged aceto balsamico, five-sixths ordinary wine
vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   The gold standard _ balsamico drawn from barrels that were first
used as early as 1650 _ can fetch upward of $500 for a 3.4-ounce
bottle. Vintages from barrels two or three centuries younger cost
about $75 to $250 for 3.4 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The production of industrial balsamic vinegar in Italy dwarfs
that of traditionally crafted and aged aceto, by 1.7 million liters
to 1,760 liters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the parade of commercial balsamic vinegars there are still
some extraordinary _ and pricey _ imports.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, laying down $50 doesn't guarantee a fabulous aceto
balsamico. As with other foods that have moved from expensive
luxury to affordable near-necessity in the American kitchen, taste
is the only sure arbiter.
</P>
<P>
   Any bottle of the most authentic version, called aceto balsamic
tradizionale, will be corked and sealed with wax or a lead capsule
and bear a ribbon or a stamp of the producer's insignia. Italian
law regulates the phrase ``aceto balsamico tradizionale,'' and any
Italian product with that name will state the point of origin,
either Reggio Emilia or Modena. But it will not show an age on the
label.
</P>
<P>
   Not all artfully sealed, beribboned bottles contain true aceto
balsamico tradizionale. The laws limiting the use of buzz words
like ``balsamico'' or phrases like ``balsamic vinegar of Modena''
or ``di Modena'' are loose. They can signify a minimally aged
blend, or unpalatable boiled caramel and vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Italian government banned the use of the term
``balsamico,'' as well as reference to Modena or Reggio Emilia on
any bottle but ``tradizionale,'' pure balsamico, aged at least 12
years. The law, however, governed only Italian production.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, any vinegar can be called balsamic. The
term has lost meaning, as the vinegar has lost character. And
labels are often misleading. A giant ``6'' or ``21'' on the label
means nothing about the age of what is inside the bottle, Corti
said. ``It's illegal to put the age of the vinegar on the bottle,''
he continued, ``but they can print a number on there, and the
customers make the inference.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, the vinegar's age is less important than that
of the wood it ages in, no balsamico that costs less than $50 a
bottle has had enough aging and care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you age water for 21 years, its going to cost you
something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vinegar process starts with the grape harvest in fall. In
Italy, Trebbiano, a tart variety, is the grape of choice, though
regulations allow the white occhio di gatta and Spergola, as well
as the red Lambrusco and Berzemino grapes.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Bertolli has found that French columbard, chenin
blanc, merlot, syrah and zinfandel grapes have the acidity for a
well-balanced balsamic vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   The grapes are crushed gently to reduce the release of tannins
in their skin and then simmered until about 25 percent of the
liquid evaporates to make a sweet syrup, which is poured into
75-to-100-liter chestnut or mulberry barrels and left for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Air space is left in the barrel for oxidization, and slowly,
wine yeast feeds on the must's sugar and converts it to alcohol. At
the same time, but much more slowly, acetic bacteria consume the
alcohol and transform it into acetic acid. The sugar content is too
high for the yeasts to consume, and what remains sweetens the
vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   The vinegar loses 10 percernt to 25 percent of its volume every
year. Chestnut, cherry, mulberry, ash, locust and even juniper
barrels are used in the elaborate decanting to smaller barrels,
each wood lending a different nuance to the vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 years, the vinegar's flavor mellows. More aging lets it
become thicker and more complex as the natural sweet and sour
balance deepens. The amber color darkens more than fine old
fortified wine.
</P>
<P>
   Some fanatics in Modena boast centuries-old aceto, whose mother,
or matrix, can be traced back to the rule of the Estes in the
1500s. The best aceto balsamico varies vintage to vintage, bottle
to hand-blown Venetian bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Then as now, the very best is never sold. It is a family jewel
and a process that binds generations with the land from which it
sprang. The progress of a family's vinegar bears witness to the
family's own evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Who could assign a market value to the priceless?
</P>
<P>
   ``An Italian family that maintains an acetaia'' _ or vinegar
room _ ``puts up a barrel when a child is born and serves it on its
21st birthday,'' Bertolli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can make money by making real aceto balsamico,'' he
added. He and his friends, he said, make the traditional vinegar to
``create community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of slowing down and paying attention, a way of
preserving tradition, a way of telling time.''

EXHIBITING THE CONTRAST AND RIVALRY BETWEEN MATISSE AND PICASSO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Picasso saw Matisse's ``Joy of Life''
(1906), he produced ``Les Desmoiselles d'Avignon'' (1907) in
response. When Matisse saw Picasso's portrait of a dreamer, ``Woman
With Yellow Hair'' (1931), he countered four years later with ``The
Dream.'' Matisse and Picasso were goads, rivals and measures for
one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever looked at Matisse's painting more carefully
than I,'' Picasso once said, ``and no one has looked at mine more
carefully than he.'' But Picasso never painted a Matisse, and
Matisse never painted a Picasso. As the art historian Leo Steinberg
put it, ``unlike Picasso'' is a mantra for Matisse scholars and
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   How many ways are there to say that Matisse is not Picasso and
Picasso is not Matisse? At a symposium to kick off the exhibition
``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle Rivalry'' organized by Yve-Alain
Bois at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, there were 49
examples, starting with touch and ending with death.
</P>
<P>
   The first speaker, Steinberg, pondered the way each painter
painted fingers. ``Picasso's touch is too demonstrative to leave
anything out'' (Example No. 1), Steinberg said. Matisse is a master
of fingers with no end (No. 2).
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to making paint or paper scraps ``vicissitate,''
or assume different roles, he said, Picasso rules (3). In one
Cubist collage, ``Siphon, Glass, Newspaper, Violin,'' pieces of
newspaper ``dematerialize into connotations'': one is a siphon, or
is it a wine bottle?; another is a glass and shadow; still another
is scratch paper to draw on. Scraps from the trash become
``dramatis personae,'' players with careers, Steinberg said.
Picasso has ``intrinsic wit'' (4). Matisse can hide figures in a
landscape (5). Picasso can represent multiple views of a figure
(6). Picasso's black eyes are better(7). Matisse makes black a
color (8). ``Matisse feels'' (9). ``Picasso embodies'' (10).
``Matisse resonates'' (11). Picasso begins ``in medias res'' (12).
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg added: ``Matisse can mix drawing and painting, but men
and women? No way'' (13). Picasso is obsessed with mating (14);
even his pigeons do it. In Picasso, there is narrative focus (15).
In Matisse there is no main attraction, not even the face (16).
Why? It would be ``too attractive,'' stealing attention from the
painting itself.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso conducts an ``assault on the center,'' Steinberg said;
he ``closes like a fist'' (17). Matisse is loose and expansive.
``He knows where the center is but his vectors speed past it''
(18).
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Matisse, and Picasso seems overanxious'' (19),
Steinberg continued. ``Get into Picasso, and Matisse seems
decorative'' (20) and ``shallow'' (21).
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good. But what happens when they start
trespassing on each other's turf? John Elderfield, the chief
curator at large at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, told a
story about Matisse in Picasso-land. In 1935 Matisse began work on
``The Pink Nude.'' If you look at the photographs of each stage of
the work, Elderfield said, they form ``an archeology of Matisse's
reaction'' to one of Picasso's nudes in an armchair.
</P>
<P>
   For Picasso, paintings that suggest control and submission in
the same moment were second nature. He often painted women gazing
challengingly at the viewer (22) and at the same time seductively
displaying both rear and front (23).
</P>
<P>
   For Matisse such an approach was treacherous (24). He went
through no fewer than 22 tries to get ``The Pink Nude'' right. And
he only found a comfortable solution to it when he took a break.
One afternoon, he drew a satyr spying on a nymph from above. The
next morning he went back to the painting and transformed some
flowers sitting on a chair into a stand-in for the satyr. The
flowers got a view of the model's front; the viewer saw the side.
Unlike Picasso, Matisse didn't distort the figure to get a double
view (25).
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only time one artist chased madly after the
other. In the early 1930s, Albert Skira commissioned Matisse to
illustrate some Mallarme poems and, at the same time, commissioned
Picasso to illustrate a new edition of Ovid's ``Metamorphoses.''
Picasso saw the commissions as a contest, said Lisa Florman, an
assistant professor of art history at Ohio State University. He
rushed to finish first.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, when both finished, Picasso finally got his digs in. In
one of the prints in the Vollard Suite, Picasso drew an artist
holding up a classic Matissean image, a goldfish in a bowl. Could
it be that Picasso was at last paying homage to Matisse, ``the
master of goldfish'' (26), telling him he admired the way his
figures circulate around the canvas like fish in a bowl (see No.
18)?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. Picasso, Ms. Florman argued, was taunting Matisse,
saying his figures were cold (27) and distant (28), too much like
fish behind glass. Matisse, Picasso suggested, had to rely on
sublimation (29), while he himself was driven by desire (30).
</P>
<P>
   Color? Could it be a case of Picasso in Matisse-land? In the
early 1930's Picasso emerged from a painting slump by developing a
pneumatic and parti-colored style, painting the inflated figure of
his new love, Marie-Therese Walter, with migrating body parts,
vacant head and, most notably, yellow hair and violet skin.
</P>
<P>
   Some people see these multicolored confections as the influence
of Walter herself (whose skin Picasso saw as violet). Others think
Picasso is taking a shot at Matissean color. Matisse the Fauve was
famous for arbitrary, unrealistic hues (31).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even in his most Matissean moment, Picasso was not Matisse,
argued Rosalind Krauss, an art history professor at Columbia
University. Rather, she said, Picasso was recalling the year 1914,
when he triumphed in his own way over realistic, optical color by
pasting a piece of stippled mauve wallpaper (32) into two Cubist
collages, ``Pipe and Sheet Music'' and ``Bottle of Bass, Ace of
Clubs and Pipe.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Matisse and Picasso was not all
``gentle rivalry.'' Picasso once told Francoise Gilot that
Matisse's ``Still Life With Magnolia'' set ``his teeth on edge.''
Why? There was no cause and effect. It was just one thing after
another: a pot, a magnolia, a shell, a pitcher. Picasso had a point
(34).
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shiff of the University of Texas at Austin observed that
Picasso's paintings always lend themselves to analysis (35). There
is a multiplicity of explanations of each element in his work
because everything is overdetermined (36). ``Words do not fail when
you try to analyze a Picasso,'' Shiff said. The problem, he said,
is ``how to terminate the analysis'' (37).
</P>
<P>
   In this multiply determined world, Picasso is ringmaster, ``the
prime mover,'' Shiff said (38). But with Matisse everything is part
of a harmony (39) that seems to have been achieved unconsciously
(40). Ms. Gilot described Matisse's ``Still Life With Magnolia''as
``full of bliss'' and ``impossible to analyze'' (41).
</P>
<P>
   But what is at the heart of these differences _ Picasso's
narrative intensity and Matisse's harmonious bliss, Picasso's
``assault on the center'' and Matisse's distracted, all-over
structures? Perhaps one can see the core difference in the way they
each confronted death.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso represented ``the desolation of age'' in a series of
skull paintings, said Jack Flam, an art history professor at
Brooklyn College. For Picasso death was an adversary (42). The
battle was to be fought on earth. Old Matisse, though, ``cultivated
an image of youthfulness, a world in which there is no death''
(43). He developed a set of signs _ simplified graphic symbols for
nasturtiums, leeks, leaves (44). These cutout symbols, which Louis
Aragon called a poet's palette of words, look as if they can
transcend the world of things and places as easily as Matisse moved
them from one work to another.
</P>
<P>
   Both artists were obsessed in old age with observing themselves.
When Picasso painted his head, he showed himself becoming an
inanimate object (45). Matisse represented himself looking in the
mirror, his own hand bringing the drawing into being. He was
wondering how he could ``be in and out of himself at the same
time'' (46), Flam said.
</P>
<P>
   Matisse painted goldfish for a reason. Flashing and circulating,
they are nowhere and everywhere at once. Picasso painted heads for
a reason. They are emblems of self on earth. If Picasso raged
against death and the dying of the light (47), Flam concluded,
Matisse was ``preoccupied with life force'' (48). He was sailing to
Byzantium (49).

AN ADULT MOLLY RINGWALD TACKLES SERIOUS MATERIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She probably could pass for 19, or 26, or, if
you're pushing it, maybe even 35.
</P>
<P>
   There's that same razor-straight red hair, only a bit longer and
a shade or two darker than when she made all those John Hughes
movies. Big, meditative brown eyes. A face full of freckles.
</P>
<P>
   She could be your daughter, your kid sister, that ardent high
school sweetheart you never married. When you step into the
interview room she looks at you evenly, swallowing another mouthful
of takeout chili, then quietly asks how you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Her self-possessed tone suggests there's probably no question
that would rattle Molly Ringwald.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when you ask how she came to be so comfortable with,
well, strange adults, she answers with the verbal equivalent of a
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's just sort of my makeup,'' the actress replies
thoughtfully. ``I don't think I'm as trusting now as I used to be,
but as a child I was very trusting. Unless I got a weird vibe off
of somebody. I've always been kind of instinctive, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of her third decade (she turns 31 this month), Molly
Ringwald is no longer a kid _ hard to believe if it seems like only
yesterday you watched her in ``Sixteen Candles,'' ``The Breakfast
Club'' or any of the ingenue roles that earned her a Time magazine
cover as the hottest young actress of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ringwald has maintained a lower profile, taking a
leave of absence from Hollywood in 1992 and moving to Paris for
four years. She made several foreign films, including ``Seven
Sundays'' with Jean-Luc Godard, before returning to the United
States. She also was seen in the short-lived series ``Townies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the former Brat Packer is still youthful and unjaded enough
to play a teen-ager in ``How I Learned to Drive,'' the Pulitzer
Prize-winning play by Paula Vogel, now in previews at the Mark
Taper Forum in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In Vogel's unusual coming-of-age story, Ringwald's character,
Lil' Bit, ranges in age from 11 to roughly 35 or 40. When the play
opens, she's looking back at herself as a Maryland teen-ager whose
doting, charismatic Uncle Peck (Brian Kerwin) is teaching her how
to operate a '56 Chevy _ and a whole lot more besides.
</P>
<P>
   Peck, to be blunt, is a pedophile, and his ministrations to his
underage niece are as smoothly and chillingly purposeful as the
expert driving lessons he also imparts during their frequent
outings in the pre-suburbanized Maryland countryside.
</P>
<P>
   But ``How I Learned to Drive'' doesn't depict Peck as a monster
in a freak-of-the-week TV-style melodrama, with Lil' Bit as his
unwitting victim. Without glossing over the dark side of his
character, Vogel shows him to be a complex, sensitive and
profoundly lonely human being who, in some hard-to-define way,
helps Lil' Bit escape from her redneck family and begin the painful
journey toward adulthood and independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only person in her family that sort of understands
who she is,'' Ringwald explains. ``She feels like a freak because
of the thoughts she has; she talks about `the fire in her head.'
And also her body, she's overdeveloped for her age physically and
emotionally. And he's the guy that sort of says, `OK, I see you
someplace else, I know you're going to go someplace else, and you
deserve to be someplace else.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``How I Learned to Drive'' is Vogel's most successful work since
``The Baltimore Waltz,'' a semi-autobiographical fantasia based on
the life of the author's gay brother, Carl. Like that earlier work,
``How I Learned to Drive'' mixes broad humor and poignant
reflection with a hard-to-classify political viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The play earned euphoric reviews when it opened at New York's
Vineyard Theater off-Broadway two winters ago and ended up winning
the Pulitzer Prize. Some 50 productions of the play will have
occurred by the end of this year, across the United States as well
as in Israel, South Africa, France and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   That success probably wouldn't have been possible if Vogel had
written a literal-minded morality tale about child abuse, and
Ringwald for one believes that child abuse isn't the play's main
focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a love story,'' she says. ``It's not a love
story that's certainly acceptable in society, and I don't think
Paula set out to write a play that was about these two people who
obviously cannot be together and (imply) that it's OK for them to
be together. What she always says is that she set out to write
something like `Lolita,' but from Lolita's point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brokaw, who has directed both the New York and the Taper
productions, cite Vogel's remarks that the play is ``about the
gifts we get from the people who hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what the author really wants us to be able to do is
care for both of these people,'' Brokaw says. ``She pulls no
punches in terms of ... what has actually happened. But I think
that by the time we get to the real meat of the matter, we've been
able to be seduced by both of these people and seduced into their
relationship. Not that we will necessarily approve of it, but I
think we will at least understand how and why it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ringwald, playing Lil' Bit means being able to convincingly
portray a girl one-third her own age, an assignment she previously
handled when she took over the role in New York from Mary-Louise
Parker. Ringwald says she generally concentrates on tapping into
Lil' Bit's thoughts and emotions, and the body language tends to
take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   She and actor Brian Kerwin also worked out their strategy for
dealing with the delicate scene near the end of the play where Peck
and Lil' Bit act out their most intimate physical encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of talk about it gently before, and you make certain
ground rules and kind of go from there,'' Ringwald says. ``And
everything's fine. And Brian is a great guy, really easy to work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing herself as ``the baby'' in a Sacramento family of
three children, Ringwald began her acting career before she hit her
fourth birthday. Her first professional stage role was in the
chorus of the musical ``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good play for a kid because there were a lot of kids
in it,'' she says. ``It wasn't like this dramatic, you know,
`Oedipus' or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ringwald, by her own account, was a trusting child, her
parents were always supportive and protective. They were
particularly wary of scripts with any kind of inappropriate sexual
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My mom) didn't want me to do anything on film that I hadn't
experienced in my life, so that the overtly sexual scripts were not
even sent to me,'' Ringwald says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I was a California minor, and subject to different laws
than New York, certain nudity laws. It may have changed now in New
York. Which is why Brooke Shields was able to do stuff: She was a
New York minor and I was a California minor. But it was also just
something that my mom didn't want me to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young actress, Ringwald says, she had an additional
mentor-protector in the form of a female studio teacher who served
as her personal tutor. The woman, who passed away a couple years
ago, was something of a Hollywood backstage legend, having also
assisted Jodie Foster and Winona Ryder early in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was kind of maternal but more like a friend, really,''
Ringwald says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's kind of what Lil' Bit, I think, finds in Peck. Except
without the other side of it, because obviously this was a
wonderful, healthy relationship in my life. Everything I got from
her was kind of like what Lil' Bit gets. Because she saw something
in me, she always knew that I was kind of destined for other
things, she protected me and taught me things without my knowing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With several new projects under way, including a role in the
summer thriller ``Killing Mrs. Tingle,'' written and directed by
Kevin Williamson (``Scream'') with teen fave Katie Holmes; and
``Hearts and Bones,'' with Keifer Sutherland and Daryl Hannah,
Ringwald appears destined for more good things. So far, she seems
to be managing the trick, as Casey Stengel put it, of growing up
without growing old.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very young woman with a very wise soul, the soul of
someone with great experience,'' says director Brokaw. ``And I
think that's what makes her particularly compelling in this part.
Because I think that's true for Lil' Bit also, because even at the
age of 11 (she) has an old soul.''

FOREIGN DIGNITARIES NOW VISITING BUSH ON REGULAR BASIS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ All governors get occasional visits from foreign
dignitaries, but Gov. George W. Bush's presidential aspirations
have turned the Texas Capitol into a mini-United Nations in recent
weeks, including Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The day's gubernatorial guests included former Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney and two diplomats from the Persian Gulf
nation of Qatar. Last week, Bush greeted Britain's Tory leader
William Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Mulroney, whose tenure was viewed as a disaster for his
conservative party, left Bush with the impression that ``it's
important for the Republican Party to unify as opposed to splinter.
I think he's worried that the party would tend to shatter on some
issues,'' Bush said after their brief private meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mulroney didn't meet with the press, but took a bow from the
gallery of the Texas House at Bush's request. Bush described
Mulroney as ``a friend of my dad's ... a friend of America, a great
world leader when he was in power.'' He was prime minister from
1984 until his resignation in 1993, coinciding with George Bush's
terms as vice president and president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's meeting with the dignitaries from Qatar also was private.
Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, Qatar's minister of
foreign affairs, was accompanied by Ambassador Saad M. Al-Kobaisi,
a gubernatorial spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to listen,'' Bush said. ``He's just coming by
to make a courtesy call,'' Bush said of the sheik. ``I don't have
an agenda,'' the governor added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get ambassadors that come all the time. This (presidential)
speculation has seemed to have caused more governments to send
their ambassadors my way, so I look forward to listening,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors claim to be doing some listening as well.
</P>
<P>
   According to the British Broadcasting Corp., Hague returned to
England saying he had gathered information about successful GOP
strategies, including Bush's ``compassionate conservatism.'' The
British network described Bush as ``one of the foremost exponents
of the new `caring conservatism.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hague will tell his party it must be seen as `open, inclusive
and compassionate,' as opposed to its past `elitist' image,'' the
BBC reported Friday.

 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUNU, South Africa _ If you don't concentrate you can drive
through this tiny rural village without even noticing it. Of
course, the yellow brick house with the guard tower might catch
your eye. It looks more or less like what it is _ an imitation of a
South African jailer's cottage.
</P>
<P>
   It is President Nelson Mandela's vacation house. He had it built
that way after having spent his last years in prison in a similar
bungalow. He said he wanted the familiar floor plan so that he
could find the kitchen without banging his shins in the middle of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   The house is just a few yards from the main road. On the other
side is the rest of Qunu, mostly a collection of round huts and a
fair number of Mandela cousins who are tending sheep and cattle and
pigs. That is where Mandela did most of his growing up, and he has
said he will retire there.
</P>
<P>
   But that is seeming more and more unlikely, especially now that
he has married Graca Machel, the widow of the former president of
Mozambique. ``What would Graca do there?'' some on the president's
staff have been heard to mutter.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Mandela has already spent enough time here to put
Qunu on the map. Hundreds of tourists travel out here every year,
though the village is nowhere near any of South Africa's top
tourist destinations. It is a winding potholed three-hour drive
north of the nearest big city, East London, on the southeastern
coast.
</P>
<P>
   But Qunu residents have not let the tourists make much of an
impression on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they come,'' said Kutala Tetani, 18, who was chasing
down an errant donkey recently across the road from Mandela's
house. ``They do not bother us.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has thought to put up a sign or open a souvenir stand,
though a visitor can buy a cold drink or a large sack of ground
corn at the tiny store next to the mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   But much has changed for Qunu since Mandela left prison in 1990.
He came here almost right away, hungry to see the open spaces of
his homeland, where the rolling hills are velvety green in the
summer and there are hardly any trees. Because Mandela is now 80,
not too many people remembered him, but everyone knew who he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time he came,'' said Leonard Mandela, 67, a relative
of the president who has lived here all his life, ``he would have a
walk and all the way the people just followed him.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his memoirs, Mandela said he was bothered by what he saw
when he returned. ``What had endured was the warmth and the
simplicity of the community, which took me back to my days as a
boy,'' he wrote. ``But what disturbed me was that the villagers
seemed as poor if not poorer than they had ever been then. Most
people still lived in simple huts with dirt floors, with no
electricity and no running water.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the village has electricity, new water taps, new school
buildings and, right now, a tunnel that is being built so that the
children can safely cross the road to visit Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is just a result of new anti-poverty programs. But
some is Mandela's famous corporate arm-twisting at work. The
residents of Qunu can point to villages across the valley that do
not have such amenities. They concede that there is some jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these other villages, they are complaining,'' Leonard
Mandela said with a shake of his head and a shrug that suggested
that this was too bad, but certainly not something to spend too
much time over.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road at the freshly painted new high school with the
luxury of a book-filled library and a science laboratory, the
principal, Zoneka Jafta, and the deputy principal, Mncedis
Mabuntane, said there was a fair degree of animosity toward them in
neighboring communities.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Jafta, who has been the high school principal since
1984, does not tolerate such complaints. ``They are saying, `Why
does Mandela always do for his own place?' '' she said. ``He is
going to do more everywhere. But he is starting here. I don't see
anything wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mandela was released from jail after 27 years, the Qunu
school was a couple of falling-down huts, Mrs. Jafta said, with
floors of hard cow dung. The 10th grade was taught under a tree.
The principal's office was a shack. And in 1989, the outhouse
collapsed, dropping half a dozen students into the pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to be pulled from that,'' Mrs. Jafta said. ``Their
shoes were left behind. And then they had to walk 5 kilometers to
the water to wash. It was very traumatic.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mandela first visited the school, he heard about all the
problems but made no promises, she recounted. Then one day a
helicopter landed. Prodded to do a good deed, executives from
Caltex, the oil company, had arrived. Within the year, Caltex had
built several buildings for the school.
</P>
<P>
   There are still problems. The science lab does not have a single
chair or desk. The children have to take classes standing up and
lean on one another to take notes. There are no refrigerators. Mrs.
Jafta and Mabuntane are assembling a list for Mandela's next visit.
</P>
<P>
   He usually comes by at Christmas time, when he hands out
presents to the children. To hear them tell it, he is rather
single-minded in his conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells us to stay in school,'' the students say in a chorus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One year, Mandela gave the students an American $100 bill. They
eventually voted to use it toward improving the water system.
</P>
<P>
   There are plans afoot to have a museum here. Not that there is
too much left from Mandela's childhood. His mother's hut was taken
down to make room for his brother's house. And the Methodist Church
school that Mandela attended and that gave him the Christian name
Nelson is gone, too.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Long Walk to Freedom,'' Mandela tells of his first
day at school, when his father took a pair of his own trousers, put
them on his son, cut them around the ankles to get the length
right, tied them at the waist and sent him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have been a comical sight,'' Mandela wrote. ``But I
have never owned a suit I was prouder to wear than my father's
cut-off trousers.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Mandela said, his principal goal in life was to
be the best stick fighter around.

IRAQFLAK (Undated) - It was supposed to be a routine refueling
flight well outside the no-fly zone over northern Iraq. But then
two streaking missles rose from the ground below. By DENNIS WAGNER.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLINTON (Phoenix) - President Bill Clinton will pay a visit to
Arizona on Feb. 25, the first time he has been here since the blitz
of three appearances he made here in September, October and
November of 1996 that resulted in his taking of the state in his
re-election campaign. The president will spend much of the day in
an event related to social security, according to Republic sources.
By CHRIS MOESER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHEEHY-CLINTONS (Phoenix) - Journalist and author Gail Sheehy has
been tracking Bill and Hillary Clinton since the campaign of 1992.
In last month's ``Vanity Fair,'' she wrote an extensive article on
how the Clinton marriage is faring - now that the secret of Bill's
philandering is out. The verdict: Hillary is not amused. ``She's
putting him through the wringer,'' Sheehy says. By BARBARA YOST.
Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOOK-LOSTBIRD (Undated) _ In ``Looking for Lost Bird,'' Yvette

   &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - A couple of months ago, I wrote a nasty
letter to ``This Old House'' because I didn't like how a Victorian
mansion was being restored. After I mailed it, I realized that,
because I was being so petty, karma _ which returns to you ten-fold
_ was going to be brutal. I now believe that the following letters
are a portion of my penance. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the
``L'' category. &QL;

CITING `CAMPAIGN' AGAINST GERMANY, CHANCELLOR PLANS FUND FOR
VICTIMS OF NAZIS
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By ROGER COHEN 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany announced on
Tuesday that a fund, projected to amount to $1.7 billion, would be
created and financed by 12 German companies to compensate victims
of the Nazis and end what he called ``the campaign being led
against German industry and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, in the presence of some of Germany's top
executives, was clearly aimed at stopping a wave of lawsuits in
American courts against German companies that used slave labor and
forced labor during World War II. But Schroeder's choice of words
appeared unlikely to calm the waters.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor, who took office last October and has been
struggling to stamp his authority on the government, said a main
function of the fund was ``to counter lawsuits, particularly class
action suits, and to remove the basis of the campaign being led
against German industry and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor did not say who was behind the ``campaign''
against Germany, but his suggestion appeared comparable to the
response of some Swiss officials who said they saw a darkly
orchestrated anti-Swiss movement in the legal actions by Holocaust
survivors against Swiss banks that ultimately led to a $1.25
billion settlement signed last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an inadequate and embarrassing statement,'' said
Michael Witti, a Munich-based lawyer for tens of thousands of
plaintiffs in the suits already brought. ``It is not a question of
campaigns by anybody. It is a question of Holocaust victims' rights
that have been denied by these corporations for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's statement, in which firmness mingled with remorse,
appeared to catch the ambivalent mood of a Germany anxious to put
the past behind it, irritated over what some intellectuals have
called the ``popularization'' of the Holocaust, yet still conscious
of its inescapable historical responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, the German government has paid
out about $80 billion in war reparations and aid, most of it to
Jews who survived concentration camps or fled.
</P>
<P>
   But forced laborers _ people, generally non-Jews, deported to
Germany mainly from Eastern European countries including Poland and
Russia _ have not often been compensated. Nor has a far smaller
category of slave laborers _ some Jewish, some not _ who were put
to work in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the ``Remembrance, Responsibility and the
Future'' fund is intended to answer the ``moral responsibility of
German firms with regard to such issues as forced laborers,
Aryanization and other injustice during the Nazi regime,'' said
Schroeder, who was speaking in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   Its aim is thus broad. The term ``Aryanization'' refers to the
takeover, often with derisory payments or none at all, of Jewish
property in Germany. Many Jewish survivors are now seeking
compensation for these acts.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder did not specify the amount of the fund, but officials
here provided the rough estimate of about three billion German
marks, equal to about $1.7 billion. The chancellor said payments
should start ``very quickly, if possible before Sept. 1, 1999'' in
view of the advanced age of many of the people involved.
</P>
<P>
   Witti said the sum of $1.7 billion, if accurate, was substantial
but inadequate. He estimated that there were about 1.6 million
World War survivors who could qualify for compensation under the
fund, each of whom might then receive about $1,000, if payments
were equal.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish government has said there are more than 500,000
surviving forced laborers in Poland alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is clearly right is the idea that payments should be made
against formal abandonment of all class-action suits,'' the lawyer
said. ``German industry must know that when it's over, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's statement said that ``the governments of the United
States and Israel welcome this initiative as a positive and
courageous answer by German companies to their moral
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But American officials said privately that they were surprised
by the timing of the statement. ``We don't really know what to make
of it,'' one said. ``There are some raised eyebrows.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eugene Dubow, the head of the American Jewish Committee in
Germany, said, ``If Schroeder thinks there is a campaign against
Germany, perhaps he does not totally understand the issue of people
waiting 50 years for justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, aware of the potential impact of the
suits on German-American relations, has followed the issue closely.
The announcement came after protracted negotiations led by Bodo
Hombach, Schroeder's chief of staff, and Stuart Eizenstat, the
State Department under secretary for business and economic affairs.
Eizenstat is expected in Germany next week.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 companies that announced their participation in the fund
on Tuesday are: DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Siemens,
Volkswagen, Hoechst, Dresdner Bank, Krupp, Allianz, BASF, Bayer,
BMW and Degussa. The list _ encompassing auto making, banking,
chemical production, insurance and other industrial sectors _
covers many of Germany's top industrial names. They invited other
companies to join them.
</P>
<P>
   At a time that German companies have been on a buying spree
overseas _ last year the auto manufacturer Chrysler and the
publisher Random House were both acquired by German companies _ the
slave-labor question has been particularly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is still trying to complete the purchase of
Bankers Trust, the financial services company. But the acquisition
has met some resistance in the United States, pending clarification
of slave-labor and other issues. The German bank said this month
that it had helped to finance Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Breuer, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, was with
Schroeder on Tuesday. He said the fund amounted to a ``large step
in the right direction, but there are still a lot of details to
sort out.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the details is the planned establishment of a German
federal fund alongside the one financed by the companies. It is not
clear how large it might be. Schroeder's statement said, ``A
suitable link with the companies' initiative must now be found.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies said part of the fund would be used to compensate
slave laborers and other victims and part to finance
``forward-looking projects on the basis of understanding of the
Nazi past.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest to find a balance between remembrance and
forward-looking themes has become something of a German obsession
of late, affecting a still unresolved debate over a Holocaust
Memorial in Berlin, the new capital.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the discussions lies an evident German thirst to be
``normal'' and embrace the future in a country where the vast
majority of people alive today played no role in the Holocaust.

 &HT;    Newspaper industry conference comes to AtlantaBy Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Editor and Publisher, the magazine of the newspaper
industry brings its 10th annual Interactive newspapers conference
to Atlanta Feb 17-20. The four-day event will take place at the
Hyatt Regency Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote speaker Michael Bloomberg, founder and CEO of Bloomberg
News is scheduled to talk about the challenges and strategies
facing journalism in the online world. The president of
Atlanta-based Cox Interactive Media, Peter Winter, will speak
Friday on convergence and managing multiple media streams.
</P>
<P>
   This is the tenth anniversary of the conference first held in
Dallas 10 years ago with 50 attendees and no exhibitors. This year,
according to Marsha Stoltman, Editor and Publisher's vice president
of marketing relations, 1,300-plus attendees are expected along
with 117 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1990, we were talking about very different products
like videotext, for example,'' Stoltman says, adding that the
conference has become global in scope and issues. ``We have
attendees from 35 different countries. The issues are the same no
matter what part of the world you live in,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The four day conference addresses all aspects of online
journalism from marketing to editorial and classified advertising.
The classified advertising section features advertisers talking
about how they divide their dollars between online and traditional
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll also be focusing on organizational issues, which has
been a really tough issue for many media companies. We'll also talk
about targeting younger consumers, who aren't really reading
newspapers. We'll talk about how they are getting their news and
how the industry is pro-actively working to capture those people.''

 &HT;    Citizens' committee will get first members soon
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia Y2K citizens' committee is coming out of
incubation.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Georgia's Gov. Roy Barnes met with Southern
Co.'s head, A.W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg, the newly appointed Y2K czar,
about the shape of Dahlberg's new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan now is to have the first 10 members of Dahlberg's Y2K
citizens' committee appointed by Friday. Then we can at least get
the executive order forming that committee signed and done,'' said
the governor's spokesman, Jim Flowers. ``We can add more members
later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a pretty diverse group,'' Flowers added.
``We're looking at people from the hospital industry,
communications and, of course, the utility industry'' _ this last
reference was to Dahlberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've also got a retired banker under consideration,'' Flowers
said. ``We may include a minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aiming for a pretty good cross-section covering the
whole state. For what you can do with 15 to 20 people, it'll be a
fair representation of the state as a whole. We want enough ears
into different areas of the state that we'll hear about everything
one way or another,'' Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   The citizens' committee will work with the Y2K inter-agency task
force, the latter the product of a Barnes executive order announced
Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The task force will ``coordinate information exchange and
assistance to local governments as they assess and plan for Y2K,''
Barnes said at the time. The information gathered will also be used
by GEMA, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, ``to coordinate
contingency planning for the state and communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force is going to coordinate Y2K surveys ``so we don't
duplicate efforts,'' said Flowers. ``It's also going to coordinate
what other data gatherers have done so we can share best
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force will ``work with communities that have to respond
to surveys, and it will help them respond.'' And it will supply
additional help through volunteers, if necessary, Flowers noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, if a municipality has embedded processors, and
if it doesn't know what to look for,'' then the task force will
``help them with that,'' Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that Dahlberg's citizens' committee will also be in
close contact with all the state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the citizens' committee will be out in the
communities, Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will know ``what's going on, and it can be a
two-way information force, saying, `Here's what's already being
done out there, but here's what needs to be done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Flowers explained, the citizens' committee will
``make sure that what agencies are doing is both the right thing
and something that's understood by everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   March 5 is the tentative date for the first meeting with the
citizens' committee, Flowers said. ``That's going to be a meeting
where we give a good briefing about the readiness of the state
agencies and also a briefing about GEMA.''

 &HT;    Institutions respond to call of new media
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Academe has had a reputation for being slow off the
mark when it comes to preparing students for what industry needs
right now. But local colleges, obviously hearing the firebell
ringing, have turned their attention to training people for fields
like Web design and information technology.
</P>
<P>
   And students are eager and ready, too.
</P>
<P>
   Both Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia have designed
programs in new media, emphasizing the science and art of creating
material on the Internet to inform, sell, and connect with a public
anxious to learn and do transactions on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools, like Clayton State, are busy training platoons of
information technologists to massage and manage streams of data for
companies large and small. The school reports nearly 500 students
enrolled since fall, with the demand outrunning the available
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Williams, president of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce, outlined the reason why the pressure is on to accelerate
the production of trained people for the information industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hometown employers are growing so fast we need 19,000 new
trained workers per year to compete with other emerging high-tech
cities,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   That demand is driving starting salaries for some of these
new-minted, new-media mavens to $40,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia opened its Dowden Center for New Media Studies in
Athens, Ga. in early 1994, and has now placed about 80 students in
shops and big businesses like CNN, IBM, First Union Bank and iXL.
</P>
<P>
   The Dowden Center, which is a part of the Henry W. Grady College
of Journalism and Communication, has the resources of a nationally
recognized communications industry program, said Scott A. Shamp,
center director.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is no doubt that new media is a real hot spot in
communications,'' he said. ``In the old days, hard-nosed professors
would say, 'look to the the right, look to the left, only one of
you will make it.' Now these (new media) students are treated like
royalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Tech program, which also began in 1994, is lodged in
the School of Literature, Communication and Culture, and draws on
the expertise of the school's computer technology experts.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a two-year masters program in information
design and technology, Tech also draws hundreds of employed
part-time students for continuing education segments of two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing education program is very much consumer driven,
catering to what students say they need to round out their
understanding, or get them started on a new area of interest,''
said Thomas Winn, director of continuing education.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the more structured full-time programs, schools are
under the gun to be flexible. They are hard-pressed to keep up with
business needs that are growing and shifting fast.
</P>
<P>
   Shamp at Georgia keeps the bridges up, bringing in outside
speakers frequently, including recent graduates of the program _
who can come in and talk about the real, live experiences, convey
the excitement of the new careers, and even scout the best
prospects for their own companies or employers.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are intimate by today's campus standards, with some 16
students per class in Athens, and a limit of 20 annually at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we are surrounded by computers, as you see,'' Shamp
told me during one visit, ``the most important item in this room is
that table. That's where our work is done.''
</P>
<P>
   In that seminar-like atmosphere students debate the aesthetics
of existing Web pages they study and think up ways to present
graphics that are fresh and innovative but also clear to people who
view the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a more traditional structure, Tech students learn to use the
tools in class dealing with video, digital editing, graphic design
and multimedia. They also study how people learn in courses like
cultural theory and cognitive science.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the feeling that we must do more than train,'' said
Winn. ``We also need to teach history, and also put what we learn
in perspective, the kind of thing that is traditional for
colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   While the universities are dealing with some of the broader
skills in the new media, Clayton is working furiously to train the
technicians to man the computers and get the work done in the
utilities and other major companies which must keep up with the
latest ways to manage data.
</P>
<P>
   The new Information Technology Career Ladder (ITCL) program
started last fall and now has 455 students enrolled. Many of them
are in one-year certificate programs and will be on the job this
summer, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other students are working toward two-year associate degrees as
well as bachelors degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Stephen Portch, talking to the Board of Regents last
week in Atlanta, praised Clayton State for its ``spectacular''
response in gearing up fast.
</P>
<P>
   But economic development policymakers fear that a continued
shortfall in workers could dampen the growth of some technology
industries in metro Atlanta and elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, however, the market is ruled by the freshly
trained grads in new media, the budding royalty.

 &HT;    Author tells tale of how to lose money in a hurry
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Wolff wrote one of the first ``how not to''
books about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn Rate: How I survived the Gold Rush Years on the
Internet,'' is about Wolff's experience as an unlikely Internet
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   The former journalist turned screenwriter turned American
expatriate and would-be novelist turned media consultant staked an
early claim _ 1994 _ in the Internet gold rush. Wolff New Media
compiled, published and sold NetGuide, a book that tried to be the
TV Guide of the Internet. Burn Rate tells the story of how Wolff
turned a profitable publishing company into a money-sucking
Internet black hole.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff traded outside cash for control and grew his new media
company exponentially. In four months in 1996, his company shot
from 8 employees to 70. Wolff took a profitable business making 15
percent to 20 percent profit margins into a company that in one
year lost $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Wolff was smacked: Unable to cover the bills, he
allowed his company to be taken over by some of its investors. The
book, finished in March 1998 and released in June, is Wolff's smack
back. Part diary, part gossip column, part cautionary tale, Wolff
describes Burn Rate as ``an incredibly sweet revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Burn Rate has sold close to 100,000 copies. Wolff, 45, said he
is starting to think about a new book. In the meantime, he writes a
weekly, 2,000-word media column for New York magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff will speak in Atlanta at a Wednesday night dinner
sponsored by the Association for Interactive Media.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you end up an Internet entrepreneur?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I started consulting on the future of media for some
friends on Wall Street. Then I got involved with people wanting to
do some media deals. I got gradually more and more in this world of
deals and media and entrepreneurship, and I liked it. I liked being
around business people. I'd been around writers for a long time.
And you know, writers, are a lot of _ they're a group with a lot of
homogeneity, let's say. I got into the business world and said,
where'd these people come from? It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did that lead you to the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I got more interested in desktop publishing technology. I
was always looking for ways to compete with larger media
organizations and that lead me to the Internet. Around 1990, I
started getting this inchoate sense that there was a relationship
between information and technology. That sounds ridiculous now, but
in 1990 not a lot of people I knew were thinking like that. The
Internet just got into my horizon, in subtle ways. A guy I knew
knew a guy who said there was lots of free information out there,
stuff you pay Lexis/Nexis for. I told an intern to find out about
it for me.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually it was just there. It was a presence. I remember
trying to explain this to people in the early 90s, and it was
impossible. You sounded like a crazy person at that point. You were
trying to describe the indescribable, and no one ever got it. I
thought then that there's got to be a book here. I came up with
NetGuide. I saw it as a TV Guide for the Net. Describing the
Internet as a new kind of TV, a new kind of media, which no one was
doing at that point. The book came out in Jan. 1994, within a week,
knew my life had changed. The response to the book was
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it too late for regional cities like Atlanta to get
involved in the technology industry in in a big, Silicon Valley
way?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's too late and too early still. I still don't know what's
going to work in this industry. Everybody assumes this certainty,
but it lasts for a limited period. Like electronic commerce. Yeah,
well, e-commerce doesn't work. All the people know is they can sell
products while losing money on them. No one has figured out how to
sell products that make money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What advice do you have for people running start-ups?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's all a matter of your individual goals. If you want to
trade up into a company that you don't control, there's one way. In
my own career, I traded up and shouldn't have. I did not want to be
beholden and under the thumb of other people, even if it meant the
possibility of unlimited wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would you do differently?
</P>
<P>
   A: I shouldn't have expanded as fast. We grew twentyfold. We
went, in four months, from eight employees to 70. Revenue went up,
but losses did too. I took a profitable company making 15 percent
to 20 percent margins into a company that, in a year, lost $7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What reaction did you get from the subjects of your book?
</P>
<P>
   A: These guys were so shocked by the book. Never in their
wildest imaginations did they think that this would happen, that
someone would hold them up to the kind of ridicule I held them up
to. It was and is an incredibly sweet revenge. Of all the kinds of
things business people think, they don't think there are people who
will write about them in a completely honest, open and unexpurgated
way. It's quite possibly never happened before in the annals of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the biggest surprise?
</P>
<P>
   A: How much you could make and how much you could lose. And that
I would have been able to turn myself into a business guy. Really,
for me, to be a business guy, to have been able to step forward and
create the industry, meant that no one knew anything.

 &HT;    Part of Braves team warms up in Florida
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Like it or not, this spring training
figures to be short on suspense for the 1999 Atlanta Braves. Early
offseason activity by the Braves' front office has left the roster
nearly set, long before pitchers and catchers set foot in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Braves pitchers and catchers are due to report to camp today at
Disney's Wide World of Sports and will begin their workouts on
Thursday. The remaining players are scheduled to report Monday to
begin full-squad workouts on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves' offseason acquisitions of outfielders Brian
Jordan and Otis Nixon, second baseman Bret Boone and reliever Mike
Remlinger, there's not much room left for maneuvering when the
Braves break camp and cut the roster to 25 to start the season
April 5.
</P>
<P>
   The only obvious opening is in the bullpen, but only a couple
spots are up for grabs there. With the return of closer Kerry
Lightenberg, setup men John Rocker and Rudy Seanez and the addition
of Remlinger, four spots are all but locked up.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves two to be fought over by Mark Wohlers, who attempts
his comeback after a disastrous 1998; Russ Springer, who is at home
recovering from back surgery and doubtful to be ready by Opening
Day; Odaliz Perez, the 20-year-old left-hander who pitched his way
onto the 1998 postseason roster; and Mike Cather, who reports good
health as he attempts his comeback from rib-extraction surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a disastrous spring from rookie Bruce Chen, the Braves
starting pitching rotation figures to be as tough as ever, with
last season's Cy Young winner Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux as himself,
John Smoltz back with a healthy elbow and Millwood poised for his
second full season in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The only position player who appears to be under the microscope
is Ryan Klesko, but even so, the Braves would like to see what kind
of influence new hitting coach Don Baylor will have on him this
spring before they'd consider letting him go. If that's where the
noise is supposed to come, it might well be a quiet spring.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon and Gerald Williams will give Cox some other worthy
options in the outfield. Even the Braves bench already appears not
only set but solid, with Nixon and Williams, Keith Lockhart's
healthy return from shoulder surgery, Ozzie Guillen, Danny Bautista
and catcher Eddie Perez.
</P>
<P>
   What will be interesting to watch is the new mix of offensive
talent and how manager Bobby Cox plans to work Jordan and Boone
into the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into spring training Cox said he thought Jordan had the
talent and versatility to bat anywhere from second to fifth. Boone
has batted second but might be useful as low as the eighth hole.
Look for Cox to do a little mixing and matching when the exhibition
season opens on March 4.
</P>
<P>
   But for all intents and purposes, this spring training will be
mostly about tinkering. And for a club that hit a franchise-record
215 home runs and set a modern-day franchise record with 826 runs
in 1998, that's a considerable luxury.

 &HT;    Houston, L.A. vying for team
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barring potential snags, NFL owners will choose
between Los Angeles and Houston as their 32nd franchise during the
annual meetings next month in Phoenix. Identifying who will own the
team _ in what probably will be the final expansion franchise
awarded for the next 10-20 years _ figures to take a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear yet whether we'll choose an owner or simply
select the city and go to a bid process,'' Pittsburgh Steelers
owner Dan Rooney said after a four-hour session of the combined
finance and expansion committees held here.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Houston bid headed by Bob McNair already has
funding in place and is much further along than either of the
proposals from Los Angeles, the conventional wisdom is that NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue wants a team in the country's
second-largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Having a team in Los Angeles would give the NFL leverage when it
re-opens its television contracts after five years of the
eight-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The league does not seem sold yet on either of the men seeking a
team for Los Angeles, former Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz and
developer Ed Roski. The Roski group did gain some clout with the
recent addition of billionaire Eli Broad.
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle confronting the commissioner is that some owners
don't want the league to fund a stadium in the Los Angeles area.
Several league officials concede that they lack the votes for such
a move.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meetings will be held March 14-18.

 &HT;    COMPAQ OFFICIAL DEFENDS MICROSOFT'S CONDUCT
 &HT;    470&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite occasional disputes, Compaq and Microsoft
agree more often than not on what's best for the computer industry,
according to a key Compaq official's written testimony released
Tuesday in the Microsoft antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony is significant because several other executives at
Compaq Computer Corp. have submitted depositions accusing Microsoft
of using its Windows licensing contracts with computer markers to
stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq has not agreed with every position asserted by
Microsoft, nor has Microsoft always agreed with our views,'' John
Rose, senior vice president and group general manager of Compaq's
enterprise computing group, declared in his written testimony as a
Microsoft defense witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our two companies, however, have generally agreed on solutions
that have benefited customers and accommodated both our interests
and needs, and the computer industry as a whole,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Due to take the witness stand Wednesday, Rose will be the sole
outside industry executive to testify on behalf of Microsoft Corp.,
the world's largest software firm.
</P>
<P>
   Several Justice Department exhibits released earlier show that
Microsoft threatened to revoke Compaq's right to preload the
industry-standard Windows 95 operating system on its popular
Presario systems after Compaq revealed plans to remove the icon for
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser from Presario desktops.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose contends in his 17-page brief that Microsoft acted
within its legal rights because Houston-based Compaq, the world's
largest maker of personal computers, breached a verbal deal with
its Redmond, Wash., software partner that had been reached in
August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look back on the facts today, I do not believe that
Microsoft had anything to do with whether Compaq in 1996 was also
loading Netscape Navigator or any other non-Microsoft product onto
its Presario computers,'' Rose wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That testimony could weigh heavily in reaching a verdict. The
government holds that Microsoft has illegally used its vast Windows
market power in seeking to dominate Internet commerce, focusing on
Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser as a prime
target. Earlier, Netscape boss Jim Barksdale had accused Microsoft
in court of harassing Compaq because it wanted to preload Navigator
on some Presario models in place of Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose explained that Compaq had removed the desktop icon for
Internet Explorer under an accord with America Online Inc.
stipulating that only AOL's Internet icons would be placed in that
prime showcase. That agreement, Rose said, needed to be revised to
quash Microsoft's objections.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom Tuesday, the government played a videotape in a
bid to show that the curbs Microsoft places on AOL make it
difficult for consumers to download Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's own video, shown to U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson last week, glossed over the full capture process,
which Microsoft's lawyers said took just 10 minutes, ``to save
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government tape showed the procedure could take an hour
or longer, depending on the speed of the Internet link. For his
part, Jackson appeared perplexed, confessing to a ``conceptual
problem'' with the multifold downloading routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not nearly as easy as their video portrayed it to be,''
David Boies, the government's lead lawyer, said outside court.
``They clearly were trying to shorten the tape.''

   CARVILLE, La. _ The gate is open now. Residents come and go as
they please. But there was a time when snatches of freedom _ to
catch a ballgame or make a phone call _ meant slipping through a
hole in the fence and risking 30 days in a lockup. Sixty days for
the second offense.
</P>
<P>
   Within the 330 acres bounded by barbed wire, generations of
residents printed a magazine, earned Boy Scout merit badges,
produced plays, held their own Mardi Gras, authored books, fell in
love and conceived children they were forbidden to raise.
</P>
<P>
   Most are elderly now, the last 73 patients of the only long-term
care center in the continental United States for Hansen's disease,
traditionally known as leprosy. In 1951, its peak year, the
Carville complex housed 480.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government intends to close the Gillis W. Long
Hansen's Disease Center in three years, turning out those who
remain. Last year, 45 residents accepted $33,000 annual
``stipends'' _ double for married couples _ and moved away. The
site will be handed back to Louisiana, whose National Guard will
run a job-training boot camp for at-risk youths.
</P>
<P>
   At Carville, all are cured but many continue to suffer from the
physical damage _ facial deformities, clawed hands and circulation
problems _ incurred before effective treatment was discovered. Then
there are old-age infirmities and a psychological dependency
nurtured by decades of institutionalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a world of its own,'' said Texas-born Johnny Harmon,
87, who came to Carville as a young man for two lengthy stays and
finally returned in 1992 with his wife, Anne, whom he had met and
married when both were patients. She arrived at age 10 after
neighbors burned her family's home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have come voluntarily, but I lived a fuller life
than if I hadn't,'' said Harmon. Easily Carville's least shy
resident, he tools around in a motorized wheelchair with a large,
hand-lettered sign affixed to the back, advertising his 184-page,
self-published memoir, now in its fourth printing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of lonesome around here now,'' Harmon said of the
departure of more than a third of the residents between August and
late October.
</P>
<P>
   Like others who stayed, he adamantly opposes leaving _ even with
a generous and tax-free living allowance of $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' snapped Harmon, once a draftsman with the
Texas highway department who became a professional photographer at
Carville. ``It's really depressing. They'll have to take me out in
a box.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't take the offer, assisted-living quarters are
expected to be found in Baton Rouge, 26 miles to the north, where
the Carville complex will eventually relocate as a scaled-back
clinic, said Julia Elwood, its spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Elwood arrived as a frightened 16-year-old patient from the
small South Texas town of Elsa. After being cured through a series
of sulfone drug injections, graduating college and teaching school,
she returned as a staff member, the first to do so.
</P>
<P>
   None of the residents now carries the leprosy bacteria, whose
mode of transmission still perplexes researchers. It is not a
venereal disease, but specialists believe _ but cannot prove _ it
spreads through skin-to-skin contact, inhalation of
bacteria-containing droplets and, in some Southern states, handling
armadillos.
</P>
<P>
   However transmitted, it's done so with difficulty. Ninety to 95
percent of people are naturally immune. (Only one Carville employee
ever contracted the disease, a power-house worker who did not come
in contact with patients.) The international medical community
recognized in 1956 that there no longer was any need to quarantine
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Today, less than two weeks' outpatient treatment with a cocktail
of antibiotics removes the threat of contagion.
</P>
<P>
   Although leprosy sounds like something out of antiquity _ or a
``Ben Hur'' rerun _ there are 690,000 new cases a year around the
world. It is now called Hansen's disease _ after the Norwegian
scientist who discovered the rod-shaped bacteria _ to differentiate
it from the vague but damning biblical references to leprosy as a
divine curse on the sinful and unclean.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a cure was discovered in the mid-1940s by Carville
researchers, the social stigma endured.
</P>
<P>
   For years, patients were encouraged to take assumed names to
spare their families embarrassment and ostracism back home.
</P>
<P>
   Even after forcible detention ended in 1957, they built their
own society and, at times, an aggressive cohesiveness. They
successfully campaigned to oust one unpopular director and tried to
push out another.

CLINTON, HATCH REKINDLE FIGHT OVER HEAD OF CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Sen. Orrin Hatch on Tuesday
rekindled an old battle over the acting head of Justice
Department's civil rights division, Bill Lann Lee, whom Republicans
accuse of favoring racial preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged
Clinton not to renominate Lee, whose bid for the post of assistant
attorney general for civil rights has been blocked twice but who
nonetheless has been heading the division since December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Lee's tenure, the Justice Department has advocated the
same policies that initially led to his failure to be confirmed as
assistant attorney general,'' Hatch said in a statement. ``The
Senate has already considered the nomination of Bill Lann Lee for
this position.''
</P>
<P>
   However, White House officials immediately confirmed that the
president will nominate him within a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes that Mr. Lee has done an excellent
job,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, adding that Lee's
opponents had a ``demonstrable lack of knowledge of his
background.''
</P>
<P>
   When first nominated in 1997, Lee encountered heavy criticism
from conservatives who charged that he was a zealous promoter of
racial preferences in affirmative action cases.
</P>
<P>
   Following an acrimonious debate, Democrats in the Senate
Judiciary Committee blocked a vote, figuring Lee's bid was destined
to fail. Because Lee was not actually voted down by the committee,
the White House retained the option of installing him as acting
director _ and did so on Dec. 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent Lee's name to the Senate again in January 1998, but
this time the Republican majority refused to schedule a hearing on
his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's announcement came on the heels of the release of a
report by former Attorney General Edwin Meese and two conservative
legal watchdog groups accusing Lee of pursuing racial and ethnic
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mr. Lee is doing is a flagrant violation of the
Constitution,'' said Meese, who served in the Ronald Reagan
administration, at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Bolick, litigation director for the Institute for Justice,
a conservative legal advocacy group, said Lee's record at the civil
rights division had confirmed ``all of the worst fears raised by
critics of his nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report assessing Lee's first year, Bolick and Roger Clegg,
general counsel for the Center for Equal Opportunity, an
anti-affirmative-action think tank, asserted that Lee has pushed
race-conscious practices in employment, contracts, voting and
education.
</P>
<P>
   One example cited in the report was Lee's support of a 1995
lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against the city of
Torrance, Calif. In that case, the civil rights division argued
that the city's written tests to evaluate applicants for police and
firefighter positions discriminated against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the lawsuit was rejected by U.S. District Court Judge
Mariana R. Pfaelzer, who called it ``frivolous, unreasonable and
without foundation'' and awarded the city $1.8 million for
attorneys' fees.
</P>
<P>
   The department filed a similar police and firefighter suit in
1997 against Garland, Texas. That case continues to be fought in a
federal district court.
</P>
<P>
   Clegg said that ``the head of the civil rights division should
not be someone who believes that an American's civil rights depends
on his skin color or where his ancestors came from.''
</P>
<P>
   But Christine DiBartolo, spokeswoman for the division, said Lee
has not pushed ``racial quotas'' and has ``always operated within
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBartolo said only about ``1 or 2 percent'' of the division's
resources are devoted to affirmative action cases and that Lee
should be judged as well on his work in other areas such fighting
housing discrimination and upholding the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senate Republicans should focus on the whole job, not just
affirmative action,'' she said.

<P>
   Several Justice Department exhibits released earlier show that
Microsoft threatened to revoke Compaq's right to preload the
industry-standard Windows 95 operating system on its popular
Presario systems after Compaq revealed plans to remove the icon for
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser from Presario desktops.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose contends in his 17-page brief that Microsoft acted
within its legal rights because Houston-based Compaq, the world's
largest maker of personal computers, breached a verbal deal with
its Redmond, Wash., software partner that had been reached in
August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look back on the facts today, I do not believe that
Microsoft had anything to do with whether Compaq in 1996 was also
loading Netscape Navigator or any other non-Microsoft product onto
its Presario computers,'' Rose wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That testimony could weigh heavily in reaching a verdict. The
government holds that Microsoft has illegally used its vast Windows
market power in seeking to dominate Internet commerce, focusing on
Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser as a prime
target. Earlier, Netscape boss Jim Barksdale had accused Microsoft
in court of harassing Compaq because it wanted to preload Navigator
on some Presario models in place of Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose explained that Compaq had removed the desktop icon for
Internet Explorer under an accord with America Online Inc.
stipulating that only AOL's Internet icons would be placed in that
prime showcase. That agreement, Rose said, needed to be revised to
quash Microsoft's objections.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom Tuesday, the government played a videotape in a
bid to show that the curbs Microsoft places on AOL make it
difficult for consumers to download Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's own video, shown to U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson last week, glossed over the full capture process,
which Microsoft's lawyers said took just 10 minutes, ``to save
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government tape showed the procedure could take an hour
or longer, depending on the speed of the Internet link. For his
part, Jackson appeared perplexed, confessing to a ``conceptual
problem'' with the multifold downloading routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not nearly as easy as their video portrayed it to be,''
David Boies, the government's lead lawyer, said outside court.
``They clearly were trying to shorten the tape.''

 &HT;    CNN, WebMD form alliance
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Expect to be hearing a lot more from WebMD, the
Atlanta-based health information portal. Tuesday, the company
announced a wide-ranging strategic alliance with CNN News Groups.
</P>
<P>
   While WebMD has devoted much of its time and resources to
developing an online service for physicians, the CNN alliance is a
strategic step in the attempt to drive traffic to its consumer
service. The company also has deals with the online service,
CompuServe, to provide content primarily to professional users.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal call for CNN and WebMD to exchange online
content. WebMD will receive on-air and online promotion across the
CNN News Group, including all CNN cable and radio networks as well
as CNN Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD has also committed to a three-year multi-million
advertising deal that will make WebMD one of CNN's largest
advertisers. And CNN will also take what it terms ``a modest equity
stake'' in the growing health care portal for consumers and
physicians. The size of that stake was not revealed.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD filed for an initial public offering Jan. 28. It will have
to refile the IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission
because of CNN's new equity stake. Neither CNN nor WebMD would
discuss details of the deal, citing SEC quiet period regulations.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD (http://www.webmd.com) offers online health information
free to consumers and for a $29.95 charge to practicing physicians.
The company is a ``vertical portal'' _ online lingo that means it
provides specialized health news and information from a variety of
sources. Founder Jeff Arnold said that before deciding to join
forces with CNN, the company did some research of its own showing
that more than half of all physicians say CNN is their No. 1 source
for news.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold wants to attract more doctors to the WebMD site, but he
says the CNN alliance will raise consumer awareness of the company
and its offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a vertical medical portal and early on we decided to
build a focused message to physicians that WebMD is an Internet
site that will help them save time and cut costs within their
practice. We've worked hard in the last several months to get that
message out.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he says the company is working equally hard to raise
awareness of WebMD's consumer offerings _ and that's where CNN
comes in. ``To raise consumer awareness, we needed a broadcast
partner,'' he says. ``We are big believers that there will be
convergence of TV and the Internet, eventually in terms of high
speed access but for now in terms of awareness alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a serious topic and it has to be comprehensive and
extremely trusted. When we looked out to see who we should
approach, it was evident very early on that CNN was the perfect
match. It's one of the world's most trusted brands and we think
news and health are very similar topics. We want to be viewed by
consumers and physicians as a company that takes health information
very seriously. That's very important to us and we are always
looking for partners who can validate that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He also says the CNN deal is part of the company's first attempt
to build out its consumer strategy. ``WebMD hopes to bring the
entire health care industry online. We think that you have to
target both doctors and consumers to be successful.'' Arnold says
today's announcement is a strong indication the company is
aggressively targeting the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said the multifaceted relationship with CNN is broader
than similar deals in the past. ``We are telling consumers there's
a place (for health information) they can trust. CNN helps us
validate that claim.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world of billions of bytes of information, people need
information they can trust,'' said Tom Johnson, president and chief
executive of CNN News Group. ``In the last 18 years, we have become
one of the most trusted brands in news and WebMD is equally
well-respected and will stand for information that can be trusted,
which is a key factor particularly when you are dealing with health
information.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning April 1, CNN viewers will hear of WebMD on all the CNN
cable channels, while visitors to CNN.com will have access to WebMD
content. ``They'll offer the depth we don't have,'' said Rob
Tillison, CNN senior vice president of business development. ``When
we end (an on-air piece), we'll have a tagline send people to our
Web site in association with WebMD.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN in any one day will air 32 health-related stories across
their networks,'' Arnold says. ``CNN provides the breaking news and
WebMD is providing the depth and the personalization tools to help
consumers go deeper.''

TURKEY SAYS IT HAS CAPTURED KURDISH REBEL CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KURD-PROTESTS, KURD-LEADER) 
(bl) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turkey announced that its most-wanted
fugitive, Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan, whose army has
been fighting for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, was
captured in Kenya and flown to Turkey early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, whose 14-year war has cost the lives of an estimated
30,000 rebels, soldiers and civilians, has been sought by Turkish
authorities for more than a decade. He is likely to be tried for
treason and mass murder, and could face execution.
</P>
<P>
   It was uncertain what effect Ocalan's arrest would have on his
guerrilla force, called the Kurdistan Workers Party, or on the
civil conflict that has cost Turkey billions of dollars and
severely damaged its image abroad. The conflict has come to
dominate Turkish life and has been used to justify measures ranging
from limiting freedom of expression to burning villages in combat
zones.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders gave no details of how Ocalan was captured, but
officials and other people close to the government said a team of
Turkish commandos had snatched him away from Greek diplomats, who
had been sheltering him for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was being escorted to the airport in Nairobi,'' said an
official close to the Turkish intelligence service. ``His Greek
escorts lost the car in traffic, and he never made the flight. Some
special operations guys figured out where he was and intercepted
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grabbing a car that's being watched by a couple of Greek
diplomats is a piece of cake for a special-operations team in a
country like Kenya,'' added the official, who, like others who
discussed the case, spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Turkey
has very good special-operations people _ state of the art. This is
one of the biggest things they've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   A different account was offered by a lawyer for Ocalan and a
Kenyan guard at the Greek ambassador's residence, the Associated
Press reported. The guard said men in Kenyan government vehicles
entered the compound and forcibly removed three men Monday evening,
although he was uncertain whether they included Ocalan. The guard
said the men were forced into a vehicle, which sped off in a convoy
that included the Greek ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Britta Boehler, citing accounts by witnesses, was
quoted as saying from the Netherlands that Ocalan, ``did not leave
voluntarily'' and that ``he was physically dragged out.''
</P>
<P>
   News of Ocalan's capture set off violent protests in European
capitals, where Kurds invaded Greek and Kenyan diplomatic missions
to protest what they believed to be those countries' roles in
turning him over to Turkey. It became clear later Tuesday, however,
that in all probability neither country had cooperated in the
operation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Kurdish prisoner in a Turkish jail burned himself to death to
protest the capture, and military units in southeastern provinces
were placed on alert.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's arrest was announced by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit at a midday news conference in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   ``The head of the separatist organization has been in Turkey
since 3 o'clock this morning,'' Ecevit said, beaming and apparently
struggling to control his emotions. ``He will account for his
activities before the Turkish justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of some Turks, Ocalan's capture may be seen as
Turkey's most spectacular success since it landed troops on Cyprus
in 1974 in what it described as an effort to protect the Turkish
minority there. Ecevit was also prime minister then, and he could
reap considerable benefit from a new image as a two-time winner.
</P>
<P>
   Turks are scheduled to go the polls April 18 for a national
election. Ecevit, who began his current term barely a month ago and
had been seen as only an interim figure, suddenly seems in a much
stronger position.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ambassadors were summoned to the Turkish Foreign
Ministry for an official briefing after Ocalan's capture was
announced, and they were told that the government intends to use
his trial to show its respect for legal formalities. Ecevit has
long portrayed himself as an advocate for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they're going to be under scrutiny, and they want to
do their utmost to be scrupulously fair,'' said an ambassador who
attended the briefing. ``People around Ecevit are going even
further. They see this as a way to break the stalemate on human
rights altogether, to push through reforms that the system has been
resisting.''
</P>
<P>
   Several European leaders encouraged Turkey to seize this
opportunity to improve its image and to make substantial
improvements in human-rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the trial to respect all the guarantees of the rule
of law, and particularly to respect European standards of
fundamental rights,'' said Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
in a statement. ``We believe that if Turkey behaves in accordance
with European standards, that will help it get closer to the
European Union.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Ocalan lived semi-clandestinely in Syria from about 1980 until
last October. Late that month, after Turkish commanders made
several threats to attack Syria if it did not expel him, he fled.
</P>
<P>
   He turned up first in Russia and then in Italy. Turkish leaders
demanded his extradition, but Italy refused on the grounds that its
constitution forbids sending suspects to countries where the death
penalty is in force. Furious Turks launched protests that ranged
from boycotting Italian goods to burning Italian flags.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Ocalan was reported to have left Italy, and his
whereabouts since then had been uncertain. Earlier this month he
spent several days flying around Western Europe seeking a haven,
but found none.
</P>
<P>
   After that episode, he disappeared again. According to
information provided Tuesday by Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya
Godana, he landed secretly in Nairobi and was sheltered by Greek
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Godana said at a news conference that the Greek ambassador in
Nairobi, George Costoulas, had ``engaged in conduct which
definitely cannot be said within the purview of what a diplomat is
supposed to do.'' Hours later, Kenya demanded that the Greek
government recall him.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kenyan authorities learned that Ocalan was hiding in a
Greek Embassy building, Godana said, they demanded that he be
expelled immediately. It was at that point that the drive late
Monday night to Nairobi's airport was hastily arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish news reports said Tuesday that Ocalan apparently was to
have been taken from Kenya to Greece, but Godana said there was
``some talk of sending him to the Seychelles.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he knew that Ocalan would end up in Turkey, Godana
replied: ``We did not have the slightest suspicion this was a
possibility. There is no way we would have approved such a move.''
</P>
<P>
   Greek Foreign Minister Theodore Pangalos confirmed that Greek
diplomats had sheltered Ocalan in Kenya, but denied that he had
been under their protection on his way to the airport. ``He chose,
despite our advice, to go with the Kenyan authorities to the
airport,'' Pangalos said in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   In some quarters, Ocalan is viewed as leader of a liberation
movement fighting for the rights of Turkey's estimated 8 to 10
million Kurds. The government, however, portrays him as a ruthless
terrorist for whom no tactic has been too gruesome or horrific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ocalan was not fit, either as a person or by his leadership
style, to be the head of a major political organization,'' said
Dogu Ergil, director of the Foundation for the Research of Societal
Problems, which seeks to resolve conflicts in Turkish society. ``He
was a dictator and a factional leader more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We Turks think since we have captured him, we have gotten rid
of the Kurdish problem as well, which is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Ergil added: ``If the Kurdish grievance is not eradicated by
economic development, political democracy and the rule of law,
Kurds will create another organization with more modern leaders who
are closer to Europe and better adapted to the European style of
politics. That would be quite a problem for Turkey.''

CAPTURED REBEL LEADER HURT, MORE THEN HELPED, KURDS' CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ One of the greatest modern tragedies for the
hapless Kurds, who have been oppressed, exploited and slaughtered
by dozens of regimes over the centuries, may have been the rise of
Abdullah Ocalan as their revolutionary leader.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, whose return to Turkey as a prisoner Tuesday seems to
have ended his 14-year career as a guerrilla leader, is by most
accounts dogmatic and tyrannical. Many Turkish Kurds have followed
him, and some still consider him to be their only authentic leader.
In the eyes of much of the world, however, he has done as much as
anyone to discredit their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people with whom Ocalan formed the Kurdistan Workers
Party in the 1970s were later killed, some of them tortured to
death, on his orders _ or they fled to live clandestinely in
Europe. He branded them as traitors after they challenged him or
pressed for more democracy within the revolutionary movement.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan was able to build his party into a strong guerrilla
movement in the late 1980s in part because the Turkish government
did not allow any Kurdish organizations to exist legally. With no
moderates to follow, many Kurds turned to him despite their doubts
about his tactics and personal traits.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has encouraged a strong personality cult, Ocalan
(pronounced OH-ja-lan) is not believed to have fought in a single
engagement with Turkish troops, preferring the safety of exile in
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   His group has thrived largely because of support from foreign
powers. It was first subsidized by the Soviet Union, which
encouraged all movements that might weaken Turkey. Later it was
adopted by Syria. According to Turkish officials, it has also
received various forms of backing from Greece and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish exiles in Europe have contributed millions of dollars to
his movement, some of it voluntarily and the rest under threat.
Prosecutors in several European countries have asserted that the
organization also operates lucrative heroin-smuggling rings.
</P>
<P>
   Violence became such an integral part of the group's operations
in Europe that the Swedish police spent years investigating claims
that it was behind the assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme.
The claims were never proven.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, Ocalan's movement had won at least nighttime
control over large parts of eastern Turkey. It appointed local
officials, collected taxes and administered its own justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at this success, the Turkish government launched a
savage counterinsurgency campaign during which many Kurdish
villages were burned and many suspected rebel sympathizers were
tortured or killed or disappeared. This campaign was a devastating
military success, but it also brought a great political victory to
the Kurdistan Workers Party by allowing it to portray the Turkish
military as savagely repressive.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan was born into a peasant family with six children in a
village on the Syrian border. He became a left-wing militant during
his university years in Ankara, where he studied politics. He was
imprisoned for seven months in 1972 for ``pro-Kurd activities.'' He
has led the Kurdistan Workers' Party since 1978, when he created
the Marxist-oriented party with a group of fellow students.

<P>
   He fled Turkey prior to the September 1980 military coup and has
since lived in exile. On August 15, 1984, he launched his armed
struggle against Turkey, choosing arms over talks for the Kurdish
cause so as not to ``waste time with political debates.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote editorials in the pro-Kurd newspaper Ozgur Ulke prior
to its suspension in 1995, and then began broadcasting on the
London-based satellite channel MED-TV beaming directly to Turkish
Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 20 million Kurds in eastern Turkey and
nearby regions of other countries. They are native to the region
and were already there when the Turks arrived from Central Asia
about 1,000 years ago. The Kurds are said to be the largest group
that has never had a state of their own.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Ocalan has made several peace overtures to the
Turkish government. All have been rejected. Advocating negotiations
with his party is a criminal offense here.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Turkish authorities have finally caught the man
they have demonized for so long, some Turks are wondering if the
political climate will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tons of Kurds who I believe are prepared to play the
pluralist game, recognizing that separatist and secessionist
agendas are a downhill slippery slope to chaos, pain and
violence,'' said Kemal Kirisci, author of a recent book on Turkey's
Kurdish dilemma. ``This could finally be the occasion of Turkey
reaching maturity and finally embarking on the path its people
deserve.''

MACWORLD DECIDES TO STAY IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Organizers of the MacWorld Expo Tuesday say the fabled
computer show will stay in New York City this summer rather than
return to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Show sponsor IDG Expo Management of Norwood, Mass. has canceled
its August reservations at Boston's World Trade Center, saying the
facility is too small. The company will instead hold MacWorld at
New York City's Jacob Javits Center for the second year, a decision
that could cost Boston $20 million in convention-related revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Boston had hosted the summer MacWorld for
years. The event was one of the city's biggest conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas Menino expressed disappointment at Boston's loss of
the show, citing it as further proof that Boston needs the huge new
convention center set to begin construction next year. ``When we
have our convention center on-line, things like that will not
happen in the future,'' Menino said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Derany , show director for IDG Expo Management said the
trade center was simply too small, forcing the company to hold many
MacWorld events at other venues, such as the Hynes Convention
Center. ``The Javits Center is better equipped to host the event
for us,'' said Derany. ``It has more space for us and it's all
under one roof.''
</P>
<P>
   IDG expressed doubts about sticking with Boston several weeks
ago, in the aftermath of its successful MacWorld show in San
Francisco last month. Nearly 70,000 people attended the show, up
from 68,000 the previous year, and there was also an increase in
the number of computer companies exhibiting Apple-related products.
</P>
<P>
   The East Coast edition of MacWorld was held at Javits last
summer, but weak attendance numbers led IDG to announce last year
that the show would return to Boston. But since then, Apple has
enjoyed a dramatic renaissance after years of falling sales and
financial losses. The success of Apple's iMac computer has given
the firm new momentum, and IDG expects continued growth in MacWorld
visitors and exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Boston's convention industry worked on alternative
proposals to satisfy the show's needs, only to fall short. One plan
called for the erection of huge computer-shaped tents in the
parking lot of the World Trade Center, to provide additional space.
But IDG wouldn't bite.
</P>
<P>
   World Trade Center president John Drew said that the decision
was mainly based not on a lack of space in Boston, but by Apple's
desire to hold MacWorld in the nation's chief financial center.
``They simply wanted to be in New York,'' said Drew. ``They wanted
to be closer to Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   But IDG's Derany said that her firm, not Apple, operates
MacWorld and was entirely responsible for the decision to return to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge disappointment and it's a huge loss for the
region's visitor economy,'' said Patrick Moscaritolo, president of
the Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``On the other
hand it also points out the need for the new convention center
that's being built down there in the seaport district.''
</P>
<P>
   The $700 million convention center won't begin construction
until next year and won't be finished until late 2003. Therefore,
said Moscaritolo, it's unlikely that IDG will bring MacWorld back
to Boston before 2004. Derany said that arrangements for next
year's MacWorld have not been completed, but IDG is in discussions
with the Javits Center to arrange a third New York show.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Menino said that the financial loss to Boston is far
outweighed by other major events coming to the area, including
baseball's All-Star Game and the Ryder Cup golf tournament.
``They're more valuable to us than MacWorld,'' he said.

BREWER TO REINTRODUCE PICKWICK ALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hoping to recapture some of the explosive growth that
microbreweries enjoyed during the early 1990s, the maker of Harpoon
beer will reintroduce Pickwick Ale Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pickwick was a beer popular in Eastern Massachusetts for much of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   The brand's re-emergence after a roughly 25-year absence is the
result of a licensing agreement between Mass. Bay Brewing Co. of
Boston, which makes and markets Harpoon along the East Coast, and
the Haffenreffer family, which for many years produced Pickwick at
breweries in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The family sold Pickwick in 1964, and it was later marketed
briefly by two other other companies, said Ted Haffenreffer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a long absence from the local scene, the brand continues
to be admired, and ``Pickwick paraphernalia'' can still be found in
many area tap rooms, said Mass. Bay chief executive Richard Doyle,
who cofounded Mass. Bay in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Though the beer recipe may be modified a bit, Pickwick has ``a
nostalgia-icon quality to it,'' Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Most craft-brewers, including Harpoon, could use a boost.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, sales for such brands as Samuel Adams,
Pete's Wicked Ale, and Harpoon surged wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Though tiny, these brands took enough business away from brewing
giants to keep the big companies' beer sales flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the early 1980s, beer consumption has been growing at
only about a half a percentage point a year,'' said Benj Steinman,
editor of Beer Marketer's Insights. The $70 billion US beer
business has been ``pretty much a market share game,'' with brewers
trying to take customers away from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for microbrewers, the momentum of the early 1990s
has ``stalled out'' as consumers have lately turned to such
imported beers as Corona and Heineken, Steinman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to drink something that's familiar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pickwick is certainly somewhat familiar, and it offers another
advantage: In terms of store prices, it could find a niche between
upscale microbrews and mid-priced Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   With a suggested retail-price range of $4.99 to $5.49, a
six-pack of Pickwick bottles should cost 50 cents less than a
six-pack of Harpoon and 50 cents more than Budweiser, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately owned Mass. Bay does not disclose earnings; it
declined to elaborate on details of its Pickwick licensing
agreement. Last year, it produced 55,000 barrels of beer.

 &HT;    ARMY TRUCKS LATE, OVER BUDGET AND RUSTY
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Army purchased thousands of trucks that
were delivered years behind schedule and $100 million over budget,
and whose cabs began rusting even before the vehicles left the
plant, a government report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations are the latest for one of the biggest and
least-noticed military acquisition programs, the Army's effort to
replace its entire aging fleet of medium-sized trucks at a total
cost of $15.7 billion over 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office (GAO), the investigating arm of
Congress, criticized the Defense Department for selecting Stewart &AMP;
Stevenson Services Inc., a Houston-based company, for the work in
1991. The report said the company had little or no experience in
building trucks or combat vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart &AMP; Stevenson's speciality had been gas turbine generators
and aircraft ground support equipment, the report said. The company
enlisted the aid of an Austrian truck maker for the prototype, and
then set up a manufacturing plant in an old oil-drilling equipment
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, production has fallen far behind schedule. The first
Army unit received its new trucks in January 1996, two years later
than planned. Congress and the Defense Department then decided to
extend the $1.2 billion contract with the Houston company by three
years. The GAO said the extension would add $85 million to the
contract and cost the Army $22 million in repairs on old trucks
that had been slated for replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, despite a requirement that the new trucks be designed
to prevent corrosion for at least the first 10 years of service,
the first 4,955 trucks were so rust-prone that many had holes in
the cabs in less than three years. Rather than require the
manufacturer to replace all the cabs at a cost of $31 million, the
Army let it make repairs and offer a warranty worth no more than
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure who should get most of the blame, the
contractor, the Pentagon or even Congress,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, who requested the study. ``One thing, however, is for sure
_ the American taxpayers are paying more than they should for this
military truck program.''
</P>
<P>
   Messages left with the Houston headquarters and Washington
office of Stewart &AMP; Stevenson were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department conceded that it had identified ``lessons
learned.'' In its written response to the GAO, the Pentagon said
improvements had been made, and added, ``we are confident that the
fielded vehicles will economically provide the required service
life.''

CITING `CAMPAIGN' AGAINST GERMANY, CHANCELLOR PLANS FUND FOR
VICTIMS OF NAZIS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating for all needing)   (fe) 
 By ROGER COHEN 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany announced on
Tuesday that a fund, projected to amount to $1.7 billion, would be
created and financed by 12 German companies to compensate victims
of the Nazis and end what he called ``the campaign being led
against German industry and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, in the presence of some of Germany's top
executives, was clearly aimed at stopping a wave of lawsuits in
American courts against German companies that used slave labor and
forced labor during World War II. But Schroeder's choice of words
appeared unlikely to calm the waters.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor, who took office last October and has been
struggling to stamp his authority on the government, said a main
function of the fund was ``to counter lawsuits, particularly class
action suits, and to remove the basis of the campaign being led
against German industry and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor did not say who was behind the ``campaign''
against Germany, but his suggestion appeared comparable to the
response of some Swiss officials who said they saw a darkly
orchestrated anti-Swiss movement in the legal actions by Holocaust
survivors against Swiss banks that ultimately led to a $1.25
billion settlement signed last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an inadequate and embarrassing statement,'' said
Michael Witti, a Munich-based lawyer for tens of thousands of
plaintiffs in the suits already brought. ``It is not a question of
campaigns by anybody. It is a question of Holocaust victims' rights
that have been denied by these corporations for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's statement, in which firmness mingled with remorse,
appeared to catch the ambivalent mood of a Germany anxious to put
the past behind it, irritated over what some intellectuals have
called the ``popularization'' of the Holocaust, yet still conscious
of its inescapable historical responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, the German government has paid
out about $80 billion in war reparations and aid, most of it to
Jews who survived concentration camps or fled.
</P>
<P>
   But forced laborers _ people, generally non-Jews, deported to
Germany mainly from Eastern European countries including Poland and
Russia _ have not often been compensated. Nor has a far smaller
category of slave laborers _ some Jewish, some not _ who were put
to work in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the ``Remembrance, Responsibility and the
Future'' fund is intended to answer the ``moral responsibility of
German firms with regard to such issues as forced laborers,
Aryanization and other injustice during the Nazi regime,'' said
Schroeder, who was speaking in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   Its aim is thus broad. The term ``Aryanization'' refers to the
takeover, often with derisory payments or none at all, of Jewish
property in Germany. Many Jewish survivors are now seeking
compensation for these acts.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder did not specify the amount of the fund, but officials
here provided the rough estimate of about three billion German
marks, equal to about $1.7 billion. The chancellor said payments
should start ``very quickly, if possible before Sept. 1, 1999'' in
view of the advanced age of many of the people involved.
</P>
<P>
   Witti said the sum of $1.7 billion, if accurate, was substantial
but inadequate. He estimated that there were about 1.6 million
World War survivors who could qualify for compensation under the
fund, each of whom might then receive about $1,000, if payments
were equal.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish government has said there are more than 500,000
surviving forced laborers in Poland alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is clearly right is the idea that payments should be made
against formal abandonment of all class-action suits,'' the lawyer
said. ``German industry must know that when it's over, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's statement said that ``the governments of the United
States and Israel welcome this initiative as a positive and
courageous answer by German companies to their moral
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But American officials said privately that they were surprised
by the timing of the statement. ``We don't really know what to make
of it,'' one said. ``There are some raised eyebrows.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eugene Dubow, the head of the American Jewish Committee in
Germany, said, ``If Schroeder thinks there is a campaign against
Germany, perhaps he does not totally understand the issue of people
waiting 50 years for justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, aware of the potential impact of the
suits on German-American relations, has followed the issue closely.
The announcement came after protracted negotiations led by Bodo
Hombach, Schroeder's chief of staff, and Stuart Eizenstat, the
State Department under secretary for business and economic affairs.
Eizenstat is expected in Germany next week.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 companies that announced their participation in the fund
on Tuesday are: DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Siemens,
Volkswagen, Hoechst, Dresdner Bank, Krupp, Allianz, BASF, Bayer,
BMW and Degussa. The list _ encompassing auto making, banking,
chemical production, insurance and other industrial sectors _
covers many of Germany's top industrial names. They invited other
companies to join them.
</P>
<P>
   At a time that German companies have been on a buying spree
overseas _ last year the auto manufacturer Chrysler and the
publisher Random House were both acquired by German companies _ the
slave-labor question has been particularly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is still trying to complete the purchase of
Bankers Trust, the financial services company. But the acquisition
has met some resistance in the United States, pending clarification
of slave-labor and other issues. The German bank said this month
that it had helped to finance Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Breuer, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, was with
Schroeder on Tuesday. He said the fund amounted to a ``large step
in the right direction, but there are still a lot of details to
sort out.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the details is the planned establishment of a German
federal fund alongside the one financed by the companies. It is not
clear how large it might be. Schroeder's statement said, ``A
suitable link with the companies' initiative must now be found.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies said part of the fund would be used to compensate
slave laborers and other victims and part to finance
``forward-looking projects on the basis of understanding of the
Nazi past.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest to find a balance between remembrance and
forward-looking themes has become something of a German obsession
of late, affecting a still unresolved debate over a Holocaust
Memorial in Berlin, the new capital.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the discussions lies an evident German thirst to be
``normal'' and embrace the future in a country where the vast
majority of people alive today played no role in the Holocaust.

CARVILLE, La.: push out another. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, the Patients Federation opposes stipend-takers returning
to use Carville's subsidized facilities, which include a hair salon
and a canteen that sells tax-free cigarettes, discount beer and
such exotic fare as pickled pig lips. The Federation's leader, a
Colombian-born nun, declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residents didn't want those who left to come back and harvest
the pecans,'' said Dr. Bruce Clements, 70, the center's clinical
director. ``I don't think it's very Christian of them. They don't
want them in the cafeteria anymore. I guess it's jealousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents fondly recall the U.S. Public Health Service
administrators who lifted penallike restrictions that persisted
years after sulfone drugs proved effective. They closed the jail,
eased the issuance of passes, lifted a ban on social contacts
between patients and staff, and permitted weddings on the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as far as Washington is concerned, Carville has outlived
its usefulness. There is now no medical need to keep treated
patients apart from society. And the $15.6 million annual budget
has made it a costly white elephant to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're victims of our own success,'' said Bunny Harriman, a
Corsicana, Texas, native who is chief social worker at Carville.
``But it's still painful for the very old, staid and entrenched
people. This place is their home, and to have their home threatened
is a sad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, relatively younger patients took the stipend offer

   The state of Louisiana purchased the antebellum Indian Camp
Plantation in 1894 after a newspaper series exposed deplorable
conditions endured by leprosy victims in New Orleans. The new
site's conditions were little better until a Catholic order, the
Sisters of Charity, arrived to bolster the sole doctor. Its
smiling, energetic nuns in simple blue habits are still here today
but don't know where they'll go when the center closes.
</P>
<P>
   A one-room museum on the grounds shows how the complex evolved
from one main house and a few huts to more than 100 buildings and a
golf course. On display are crude iron shackles that incoming
patients once were forced to wear and a wicker basket in which
newborn children were carried out, some to an adoption center in
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1921, the U.S. Public Health Service took over and began
accepting patients from all over the nation and many foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Patients included naval officers, debutantes, homemakers,
cowboys, laborers, musicians, pharmacists, watchmakers, tailors,
lawyers, Protestant ministers, Catholic priests, a rabbi and a
former prizefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Before the mid-1940s, their freedom of movement beyond the fence
was tightly controlled. One man was jailed for sneaking out to
vote, Harmon recalled.
</P>
<P>
   There were suicides and, Harmon said, at least one murder.
</P>
<P>
   A love triangle led to deadly gunplay, he said. ``But after the
trial, the guilty man was sent back to Carville,'' Harmon said.
``They didn't want him in prison.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   At meal time, residents head toward the cafeteria in a fleet of
bicycles, tricycles and powered wheelchairs. An elderly couple,
both blind, led each other on foot, sharing a single cane.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ruth Lozano Daigle, 81, uses a wheelchair to travel between
buildings but appears far less debilitated than others.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived in 1939 at the age of 22 from San Antonio to
discover that her sister, whom she had been told was attending
college in New Orleans, had preceded her with the same disease.
Sixty years later, she has outlived her sister and the man she met
and married here. Because the diagnosis of her disease came early,
she suffered none of the facial disfigurement or marked
enfeeblement that afflict many here.
</P>
<P>
   Though physically restricting, Carville has provided a full
life, she said. She worked in the infirmary, wrote letters for
patients who could not hold a pencil, and later became editor of
the center's magazine, ``The Star,'' which has fought prejudice
against those who contract the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why she refuses to leave now, the tiny woman with the
honeysuckle voice turned deadly serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government brought me here,'' Daigle said. ``If I didn't
go, they would have put yellow quarantine flags around my family's
house. I became a ward of the government, and I think they should
take care of me till I die. I guess that sounds selfish, but that's
the way I look at it.''

   CARVILLE, La. _ The gate is open now. Residents come and go as
they please. But there was a time when snatches of freedom _ to
catch a ballgame or make a phone call _ meant slipping through a
hole in the fence and risking 30 days in a lockup. Sixty days for
the second offense.
</P>
<P>
   Within the 330 acres bounded by barbed wire, generations of
residents printed a magazine, earned Boy Scout merit badges,
produced plays, held their own Mardi Gras, authored books, fell in
love and conceived children they were forbidden to raise.
</P>
<P>
   Most are elderly now, the last 73 patients of the only long-term
care center in the continental United States for Hansen's disease,
traditionally known as leprosy. In 1951, its peak year, the
Carville complex housed 480.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government intends to close the Gillis W. Long
Hansen's Disease Center in three years, turning out those who
remain. Last year, 45 residents accepted $33,000 annual
``stipends'' _ double for married couples _ and moved away. The
site will be handed back to Louisiana, whose National Guard will
run a job-training boot camp for at-risk youths.
</P>
<P>
   At Carville, all are cured but many continue to suffer from the
physical damage _ facial deformities, clawed hands and circulation
problems _ incurred before effective treatment was discovered. Then
there are old-age infirmities and a psychological dependency
nurtured by decades of institutionalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a world of its own,'' said Texas-born Johnny Harmon,
87, who came to Carville as a young man for two lengthy stays and
finally returned in 1992 with his wife, Anne, whom he had met and
married when both were patients. She arrived at age 10 after
neighbors burned her family's home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have come voluntarily, but I lived a fuller life
than if I hadn't,'' said Harmon. Easily Carville's least shy
resident, he tools around in a motorized wheelchair with a large,
hand-lettered sign affixed to the back, advertising his 184-page,
self-published memoir, now in its fourth printing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of lonesome around here now,'' Harmon said of the
departure of more than a third of the residents between August and
late October.
</P>
<P>
   Like others who stayed, he adamantly opposes leaving _ even with
a generous and tax-free living allowance of $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' snapped Harmon, once a draftsman with the
Texas highway department who became a professional photographer at
Carville. ``It's really depressing. They'll have to take me out in
a box.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't take the offer, assisted-living quarters are
expected to be found in Baton Rouge, 26 miles to the north, where
the Carville complex will eventually relocate as a scaled-back
clinic, said Julia Elwood, its spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Elwood arrived as a frightened 16-year-old patient from the
small South Texas town of Elsa. After being cured through a series
of sulfone drug injections, graduating college and teaching school,
she returned as a staff member, the first to do so.
</P>
<P>
   None of the residents now carries the leprosy bacteria, whose
mode of transmission still perplexes researchers. It is not a
venereal disease, but specialists believe _ but cannot prove _ it
spreads through skin-to-skin contact, inhalation of
bacteria-containing droplets and, in some Southern states, handling
armadillos.
</P>
<P>
   However transmitted, it's done so with difficulty. Ninety to 95
percent of people are naturally immune. (Only one Carville employee
ever contracted the disease, a power-house worker who did not come
in contact with patients.) The international medical community
recognized in 1956 that there no longer was any need to quarantine
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Today, less than two weeks' outpatient treatment with a cocktail
of antibiotics removes the threat of contagion.
</P>
<P>
   Although leprosy sounds like something out of antiquity _ or a
``Ben Hur'' rerun _ there are 690,000 new cases a year around the
world. It is now called Hansen's disease _ after the Norwegian
scientist who discovered the rod-shaped bacteria _ to differentiate
it from the vague but damning biblical references to leprosy as a
divine curse on the sinful and unclean.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a cure was discovered in the mid-1940s by Carville
researchers, the social stigma endured.
</P>
<P>
   For years, patients were encouraged to take assumed names to
spare their families embarrassment and ostracism back home.
</P>
<P>
   Even after forcible detention ended in 1957, they built their
own society and, at times, an aggressive cohesiveness. They
successfully campaigned to oust one unpopular director and tried to
push out another.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Patients Federation opposes stipend-takers returning
to use Carville's subsidized facilities, which include a hair salon
and a canteen that sells tax-free cigarettes, discount beer and
such exotic fare as pickled pig lips. The Federation's leader, a
Colombian-born nun, declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residents didn't want those who left to come back and harvest
the pecans,'' said Dr. Bruce Clements, 70, the center's clinical
director. ``I don't think it's very Christian of them. They don't
want them in the cafeteria anymore. I guess it's jealousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents fondly recall the U.S. Public Health Service
administrators who lifted penallike restrictions that persisted
years after sulfone drugs proved effective. They closed the jail,
eased the issuance of passes, lifted a ban on social contacts
between patients and staff, and permitted weddings on the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as far as Washington is concerned, Carville has outlived
its usefulness. There is now no medical need to keep treated
patients apart from society. And the $15.6 million annual budget
has made it a costly white elephant to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're victims of our own success,'' said Bunny Harriman, a
Corsicana, Texas, native who is chief social worker at Carville.
``But it's still painful for the very old, staid and entrenched
people. This place is their home, and to have their home threatened
is a sad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, relatively younger patients took the stipend offer
last year, Harriman said. ``Now the average age is 70.''

HANSEN'S DISEASE TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies OUTCASTS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, Hansen's disease is mostly a problem in the Third World,
with India, Indonesia and Myanmar, formerly Burma, accounting for
70 percent of the 1.8 million active cases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the United States is not free of Hansen's. There are an
estimated 6,500 U.S. cases, 380 of them in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the known ones. There may be more.
</P>
<P>
   Because of unfamiliarity with the disease, ``some people are
misdiagnosed for five or 10 years,'' said Nancy Bernstein, a
Dallas-based public health nurse who supervises care for Hansen's
patients in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Early diagnosis and treatment almost always prevent deformities,
Bernstein said. But the afflicted, experiencing numbness in the
feet or hands or finding lesions, spots or nodules, can go from
doctor to doctor being told they might have ringworm or psoriasis,
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The rarity of the disease also has fostered popular
misconceptions, like the myth that fingers and toes drop off.
</P>
<P>
   Left untreated, Hansen's can cause ``bone absorption,'' which
makes fingers recede into the hand. The bacteria can destroy
cartilage, which leads to a disfigured or flattened nose. Because
of a loss of sensitivity _ the person may feel no pain _ fingers
can be accidentally cut or burnt off.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for research has dried up in recent years, driving
numerous scientists out of the field, even though work on leprosy
could be applicable to tuberculosis and other diseases, said James
L. Krahenbuhl, who supervises leprosy studies at Louisiana State
University in Baton Rouge, where the Gillis W. Long Hansen's
Disease Center in Carville's research branch is now located.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be dismantling the very research and control measures
needed to truly control Hansen's disease around the globe,'' he
said.

 &HT;    CLINTON SEEKING $1 BILLION IN EMERGENCY AID FOR CENTRAL AMERICA
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 450 words.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton asked Congress Tuesday for nearly
$1 billion in emergency recovery aid and debt relief for Central
American countries ravaged last fall by hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   The largest part of the package -- a requested $613 million for
reconstruction -- would be used to help rebuild homes, farms, roads
and other facilities destroyed by flooding that killed 9,000 people
and left 3 million more homeless in what the administration calls
the worst natural disaster in the history of the Western
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though the rains have stopped, the hard work of rebuilding and
recovery has just begun,'' said Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who, along with First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
others, announced the aid request at a White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the first lady plan to travel next month,
leaving March 8, to Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala,
countries hard-hit by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   The storm swept through the region on Oct. 28, ripping across
Honduras with winds up to 120 miles per hour and dumping 25 inches
of rain on the country, causing floods that have set back a
generation's worth of development in thousands of communities
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``At just the moment in time when all of these countries were
poised for the future, this devastating natural disaster has seemed
to come out of nowhere and set them back with respect to pursuing
their dreams and their hopes,'' the first lady said. ''We want to
be friends and partners in rebuilding those dreams and hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   The $613 million in reconstruction aid Clinton has requested
would be earmarked for Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala. Some $50 million of that money would also go to Haiti
and the Dominican Republic, which suffered damage from Hurricane
George last fall. Another $10 million of it would go to Colombia,
which was hit with a devastating earthquake earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the reconstruction aid request, Clinton is asking
Congress for:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $158 million to reimburse the Defense Department and the U.S.
Agency for International Development for emergency assistance it
has already provided due to Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $80 million to reimburse the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service for the costs of deferring deportations to
hard-hit Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $64 million to help deal with soil erosion, denuding of
woodlands and other environmental ills that contributed to the
flood-related damage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $41 million to help ease the burden of foreign debt owed by
Nicaragua and Honduras. Because of the way debt is managed, the
actual relief provided to those countries would be more than double
the amount the program would cost U.S. taxpayers. Nicaragua owes
foreign countries some $6 billion. Honduras owes $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. assistance is part of a broader package of global aid
expected to reach some $4 billion. Aid officials from the United
States, Europe, Japan and other donor countries are scheduled to
meet in Sweden in late May to confer on a long-term recovery plan
for the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is hopeful that Congress will approve
its emergency aid request before that, so the money may be used to
provide urgently needed assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope Congress will act expeditiously, by the end of
March,'' said Josh Gotbaum, executive associate director of the
White House Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is bipartisan support for action, substantial action,''
Gotbaum told reporters. ''But one should not prejudge the
prerogatives of the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the aid is being sought under an emergency supplemental
request, it is not subject to budget rules that would require the
White House to demonstrate how to pay for the requests -- through
tax hikes or cuts in other types of spending -- as is required for
normal budget items.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the emergency aid, Clinton plans to ask Congress
soon to enhance the trade terms granted to Caribbean nations under
the Reagan-era Caribbean Basin Initiative, or CBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''CBI is a critical tool for the rebuilding of Central
America,'' said Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean countries received certain preferential trade
privileges under the terms of the CBI. Those countries have
complained, however, that Mexico got an even better deal under the
provisions of the five-year-old North American Free Trade
Agreement, or NAFTA. The Caribbean countries have been seeking new
terms that would put them on parity with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined to specify on Tuesday whether
Clinton's proposal for enhanced CBI benefits would amount to NAFTA
parity.

EX-OFFICERS WHO KILLED BIKO DENIED AMNESTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Four former police officers who
maintained they had accidentally killed anti-apartheid activist
Steve Biko, when he became agitated and had to be restrained, were
refused amnesty Tuesday by the country's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy ruling, the commission cited several reasons for
its judgment, including the belief that the officers had lied about
what happened to Biko, who died of severe head injuries after they
interrogated him in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the applicants' version of Biko's death was
``so improbable and contradictory that it has to be rejected as
false.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, none of the applicants has impressed us as a
credible witness. They had clearly conspired to conceal the truth
of what led to the tragic death of Biko soon after the incident and
have persisted in this attitude before us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ends one of the more controversial cases to go before
the commission, which was created to help South Africa put its
brutal past to rest without the expense and divisiveness of
criminal trials. Just how Biko was killed has been one of the
apartheid-era's most enduring mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Biko and a friend were arrested outside the small town of
Grahamstown in August 1977 on their way to a political meeting in
Cape Town. His death in custody that September stirred outrage
abroad and many see it as a turning-point in the campaign against
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The amnesty hearings for the officers, which drew hundreds of
spectators, appeared to provide some new details about how the
young founder of the Black Consciousness Movement died.
</P>
<P>
   The officers described how they lied about which day Biko was
taken into custody to cover up the fact that they had not sought
medical treatment for him. And they told of how Biko was left,
standing and handcuffed to a window grille for nearly two days even
though it was clear that he was no longer coherent.
</P>
<P>
   But the officers claimed that Biko suffered his head injuries by
accident after he lunged at them because they would not let him sit
down. Some said Biko's head was slammed into a wall like a
battering ram during the scuffle. One of the officers said Biko
also hit his head on a table.
</P>
<P>
   After the botched interrogation, Biko was driven more than 500
miles across the country, lying naked and shackled in the back of a
police van, for medical care in Pretoria. The 30-year-old activist
died in a police cell before he was taken to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for amnesty, an applicant must confess all and have a
political motive for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the officers _ Daniel Petrus Siebert, Jacobus
Johannes Oosthuysen Beneke, Rubin Marx and Harold Snyman (who has
since died) _ admitted to any crime, saying that they had acted to
defend themselves or to restrain Biko.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason alone, the commission said, it could not grant
amnesty. Also if the act was an accident, it could hardly be
associated with a political objective, the commission said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In dismissing the police officers' versions of Biko's death, the
commission said it appeared more probable that Biko was attacked
because the officers were offended by his ``arrogant, recalcitrant
and noncooperative attitude, particularly exemplified by his
occupying a chair without their permission to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This view is reinforced by the cruel and inhumane manner in
which Biko was treated after he sustained the fatal injury, in
particular the manner in which he was shackled to the metal grille
and his transportation to Pretoria,'' the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said Biko's reputation as someone who would fight
back was probably another factor in the way he was treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to have been no justification at all for Beneke
to simply blindly attack Biko,'' the ruling said. ``This in all
likelihood sparked off a general attack on Biko with most of the
policemen present joining in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attack was possibly also not unrelated to the fact that
the applicants were informed that Biko had beaten up one of their
colleagues on an earlier occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the applications the committee said the killing of
Biko was ``wholly disproportionate to any possible objective
pursued by applicants, particularly the stated one of extracting
information or admissions from Biko.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate application by a fifth police office who participated
in the interrogation of Biko, Gideon Nieuwoudt, was rejected last
month for similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Biko family had vehemently opposed the amnesty application.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Feb. 21,
1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORY  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH/AMERICAN-THEATER (Undated) _ A conversation between
three New York Times theater critics on British and American
theater, which was recorded by the theater editor of Arts and
Leisure, Andrea Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CARLOS-SAURA-FILMS (Undated) _ This year's Academy Award
nominations offer many reasons for deep satisfaction, but one such
reason hasn't attracted much attention. Tucked at the end of the
list of nominees for best foreign film, just below Roberto
Benigni's ubiquitous ``Life Is Beautiful,'' is ``Tango,'' an entry
from Argentina that is the work of the hugely gifted, hugely
perplexing Spanish director Carlos Saura. It would be wonderful in
any case for the 67-year-old Saura to be noted again for Oscar
consideration (his ``Carmen'' was nominated in 1983). By Will
Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   RISA-GARCIA-FILMS (Undated) _ In 1973, Risa Bramon Garcia turned
her first nobody into a star. His name was Martin, and she didn't
care that he had no acting experience. ``It's not just that he had
(italics)presence,''(end italics) said Ms. Garcia, who was then 16
and directing a high school production of ``South Pacific.'' ``He
had a beautiful singing voice. I knew that because he used to sit
behind me in history class and hum.'' Now 42, Ms. Garcia still has
ears and eyes for talent. Over the past 15 years she has become a
top casting director in Hollywood. With ``200 Cigarettes,'' which
opens on Friday, Ms. Garcia's 94-minute romantic comedy marks her
debut as a feature film director. By Margy Rochlin. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   APPLE-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Apple,'' an astonishing directorial
debut by Samira Makhmalbaf, written and edited by her father,
Mohsen Makhmalbaf, won praise when it screened at the Cannes
International Film Festival last spring, but it also provoked a
certain confusion. ``One critic asked: `What kind of country is
Iran?' '' Ms. Makhmalbaf recalled, speaking animatedly in a mixture
of English and Farsi. `` `Is it a place where 12-year-old girls are
incarcerated, or where 18-year-old girls make movies?' '' The film,
which opened in New York on Friday after screening in the New York
Film Festival last fall, is both a realistic recreation of surreal
events and a subtle allegory about the need for liberty. By Leslie
Camhi.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews: ``Death of a
Salesman''; ``The Misanthrope'' and ``James Naughton: Street of
Dreams.'' Photo.
</P>
<P>
   YANKS-ENGLISH-THEATER (Undated) _ While it may seem to Americans
that British theater people stream across the Atlantic in a
constant one-way flow, the current runs both ways. Americans can _
and do _ flourish in English theater. Six expatriates offer their
observations. By Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   COLOR-OF-JUSTICE-THEATER (London) _ Nothing has provoked more
attention in the British theater so far this year than a defiantly
undemonstrative piece called ``The Color of Justice.'' The subject
is the killing of a black teen-ager in southeast London six years
ago, and the manner of its telling is as fresh as the O.J. Simpson
trial and as old as Aeschylus' ``Oresteia.'' By Benedict
Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-AMERICANS-ACTORS (Undated) _ The trade agreement
governing the number of British and American actors working on
opposite sides of the Atlantic is under attack by Britain's main
international cultural agency, prompting hopes that the unions
involved will reconsider the arrangement. Under the current rules,
a producer who wants to bring a British actor to New York must seek
the approval of Actors Equity, the American union, just as British
Equity's approval is needed to allow an American actor to go to
Britain. In theory, the two unions try to balance the exchange. By
Felicia R. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   NIGHTINGALES-THEATER (London) _ There will be two unfamiliar
entities onstage when ``Not About Nightingales'' opens on Thursday
at Circle in the Square on Broadway. First, of course, will be
Tennessee Williams' fierce, lyrical prison play, having its belated
New York premiere 61 years after it was written. And second,
playing the central role of the warden, will be Corin Redgrave, who
has not been on Broadway since 1963 and who is the least known of
the famous acting Redgraves. In addition to what Ben Brantley,
writing in The New York Times, called an ``outsize, Satanic''
performance as Boss Whalen in ``Not About Nightingales,'' Redgrave
has been acclaimed in productions of plays by Martin Sherman
(``Some Sunny Day''), Richard Nelson (``The General From America'')
and Noel Coward (``A Song at Twilight''), as well as onscreen as
Sir Walter Elliot in ``Persuasion.'' By Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHAPERO-CLASSICAL-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ The history of music is
filled with accounts of major new works that received prominent
premieres only to languish thereafter and sometimes virtually
disappear. Take the Symphony for Classical Orchestra by the
respected American Neo-Classical composer Harold Shapero. Shapero
was 27 when he completed this 45-minute work, which was given its
promising first performance in January 1948 by the Boston Symphony
Orchestra and Leonard Bernstein, who was then 29. Two months later,
George Szell conducted it with the Cleveland Orchestra. And in
1953, Bernstein and the Columbia Symphony Orchestra recorded the
piece in New York, producing a remarkable performance that
circulated for years and won the symphony admirers among musicians
and composers sympathetic to Neo-Classicism. That recording, long
unavailable, has now been reissued by Sony Classical in its
Bernstein Century series (SMK 60725; CD). By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BLONDI-MUSIC (New York) _ ``Do you really want to know the whole
odd story?'' asked the guitarist Chris Stein, peering skeptically
across the coffee table in a midtown hotel suite. He was explaining
why Blondie, the punk era's best-selling group and, later, one of
its many train wrecks, has regrouped after 16 years to record ``No
Exit,'' an album of new studio material. By Ann Powers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MORELL-PHOTOGS (Boston) _ The exhibition ``Abelardo Morell and
the Camera Eye,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts through April 11,
documents Morell's pictures from the point of view of a child with
70 images. It was organized by Diana Gaston, curator at the Museum
of Photographic Arts in San Diego, Calif. By Deborah Weisgall.

</P>
<P>
   HAPPENINGS-ART (Undated) _ With ``Off Limits: Rutgers University
and the Avant-Garde, 1957-1963,'' the Newark Museum has organized
an illuminating exhibition about one of modern art's lesser-known
but pivotal creative scenes. It unfolded at a moment when the art
world was transfixed by the apotheosis of Abstract Expressionism,
and still-nascent Pop Art had yet to emerge. The time was the late
50s and early 60s, when a mutually influential group of artists,
teachers and students came together at the Rutgers College and
Douglass College campuses in New Brunswick. There, they came up
with radical notions and rule-breaking experiments that helped sow
the seeds of performance art, installation art, conceptual art, Pop
Art and the international current in art known as Fluxus. ``Off
Limits,'' which traces this art-historical path, focuses on the
ideas and early work of Allan Kaprow, Robert Watts, George Segal,
Geoffrey Hendricks, Robert Whitman, Lucas Samaras, George Brecht
and Roy Lichtenstein, examining some of the better known of these
artists' work in unexpected contexts. The show opened Thursday and
will remain on view through May 16. By Edward M. GOMEZ.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-BASKETS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Lloyd E. Cotsen, a
mega-collector of ordinary and offbeat objects that most people
ignore, goes to great lengths to share them with the public.
Cotsen, who is 69 and lives in Los Angeles, is letting the public
view his most treasured artifacts _ Japanese bamboo baskets. The
900 baskets in his collection, which is considered the largest and
most distinguished in private hands, are a type of artifact that is
virtually unknown to all but a small group of experts, even in
Japan, where such objects are seldom exhibited. So Cotsen lent 100
rarities to the Asia Society in Manhattan for ``Bamboo Masterworks:
Japanese Baskets from the Lloyd Cotsen Collection,'' a show on view
through May 30. By Rita Reif.

   ATM-CARJACK (Los Angeles) _ The LAPD mounted a manhunt Tuesday
for men who attacked a couple at an ATM around 10 p.m. Monday,
robbed and carjacked them and drove them around for several hours.
The man was beaten and the woman was sexually assaulted, then left

   KURD-PROTESTS (Rome) _ Enraged by the capture of the foremost

   GERMAN-SLAVE-PAY (Berlin) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
announces the creation of a fund, projected to amount to $1.7
billion, financed by 12 German companies, to compensate victims of
the Nazis and end what he calls ``the campaign being led against
German industry and our country.'' The announcement is clearly
aimed at stopping a wave of lawsuits in U.S. courts against German
companies that used slave labor and forced labor during World War
II. But Schroeder's choice of words appears unlikely to calm the
waters. By Roger Cohen. (The story has moved in ``i'' news file.)

   TX-DRAGGING-DEATH (Jasper, Texas) _ John William King, his arms
festooned with racist tattoos, had dreamed of forming his own local
chapter of a white supremacist group but felt he needed some
dramatic event to catapult him into the limelight and attract
members. That, prosecutors said for the first time, is their theory
of why King and two other young white men chained a 49-year-old
black man to the back of their pickup truck last June and dragged
him 3 miles down a country road until his flayed and battered body
fell apart. The case against King, 24, the first of the three
suspects to come to trial in the hideous death of James Byrd Jr.,
opens before a locally drawn jury of six men and five women _ all
white but for one black man. By Rick Lyman. (Scheduled to move by

   GORE-POLITICS (Washington) _ Vice President Al Gore has emerged
from the impeachment ordeal in a more commanding position to
capture the Democratic nomination than he would have if the world
had never heard of Monica Lewinsky. Most significantly, Dick
Gephardt has decided not to take on Gore. And among Republicans
there is such a feeling of inevitability to the vice president's
quest to succeed Clinton that former Vice President Dan Quayle, in
announcing his exploratory committee last week, proclaimed: ``I

   In Red Square, just across from the mausoleum where Lenin lies
in state like some old biological curiosity preserved in
formaldehyde, there is a grand three-story stone building that
these days is in about the same shape.
</P>
<P>
   The rococo facade of the GUM department store resembles that of
a cathedral, but its gaudy interior is an emporium with mink coats
on hangers and on customers. GUM seemed a symbol of Russia's hope,
for the spiffily dressed chairman of the board, Yuri Solomatin, 44,
came across as a Russian capitalist with a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Solomatin eschewed the mob, limousines and bodyguards; he did
not wear fat diamonds on his fingers or endless-legged women on his
elbow; and he boasted of running the most open, market-oriented,
Western-style company in all Russia _ proving this by granting
himself and other managers stock options that soared fifteenfold.
He sold more than half of GUM's stock to foreigners, mostly
Americans and Europeans, an unheard-of feat in nationalistic
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Russian devaluation and market meltdown in August,
and suddenly GUM crumbled. Its stock has fallen to 25 cents a
share, from a peak of $5.40, and its shops today are a sea of signs
that scream ``skidka'' _ discount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overnight,'' Solomatin said heavily, sitting in a third-floor
conference room, ``we were made paupers.''
</P>
<P>
   How did GUM get hit by what started as a run on the Thai
currency in July 1997? Why did the crisis ripple from country to
country and end up leaving Russia facing hunger and economic chaos,
with 30 percent of Russians living below the poverty line, up from
18 percent at the end of 1996? And why has it now hit Brazil and
shaken financial markets in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico?
</P>
<P>
   The answers will be hotly debated for years, but some tentative
explanations are emerging for what is known as the contagion
effect: the tendency of a financial crisis to spread and ``infect''
other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The growing interdependence through the fabric of the world
economy connected GUM even to Mary Jo Paoni, a secretary in
Cantrall, Ill. Mrs. Paoni patronizes a Bergners department store,
and her husband frequents Kmart, but through her Illinois state
pension fund she was in a sense a tiny part owner of GUM.
</P>
<P>
   The pension fund owned $7.2 million worth of the Brinson
Emerging Markets Fund, and records show that Brinson in turn bought
$138,000 in GUM stock.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Paoni was linked to GUM in another way, for her pension
fund has $1-million worth of shares in Germany's Dresdner Bank. And
Dresdner, excited by GUM's prospects, lent it $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the Soviet days, GUM was the best department store in the
country, with lines of people waiting each morning to enter, and it
set aside a special area on the third floor, Section 100, where
ordinary shoppers were banned and top Communist Party officials
could pick up fine clothing unavailable anywhere else in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of its fame, GUM was among the first Russian
companies to be privatized after the fall of the Soviet Union. It
became an upscale shopping mall, and every day 200,000 shoppers
trooped down its aisles.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 international retailers occupied space, paying what
analysts said were higher rents than anywhere else in Europe.
Samsonite reported that it sold more per square foot in its luggage
store in GUM than in any of its other outlets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Over all in GUM, sales soared to an average of $926 per square
foot, one of the highest such figures in the world. In contrast,
Bloomingdale's in New York says that its sales are $267 per square
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Fund managers were impressed by all this and by GUM's declared
commitment to international standards. It even put out annual
reports in English as well as Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ``GUM has a strong balance sheet, no long-term debt and high
liquidity,'' wrote Sector Capital, a Moscow investment bank, in
1996. ``The company is very profitable, with a 40 percent return on
assets. Together with the company's financial stability, this makes
GUM a very attractive investment.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, GUM and its American owners made the same kind of
mistake as the Thai real estate developers who started the whole
mess. They became so accustomed to the long summer days that they
came to disbelieve in winter.
</P>
<P>
   When Thailand floated its currency on July 2, 1997, the date
that is now regarded as the beginning of the global financial
crisis, the only shudder passing through GUM was one of delight _
at its rising stock price. Over the next three months, the stock
rose 37 percent, to a new peak.

<P>
   THAI PROBLEMS SPREAD
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else was initially very worried that Thailand's problems
would radiate around the world. While some of Thailand's underlying
problems were well known, on the day of the devaluation the Thai
stock market rose 7.9 percent, its biggest gain in more than five
years.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, absolutely everyone seems to have made a
catastrophic misdiagnosis of the problem, one that resulted in
Thailand's getting insufficient treatment and in exposing other
countries to the contagion. The misdiagnosis was twofold: first,
that Thailand probably faced a typical temporary downturn, rather
than a staggering depression that would last for years; second,
that the problem was largely confined to Thailand rather than the
beginnings of a serious global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration initially saw the crisis as a replay
of what had happened in Mexico in 1995, and prescribed the same mix
of austerity and aid. So in the late summer of 1997, Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence Summers, signed on
to a standard International Monetary Fund plan: spending cuts, high
interest rates and a repair job on the Thai banking system. But
over the protests of the fund, the United States declined to
contribute to a bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and Summers were adamant that they could not contribute
because of congressionally imposed restrictions. The State and
Defense Departments were unhappy with Treasury's tightfistedness,
but Treasury officials suggested sarcastically if any other
department had a spare billion or two in its budget and wanted to
help the Thais, it should feel free to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin still insists that he made the right economic decision,
but he seems less sure that he got the diplomacy right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would have made a difference economically,''
he said of a contribution to Thailand. ``Diplomatically, I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official said flatly: ``In hindsight,
it was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Thailand appealed to Japan for financial help that summer of
1997, and officials in Tokyo say they thought seriously about
arranging a big package of loans. But in the end they did not,
partly because Washington insisted that a rescue be made only
through the monetary fund and only after imposing tough conditions
on Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   With the firm backing of Treasury, the fund initially forced
Thailand to accept austerity, including budget cuts and high
interest rates. The idea was that sky-high interest rates would
attract capital back to Thailand and stabilize exchange rates, but
they also ended up devastating otherwise viable businesses. Many
economists, including those at the World Bank, have criticized the
fund's approach as initially worsening Asia's problems, and even
the fund has admitted that its budget cuts were too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1998, recognizing that the slump was unexpectedly
serious and that the initial conditions had been too tough, the
fund and Treasury reversed course. They steadily allowed Thailand
to reverse planned budget cuts and to ease the austerity, but the
damage had been done.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin stood his ground, saying that the higher rates were needed
to stabilize currencies in Thailand and South Korea, laying the
groundwork for eventual recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is ``likely very chaotic conditions, far greater
inflation and a risk that confidence will not come back for a
recovery,'' he said. Countries like Indonesia that resisted the
fund's medicine ended up even worse off, he notes.
</P>
<P>
   After initially bowing to Washington's desires and declining to
rescue Thailand directly, Japan became more assertive as it saw the
crisis worsen. In September 1997, Japanese officials proposed a
$100-billion bailout plan called the Asian Monetary Fund, to be
paid for half by Japan and half by other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   This would not have cost the United States a penny, but Rubin
was furious about it, partly because the Japanese had not consulted
him. He fumed as he strolled about the Air Force jet carrying him
to the annual meetings of the fund and World Bank in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, who has often shown a deep distrust and distaste for
Japanese officials, gathered with Summers and other aides in the
forward compartment of the plane to plot strategy. As the group
nibbled on nachos, Rubin complained that the proposal would
undercut American interests and influence in Asia, and that Japan
would lend the money without insisting on tough economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and Summers succeeded in killing the plan, with the help
of Europe and China. Many in Asia now regard that as a crucial
missed chance, and there is real bitterness that the United States
had muscled in to prevent Japan's attempted rescue of its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials stand by their opposition to the Asian
Monetary Fund, saying that the plan would not have changed
anything, for it would have taken time to implement and, as
Japanese officials later acknowledged, Japan was itself hard up for
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese plan was vapor,'' a Rubin associate said
recently. ``It wasn't going to happen. It was ill thought out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some other American officials now say, a bit sheepishly,
that if they had realized the seriousness of the crisis, they might
have been more accepting of the proposal. In November 1998, a year
after Washington killed the plan, Japan came back with another one,
on a smaller scale. Instead of trying to subvert it, Rubin now
called the idea constructive. President Clinton hailed it as one of
Japan's ``important contributions to regional stabilization.''

<P>
   AN ECONOMY SELF-DESTRUCTS
</P>
<P>
   Treasury opposed the first Japanese fund in part because it _
along with everybody else, including investors, scholars and
journalists _ thought that the storm over Asia would probably pass.
Yet something fundamental had changed. Perceptions of risk had
altered, and people began to get nervous about holding any Asian
currency.
</P>
<P>
   The anxieties became self-fulfilling, particularly as Thailand's
economy began to self-destruct. Speculators, stock investors and
local businessmen alike wanted the safety of dollars, and during
the fall of 1997 currencies fell in the Philippines, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Taiwan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Since many Asian countries had problems with heavily indebted
corporations, inflated stock and property prices, overvalued
currencies, and bad loans, it was easy to find similarities to
Thailand once people began to look. Just as Western capital had
flooded into emerging markets as a group in the early and
mid-1990s, now it began to ebb.
</P>
<P>
   Take Barton Biggs, the strategist at Morgan Stanley, who, a few
years earlier, had helped ignite the Asian investment boom. As
Thailand began to fall apart in the fall of 1997, he made another
trip to Bangkok, and this time his advice was grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really went with the idea that Asia was sold out and bombed
out and that there must be some attractive values,'' he said in a
teleconference with investors on Oct. 27, 1997, recorded by
Bloomberg. ``And I've got to say that I was disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggs told investors to sell all their holdings in markets like
Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, and to cut by one-third their
investments in emerging markets like Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. BANKS CASUALTY-FREE
</P>
<P>
   The dominoes began to fall. In late October 1997, right after
Biggs' announcement and partly because of it, the Hong Kong stock
market plunged 23 percent over four days. The debacle in Hong Kong
suddenly caught Wall Street's attention, and in New York on Oct.
27, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 554 points, its
biggest one-day point loss in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changed everyone's calculations,'' recalled Stanley
Fischer, the fund's deputy chief. Suddenly, contagion was the
buzzword, and there were regular meetings on the crisis in the
Situation Room at the White House. Yet while White House officials
pondered what to do, investors were busy selling. Anything that
seemed to hint of emerging markets was dumped, and stock markets in
Brazil, Argentina and Mexico also suffered their worst one-day
losses ever.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Paoni's money in the Illinois pension fund joined the rush
to the exits. Records show that the fund managers sold Indonesian
stocks that had cost them $3.3 million, Malaysian stocks that had
cost $1.9 million, Philippine stocks that had cost $1.5 million,
South Korean stocks that had cost $1.1 million, and Thai stocks
that had cost $2.2 million. Across the world, everybody was doing
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Indonesia was forced to accept a $17-billion bailout, later
raised to $23 billion, to which the United States agreed to
contribute _ an implicit admission that it had made the wrong call
with Thailand. Pressure grew on South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia,
Brazil, Russia and other countries. Everybody seemed alarmed except
Clinton, who in November 1997 tried to sound reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a few little glitches in the road here,'' he said.
``We're working through them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was perhaps listening too closely to the State
Department, for American diplomats in Bangkok were sending out rosy
cables, and their counterparts in South Korea were similarly
oblivious to the Korean economy's disintegration, which was then
well under way. In Washington, Rubin and Summers had a far clearer
sense of what was happening in South Korea, and were openly
disparaging of the diplomatic reports from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department missed its cues because, historically, it
had focused on the threats from Communists who carry grenades, not
on the threats from business executives who wear neckties and trade
currencies. The same was true of the Central Intelligence Agency,
which proved itself, in the words of one of its top officials,
``completely unprepared to deal with questions of an economic
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet by Thanksgiving Day 1997, it was clear to all top officials
in Washington that South Korea was on the brink of an economic
catastrophe. After five hours of conference calls among top
American officials, Clinton telephoned President Kim Young-sam of
South Korea and told him he had no choice but to accept an
international bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Kim bowed to the inevitable and accepted a bailout that swelled
to $57 billion, the biggest ever. But with that money now flowing
into South Korea, Western banks saw a chance to take it and run.
The banks called in their loans, hoping to flee while they could.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin quietly called the heads of major banks and urged them to
reschedule their loans, and in the end they did.
</P>
<P>
   But the bailout still ended up bolstering Western banks. South
Koreans lost their businesses and in some cases were even driven to
suicide. But foreign banks _ among them Citibank, J.P. Morgan,
Chase Manhattan, BankAmerica and Bankers Trust _ were rewarded with
sharply higher interest rates (2 to 3 percentage points higher than
the London interbank rate) and a government guarantee that passed
the risk of default from their shareholders to Korean taxpayers.
The banks say that this was only fair, because they were extending
their loans up to three years and thus assuming an extra burden.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in contrast to previous financial crises, which were
resolved by banks' effectively paying a good share of the bill,
this was a huge bailout with public funds, and the banks did not
chip in major new money.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin defends the bailouts, saying that he ``wouldn't spend a
nickel'' to bail out banks or investors, but that helping the
country often means ensuring that it can pay off its creditors.
</P>
<P>
   But critics note that the some of the biggest beneficiaries are
the banks. ``The effort is hurting the countries they are lending
to, and benefiting the foreigners who lent to them,'' argued Milton
Friedman, the Stanford University economist and Nobel Prize winner.
Friedman argues that the monetary fund does more harm than good and
is bitterly critical of these bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States does give foreign aid,'' he said. ``But this
is a different kind of foreign aid. It only goes through countries
like Thailand to Bankers Trust.''

<P>
   INVESTORS RUN FROM RISK
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of South Korea, investors rushed from any sign
of risk. At Morgan Stanley, Biggs had bought emerging markets early
in 1997 for his own portfolio, but now he sold frantically. Records
at the Securities and Exchange Commission show that in December
1997 he sold $56,000 worth of his own company's Malaysian Fund,
$650,000 worth of Emerging Markets Fund, $80,000 worth of India
Investment Fund, $137,000 in the Pakistan Investment Fund and
almost $1.6 million worth of Asia Pacific Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of other investors were doing likewise,
liquidating their holdings in emerging-markets funds. This created
another kind of contagion. Sales of emerging-markets mutual funds
forced fund managers to pare down their portfolios to pay back
shareholders. This meant that fund managers had to trim holdings
even in distant countries, even in stocks that they regarded as
still valuable. In this way the electronic herd rushing away from
Korea ended up trampling stocks in Argentina and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The world seemed to be coming apart, and so was the U.S.
government's consensus on what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia was particularly nettlesome because of the question of
how to treat President Suharto, the aging dictator, whom Clinton
had previously supported.
</P>
<P>
   While on a trip to Texas on Jan. 8, 1998, Clinton telephoned
Suharto from Air Force One to urge compliance with the monetary
fund program. But Suharto stuck to some of his ideas about how to
run the economy, like a ``currency board'' to back Indonesian money
with dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A White House aide recalls Suharto's growling, ``Look, I
understand that this doesn't cure anything, but the IMF isn't
curing anything either.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials were puzzled about what to do, and they had
no intuitive feel for what might happen next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the crisis was not understood,'' recalls a
senior official who weathered the thick of the crisis. ``We didn't
really grasp everything that was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   NATION'S DRIVE-BY SHOOTING
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has been hit hardest, but what remains unclear is
whether it had to suffer at all. Some economists argue that
Indonesia was simply the victim of the international equivalent of
a drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Its trade balance was in relatively healthy shape. It had a
respectable $20 billion in foreign exchange reserves and did not
squander them trying to defend its currency. Credit had grown more
slowly than in other countries, and there was less indication of a
bubble. The government initially reacted with foresight, going to
the fund before any severe problems developed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the end the Indonesian currency lost 85 percent of its
value, riots cost more than 1,000 lives and hunger became
widespread. Today there are doubts about whether Indonesia can
survive as a nation; some fear that it will fragment like
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``These horrendous things did not have to happen,'' argues
Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist, who blames the United States
and the monetary fund for deepening a financial panic. ``The crisis
was pushed to an extreme that it never had to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia was particularly vulnerable to panic because most of
its private wealth is in the hands of ethnic Chinese who are
unusually likely to seek safe havens for themselves and their
money. Public confidence was therefore Indonesia's most precious
commodity, but it dissipated as officials from Washington tangled
repeatedly with the Indonesian government over how to deal with the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's handling of it was disastrous. He backtracked on
closing banks, adding to confusion, and resisted many reforms that
would have threatened his family empire. The fund forced Indonesia
to close 16 banks, but then in an internal document acknowledged
that it had gravely erred and that the closures had triggered bank
runs around the country.

   Both Treasury and the fund ridiculed Suharto's budget proposal,
which because of exchange-rate movements showed a 32 percent
spending increase in local currency terms. But three weeks later,
having already irreparably harmed Indonesia's image, the fund
quietly approved a budget with a 46 percent spending increase.

   ANATOMY OF DERIVATIVES
</P>
<P>
   As currencies and countries tumbled, another form of contagion
began to take a toll on world economies: financial derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   Originally called synthetic securities, derivatives are so named
because they are derived from something else _ an underlying stock
or bond. They can be as simple as an option to buy a stock, or they
can be complex products involving multiple currencies, loans and
bonds. In effect they are repackaged securities, stuck together
like a complex work of financial Lego.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing inherently harmful about derivatives, and they
can be very useful to protect against risks. But they can also be
used to speculate. Their tremendous variety is reflected in the
nicknames given to various kinds: the jellyroll; the iron
butterfly; the condor; the knockout option; the total return swap;
the Asian option.
</P>
<P>
   These are jellyrolls that really sell. Western sales teams were
active in Asia, and they often peddled complex financial products
to customers who sometimes did not understand what they were
getting into.
</P>
<P>
   No one believes that derivatives actually caused the crisis. But
although the point is bitterly contested by some investment
bankers, a number of economists believe that once the crisis
started, derivatives helped deepen it and infect other countries.
They cite several mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   First, derivatives made it easier to make high-risk bets on
Asia, but these were not publicly reported. As a result, no one had
any idea how much betting was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derivatives enabled a lot of hot money to flow into Asia below
the radar,'' said Frank Partnoy, a former derivatives salesman and
now an assistant professor of law and finance at the University of
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the riskiness creates a rush to cover bets when the
market goes the wrong way, and this scramble sometimes causes wild
market swings.
</P>
<P>
   As Partnoy explained the scramble: ``It's as if you're in a
theater, and say there are 100 people and you have the
rush-to-the-exit problem. With derivatives, it's as if without your
knowing it, there are another 500 people in the theater, and you
can't see them at first. But then when the rush to the exit starts,
suddenly they drop from the ceiling. This makes the panic
greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Third, derivatives increased the linkages from one country to
the next. South Korea, in particular, invested in derivatives and
other high-risk securities that were tied to Thailand, Russia,
Indonesia and Latin America. South Koreans bought 40 percent of one
Russian bond issue and almost all of a Colombian bond issue.
</P>
<P>
   So when those countries soured, South Korean financial
institutions were badly hit as well. Derivatives had allowed them
high yields but also meant that they stood to lose far more than
their principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is quite clear that derivatives are vectors of
contagion,'' said Martin Mayer, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Why did derivatives flourish in Asia? One reason was that until
the crisis, they were enormously profitable for everyone. Some
Asian financial institutions now grumble about them, but until a
couple of years ago Korean mutual funds managed to earn
exceptionally high returns in part because of their derivative
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, American banks often made huge sums selling these
products in Asia. Jan Kregel, who has researched the issue as a
senior fellow at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute in
Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., concludes that in the boom years of both
Thailand and Indonesia, Western banks made incomparably more money
selling derivatives than making loans, and that in any case much of
the lending was linked to derivatives as well. Most of the major
American banks _ Bankers Trust and Chase and J.P. Morgan and others
_ were actively selling derivatives in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was not that Westerners were fleecing Asians, for in
Asia one of the biggest derivatives players was a Hong Kong
investment bank, Peregrine Investments, run by a British former
race-car driver named Philip Tose. Founded only in 1988, Peregrine
came from nowhere to register an astonishing $25 billion in
revenues in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early last year, Peregrine returned to nowhere. It
collapsed in a sea of debts in Indonesia and elsewhere, and the
shock then rippled through Asia and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a major local player,'' said Christopher Barlow, a
finance expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers who is presiding over the
liquidation of Peregrine. ``A collapse like this causes shock waves
in the system and damages confidence.'' Barlow said Peregrine had
more than 2,000 creditors, with claims of more than $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the losers was the Illinois state pension fund, which
manages Mrs. Paoni's retirement money. The fund had bought $358,000
of Peregrine stock, all of it now worthless, although this had only
an infinitesimal effect on Mrs. Paoni's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derivatives are like power tools,'' said Brian Lippey,
managing director of Tokai Asia Ltd., an investment company in Hong
Kong. ``If you know how to use them, they're great. But if you
don't know how to use them, you'll drill a hole in your head.''

   SALAMET LOSES FARES
</P>
<P>
   In the Indonesian town of Mojokerto, high finance began to close
in on Salamet, a rickshaw driver.
</P>
<P>
   Salamet (who like many Indonesians uses only one name) cannot
read, so he had not learned from the newspaper that the Thai baht
had plummeted and the Hong Kong market had plunged. But he was
shocked when Agus Santoso came home.
</P>
<P>
   Santoso, a slight 40-year-old neighbor, too frail a man to make
a decent ditch-digger, had been the talk of the town. He had
managed to learn how to drive a car and had got a job driving new
cars to dealerships all over Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The job paid $400 a month, a colossal sum that had tongues
wagging all over the neighborhood. Salamet had dreamed that he,
too, might learn to drive a car and follow in Santoso's lead.
</P>
<P>
   But cars and car parts are imported, so they began to soar in
price as the Indonesian rupiah lost value. Indonesians stopped
buying new cars, and Santoso was dismissed and moved back home.
</P>
<P>
   Meat and rice soared in price, and people in Mojokerto began to
cut back to two meals a day. The poor began to walk instead of
taking rickshaw rides, and Salamet's earnings fell by half, to less
than $1 a day.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear how severe the impact has been across the
region, and the last few months have seen a statistical battle, as
international organizations and aid agencies have issued a flood of
reports offering widely divergent portraits of Asia in crisis.
Invariably, the bleakest assessments have tended to get the most
attention.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, for example, estimates by the government and some
aid agencies have suggested that the proportion of people living in
poverty has risen to 40 percent or even 50 percent. But three
carefully prepared World Bank reports released in January suggest
that the increase has been much more modest, to 13.8 percent in
1998 from 11 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As the World Bank sees it, ``Rather than the universal
devastation in poverty, employment, education and health so widely
predicted and repeated in the media,'' the reality is increased
poverty and a rising number of school dropouts, but not on the
scale that aid agencies had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Still, although the scale is uncertain, everyone agrees that the
crisis has left millions of people in great distress. And in
Salamet's extended family, there is no doubt that life has taken a
turn for the worse, even if it is difficult to measure.
</P>
<P>
   Salamet took his wife, Yuti, and their baby daughter to visit
his in-laws in a village near Mojokerto, and there they sat down
beside a hut to chat. No food was served, for there was none.
</P>
<P>
   The matriarch, Sambirah, who does not know her age but appears
to be in her 80s, cradled her great-granddaughter in gnarled arms
so frail that they seemed to rattle in the breeze, and for a moment
her rheumy eyes glowed with pride. Mrs. Sambirah's pale mouth
turned up at the corners, revealing two yellowed teeth, tusks
emerging from an expanse of gum.
</P>
<P>
   Then the tusks disappeared, and Mrs. Sambirah's eyes clouded.
She sighed and described how she now pawns her sarongs so that the
children do not starve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can put up with it if I don't eat,'' she said. ``But the
children aren't used to it. They cry and cry.''
</P>
<P>
   A PULP TYCOON'S WOES
</P>
<P>
   Across the globe, on the 22nd story of a skyscraper in Rio de
Janeiro, Carlos Aguiar began to feel Indonesia's pain.
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar, 53, president and chief executive of a pulp and paper
company called Aracruz Cellulose SA, is solid and plain-speaking.
His hair is neatly parted on the side; his manner suggests a waltz
rather than a samba. He worked his way up through the business, and
his heart is not in Rio but 375 miles north in the company town of
Aracruz, where most company timber plantations and pulp mills are.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Paoni is among those with a stake in Aracruz. Her state
pension fund bought into the Brinson Emerging Markets Fund, which
in turn owned 102,000 shares of Aracruz preferred stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors picked up Aracruz, for the paper industry was
doing well in the mid-1990s and investment analysts were
recommending the stock. But a problem was developing behind the
scenes: Asian companies were building a quantity of enormous paper
mills in Indonesia and other countries, dramatically increasing
worldwide output. Global pulp capacity has soared to 35 million
tons, from 25 million tons in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody saw Asia as being this great market,'' Aguiar said
morosely. ``China, India, they have enormous populations, and
everybody was betting on them. That was why the Indonesians built
these giant factories, because they were expecting that paper use
in China would go from 17 kilos a person now, to 30, then to 100.
It didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of the glut, the devaluations in Asia meant that
Indonesian companies lowered their prices. So the price of Aracruz
pulp dropped to $420 a ton recently from $850 a ton at its peak in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Pulp offered simply one example of a global slump in commodity
prices. The world abruptly found itself bedeviled by excess
capacity just as demand slumped, and so markets were awash with
Russian steel, Chilean copper, American grain, Colombian coffee and
Saudi oil.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, after one of the great booms in economic history,
commodity prices on average are still 12 percent lower than the
average in 1990. Metals on average now cost just two-thirds as much
as eight years ago. After adjusting for inflation, oil costs less
than it has for 25 years, since before the 1973 oil shock.

 &HT;    Atlanta, N.C. lure venture capital
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta and North Carolina's Research Triangle
Park bolstered their reputations as Southern hotbeds for venture
capital by churning out record numbers of deals last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta market ranked first in the region with investors
pouring $282.8 million into 77 deals in 1998, according to figures
released Tuesday by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. The
Research Triangle Park raked in 59 deals worth $247.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta and the Research Triangle Park _ economic
powerhouses located 400 miles apart on the booming I-40/I-85
corridor _ have emerged as regional models for attracting venture
capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists typically invest in start-up or fledgling
technology companies that find it difficult to arrange traditional
financing, such as bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a growing number of technology success stories
_ such as Atlanta's MindSpring Enterprises, an Internet access
provider _ have fueled interest among entrepreneurs who want to
start companies and venture capitalists who want to invest in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little ecosystem is happening here, with more deals and more
companies,'' said J. Michael Cummins, chief executive of the
Georgia Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology in
Atlanta. ``We are seeing an attitude change.''
</P>
<P>
   To the detriment of technology start-ups across the South,
deep-pocketed investors traditionally have favored putting money
into real estate, textiles, soft drinks ``and other things you can
touch, feel and understand,'' Cummins said.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest figures from PricewaterhouseCoopers' fourth
annual survey show technology investments are rising fast,
particularly in North Carolina and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Florida reeled in $301.4 million in 49 deals last year, ranking
it first among Southern states, PricewaterhouseCoopers said. But
those deals were spread across Florida, unlike the bunching of
deals in metro Atlanta and the Research Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   In the region, North Carolina ranked second, with $300.4 million
in 73 deals. Georgia finished third in investments, with 83 deals
valued at $298.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a humbling comparison for the South's venture capital
leaders, California's Silicon Valley hauled in $4.6 billion in 787
deals last year. Nationwide, venture capitalists invested $14.3
billion in 2,856 deals.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in metro Atlanta and the Research Triangle Park, a
6,900-acre technology park between Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill,
predicted venture capitalists will invest even greater sums in
coming years as the flurry of activity builds upon itself.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's far-reaching microchip initiative, the Yamacraw
Mission, is seeking $2.5 million from the state Legislature in
technology seed funds in the fiscal year starting July 1, Cummins
said. Private investors would be required to put up $3 for every $1
in state funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is starting to bear the fruit of a lot of years of
hard work,'' said Maureen Morrison, a PricewaterhouseCoopers
partner in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the Research Triangle Park is attracting venture
capitalists from outside the region. A major Atlanta-based firm,
Noro-Moseley Partners, has invested $8 million in four Research
Triangle deals since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to get over the hump as far as outside money
is concerned,'' said David Blivin, managing director for
Durham-based Southeast Interactive Technology Funds, the Research
Triangle's largest venture capital firm.

<P>
   ON RUSSIA IN DEBT
</P>
<P>
   Falling commodity prices were making ripples around the world.
They were especially brutal to Russia, whose main export is oil and
gas, with the upshot that Russia's economy was falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody much noticed at first. As with Asia a year earlier, it
was too easy to be dazzled by the black Mercedes-Benzes, the
diamond rings and the crowded discos. In 1997, Russia's stock
market performed the best in the world, rising 149 percent in
dollar terms, according to the calculations of the International
Finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At GUM department store, Solomatin, the chairman, had been
equally optimistic. He had sunk GUM's entire nest egg of liquid
assets _ then worth $33 million _ into the stock and bond markets.
It had seemed a good deal, for the bonds were paying interest rates
of 100 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes Russia's economy was showing severe
strains, and many of them were unrelated to the Asian crisis. Tax
collection was abysmal, government budget deficits were growing,
short-term debt was rising and President Boris Yeltsin's health
seemed to be fading.
</P>
<P>
   Asian countries had had problems with private debts, but
Russia's problems were a bit different: the government itself was
addicted to debt. And with one-third of government revenues coming
from taxes on oil and gas that were steadily falling in price, it
was difficult to foresee an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main reason for our crisis was not the Asian
crisis,'' said Sergei Kiriyenko, who at 37 became Russian prime
minister last spring. ``It was that for years we had expenses
higher than revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, in contrast with Asia and Latin America, where
markets were deeply rooted, Russia had only the flimsiest
attachment to market principles and was being savaged by corruption
and organized crime. Russia's top prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov,
estimates that half of all Russia's commercial banks are
mob-controlled and that criminals control about half of the gross
national product.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Russia's economy was quietly disintegrating, public
support from the United States, Germany and other countries
bolstered the impression that, as one economist put it, Russia was
``too nuclear to go bust.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, the Clinton administration pushed the monetary
fund for a major bailout, even though officials worried privately
about whether it would work. In the end the fund worked out a
$17.1-billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Americans did not fully notice the crisis developing,
but Russians did _ and their behavior undermines the notion that
around the world it was only Western investment bankers who took
poor locals to the cleaners. In Russia it was more the other way
around. Russian capital flight steadily averaged $1 billion per
month for the last three years, moving to places like Britain and
Switzerland, which Russians felt they could trust. The first $4.8
billion installment of the fund bailout quickly disappeared as
Russian oligarchs cashed out their rubles and took their money out
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As Charles Dallara of the Institute of International Finance in
Washington described it, ``So in a broad sense, you had the West,
the IMF, Western banks and Western governments pouring money in the
front door, and a select group of Russian citizens taking it out
the back door.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Russian legislature balked at many of the
required reforms. Investors panicked, and on Aug. 17, computer
screens flashed the bad news: the bailout had collapsed, and Russia
stopped propping up the ruble and defaulted on domestic bonds.
Overnight, the bonds were virtually worthless, and stocks fell from
dollars to pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rubin says he has no regrets about the July bailout.
``I'd do the same thing again,'' he said. ``Given the stake we had
in an economically viable Russia, it was a risk worth taking. It
had a realistic chance.''
</P>
<P>
   GUM, which had been seeking listings on overseas stock
exchanges, sent despondent faxes that day to its investment banker
friends, postponing those plans indefinitely. The crisis sent the
ruble tumbling to more than 18 to the dollar from 6, and so in
effect all the imports in GUM (and most of the inventory is
imported) tripled in price just as Russian consumers were losing
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The shock waves from the Russian default were felt around the
world, partly because they shattered the assumption of an
international safety net. The United States and the monetary fund
had wanted to save Russia, and their failure sobered investors,
sending them scurrying once more away from risk.
</P>
<P>
   After the Russian crisis, the upheavals in international markets
nearly destroyed Long-Term Capital Management, the most glamorous
of America's hedge funds. More than a year earlier, the hedge funds
had helped to trigger the financial crisis in Thailand, setting in
motion a chain reaction that ultimately came back to take Long-Term
Capital to the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital tumbled for the same reasons that Thailand
did. American financiers may like to think of themselves as a world
apart from Thai bankers, but there was a certain symmetry in what
went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand and Long-Term Capital were both victims of their own
successes, which bred hubris and carelessness toward risks. They
also both borrowed more money than they should have, and got into
trouble when their bets went wrong. And, to be fair, both had a
certain amount of bad luck.

<P>
   ON WHEN TO BAIL OUT
</P>
<P>
   The Russian default sideswiped Brazil, which for a time lost
money from foreign reserves at the rate of $1 billion a day. So
when Brazil wobbled, the United States braced itself. In November
1998, the Brazilian government agreed to a $41.3-billion bailout
package from the fund, which Clinton arranged early, while Brazil
was still solvent.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States it was a remarkable turnaround. A bit more
than a year earlier, the Clinton administration had refused to
contribute money to the Thai bailout and had prevented Japan from
distributing aid. This time, Clinton himself led the intervention
and the United States came up with $5 billion of the package.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a bad bet. Despite widespread recognition that the
Brazilian currency, the real, was overvalued, Washington made
essentially the same mistake as it had in Russia: it trusted the
legislators to quickly pass reforms that would reassure investors.
Again the markets won, and in January Brazil was forced to float
the real.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the currency in turn forced Brazil to raise
interest rates to try to attract foreign money _ the pattern that
had occurred a year earlier in Indonesia or South Korea. And the
high interest rates, in turn, are depressing Brazil's economy and
casting a shadow over Argentina, Mexico and all of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   At Aracruz, Aguiar has solemnly watched the stock price fall,
from $22 a share in the summer of 1997 to $11.81 on Tuesday. Over
the years, he has taken desperate measures to compete globally,
trimming Aracruz's work force by nearly two-thirds, cutting back on
health and dental benefits, and turning to a cheaper contractor to
run the company cafeteria. Just since the crisis hit in the fall,
he has pared staffing another 10 percent, and he prays it will be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the globe, in the third floor boardroom of
GUM, Solomatin has a grand view of Red Square _ and a terrible view
of his company's future.
</P>
<P>
   All the company's plans are on hold; the money in defaulted
bonds is locked up; all the stock is now worth only $36 million,
about the cost of the inventory.
</P>
<P>
   That makes GUM a candidate for a takeover by a foreign company,
and two European companies are said to have been eyeing it. But
Solomatin sounds skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would take us over?'' he asked. ``Investor fear of Russia
is so great that nobody would consider buying us.''

   NEW YORK _ It was lunchtime, but the 30 or so women and one man
crowded into a Manhattan meeting room weren't eating anything.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the focus was on how much weight each had lost, using
the newest Weight Watchers program, which assigns points to foods
based on their fat, fiber and calorie content. In the true spirit
of a support group, they burst into applause when Yvonne, a tall
brunette in a business suit, declared that she had shed 21 pounds,
her goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Weight Watchers gives me a sense of control over my
food and my weight,'' she said before adding: ``Ore-Ida has these
French fries that are 35 for three points. You don't have to
deprive yourselves, guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne, who would not give her last name, said later that she
was unaware that Ore-Ida and Weight Watchers International were
owned by the same concern: H.J. Heinz Co.
</P>
<P>
   Food and diet have been an odd couple at Heinz for 21 years, and
many analysts, seeing a certain dissonance between the businesses,
have long expected the company to sell Weight Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   But across the country and parts of Europe, Weight Watchers'
offices like the one in Manhattan are drawing a surge of new
customers at a time when Heinz's larger businesses like ketchup are
just treading water. A dud just two years ago, Weight Watchers,
while still a small part of the Pittsburgh-based company, is now
the fastest-growing division in Heinz's empire of Star-Kist canned
tuna, Smart Ones and Budget Gourmet frozen dinners, Nine Lives pet
food, baby food, pickles and ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of Weight Watchers has come amid a general upturn in
the industry as people flee diet drugs. A simplified nutritional
program and new marketing has also bolstered the chain, creating a
peculiar quandary for Heinz's relatively new chief executive,
William Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first took over this position two years ago, Bill
Johnson said to me, `Kent, we're concerned, and your challenge is
to prove to Pittsburgh that this business is alive and well,'''
said Kent Kreh, the chief executive of Weight Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have delivered beyond Pittsburgh's expectations,'' Kreh
said.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether Heinz may take advantage of Weight
Watchers' success and sell the chain. Some analysts speculate that
it is time to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to do it at the top of the cycle, instead of at the
bad part of the cycle,'' said John McMillin, a food industry
analyst with Prudential Securities, who noted that a sale would add
needed cash to Heinz's balance sheet. Heinz does not break out
profits for Weight Watchers, but McMillin estimates yearly
worldwide revenue at $500 million for its classroom business and
another $500 million in packaged foods.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts say Heinz, which has been cutting back and
reorganizing some of its food businesses, may keep Weight Watchers
after all.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Johnson is expected to discuss Weight Watchers as
well as additional cost-cutting and reorganization at a meeting
with Wall Street analysts in Naples, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Heinz have risen sharply in the last week, in apparent
anticipation that further measures will be announced Wednesday,
analysts said. Since reaching a 52-week low of $50.875 on Feb. 8,
the stock has risen more than 9 percent. Still, the stock is down
nearly 10 percent from its 52-week high of $61.75 on Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to a request for comment on Weight
Watchers' future, Johnson said, ``We are now in the process of
finalizing that review and can't comment further.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Weight Watchers was in deep decline. Attendance,
measured by individual visits, had fallen from a high of 32 million
in 1990 to just 18 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When Heinz's longtime chief executive, Anthony O'Reilly, stepped
down in 1997, speculation grew that Weight Watchers would soon be
sold off. The acquisition had been seen as a personal project of
O'Reilly, who is remembered for taking a pen from his pocket to
structure the terms of the deal with one of the diet center's
co-founders. And late last year, the manufacturing of Weight
Watchers frozen foods was combined with Ore-Ida, leaving the
classroom activities separate from the food business.
</P>
<P>
   But like a waistline that stubbornly reinflates, Weight Watchers
has come back. Enrollment has climbed steadily, and is expected to
hit 30 million by the time Heinz's fiscal year ends in April, Kreh
said. January, February and March are peak enrollment months, he
said, because that is when people resolve to do something about
their eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   Revamping Weight Watchers began by shifting slightly the
philosophy behind its program. While a balanced diet is encouraged,
people are told they can eat whatever they want, as long as their
daily point totals fall within the recommended range for their
height and weight. Someone who weighs between 150 and 174 pounds
could consume between 20 and 27 points, according to the program.
</P>
<P>
   The new points program, 1-2-3 Success, replaced a more
complicated nutritional analysis. The program was introduced in the
United States about 16 months ago after similar success in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Group leaders also stopped selling the Weight Watchers frozen
foods during the group meetings, though they do beat the drum
constantly on the need to stay enrolled for as long as a year. At
the meetings, customers are weighed and note their weight on file
cards. During the discussions, they exchange information on food
and exercise, and occasionally work on thornier issues, like
whether they have been overeating to compensate for loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to appeal to people is the program's recent emphasis
on freedom of choice, which permits all kinds of foods but tries to
push people toward healthy eating habits. Vegetables can be
consumed in unlimited quantities. (Ketchup, meanwhile, is worth one
point a quarter-cup.) Words like ``diet'' are discouraged, and
exercise is applauded.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new program has received a boost from an advertising
campaign that features Sarah Ferguson, the duchess of York, whose
weight had been the subject of much mockery in the British news
media. After losing 11 pounds from her peak of 210 pounds while
attending the British version of the Weight Watchers program, she
signed on as a spokeswoman in early 1997 for a fee estimated to be
between $1 million and $2 million. (A personal trainer and other
methods have helped her lose more weight.) In addition to
television ads, the duchess has lent her name to a Weight Watchers
cookbook and other products.
</P>
<P>
   Weight Watchers, and diet centers like Jenny Craig Inc., have
also benefited as people flee diet drugs, frightened by reports
about two diet pills that were pulled from the market because of
links to heart valve damage. The commercial weight-loss business is
both large and competitive, with Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig,
the two biggest classroom-based methods, up against diets that
offer meal substitutes like milkshakes.
</P>
<P>
   But disillusionment over dieting can also damage diet centers
like Weight Watchers. Complaints that the diet industry was
promising excessive weight loss with little effort or expense led
to an agreement last Wednesday by the Federal Trade Commission and
companies including Weight Watchers. The companies agreed to
publish standard disclosures on the details of their programs, what
consumers can expect, their staff credentials and the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Weight Watchers has a relatively positive image among
nutrition experts. ``Its educational approach is very sound,'' said
Morgan Downey, executive director of the American Obesity
Association, a Washington nonprofit advocacy group. ``It's not
overhyped.''
</P>
<P>
   And the program is clearly very profitable. ``This is a business
that has an incredible operating leverage,'' said Erika Gritman
Long, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. ``If you have 10 people in the
class, and you add two more people, that increment goes straight to
the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreh said the break-even point was more like 25 people in a
class.
</P>
<P>
   Each person pays about $30 to enroll, and another fee, which
ranges from $10 to $14, gets tacked on every week for the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been able to shave costs by not hawking frozen
foods to its classes anymore; many meetings have been moved out of
their old spaces, which were taken up by giant freezers, and into
tinier and cheaper real estate. And along with the rising
enrollment has come another trend: People seem to be staying in the
program longer, eight weeks vs. six or seven in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Weight Watchers has made itself mobile, with At Work programs
set up at offices. And it has tried to be accessible to other
customers, like new mothers, with a Mommy and Me program that has
existed for several years and allows participants to bring small
children to class.
</P>
<P>
   Products for sale in the classrooms include $20 calculators for
adding up food points and copies of ``Dieting with the Duchess,'' a
lifestyle and recipe book published by Simon &AMP; Schuster (listed at
$25) last month, a year after ``Dining with the Duchess.''
</P>
<P>
   Members can also part with $6 apiece for books that list various
foods and their point allocations; the books at least seem
cosmopolitan, demystifying the impact of foods like the Japanese
shabu shabu (8 points), a Starbucks latte (2 points) and, perhaps
in honor of the duchess, Yorkshire pudding (6 points for a
four-inch square).
</P>
<P>
   Kreh says he has his eye on more ways to raise the Weight
Watchers profile and keep the cash rolling in. Last month, the
company signed a licensing agreement with Warnaco for a line of
what Kreh called ``shape wear and active wear,'' mostly women's
undergarments.
</P>
<P>
   The line will be called Weight Watchers In Control, which
perhaps is what is going on at Heinz as well.

 &HT;    Delta announces buyout offer of Atlantic Southeast Airlines
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines made a $700 million offer Tuesday to
buy commuter affiliate Atlantic Southeast Airlines, saying it plans
to run the smaller carrier as a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and ASA, both based in Atlanta, would maintain separate
names, workforces and pay scales.
</P>
<P>
   But Delta, which already owns 28 percent of ASA, would gain
total control of its operations, management and airport facilities,
as well as the deployment of ASA's new regional jets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that would enable Delta to use the jets to its best
advantage and fortify its position in the Southeast. Ownership also
protects Delta from losing a key partner to another acquirer.
</P>
<P>
   ASA provides connecting flights at Delta's hubs in Atlanta and
Dallas-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Chief Operating Officer Maurice Worth said the buyout
poses no labor obstacles _ such as the pilot strife that hobbled
American Airlines _ because workers wouldn't be integrated and
Delta's pilot contract allows such an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Delta expects no regulatory opposition, since the
two carriers already are close allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not competing airlines now, so there's no dimunition of
competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta is offering $34 a share for stock in ASA Holdings Inc., a
slight premium over Tuesday's opening price of $31.93 3/4. The
price jumped $1.93 3/4, to $33.75, on news of the proposed buyout.
Delta shares slid 6 1/4 cents to $52.50.
</P>
<P>
   The tender offer commences Monday, and Delta said it hopes to
gain the necessary 51 percent shareholder approval and close the
deal by spring.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst James D. Parker of Robinson Humphrey said the price
appears low. He said he was puzzled why ASA, which has long enjoyed
stout revenue and earnings growth, didn't drive a harder bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ASA Chairman George F. Pickett Jr., 57, shed little light on the
reasons for the sale, which he said was approved unanimously by the
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a personal decision,'' Pickett said. ``It was an
opportunity that arose, and we accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing,
Pickett and his wife, Elizabeth, control 499,937 ASA Holdings
shares worth nearly $17 million under Delta's offer. ASA Holdings
President John Beiser and his wife, Maureen, control 292,147
shares, worth $9.9 million. Other officers and directors hold
smaller amounts
</P>
<P>
   Pickett and Beiser founded ASA in 1979, shortly after airline
deregulation, with a single Twin Otter aircraft flying between
Atlanta and Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Delta chose ASA as its commuter partner, and the duo
built ASA into one of the most consistently profitable airlines
anywhere. It now has 88 planes, including 19 jets, and 2,700
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Chief Financial Officer Warren Jenson said ASA posts
higher profit margins that Delta, adding ``we would expect this
deal to be additive to our margins'' in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Other major airlines, including American, Northwest, Continental
and US Airways, already own commuter subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about such a move by Delta has arisen periodically,
but the idea moved to the front burner under the management team of
new CEO Leo Mullin, who recently approached Pickett.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is approved, Delta will install John Selvaggio to
oversee the ASA subsdiary. He was recently hired from US Airways,
where he headed the commuter division. Pickett and Beiser would
give up their titles and become advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said it expects to improve ``fundamental customer service
activities'' at ASA, which has been plagued by spates of canceled
flights, lost bags and staffing shortages while trying to keep up
with the growth of Delta's Atlanta hub.
</P>
<P>
   Worth denied those problems prodded the buyout offer but added,
``It should be a much smoother operation in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, analyst Parker said the deal could tighten
Delta's grip on Hartsfield International Airport, where the carrier
and ASA control 81 percent of the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Parker noted ASA has 18 gates that Delta could borrow for its
own flights as needed. In such a scenario, ASA might use a remote
gate facility or bus passengers to the terminal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman said there are no plans for such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Ray Neidl of ING Barings Furman Selz said Delta's move
reflects ``a basic change of philosophy driven by the impact of
regional jets.'' The planes are being widely adopted by commuter
airlines, which can use them to fly longer routes.
</P>
<P>
   As an independent company, Neidl noted, ASA is obligated to use
its jets as profitably as possible, even if it means competing for
passengers with Delta. A buyout would prevent that potential
conflict, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said the deal won't affect Delta's relationships with
other commuter affiliates. Comair feeds Delta flights in Cincinnati
and Orlando, while SkyWest feeds them in Salt Lake City. Both are
independent and, unlike ASA, also work with other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of pilot unions at both Delta and ASA withheld
judgment on the deal, although they agreed it is permitted under
their contracts and poses no integration issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface I would have to say it's probably very
positive,'' said Frank Ramsey Jr., an Atlanta-based ASA captain and
chairman of its pilot union.

TOP SCHOOL AT GROUND ZERO OF QUOTA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Complete writethru _ adds last-minute settlement reached,
edits to conform)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At the vortex of the highest-stakes legal
dispute in the history of San Francisco's public schools is Lowell
High School, a fiercely competitive campus that is being shaped by
race.
</P>
<P>
   It is Lowell that required Chinese-American students to score
higher than children of other races. It is Lowell that uses a
system of racial percentages in an attempt to bring diversity into
its hallowed halls.
</P>
<P>
   And more than any other school, it is Lowell that sparked the
1994 lawsuit that threatened to topple the 15-year-old federal
desegregation plan in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was scheduled to begin Tuesday in federal court here,
but a last-minute settlement was reached in the case. District
Judge William Orrick ordered that the details of the agreement be
kept confidential until a hearing Wednesday on preliminary approval
of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Many fates hinge on the outcome to determine the fate of racial
quotas in San Francisco schools: Some $37 million a year in state
desegregation funds could be lost if the plan is ruled
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The district, now wedded to diversity, would face enormous
challenges if its practice of limiting any race to no more than 45
percent of students at a given school is struck down. Thousands of
children could be reassigned to different schools.
</P>
<P>
   But no other school would be altered as much as Lowell, the
city's oldest academic high school that traditionally admits
students based on their grades alone, not the neighborhood in which
they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you make real efforts, you won't find many
African-Americans and Latinos at Lowell,'' said Frank Wu, a Howard
University law professor who has written extensively on affirmative
action. ``At Lowell, a strictly by-the-numbers approach reportedly
results in an almost entirely Asian-American student body. That's
lamentable and should be unacceptable to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The best and the brightest students of all races in San
Francisco attend Lowell, and the high standards usually pay off.
Lowell sends a higher proportion of graduates to the University of
California than any other public school in California. It is the
alma mater of several Nobel laureates, the late Gov. Edmund Brown
and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   But because blacks and Hispanics overall have lower test scores
than whites or ethnic Asians, they're significantly
underrepresented at Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   And without the rule limiting any one race _ in Lowell's case
Chinese-Americans _ to 45 percent of the student body, the numbers
of blacks and Hispanics could shrink dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, blacks make up 17 percent of all San Francisco
public school students, but 4 percent of Lowell's 2,515 students.
Hispanics comprise 21 percent of the district's students, but 11
percent of Lowell's students. Chinese-Americans comprise 28 percent
of the district's population, but 43 percent of Lowell's students.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, between 70 and 80 percent of students are admitted
solely by their test scores and grades. The remaining 20 to 30
percent have slightly lower grades, but earn compensating
``value-added diversity points'' if their families are poor, if
they live in public housing, if their parents were not able to
attend college.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that without those value-added points, very few
black or Hispanic students would get into Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the diversity-points system note that all students
admitted to Lowell are outstanding. And students from disadvantaged
backgrounds may face greater obstacles in their efforts to study,
or even get to school.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Cohen, who heads Lowell's admissions committee, said that
if grades alone determine who gets into Lowell, the city's most
prestigious public school could become exclusively white and ethnic
Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the desegregation plan under fire began in 1983 to
settle a lawsuit filed against the school district and the state by
the NAACP, which argued successfully that San Francisco schools
discriminated against blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade later, it was three frustrated Chinese-American
families who filed the lawsuit, angry that their children were
turned away from schools only because those schools had hit their
limit of Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese-American parents and students have suffered under a
quota system in San Francisco. It's risen its ugly head most
noticeably, but not exclusively, at Lowell,'' said Amy Chang, an
attorney who is on the board of directors with the Asian-American
Legal Foundation, a nonprofit bipartisan group formed in 1994 to
support the Chinese-Americans' cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard from parents whose children were saying, `I wish I
wasn't Chinese ... I don't know why I should do my homework when
ultimately I'm judged by my race,''' Chang said. ``We feel strongly
that all children should be treated equally.''

DEAN RECALLS `ADVERSARY'   EHRLICHMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Dean, whose testimony helped put many of President
Nixon's aides behind bars in the era of Watergate, Tuesday recalled
John Ehrlichman as an ``adversary'' who ``pointed the finger at
others'' when Ehrlichman was charged and later jailed for the
coverup of the botched burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman, who died Sunday in Atlanta, never had kind words for
Dean, who replaced him as Nixon's top counsel at the ripe age of
30.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Dean extended sympathies to Ehrlichman's family, but
said his predecessor had sought to blame others for his own deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the best of relationships with him,'' Dean said.
``And I didn't have a lot of contact with him after the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   After participating in the Watergate coverup, Dean said he
decided he had to end it, and he is aware that those actions _ and
his House testimony against Nixon _ cast him as the whistleblower
and even led to his own jail sentence for being part of the
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Dean acknowledged that he is routinely trashed by former
colleague G. Gordon Liddy, on radio and television. That was as
close as Dean came to addressing Liddy's allegation _ repeated on
the airwaves Tuesday _ that Dean perjured himself to implicate
Ehrlichman in wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Dean has been toiling as an investment banker, buying and
selling businesses, and living with his wife, Maureen, whose own
face is familiar to television viewers from the Watergate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But he wrested himself from that comfortable life _ after being
recruited by agents for television talk shows _ to become a regular
commentator on MSNBC on the Clinton impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's impeachment came up, Dean said he felt obliged to
take to the microphones again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out to talk about this because they were trying to
paint it as Watergate II and it's not,'' Dean said after speaking
to lawyers and labor leaders at an Emerson College breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said that while be believed resignation was a better option
for Nixon than impeachment, he felt the opposite when it came to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (resignation) was a terrible idea, regardless of
what he'd done,'' Dean said, adding that he believed that fighting
the charges in some cases is a better alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would become the procedure, and then all you would have to
do is threaten to impeach a president,'' to oust him, Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean predicted that Kenneth Starr may be the last independent
prosecutor but he predicted Starr would move to indict Clinton.
Dean bases his prophecy on his knowledge of a leaked copy of the
special master's investigation of Starr's alleged leaks to the
media. A Newsweek friend with a copy of the report told Dean that
Starr will be exonerated, depriving Attorney General Janet Reno of
an excuse to fire Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecuting the president, especially with the court rulings
that have weakened privileges of the executive and his protectors,
will mean testimony by Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will create practical problems and it will be the worst
Secret Service detail to ever be on, because they'd go (down) with
him.''

   ROME _ Enraged by the capture of the foremost Kurdish rebel
leader, protesters stormed diplomatic posts throughout Europe on
Tuesday, taking hostages and setting fires _ and in some cities,
even setting themselves on fire.
</P>
<P>
   With what seemed like extraordinary coordination, Kurds in
Paris, Moscow, London, Frankfurt, Milan, Bern and more than a dozen
other cities went on rampages of rage and protest over the arrest
of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers Party. They held
rallies, seized consulates, battled police and threatened mass
suicides.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, many hundreds of Kurds had been arrested
and some of the hostages _ but not all _ had been released. At
least three Kurds in European cities had set themselves on fire,
including a 17-year-old girl in Germany, who like the others was
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds in Europe did not focus their anger on Turkey, which
captured Ocalan in Nairobi, Kenya, late on Monday. Instead, they
turned their rage on Greece, which at least for a while had
provided him shelter, and on Kenya _ the two countries they
believed betrayed him in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, apparently had been
providing Ocalan with a place to hide after he was forced to leave
Italy last month. Government officials in both Athens and Nairobi
nervously denied being the ones who actually turned Ocalan over to
Turkish security forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Istanbul, Turkey, about 1,000 Kurds marched through a Kurdish
neighborhood, setting cars on fire. But there were also
demonstrations of joy in Turkey by other Turks, who view Ocalan as
a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 20 million Kurds in Turkey and nearby
countries, who have long suffered persecution by successive
governments of countries in which they live. Ocalan has led a
14-year often-violent guerrilla movement for Kurdish self-rule and
civil rights in Turkey, which has been met with violent repression
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Athens were relatively quiet on Tuesday, perhaps
because Greek police rounded up more than 350 Kurds preemptively
early in the morning and held them in an abandoned army camp. In
the evening, under tight security, a rally of Greeks and Kurds in
support of Ocalan took place in downtown Athens without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Europe had no such early warning, though. Nations that had
sought to avoid getting drawn into the dispute between Kurdish
separatists and the Turkish government, fearing a backlash of
violence in their own countries, were engulfed by the crisis
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, Kurdish protesters took the Greek ambassador to
Austria and his wife hostage in their embassy, while others set
fire to the Kenyan Embassy there.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, where Ocalan had hoped to go after leaving
Kenya, by some reports, about 150 Kurds stormed the Greek
ambassador's residence in the Hague about 5 a.m. and took three
hostages, including the ambassador's wife and their 8-year-old son.
Riot police charged into a crowd of sympathizers who had gathered
outside the residence but were unable to force their way into the
building.
</P>
<P>
   In Bonn, Germany, protesters took two hostages at the Kenyan
Embassy and another at the Greek Embassy. In Leipzig, protesters
took three people hostage at the Greek Embassy but later released
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These attacks weren't really organized,'' said Mehmet Atac, a
28-year-old Kurd who was among several hundred who stood vigil
outside the Greek consulate in Frankfurt this afternoon after Kurds
occupied it. ``We heard news reports that Ocalan had been arrested,
and we all started calling each other to see what we should do. It
was one person talking to another and to another.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also less forceful, but equally fervent, marches by
chanting demonstrators outside United Nations buildings in Geneva
and other European cities and at the gates of the Council of Europe
headquarters in Strasbourg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, a spokesman a group that calls itself the
Kurdish Parliament in exile issued a statement asking demonstrators
in Europe to desist. Some did.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters in Moscow walked out of the Greek Embassy at midday
and surrendered to Russian police. Fourteen men and two women who
occupied the Kenyan Embassy in Paris for more than three hours,
threatening to immolate themselves and their hostages, surrendered
quietly to the Paris police. And by evening, French police had
liberated all occupied consulates and embassies. But in other
places, many others said they would not give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stay here until we get some answers from the Greek
authorities,'' one of the Kurds occupying the Greek Embassy in
London told a British radio station. ``We are not representing
anyone, but I can tell you that we have support'' from the
Kurdistan Workers Party, Ocalan's group.
</P>
<P>
   Police surrounded that embassy after an estimated 50 Kurdish
protesters broke into the building about 2:30 a.m. and held a
custodian hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, as many as 600 demonstrators held back by steel
barricades fought briefly with police, who used dogs and truncheons
to quell the violence. One Kurdish woman set herself on fire and
was badly injured before a police officer could put out the flames
with a fire extinguisher.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the Kurds inside the embassy, who gave his name only
as Ofter, told reporters by telephone: ``We are completely
committed. We will do anything if we are made to leave. The
protesters inside are ready to burn themselves or throw themselves
out of the windows if the police try to break in. We will stay here
for as long as it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which had refused to issue an extradition order for
Ocalan last November because officials feared it would provoke the
very kind of violence that sprang up on Tuesday, was not spared
despite all its caution. About 500,000 Kurds live in Germany,
including 10,000 in Frankfurt. Police and demonstrators battled in
nine German cities, from Leipzig to Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Schily, the German interior minister, pleaded with the
Kurds to leave the various consulates peacefully. Police in
Frankfurt used truncheons and water cannons to subdue Kurds who
were turning over cars. Between 100 and 200 demonstrators were
arrested there after clashes with police this morning, and hundreds
more were arrested in Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the '60s-era French student radical who is
now a representative of the Green Party in the European Parliament,
arrived in Frankfurt late Tuesday afternoon to act as a mediator.
Police had cordoned off the street where the Greek consulate is
situated and surrounded the building with trucks, video cameras and
even water cannons. But they also allowed more than a hundred
Kurdish demonstrators to remain in front of the occupied building
and to sing protest songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, a 17-year-old Kurdish girl
set herself on fire and was taken to the hospital with severe
burns.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder sought on Tuesday to distance
Germany from the Ocalan affair. ``This is a matter that only
affects the countries involved _ those that extradited him and
Turkey,'' he said. ``The German government is not dealing with this
matter.''

</P>
<P>
   For months, Ocalan had appealed to European countries for
political asylum or an international trial that would allow him to
avoid being deported to Turkey, where he could face the death
penalty. Turkey applied intense pressure, and Syria, Russia and
finally Italy expelled him. Ocalan was unable to find harbor
elsewhere in Europe and ended up in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 million Kurds live in Turkey, most in the poor
southeastern region. Kurds share a common language, related to
Iran's Farsi, and many are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Kurds were promised a homeland in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres,
which carved up Turkey after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, fought to
regain the land, destroying plans for a Kurdish state. There have
been numerous Kurdish revolts since.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, Kurds are not recognized as a minority. Recognized
minorities have the right to teach in their respective languages. A
ban imposed by Turkey's last military government on the use of
Kurdish in unofficial settings was lifted in 1991, but Kurdish is
illegal in broadcasts and in educational or political settings. A
court case to ban Turkey's main pro-Kurdish party is under way.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as 30 protesters surrendered four hours after
storming the Greek consulate in Milan, Italy, and holding six
people hostage, including the consul, the Italian government
implored Turkey to give Ocalan a fair trial. Italy had refused to
extradite him to Turkey last November, citing a law that bans Italy
from extraditing prisoners to countries that use capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Veltroni, leader of the largest party in Italy's
center-left government, warned Turkey on Tuesday not to apply the
death penalty, saying, ``That would place Turkey irretrievably
outside Europe.''

WEIGHT WATCHERS IS NOT ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Calif., Fla.)  (With WEIGHT-WATCHERS)

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

<P>
   Weight Watchers has plenty of company in the weight-loss
business.
</P>
<P>
   Far older than Weight Watchers, which was founded in 1963, is
TOPS Club Inc., a nonprofit organization whose initials stand for
Take Off Pounds Sensibly. The organization began in 1948, and today
has about 275,000 members in the United States and Canada who pay
$20 a year to join, said a spokeswoman, Susan Trones.
</P>
<P>
   TOPS is based in Milwaukee and maintains a site on the Web
(www.tops.org). Its informal motto, Ms. Trones said, is: ``Your
doctor provides the diet; we provide the `Do it.''' To that end,
the organization does not prescribe particular weight-loss plans
but stresses support at group meetings. ``More and more research is
pointing to the fact that with any kind of lifestyle change _
whether it is losing weight, quitting smoking or getting out of a
bad marriage _group support seems to be the key ingredient,'' Ms.
Trones said.
</P>
<P>
   Another widely known program is the publicly traded Jenny Craig
Inc., which boasts on its Web site (www.jennycraig.com) that it is
the only ``pure play investment opportunity in the field of weight
management.'' Founded in 1983 and based in La Jolla, Calif., the
company's method includes classes for moral support and an emphasis
on healthy eating habits and exercise, and products like gingko
biloba extract.
</P>
<P>
   Slim-Fast Foods Co.'s weight-loss program, which also maintains
a site on the Web (www.slimfast.com), urges people to consume its
milkshakes twice a day, with one regular meal in the evening. The
privately held company, based in West Palm Beach, Fla., calls its
plan ``an easy, delicious way to lose weight,'' though no estimates
are available on the number of people who participate in the
program.

HENRY KENDALL, 72; NOBEL LAUREATE, MIT PHYSICS PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry W. Kendall, professor of physics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, a 1990 Nobel laureate for the discovery of
the building blocks of matter, and cofounder of the Union of
Concerned Scientists, died Monday in Florida during a diving
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kendall, 72, was diving with a friend from the National
Geographic Society at Wakulla Springs State Park in Florida. Mr.
Kendall, an experienced diver and underwater photographer, was
taking underwater pictures and was later found in water 6 to 8 feet
deep at the edge of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Ris, executive director of the Union of Concerned
Scientists in Cambridge, Mass., of which Mr. Kendall had been
chairman for the last 25 years, said Tuesday that Mr. Kendall
``firmly believed that scientists could _ and should _ play an
important role in public policy debates.''
</P>
<P>
   The group strove to carry out that principle, becoming strongly
involved in controversies over nuclear weapons, nuclear power
plants, the Star Wars defense initiative, and global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``His leadership of UCS was deeply rooted in the belief that,
given accurate and credible information, the public and
policymakers would, ultimately, make the right choices about the
future,'' Ris said.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Nobel laureate Jerome Friedman of MIT said Tuesday that
Mr. Kendall ``was an outstanding scientist and an outstanding human
being who worked tirelessly for the betterment of society.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy Tuesday showed that Mr. Kendall had not drowned,
according to officials at the Wakulla County sheriff's office.
There was no water in his lungs, and there was air in his diving
tank. Police planned further tests on the diving equipment to see
if it malfunctioned, and other tests were being performed to
determine the cause of death. Results are not expected for two to
three weeks, said a spokesman for the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kendall won the Nobel prize in physics in 1990, along with
Friedman and Richard Taylor of Stanford, for work done at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in the 1960s that produced the
first direct evidence for the existence of quarks _ tiny particles
that combine in groups of three to form the subatomic particles,
such as protons, from which matter is made.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after learning he had won the prize, Mr. Kendall told
the Globe that he welcomed the honor ``because I think it will help
the UCS and my participation with them.'' He added that ``I have
always considered the things that we do there of very great
importance. . . . I have been astonished at the persistence of high
military budgets and unwise weapons systems, and a frequently
narrow view of what's needed to ensure our national security, and I
would like to see those things change.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he had concentrated much of his effort with the
UCS on increasing public and political awareness of the issue of
global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels. He told the
Globe that while this was not in his personal field of expertise,
``the greenhouse mechanism . . . is absolutely genuine, and is not
contested by anybody at all; it's not at all controversial. What is
not established at the present time is whether there is genuinely a
warming trend which you can attribute to greenhouse gases.''
</P>
<P>
   Even nine years ago the evidence was pointing that way, he said.
``What we are pushing for is at least for the country, and
hopefully other nations, to take the steps that don't cost anything
and which are beneficial on their own, independent of the
greenhouse effect,'' he said. ``And what is so striking and
poignant is that our government won't even take steps which are
otherwise beneficial and which would be the first lead-in to
controlling the greenhouse effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Such steps, he said then, included greater investment in known
clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power, to help make
their costs competitive with other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kendall was part of a panel of scientists who briefed
President Clinton on global warming in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ris said that recently Mr. Kendall had also been pressing for
the group to get involved in efforts to preserve endangered species
and biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kendall had continued to be active in his own research and
the work of the UCS, Ris said. Unlike many researchers of his
standing, he enjoyed working with beginning students and continued
to teach a freshman physics lab at MIT. ``He was going as strong as
ever,'' he said. ``He was a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kendall, who earned his doctorate in physics at MIT in 1954,
taught at Stanford University from 1956 to 1961, and had been
teaching at MIT since then. He and his brother were principal
shareholders in the family business, Kendall Co., which made Curad
bandages, Curity diapers, and hospital equipment. They sold the
company in 1972 to Colgate Palmolive Co. for $512 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kendall leaves his brother, John, of Sharon.

MODERN ART'S MISSING LINK: THE JERSEY SCENE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Edward M. Gomez is the author of the New Design series (Rockport
Publishers), with volumes on Tokyo, Los Angeles, Paris and
London.  
 By EDWARD M. GOMEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any list of historic centers of modern art must include Paris,
New York, London, Berlin, Moscow and Vienna. And, of course, New
Brunswick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``Off Limits: Rutgers University and the Avant-Garde,
1957-1963,'' the Newark Museum has organized an illuminating
exhibition about one of modern art's lesser-known but pivotal
creative scenes. It unfolded at a moment when the art world was
transfixed by the apotheosis of Abstract Expressionism, and
still-nascent Pop Art had yet to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The time was the late 50s and early 60s, when a mutually
influential group of artists, teachers and students came together
at the Rutgers College and Douglass College campuses in New
Brunswick. There, they came up with radical notions and
rule-breaking experiments that helped sow the seeds of performance
art, installation art, conceptual art, Pop Art and the
international current in art known as Fluxus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off Limits,'' which traces this art-historical path, focuses
on the ideas and early work of Allan Kaprow, Robert Watts, George
Segal, Geoffrey Hendricks, Robert Whitman, Lucas Samaras, George
Brecht and Roy Lichtenstein, examining some of the better known of
these artists' work in unexpected contexts. The show opened
Thursday and will remain on view through May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``A desire to break down the barrier between art and life
inspired these artists,'' said Joseph Jacobs, the museum's curator
of American art and one of the exhibition's main organizers. ``So
they made art using real objects, real space and time, and live
human beings. They brought the audience into their art.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, several members of the Rutgers group attended or
dropped in on John Cage's experimental-composition classes at the
New School for Social Research in Manhattan. Cage taught his
now-legendary courses there from 1956 to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Students who soaked up the avant-garde master's ideas about a
new, collagelike music made from everyday, ambient sounds included
Kaprow, Brecht, Dick Higgins, Al Hansen, Jackson Mac Low and Toshi
Ichiyanagi. Segal sometimes joined Kaprow; and Watts, Whitman and
Larry Poons also turned up. A devotee of Zen Buddhism, Cage taught
his charges to regard music, like any slice of life, as simply an
endless succession of events transpiring in time and space. (Rare
recordings of some of their experimental soundworks are included in
the exhibition.)
</P>
<P>
   Kaprow, who joined the Rutgers College art faculty in 1953, was
one of the most charismatic figures on the New Brunswick scene.
Like his friend Robert Rauschenberg in the early 1950s, he
developed mixed-media assemblages unlike normal wall-mounted
pieces. With his background in philosophy and art history, he
became a spokesman for this new art form. In a seminal essay, ``The
Legacy of Jackson Pollock,'' he advanced his ideas about it.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Marter, a professor of art history at Rutgers who consulted
on the organization of ``Off Limits'' and edited the accompanying
book, writes in it that Kaprow's Pollock article, which Artnews
magazine published in 1958, ``was the first postmortem of Abstract
Expressionism to articulate a new direction for young artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaprow, she notes, ``championed an art that involved a spatial
extension to entangle the participant, breaking with conventional
painting, to an art more actively involved with ritual, magic and
life itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Kaprow's process, Jacobs said: ``He made what he called
Environments. Then, from Cage, he added the performer and gave
birth to a new form that was distinctly visual, especially in a
gallery context. Like musical compositions, each of these works had
its own score.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching beyond the confines even of ``action painting,'' these
works, with their staging and performance instructions, became
known as Happenings. In 1958, Kaprow showed his first Environment
at the Hansa Gallery in New York, filling rooms with mirrors,
dramatic lighting and sheets of cellophane suspended from the
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Happenings occurred on the Douglass College campus, but they
were first put in a conventional art context in 1959, when Kaprow
presented ``18 Happenings in 6 Parts'' at the Reuben Gallery in
downtown Manhattan. Moving beyond Cage's teaching and his own
Environments, Kaprow served up a barrage of sensory experiences _
slide projections, painting, a person squeezing oranges _ in a
procession of nonnarrative events.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the more conceptual, interactive Events of Brecht,
a scientist at Johnson &AMP; Johnson who invented the tampon, and the
later Fluxus artists usually required only simple props and brief
instructions. Often these few words were printed on small cards
that conveyed a participatory sense of fun and play.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout ``Off Limits,'' Jacobs and his colleagues have evoked
the humorous, often philosophical, sometimes subversive spirit of
the art on view. Their first wall panel explains a ``score'' in the
context of the period's art-as-life activities and invites viewers
to approach the show's thematic sections as the interactive
Happenings and Events that they describe and emulate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in many cases, ``Off Limits'' emphatically proposes:
``Please do touch the art.'' Brecht's signature pointing-finger
symbol, a pick-up from old commercial printing, serves as a
directional marker from one gallery to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Robinson, the museum's coordinator of special projects,
who has worked closely with Jacobs, said, ``A lot of this work is
open-ended and, at the same time, very cerebral, like Kaprow's
`Beauty Parlor III,' an Environment with masks and costumes that
visitors can put on, and photo booths where they can take their
pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson also pointed out works ``that go in another
direction,'' like Brecht's enigmatic ``Repository'' (1961), a wall
cabinet stuffed with found objects, including keys, bottle caps,
rubber balls and a preserved worm. Another is Brecht's ``Exit''
(1963), a metal commercial sign whose message _ part invitation,
part command _ becomes ambiguous in an art context.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Kaprow's dictum to make art that did not look
like art, what unifies all of the work on view in Newark is its
conceptual self-awareness. Thus, Lichtenstein's ``Portrait of Allan
Kaprow'' (1961) and ``Portrait of Ivan Karp'' (1961) do not
resemble their named subjects at all. Instead, they are two
identical, generic, clip-art-style images in an irony-laden series
that Lichtenstein could have continued indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Watts' ``Table for a Suicide Event'' (1961), a table
topped with a telephone, a latex glove and other common objects,
refers less to the unsettling act cited in its title than to the
implicit meaning of the steady accumulation, over time, of phone
calls and other everyday actions that inevitably lead to death.
</P>
<P>
   Following the comprehensive Pollock survey at the Museum of
Modern Art, and at a time when popular interest still seems keen
for all things 60s, ``Off Limits'' sheds light on the multilane
bridge that links the output of the Rutgers era to art forms of
later decades. It suggests that the roots of performance art lie
largely in the presentations of Kaprow and his colleagues at venues
like the Reuben Gallery, which existed only from 1959 to 1961.
</P>
<P>
   And Whitman emerges as one of the founding fathers of
installation art. His ``Shower'' (1963), on loan from Rauschenberg,
offered the innovative combination of a functioning showerhead and
a film projection of a woman standing beneath it; again, art made
from and blurring the boundary with real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Segal, with his plaster figures in `The Dinner Party,' and
Lichtenstein, with `Look Mickey,' were also scavenging from
ordinary life, albeit from radically different sources,'' Jacobs
said. ``And Samaras made a work about danger using real razor
blades.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his death in 1997, Lichtenstein told Jacobs and Ms.
Marter, ``If I had stayed in Oswego, nothing would have happened,'`
referring to the State University of New York campus where he
taught before moving to Rutgers. The artist was still a
conservative Abstract Expressionist painter when he was hired to
teach design at Douglass College in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the other Rutgers artists who recalled the period,''
Jacobs said, ``Roy recognized that it was special, liberating. But
it disappeared because it was too complicated and didn't lend
itself to an easy label.'' By 1963, the Reuben Gallery had closed,
Happenings had been publicized in the news media (and sometimes
parodied), artists like Kaprow and Lichtenstein had initiated
promising art-world careers, and members of the Rutgers group and
their activities had been absorbed by Fluxus or other art
movements.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Segal has jokingly said that he and Kaprow once
referred to their group's explosion of energy as ``The New
Brunswick School of Painting.'' But the ambitious, inventive, often
ephemeral work it produced, while not completely forgotten, had
never been examined as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``Off Limits,'' the Rutgers era has gained its
thoughtfully documented chapter in the history books _ even if the
rich diversity of its offerings still defies one simple name.

   HANOVER, N.H. _ Furious cries of ``Paternalism!'' and protest.
Canceled Winter Carnival parties replaced by rallies and meetings.
Tears and frantic calls home and blizzards of ``Blitzmail,'' the
college e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Dartmouth, an academically distinguished college also
known for a style of fraternity party so wild it inspired the movie
``Animal House,'' the last week has brought a level of turmoil that
old-timers say they have not seen since the place went co-ed 26
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What has so shaken the campus was an announcement by the Board
of Trustees and Dartmouth's new president, James Wright, that the
school must begin to change its fraternity-dominated social
culture. Among other things, the trustees said the system must be
``substantially co-educational'' and stamp out alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   And although officials are vague about the specifics, many
students read the announcement as presaging the imminent end of
their beloved fraternities and sororities, and responded as if the
college were abolishing their families, stripping them of their
friends and tearing down the venues for the fun that helps them
through scholastic stress and the northern winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dropped a massive bomb on the community here,'' said Sean
Maduck, president of the Chi Heorot fraternity, ``and everybody's
up in arms fighting over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth is permeated by fraternities and sororities to an
extent far above the national average and unusual in the Ivy
League. Freshmen are not eligible to join, but among upperclassmen,
about half are members of the 28 houses known collectively as the
Greek system. All but three are single-sex, and their basements
often serve as beer fountains and dance halls.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, only about 10 percent of college students are
fraternity or sorority members, said Jonathan Brant, spokesman for
the National Interfraternity Conference. And only a handful of
colleges over the last two or three decades have moved as
dramatically as Dartmouth toward disowning fraternities or
requiring they go co-ed: Williams, Colby, Middlebury, Amherst, and
Bowdoin came to mind, said Brant.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth fraternities have certainly calmed down quite a bit
since the Animal House days of the '60s, tethered by alcohol laws
and rules focused somewhat more on social service and speaking
programs. Though houses have occasionally been disciplined in
recent years for backsliding, the misogynistic, vomit-spattered
debauchery several of them were once known for is considered a
thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   But they continue to dominate the social life at Dartmouth and
that, the trustees decided, in a move that had been discussed for
years, contradicts the college's values.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a system that, finally, is more inclusive, is fuller,
and is more of a whole experience,'' Wright said in an interview.
``And this crosses lines of race and of background as well as lines
of gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright is presenting the new principles as a historic
opportunity to ``re-imagine'' campus life and give students more
``social choice.'' The trustees have laid down the parameters, he
said; now they are taking suggestions from students, beginning a
process that could last a year or so, and will be followed by more
years of change that will include building new gathering spots and
on-campus dormitories to alleviate the bed shortage that forces
hundreds of students off campus.
</P>
<P>
   But students have tended to focus mainly on Wright's firm
statement in the daily Dartmouth newspaper that ``this is not a
referendum'' and a headline trumpeting the end of the fraternity
system ``as we know it.'' Suddenly, this autumn's rush, the
courting ritual between members and prospective members, seemed in
jeopardy. So did many decades of tradition, prompting angry calls
and unconfirmed rumors of withdrawn pledges from among the 50,000
alumni _ though some voices of support as well, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Among about a dozen students interviewed on Monday in the Collis
student center, none supported the trustees' decision, though only
about half were members of Greek houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absolutely ludicrous to completely wipe out
something so many people are in favor of,'' said Jennifer Coup, a
senior and sorority member. In particular, she said, ``The
single-sex houses foster a lot of really strong bonds of
friendship. It's a very supportive environment for women that I
think, especially in these times of our lives, is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Kallie Willets, a senior who does not belong to a Greek house
but whose father did, said that when she heard of the trustees'
decision, ``I flipped out and left a message to my Dad: `Dad!
They're trying to kill the fraternity system!'''
</P>
<P>
   He has kept in close contact with his fraternity brothers, she
said, and ``I see the value of the system, that 30 years later
they're still close.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraternity defenders also argue that the Greek houses are not
exclusive in that all women and virtually all men who go through
the rush process are guaranteed an invitation to join from at least
one house. And many parties are open to all as well _ an important
social asset in a small town set in the snowy boondocks and
nicknamed Hangover by some.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant minority of the college's 4,300 undergraduates
dislike the houses as cliques and limiting, students say. And
Dartmouth faculty decided more than a decade ago that Greek houses'
exclusive-by-definition admissions, their behavioral problems and
sometimes downright anti-intellectual attitude outweighed their
pluses, and voted to recommend they be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the antithesis of what a liberal arts college should
be,'' said Prof. Hans Penner, a former dean of faculty, recalling
antics like fraternity brothers competing to see how long they
could go without leaving the house, including for classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to really try something new,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of the intensity of student reaction seemed to stem from
the simple fact that no one _ including the trustees _ knows what
that new thing will be.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Monday night with students that was broadcast over
the college's cable system, Wright and two trustees made clear that
though they would not bend on their principles, they wanted to
leave the particulars largely up to students to suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would happen fast, Wright said, assuring students that
autumn rush would proceed as planned, that the new system would
likely not be put into place while they were students, and that
nothing would be eliminated before a replacement was ready. There
was no set timetable either, they said, nor a formula for what
``substantially co-educational'' meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would that we had a plan,'' said Kate Stith-Cabranes, a
trustee. ``We don't have any secret plan up our sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   Among scores of students watching together in the Collis student
center, cries of ``Liar!'' came from the suspicious audience. And
for all the explaining done late into the night by the trustees,
when the meeting ended, students seemed little mollified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I'd pledge somewhere,'' said Andrew Sonnenborn,
class of '02. ``It irritates me there might be no pledges below
me.''

ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER INVESTIGATED FOR BRIBING WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon is under
police investigation on suspicion of bribery, his lawyer, Jacob
Weinroth, said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police are investigating allegations that Sharon bribed
a former army general, Avigdor Ben Gal, to give false testimony in
a libel trial in 1997. The libel suit was brought by Sharon, who
accused a newspaper of falsehoods regarding his conduct as defense
minister during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Sharon flew to New York so that his wife, who is ill,
could seek emergency medical care at Sloan-Kettering Hospital.
Police plan to question him when he returns to Israel, Weinroth
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday police interrogated Ben Gal, now a businessman and head
of the military aircraft industry, about a trip to Russia with
Sharon shortly before he testified at the libel trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, who was Israel's infrastructure minister at the time of
the trial, had taken Ben Gal along with him to Russia to explore a
deal on importing natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that on the face of it you can see the absurdity,''
Weinroth said. ``It's impossible to even think that a general in
the Israeli military can be bribed by just a ticket to Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The police investigation grows out of a complaint filed by the
Haaretz newspaper after it won the libel suit _ a victory that
Sharon has appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon had sued the paper for an article that asserted that
while defense minister he had misled the government of Menachem
Begin about his plans for the invasion of Lebanon in 1982. The
article, an opinion column on the op-ed page, detailed what it
called a pattern of Sharon's ``lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The columnist, Uzi Benziman, described what he characterized as
Sharon's willful deception of Begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menachem Begin knows very well that Sharon deceived him,''
Benziman wrote, ``but he doesn't want to hide behind the wide back
of the minister of defense for his responsibility as prime minister
for the war.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some testimony during the trial, Sharon had all
along intended to send Israeli troops deep into Lebanon. However,
the Haaretz article said, Sharon led the government to believe that
he was planning a more limited mission and that he only decided on
the more ambitious advance into Lebanon after the invasion was
already under way based on military realities on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the invasion, Ben Gal, a commander during the
Lebanon War, gave a lecture at an Israeli university at which he
spoke of a secret invasion plan by the army, about which, he said,
the government was kept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   During the libel trial, Haaretz called on Ben Gal to testify as
a supporting witness. But once on the stand, he surprised the
newspaper's lawyers by changing his interpretation of the invasion,
saying he had been wrong and apologizing to Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Ben Gal testified, an Israeli business newspaper
published a report of his trip to Russia with Sharon two weeks
earlier to explore the gas deal.
</P>
<P>
   After Haaretz won the case, the newspaper submitted a complaint
to the police, asking them to investigate whether there was any
connection between Ben Gal's testimony and the Russia trip.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Sarid, chairman of the leftist Meretz Party, also urged an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the government's lawyer, he said: ``It is strange
and odd that Ben Gal hid in his heart the alleged truth for such a
long period of time, without bothering to clean the stain off
Sharon earlier. Only now, after the joint tour of Russia and at a
time when Ben Gal is expecting as a private businessman his own
share in the natural gas deal does he suddenly remember to change
his version from bottom to top.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on Israeli television in 1997, Ben Gal said, ``I did
not discuss with Sharon matters relating to the trial, and this
trial has nothing to do with the trip.''

 &HT;    OUT OF THE ASHES
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ One wag claims that people will flock to
church if you give them something _ even ashes.
</P>
<P>
   And, true to form, many churches will be full for Ash Wednesday
services today on the first of the 40 days of Lent.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful will be marked with ashes on their foreheads as a
sign of death and decay, mortality, penance and other grim
reminders that life is nasty, brutish and short.
</P>
<P>
   And it is one of the most popular days in the church year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me the logic of it,'' said the Rev. Michael
Driscoll, pastor of St. Jude Roman Catholic Church in Boca Raton.
``I'm baffled by it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Driscoll knows that ashes have profound ritual power. They
are often mentioned in the Bible as a sign of humility, penance or
destruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham refers to himself as mere dust and ashes. The
long-suffering Job sat in ashes. Jesus mentioned sack cloth and
ashes as tools of repentance.
</P>
<P>
   But, most powerfully, ashes are an unambiguous sign of death.
Many clergy intone, as they impose ashes on the faithful,
``Remember thou art dust and to dust thou shall return.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like ashes. People flock to ashes, that very rude
reminder of mortality,'' said the Rev. Christopher Kelly, rector of
St. Christopher's Episcopal Church in West Palm Beach. ``Maybe it's
a reminder of a basic fact of life they don't see very often in our
society. We're going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of putting ashes on the forehead might be rooted
in ancient religious consciousness. Ashes may touch a chord in the
human spirit that recalls a time when the faithful painted their
bodies or used tattoos as a sign of religious commitment.
</P>
<P>
   And in a strange, ceremonial way, ashes smeared on the forehead
impart a kind of dual identity for the complex season of Lent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ash Wednesday may hark back to rituals where marking the body
was part of your religious commitment,'' said the Rev. Lesley
Northrop, associate professor of religion and culture at Florida
International University in Miami. ``There is something fundamental
or basic about having ashes rubbed on your head as a sign that you
are both sinner and believer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashes mark the desperate beginning of a grim journey that ends
in glory. They are a sign of the bad news that precedes the good
news of the Christian gospel.
</P>
<P>
   At services today, Christians confess they are sinners, subject
to death and helpless to change their sad lot in life. Ashes
signify that corrupt reality.
</P>
<P>
   But, Christians claim, God can use the ashes of humanity to
create new life through his son, Jesus. That's the Easter miracle
to which Ash Wednesday points. It's the radical claim at the heart
of the Christian message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking Band Aids,'' Kelly said. ``We are not
patching over defects of personality and sin and making a temporary
restitution. We're talking about change in Jesus Christ. The change
is from ashes into living flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, like most clergy, makes ashes each year by burning palms
saved from the Palm Sunday celebration of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Sunday tells the story of Jesus' triumphant entry into
Jerusalem, which led to Easter Day. So, the sign of man's humility
comes from the symbol of God's victory.
</P>
<P>
   And most churches with formal services, including Roman
Catholic, Episcopal and, more recently, many Lutheran, Methodist
and other Protestant traditions, will offer ashes today. Protestant
churches abandoned the practice during the Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   `It's something that's been catching on with increasing
frequency in the last 10 to 15 years,'' said the Rev. Kendall
Taylor, the West Palm Beach district supervisor of the United
Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   In the early church, individuals _ ostracized from the Christian
community by serious sins such as adultery or apostasy _ did public
penance until they were reconciled with the church, Driscoll said.
They wore sack cloth covered with ashes and begged from others
prayer and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   By the 6th century, the church began to substitute ritual acts
for individual public penance. Soon, ashes were widely used in
those services. And Christians not under church discipline began to
join in the penitential rites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1091, Pope Urban II ordered all churches to use ashes on the
day that was to become known as Ash Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And ashes still kick off the 40-day season of penance used to
anticipate Holy Week and Easter. Lent involves giving up bad
habits, taking on good ones, paying more attention to your spirit
and less to your body.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, all dairy and meat products _ any foods taken
from animals _ were forbidden in Lent. The abstinence was
rigorously enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivals, such as the New Orleans Mardi Gras, often preceded
Ash Wednesday for a last-gasp celebration before the rigors of Lent
began.
</P>
<P>
   And Lent spawned such things as hot cross buns, pretzels and
alternative rice and lentil dishes that replaced traditional foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, they developed so many wonderful foods for Lent that
I think people actually gain weight,'' said the Rev. SimeonCorona,
pastor of St. Mary's Orthodox Church in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Christians do not observe Ash Wednesday. Orthodox Lent
begins on a Monday, six weeks or 36 Lenten days, before Easter.
That was roughly a tenth, or a tithe, of the year in which to be
penitential.
</P>
<P>
   But Sundays are never part of Lent, so the actual number of days
to Easter is greater. Sunday is always a feast day of Jesus'
Resurrection when the discipline of Lent is relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Stories abound of faithful penitents waiting breathlessly for
the stroke of midnight on Saturday. Then, they could indulge in the
behavior they ``gave up'' for Lent. Smokers smoked. Others ate
chocolate or had a quick beer before bed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 7th century, the Western church added four days to Lent,
so the season began Wednesday and included 40 days for Lent in a
46-day period.
</P>
<P>
   That made Lent mirror other difficult periods of 40 in the
Bible. Jesus was 40 days in the wilderness, tempted by the devil.
Israel wandered 40 years in the wilderness before reaching the
promised land.
</P>
<P>
   But most scholars suggest that the roots of Lent are found in
nature's annual cycle. The Anglo-Saxon word, Lencten, which is the
root word for Lent, means spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lent has its roots in that period of the darkness of winter,''
Northrop said. ``Then you waited for signs that life would come
back again in spring, at Easter.''
</P>
<P>
   The cycle of life and death is played out in nature and in the
Christian story of the death and resurrection of Jesus. Lent
provides the context.
</P>
<P>
   And, for many, it begins with ashes rubbed on the forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a basic gloomy act that is linked to an incredible hope
for change and, somehow, eternal joy,'' Kelly said.

CASE MAY END SCHOOL DESEGREGATION IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Complete writethru _ adds settlement reached, edits to
conform)  
 (With: SCHOOLS-LOWELL; not optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Patrick Wong, Brian Ho and Hilary Chen were
turned away from the San Francisco public schools of their choice
for one undisputed reason: They are Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Wong, 14 in 1994, was denied a place at top-ranked Lowell High
School because, by policy, Chinese-American children must score
higher on admissions exams than students of other ethnic groups. Ho
and Chen, 5 and 8 at the time, were turned away from their
neighborhood elementary schools because the schools had reached
their quota of Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine, as a parent, seeing your son's hopes denied
in this way at the age of 14?'' said Patrick Wong's mother,
Charlene Wong Loen.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the students filed a class-action lawsuit
seeking to overturn San Francisco's desegregation plan.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was scheduled to begin Tuesday in federal court here,
but a last-minute settlement was reached in the case. District
Judge William Orrick ordered that the details of the agreement be
kept confidential until a hearing Wednesday on preliminary approval
of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome could end the practice of limiting any one race at a
school to 45 percent, and stop the busing set up to achieve that
quota. It could cost the 62,000-student San Francisco school system
$37 million each year in state aid. And, perhaps no less
disruptive, it could shift the boundaries of virtually every
neighborhood school in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition to racial quotas comes not just from
conservatives or from high-achieving Asian-Americans often excluded
by efforts to open doors for blacks and Hispanics. It also comes
from black parents and activists tired of having children bused
across town to meet a diversity formula.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the desegregation plan resulted from a lawsuit filed
against the school district by the NAACP in the 1970s on behalf of
black children.
</P>
<P>
   But the passing years have created an alliance between the NAACP
and the school district. They are now the city's most ardent
defenders of the desegregation system.
</P>
<P>
   Based on written statements by Orrick, who signed the federal
desegregation order in 1983, the school district was headed for
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Orrick said the district and the NAACP were ``utterly unprepared
to go to trial,'' and their failure to produce evidence in support
of the current system showed they had almost ``no likelihood of
prevailing at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is being closely watched nationwide because it raises
complex legal and social questions, such as whether the
desegregation order is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Girard, the lawyer representing the Chinese-American
families that sued to overturn the quotas, said the use of racial
classification is a violation of the 14th Amendment guarantee of
equal protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district and NAACP will tell you the (desegregation)
consent decree has done all of these wonderful things and created
all these great programs,'' Girard said. ``But you can't use an
unconstitutional means to achieve a wonderful end.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the desegregation consent decree, San Francisco's 62,000
students are divided into nine ethnic and racial categories:
American Indian, black, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean,
Spanish-surnamed, other white and other non-white. No group may
exceed more than 45 percent of any school, and at least four groups
must be represented at every school.
</P>
<P>
   Since that formula was devised in 1983, the state has poured
$300 million into San Francisco schools to achieve desegregation.
The state now spends $37 million per year, roughly 12 percent of
the district's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   School Superintendent Bill Rojas defends the consent decree and
the racial quota system, saying blacks and Hispanics need certain
preferences because they are disproportionately ``denied the means
to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Harris, an NAACP attorney, said nagging inequities
remain in the school system. Black students are disciplined at
higher rates than students of other races, he said. Schools are
desegregated, but because students are clumped by ability, many
classrooms are still segregated. There also are not enough minority
teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task was given to the district to make whole these black
kids who had been pushed aside,'' Harris said. ``The district has
shown they're capable, but they must apply this to all black kids,
not just some.''

WORLDWIDE PROTEST ERUPTS OVER REBEL LEADER'S ARREST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Supporters of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan rioted and stormed Greek and Kenyan embassies across Europe
and in Canada and Australia Tuesday, seizing hostages and setting
themselves ablaze in protest over the roles of those countries in
the capture of their leader.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest marked a major victory for Turkey, which has pursued
Ocalan for leading a 14-year insurgency that has led to the death
of some 30,000 people in Turkey. But it has set off fears in Europe
that the case will spark terrorist attacks and heighten tensions
between Europe's Turkish and Kurdish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction, apparently coordinated, underscored the capacity
of Kurdish militants to raise havoc in Europe. And it demonstrates
why European governments have been so reluctant to arrest the
Kurdish leader, who has been turned away by Italy and, in recent
weeks, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Ocalan's capture in Nairobi, hundreds of Kurdish
protesters had mobilized in more than 20 cities from London to
Vancouver to Sydney. From the Greek embassy in Copenhagen to a
Turkish prison cell, Ocalan supporters set themselves on fire,
leaving at least one dead and several others burned. In London, one
teen-age girl set her sweatshirt on fire, singing her hair and
face, before it was put out by police and fellow demonstrators
protesting near the Greek embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, demonstrators gate-crashed a Greek embassy compound,
seizing five hostages, including the ambassador and his wife. In
Frankfurt, protesters overturned cars and clashed with police. And
in Moscow, 50 Kurdish protesters, shouting ``Freedom to Ocalan''
and vowing to die for Ocalan, were detained by police after they
forced their way onto the grounds of the Greek embassy.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party, the PKK, vowed
to continue the fight against Turkey and charged US and Israel
intelligence with helping in the hunt for Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries were quick to declare their hands clean. Israel
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ``Israel had absolutely
nothing to do with the Ocalan affair.'' And a White House official
denied that the US played any direct role in the arrest or
extradition of Ocalan, but declined to comment if it assisted the
Turkish government in tracking Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously very pleased with the apprehension of this
terrorist leader,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   But US officials said privately that they have been actively
pressing governments to turn Ocalan over to the Turkish government.
A State Department official said while no Americans had been
targeted by Tuesday's violence, it had issued a warning to American
diplomats and travelers.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders and international human rights activists
appealed to the Turkish government to give Ocalan a fair trial and
resist handing down a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine urged Turkey to
``respect the rule of law'' in its trial of Ocalan. The Council on
Europe issued a statement calling on Turkey to adhere to
international ``human rights'' standards as it presses ahead with
Ocalan's prosecution. And the UN special rapporteur on torture,
Nigel Rodley, citing concerns that Ocalan may be subjected to
torture, called for establishment of an independent monitor to
ensure his rights are respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ocalan was initially taken to Istanbul before being
transfered to an uknown location outside Izmir, where he is
reportedly being interrogated,'' said Rodley. ``Fears have been
expressed that he may be subjected to torture or other forms of
ill-treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The US, meanwhile, urged Turkey to use the case as a test to
prove its respect for the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents an opportunity for Turkey to clearly show its
commitment to human rights by ensuring Ocalan is treated humanely
and is given an open and transparent and fair trial in accordance
with international standards of due process,'' said US national
security spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts predicted Ocalan's arrest would deal a deadly
blow to his rebel army, they voiced skepticism over Turkey's
ability to parlay the rebel's capture into an effort to solve the
ongoing conflict between the Kurds and Turkey, which has refused to
grant the Kurds even a small degree of cultural and political
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty hard blow to the PKK,'' said Neil Hicks, the
Middle East expert for the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
``But I'm not confident that the Turkish government is now going to
capitalize on its success.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials and human rights organizations say that Ocalan's
forces are responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of
people during its war for autonomy in southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since his arrest in December we have been pushing hard to see
him brought to justice,'' said Crowley. ``We have identified him as
a terrorist and we have worked with other governments to see that
there could be a trial.''

HILLARY CLINTON WOULD FACE OBSTACLES IN SENATE BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is under
growing pressure to run for the U.S. Senate from New York next
year, would face only minor technical hurdles if she chose to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But more subtle obstacles could prove to be a formidable bar to
her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the minor problems. She's not a New York resident. But
she could rent a place in the state at any time on or before
Election Day 2000 and still qualify to be on the ballot, according
to New York State Board of Elections spokesman Lee Daghlian.
</P>
<P>
   To win a place on the Democratic primary ballot, Clinton would
have to win 25 percent of the delegates at the party's state
convention in May 2000, according to Matthew Hiltzik, spokesman for
the New York Democratic Party. Piece of cake, say her backers.
</P>
<P>
   If for some reason she failed, they add, she would have no
trouble gathering 15,000 signatures on a petition by July 2000 to
force a primary race that September.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democratic experts say it would never come to that.
</P>
<P>
   Any opposition within the party would melt if she decides to
enter the race, they contend. The leading Democratic possibility so
far, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., has said that if Clinton runs, she
would forego her own race and enthusiastically support the first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   As New York Democratic politicians sang her praises, Clinton
issued a three-sentence statement Tuesday saying she was giving the
race ``careful thought.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she appreciated ``the large number of people who have
encouraged me to consider running'' for the seat being opened by
the retirement of Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to her husband's impeachment ordeal, which ended with
his acquittal by the Senate last Friday, she said she had not been
able to give much thought to a potential candidacy but would do so
now. She said she would make her decision later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the meantime,'' she said, ``I intend to continue to focus
my attention on the issues central to the president's agenda and on
which we have worked together for so many years.''
</P>
<P>
   As first lady, she has joined the president in cultivating New
York's wealthy elite on the fund-raising circuit, a huge
consideration in the state's ultra-expensive media market.
</P>
<P>
   Political professionals say up to $20 million is needed to win a
Senate seat in New York. That's the same amount of money
presidential candidates need to survive the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope the first lady will decide soon so that if she
refuses to run, Lowey or any other prospective candidate can move
quickly. Michael Tucker, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, said Democrats expect an announcement ``shortly
... by early March.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to be the star
attraction at a New York fund-raiser for the Democratic Party's
Women's Leadership Forum, and that could provide her an opportunity
to announce she will run.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Monday that ``she'd be great if she did
it'' and that he would enthusiastically support whatever decision
she makes.
</P>
<P>
   If she decides not to run, it might be because of the subtle
obstacles, one being her well-known penchant for privacy,
reinforced by Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and the
just-concluded impeachment debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are some major issues from her past that would surely
come up in any race she entered _ her role as leader of the
administration's ill-fated 1993-1994 attempt to extend health care
to the uninsured and her involvement in the Whitewater real estate
deals in Arkansas in the late 1970s and the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the fact that New York is no place for
political wallflowers. Not that she is one, but she may not want
the hassle. If New York City's feisty mayor, Rudolph Giuliani,
chooses to run on the Republican side, she could be in for a
mudbath reminiscent of last year's race between then Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., and Republican Senate incumbent Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Polls so far are sending mixed signals. One taken late last
month by the Marist Institute in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., showed her
beating Giuliani 53 percent to 42 percent. But a Utica, N.Y.-based
Zogby International poll, also last month, showed Giuliani beating
Clinton 47 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Family finances may weigh in against a Senate run. The
Whitewater investigation, the now-settled Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit and the Lewinsky matter have sent the Clintons'
legal bills skyrocketing. The Clinton Legal Expense Trust, set up
to help the couple defray legal costs, officially put the debt at
$4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That figure may rise when the trust issues a new accounting
report later this month. Hillary Clinton earned more than $1
million from her best-selling book ``It Takes a Village,'' but the
entire amount went to charity and to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clintons could earn large amounts after President Clinton
leaves office through speaking fees, service on corporate boards
and law practice. A Senate seat pays $136,673, a paltry sum to
those in the upper business and political realms.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in New York are dismissive what they see as a
Hillary Clinton candidacy bubble. ``At this point, it's a bit of a
longshot that she's going to run,'' said Terry O'Brien, spokesman
for the New York Republican State Committee. ``If she does, she'd
bring in a lot more baggage than the carpetbag she'd bring in from
Arkansas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, Republican Sen. Kenneth Keating, R-N.Y.,
tried to tag his Democratic opponent, Robert F. Kennedy, with the
label of ``carpetbagger.''
</P>
<P>
   The term originally was used to describe northerners who sought
private gain from Reconstruction governments in the post-Civil-War
South.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy moved to New York in August 1964 in order to run against
Keating. That November he demolished Keating at the polls.

 &HT;    The talk suddenly turns to Oscar
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion Week got a double dose of Oscar hysteria
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   First, at a breakfast, the upscale retailer Barney's announced a
joint venture with the Christie's of London auction house to raise
money for AIDS charities by selling 50 gowns stars have worn to the
Academy Awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Next, at a pre-lunch show at the Bryant Park Pavilion, Oscar de
la Renta gave matrons with money a reason to salivate.
</P>
<P>
   De la Renta's typical customer (Barbara Walters and Nancy
Kissinger being prime examples) is old enough to remember the Edith
Head-designed gown Janet Leigh wore to present the Oscar for best
original screenplay (for ``Room at the Top'') in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who wears de la Renta is also wealthy enough to place
a minimum bid of $2,000 for any one of the gowns being auctioned
March 18.
</P>
<P>
   Other Oscar gowns being auctioned include: Kate Winslet's green
silk gown by Givenchy (1997); Sharon Stone's Armani-Valentino-Gap
get-up (1995); and Cher's sheer-beaded gown by Bob Mackie (1983).
</P>
<P>
   As for de la Renta _ whose clientele is so faithful that the
ladies who lunch were lungeing from their limousines to secure
seats for the show _ the nominees for best fall colors are: camel,
ruby red, bright and burnt orange, hot pink and pale blue.
</P>
<P>
   New York's elegant elder statesman favors the A-line silhouette
for fall, with jackets and sweaters that hug the torso and skirts
that flare out to the knee. De la Renta went light on the detail
(sedate embroidery, pin-dot beading, scalloped hems) and heavy on
luxury fabrics such as silk, cashmere and fur.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Campbell modeled the de la Renta gown with the best chance
of being worn by some leading lady on Oscar night: a red satin
Shakespearean dress with fur trim at the breast, cuff and hem.

 &HT;    Johnson lassos stars for thematic downer
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Credit Betsey Johnson for this: attracting more
celebrities to her fall/winter runway show than any other designer
has so far this Fashion Week. In the crushing crowd Johnson
gathered at a cavernous Mercedes-Benz dealership, the notables
included: Aerosmith front man Steven Tyler, his bride and three of
his daughters; Blondie lead singer Debbie Harry; Jurassic rocker
Lou Reed; comedic actor Damon Wayans; and ``The Practice'' star
Dylan McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   As for Johnson's clothes? Credit denied. If there's a market for
the depressed, disheveled and disturbed looks she sent down the
runway, those shoppers should seek counseling. In her press notes,
Johnson said she designed with a mythical ``Seven Sisters'' in
mind, and she divided her show accordingly. Austerity, morbidity,
infancy, lasciviousness, homelessness, feminism and ego were the
themes. Perhaps reining in the excessive angst of her fall/winter
collection in time for the retail season should be Johnson's
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Blass out to pasture? Will 2000 be the year that Bill Blass
calls it quits? The designer hinted in the affirmative in a report
Tuesday in the trade publication Women's Wear Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Blass, who suffered a mild stroke in September during a personal
appearance at a Saks Fifth Avenue in Houston, has enjoyed a career
that's lasted more than half a century. At 76, Blass said, ``I'm
not sure I find fashion as stimulating as I once did.''
</P>
<P>
   The sole owner of his company, which caters mainly to rich,
mature women, Blass said he would ``sell it'' if he follows through
with tentative plans to bow out of the business next year.

 &HT;    Azria getting his act together
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Max Azria designs like a man fighting for respect. If his next
cold weather collection for BCBG doesn't win it for him, nothing
will. Customers might notice that BCBG keeps rising in price, but
that's principally because Azria's designs are becoming
increasingly complex, luxurious, intelligent and desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Though bulky, his hand-knit sweaters and sweater dresses
accentuate the physique. Though militaristic in style, his suits
made the runway-weary models look dainty and sweet. Though
disparate, colors like cream and green and blue look unified thanks
to Azria's deft hand.

 &HT;    Agreeing to disagree on TV's great moments
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Love Boat'' over Letterman? ``The Brady Bunch'' ahead of
``Upstairs, Downstairs?'' ``The Dating Game'' but no ``60
Minutes''? Obviously, the editors at Entertainment Weekly have been
watching so much television their brains have turned into TV
dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Those list-o-maniacs are at it again. This time, Entertainment
Weekly has come up with what it modestly calls the 100 Greatest
Moments in Television.
</P>
<P>
   They get a lot right: JFK's assassination and funeral is No. 1,
and Neil Armstrong, ``Roots,'' Johnny Carson, Oprah Winfrey and
Walter Cronkite are all appropriately high up. Most importantly,
the list emphasizes the mix of the serious (Edward R. Murrow,
Watergate hearings) and the silly (Dick Van Dyke's ottoman,
``Saturday Night Live''). That juxtaposition makes TV what it is.
</P>
<P>
   But still, you have to wonder about what was included (``Beverly
Hills, 90210,'' ``The Six Million Dollar Man)'' and what those
shows bumped. So here are 10 genuinely memorable TV ``moments''
(within EW's loose definition) that didn't make the Top 100 but
should be on any list, more or less in order of importance:
</P>
<P>
   1. The debut of CNN. The news network's coverage of the
beginning of the Persian Gulf War made the list at No. 44, but that
was just when everyone started paying attention. The importance of
the global village _ Marshall McLuhan's '60s soundbite, made real
in the '80s and '90s by Ted Turner _ arguably outweighs everything
else on the list.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``60 Minutes'' moves to Sundays. After three years foundering
in the ratings and bouncing around, CBS' newsmag found its home in
1971. It's now the most popular, profitable and influential TV news
program in history.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.'' For two brief but
intense years, the brothers brought true subversion into the
mainstream; their anti-Establishment (to use an ancient term)
sensibility was a precursor of much of popular TV today.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Brian's Song.'' Along with ``Duel'' (which made the list at
No. 59), this 1971 flick launched the made-for-TV movie. And don't
even start on the emotional component.
</P>
<P>
   5. Coverage of the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention. They said
the whole world was watching, and we were.
</P>
<P>
   6. Clarence Hill vs. Anita Thomas. The greatest he-said-she-said
ever. Real news and real entertainment in one big blur, as
addictive as heroin.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Jeopardy!'' goes into syndication. The smartest, and
longest-running, game show on TV was on and off from 1964 to 1984,
but it was when Alex Trebek took over and it moved to early
evenings that it became an institution.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``Roseanne.'' She may be nuts, but her sitcom was political,
hilarious and influential.
</P>
<P>
   9. Milton Berle. The first, and in his day the only, television
star.
</P>
<P>
   10. Baby Jessica down the well. Before the white Bronco (No. 30)
and Princess Di's funeral (No. 82), this was the defining media
event that we all cared about even if it had no actual impact on
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   ` '70s Show' to carry on
</P>
<P>
   Fox has renewed ``That '70s Show'' for the 1999-2000 TV season,
ordering up 25 episodes. The sitcom will have its season finale on
March 14 and then re-enter the Fox lineup in June as part of the
network's summer strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Fox changing lineup
</P>
<P>
   Fox is about to play the shuffle game.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 p.m. March 28, the network will debut Matt Groening's
``Futurama.'' The animated series will then air the following
Sunday at the same time April 4, but then move to 8:30 p.m.
Tuesdays on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Family Guy'' will then debut in its regular Sunday time
period at 8:30 p.m. April 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PJs'' will move to 9 p.m. Tuesdays starting April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, ``Guinness World Records: Primetime'' will be moved
to a new day and time.
</P>
<P>
   Raitt's turning moment
</P>
<P>
   On tonight's ``60 Minutes II'' (9 p.m. on CBS ), singer Bonnie
Raitt says the defining moment for her decision to be clean and
sober happened in Atlanta with the late Stevie Ray Vaughn. ``I saw
him the night he came out of recovery,'' Raitt says. ``He came and
sat in with me in Atlanta, Ga., . . . he was so nervous because he
had never played completely straight, and he burned a hole in the
sun . . . and I said, `There goes my last excuse. I do not have to
kill myself to play this music. And if he can do it, I can do it.'

   WASHINGTON _ After Vice President Al Gore addressed a
closed-door retreat of House Democrats in the Virginia countryside
last weekend, he called on one of his most ardent supporters, Rep.
Norm Dicks of Washington, who posed what had the ring of a staged
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it true, Mr. Vice President,'' Dicks asked, ``that if
you wrap this presidential nomination up quickly, you can quickly
turn your attention to raising money for House members?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Gore deadpanned. The House members erupted in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Had Dicks dared to try that question a year ago, he might well
have prompted jeers from the assembled Democrats. Many Democratic
lawmakers have never felt close personally to Gore _ and not long
ago were not about to concede, even in jest, that the presidential
nomination would be his in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the exchange at the retreat underscored how Gore, 50, has
emerged from the impeachment ordeal in a more commanding position
to capture the Democratic nomination than he would have if the
world had never heard of Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, the favorite of many House Democrats,
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, has decided not to take
on Gore. And among Republicans there is such a feeling of
inevitability to the vice president's quest to succeed Clinton that
former Vice President Dan Quayle, in announcing his exploratory
committee last week, proclaimed: ``I will win the nomination. And I
will beat Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   That is by no means to say that Gore will win the nomination.
After all, the primary season is a year away, and the field has not
been set. Even his advisers point out that the vice president has
hardly electrified the Democratic electorate _ and might not be a
particularly potent contender in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   Still, through circumstances and by his cautious navigation of
the Lewinsky matter, Gore has strengthened his chances. He has
always had an inside track, if for no other reason than that no
sitting vice president in modern times has been denied the
nomination of his party.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest boost to Gore's candidacy is Gephardt's decision not
to challenge him for the nomination. More than any other rival,
Gephardt had begun to build an infrastructure in the pivotal states
of Iowa and New Hampshire and he had the ability to assemble the
organization and amass the money to become a potent challenger.
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt's advisers said the central reason he did not move
forward was that the scandal led to the Democrats' unexpectedly
encouraging showing in the election last November _ and convinced
Gephardt that he should seize the opportunity to win the House back
and become speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt would have been the clear underdog, but would have made
the primary race for more treacherous and divisive for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprising advantage for Gore has been the Lewinsky
scandal, which essentially froze Gore in place as the Democratic
front-runner. The news media were so preoccupied with impeachment
that other potential candidates were frustrated in their efforts to
draw enough attention _ and traction _ to emerge early as credible
alternatives to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's only announced opponent is former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey. Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts may challenge him as
well Jesse Jackson. But two senators, who at the very least would
have caused headaches for Gore, will not run: Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the impeachment episode, Clinton was severely
hampered last fall in stumping for candidates around the country;
many did not want to be seen with him. That opened an even greater
opportunity for Gore, who campaigned and raised money aggressively
and cemented contacts with politicians who are in his debt as the
2000 campaign gets underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the president was, in a sense, taken out of the
campaign and Al Gore was the guy everybody was calling on to go to
this state and that,'' Dicks said, ``that gave him a great chance
to solidify himself with a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest that while Gore is still not considered as
effective a leader as Clinton, he has endured the White House
scandal with his personal ethics relatively untarnished. Of
Americans surveyed in a recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll about how
Gore's close association with Clinton would affect their voting, 57
percent said they would not be less likely to vote for Gore or that
it would make no difference; 39 percent said they would be less
likely to vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who views Gore's election as affirming his own legacy,
suggested at a Democratic dinner last month that he would reinforce
the notion that the vice president not be tarred by scandal,
saying, ``As you will hear me say increasingly in the months ahead,
any mistakes we made were my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers are so confident that impeachment can be turned
to their advantage that last week they sent a fund-raising
solicitation _ the first of the Gore campaign _ to hundreds of
thousands of past contributions that portrays Republicans as using
the scandal for partisan gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will our nation succumb to the forces of divisiveness,
extremism and personal destruction that threaten to engulf
Washington as I write this?'' Gore asked. Saying that people are
``tired of the politics of personal attack,'' Gore added: ``We must
not only move politics forward, but also upward, to a higher place.
And to do so, you and I must win a resounding victory in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment has had the unexpected effect of unifying the
Democratic Party, a turn that can only benefit Gore. Driven by
their anger at Republicans for pursuing impeachment _ not out of
devotion to Gore or his policies _ many party figures in Congress
and around the country have coalesced around three goals: defending
Clinton, winning back Congress, and electing Gore as president.

MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR REOPENS DEATH PENALTY QUEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Surrounded by uniformed police as well as parents whose
children were brutally murdered, Governor Paul Cellucci set the
stage Tuesday for another tumultuous showdown on Beacon Hill by
challenging the Legislature to enact a broad new death-penalty
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more determined than ever to wage this fight for
justice,'' Cellucci said, as he announced at a union hall that he
is filing an expanded capital-punishment bill.
</P>
<P>
   Describing murderers as ``monsters who do not deserve hope,''
Cellucci proposed a law that would provide a death sentence for 16
categories of murder, ranging from the killing of police officers
to murders involving torture, rape, kidnapping, robbery or other
serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was unsuccessful last year in his battle to restore
capital punishment, Cellucci added three new categories to his
original legislation. They include the murder of a child under 14;
murder involving domestic violence; and murder committed in front
of any member of the victim's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a more cowardly act than to kill a child,''
Cellucci said in explaining that addition. Adding drama to the
event were heartfelt appeals for action from two mothers who
daughters were murdered and the father of a state police officer
killed in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift, both former
death-penalty opponents, also insisted their bill had safeguards to
prevent the execution of an innocent person. Those include a
separate jury required by majority vote to impose the death
penalty; competent counsel to be provided for an accused murderer;
and a final review by the Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built in all these protections to ensure an innocent life
is not taken,'' Swift said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents chose to attack those very points. They noted that
in Illinois 10 people who have been sentenced to death over the
past 20 years and sitting on death row were found to be innocent
and released. There have been eight executions in that state during
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience in Illinois should be a lesson to us _ there
have been more innocent people released from death row than have
been executed,'' said John Roberts, executive director of the
American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. ``The same
protections against mistakes the governor claims for Massachusetts
exist in Illinois.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci would not say that the safeguards can absolutely
prevent the execution of an innocent person. In the past, he has
said it is possible an innocent person could be executed, but that
it was worth the price to use the death penalty to prevent murders
and provide justice for the victim's families.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's press conference sets in motion what will surely
be a re-enactment of the emotional debate in the fall of 1997, when
the House first approved a death-penalty bill by a one-vote margin,
then on reconsideration a week later defeated the measure on a tie
vote when a lawmaker switched his position. The passions over the
issue were inflamed by the abduction and murder of an East
Cambridge child, Jeffrey Curley.
</P>
<P>
   With a strong majority in the Senate backing the bill, the focus
again will be in the House, where few are predicting the outcome.
The 1998 legislative elections appear to have left the same
breakdown over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last month three House members _ two who voted
against and one who voted for the death penalty _ have resigned.
Elections for their seats will be held in late May. In addition,
two anti-death penalty Democratic House members, Representative
Emanuel Gus Serra of East Boston and Charlotte Golar Richie of
Dorchester, are expected to leave shortly to take government
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be right down to the wire,'' said House Majority
Leader William Nagle (D-Northampton), who managed the effort that
killed the bill in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that anti-death penalty House members were out of touch
with public sentiment, Cellucci called on voters to ``turn the heat
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All we know is that it is close,'' he said. ``That's why it is
very important for the citizens of the state who feel as we do to
let their legislators know.''
</P>
<P>
   But state Representative John Slattery (D-Peabody), whose switch
killed the death penalty last year, accused Cellucci of posturing
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone understands that juries and judges are not
infallible, and when you inform the public that we have a very
tough punishment _ life imprisonment without the possibility of
parole _ people say that is an appropriate and tough punishment for
first-degree murder,'' said Slattery, who won reelection easily,
although Cellucci went there to campaign for his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's new bill would reinstate the death penalty for these
categories of murder: The killing of law-enforcement officials; of
a child under 14; of a judge, juror, witness, or prosecuting
attorney; or of multiple victims. Also eligible would be: murder
while in violation of a restraining order; murder where a history
of domestic-violence existed; murder committed in the presence of
the victim's immediate family; murder by someone previously
convicted of first- or second-degree murder; or murder by someone
with two or more prior convictions which would qualify for the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Murders committed while trying to avoid arrest; by an inmate; in
the course of illegal drug trafficking; by a bomb or similar
device; by a contract killing; or in conjunction with torture,
rape, kidnapping, robbery, arson, home invasion, stalking, or
assault with intent to rape are also included.

 WASHINGTON: as president. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an example of the newfound unity at the Democratic retreat,
Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, an outspoken Gephardt loyalist,
declared his fealty to Gore. It is a far more kindly dynamic than
the tensions that festered for years between Gore and Gephardt, and
between Gephardt and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, downsides to the scandal for Gore. Even if
voters do not link the vice president to Clinton's conduct, they
might simply be eager for a change after eight years of a
Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore may win marks from some voters as a loyal vice
president, his opponents would probably portray him as too close to
the embattled president. They might find it irresistible to remind
voters that on the day Clinton was impeached, the vice president
pronounced him one of the greatest presidents in history. For all
the openings the scandal gave Gore to help Democratic candidates,
it also made it more difficult for him to develop a message
independent of Clinton _ and why he should succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the partisan tone at the Democratic retreat, the
District of Columbia's representative to Congress, Eleanor Holmes
Norton, was not shy about reminding the vice president of his
weakness as a general election candidate. She questioned Gore about
surveys showing that he would trail in a matchup either with Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas or Elizabeth Hanford Dole, former head of
the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was surprised by the question from a friendly supporter and
was a little taken aback,'' Ms. Norton recalled. ``It was a
question he should have knocked out of the ball park. He gave the
technical answer that nobody believes in polls at this point _ not
an answer as to why somebody like Bush would be leading.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign that the portrait of Democratic unity may be
overstated, Gephardt, in shelving his presidential ambitions, has
not endorsed Gore.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wellstone and Kerrey said in interviews that while Gore clearly
has the edge, he is still vulnerable in the Democratic primaries.
The lack of other candidates also could strengthen Bradley's
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, a spokesman for Bradley, argued that because the
political climate would ``continue to be dramatic and
unpredictable,'' Gore's nomination was not inevitable and that
impeachment has strengthened the resolve of voters interested in a
``fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore is untouched by the Clinton scandal, Republicans
vow to tar him with his own fund-raising embarrassments, such as
attending a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Vietnam was to Humphrey, values will be to Al Gore,''
predicted Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, referring to
former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. ``It's a dilemma from
which he cannot extricate himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Gore's image as a straight-arrow, Engler replied
with sarcasm, ``Sure, those weren't really Buddhists who weren't
really writing checks either. There's nobody who's ever run for
office in either party who believed that Al Gore ended up at a
Buddhist temple for a fund-raiser and didn't realize it was a
fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gore's advisers said he has survived the scandal in far
better shape than they had expected, and gave part of the credit to
a strategy of stroking his possible rivals and subtly discouraging
them from taking him on. It was no accident, they said, that the
only long national television interview that Gore has agreed to
recently was on the program of a Democrat he does not want to run,
the CNN program, ``Both Sides With Jesse Jackson.''

UAL CHIEF URGES DEFEAT OF PASSENGER RIGHTS MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Acknowledging that labor problems and weather have
given air travelers recent cause for rage, the top executive at
United Airlines nevertheless called Tuesday for the defeat of
proposals for a national ``passenger bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Greenwald, who is expected to step down as chairman and
CEO at United later this year, said measures proposed in Congress
to penalize airlines for service problems are not justified because
the US Department of Transportation logged a relatively small
number of passenger complaints last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although up 25 percent from 1997, he said in an address to the
Boston College Chief Executives Club, the number of complaints last
year was about 5,000 _ a number that is especially small when
compared with growth in the airline industry since the beginning of
deregulation in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't create competition by limiting it,'' he said. ``You
can't improve service by legislating it. You can't impose easy
answers on a system this complex.''
</P>
<P>
   The pending bills, sponsored by Representative Bud Shuster of
Pennsylvania, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Ron Wyden of
Oregon, and others would compensate passengers for delays.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee, has urged that passengers left sitting on runways be
paid twice the price of their ticket if they are left stranded on
runways more than two hours _ and three times the price if the
delay lasts three hours _ unless the cause is related to
air-traffic control problems.
</P>
<P>
   Characterizing the mood behind bills as a
``let's-get-the-airlines frenzy,'' Greenwald called on other
airlines, along with their customers and employees, government, and
the public, to join in a ``Declaration of Cooperation'' to ease
pressures that lead to late flights, cancellations, and poor
service.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald also called for collaborative support for help in
updating an aging air traffic control system and in funding
construction of new runways and gates at airports that cannot
efficiently handle existing traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald specifically cited the labor standoff that led to
cancellation of more than half of American Airlines flights for
several days last week, and made passing reference to the poor
response to bad weather in Detroit that snarled Northwest Airlines'
coast-to-coast system for nearly a week in January.
</P>
<P>
   Labor relations have ``always been a tough thing in this
business, as American Airlines just experienced, and as did their
stranded passengers,'' he said. ``We have got to find ways to keep
labor-management disagreements from getting in the way of serving
our passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   United, following several years of bitter relations with its
unions, gave labor 55 percent control of its stock and two seats on
its board of directors in 1994 in return for major wage and other
concessions. That agreement expires in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Greenwald, hired in 1994 as a peacemaker, said
in an interview that he plans to step down when his five-year
contract expires this year.

`SOUTH OF THE BORDER, WEST OF THE SUN': OBSESSION CRIPPLES 2
LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fragile vessel is the human psyche, or, as Hajime, the
narrator of Haruki Murakami's new novel of quiet psychological
power, puts it, ``A person can, just by living, damage another
human being beyond repair.'' And when that happens, the person who
causes the damage is forever wounded as well. ``Maybe I've lost the
chance to ever be a decent human being,'' Hajime says as he passes
his 20th birthday. ``The mistakes I'd committed _ maybe they were
part of my very makeup, an inescapable part of my being.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes that Hajime commits in ``South of the Border, West
of the Sun'' are not more than the usual acts of selfishness that
people are prone to as they pursue experience and gratification.
But in the hands of Murakami, a Japanese writer whose last book,
``The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,'' considerably enlarged his following
in the United States, these small gestures acquire a savage and
inexplicable force.
</P>
<P>
   ``South of the Border'' is in this sense a curious and absorbing
psychological mystery set in modern Japan, a probing meditation on
human fragility, the grip of obsession and the impenetrable,
erotically charged enigma that is the other.
</P>
<P>
   The central figure is Hajime, born, as he tells us on the first
page, early in the second half of the century, but he is a very
``average'' person from a ``typical'' family. He is, in other
words, an member of the generation that repopulated Japan after
World War II but that never experienced any terrible hardships. If
there is anything unusual about Hajime it is that he is an only
child when the typical Japanese family has several children, and
that bothers him because other people assume that he must therefore
be ``spoiled, weak and self-centered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what really depressed and hurt me was something else,''
Hajime continues. ``The fact that everything they thought about me
was true. I really was spoiled, weak and self-centered.''
</P>
<P>
   In his loneliness and sense of isolation, Hajime has but one
true friend, a girl named Shimamoto (this is her last name; Hajime
scarcely uses her first one) who is also an only child and an
afflicted one. Shimamoto had polio as a child, which left her with
a leg that she must drag along when she walks. Hajime and Shimamoto
have a close pubescent friendship, walking home from school
together, listening to records at Shimamoto's house, once and only
once and for ``a fleeting 10 seconds of time'' holding each other's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   When Hajime's family moves away, even though his new town is
only two train stations away from his old, he soon stops seeing
Shimamoto until many years later. But in her unobtrusive way, she
has stolen into his being, such that no other person can ever be
fully meaningful to him. As Hajime grows up and has adult
experiences with women, including a high-school sweetheart named
Izumi whom he betrays, his complaint about them is that ``I
couldn't find within these women something that was waiting just
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Hajime marries, with a certain amount of love but
little passion. Helped by a loan from his shady but prosperous
father-in-law, he opens a jazz bar, then another. He has two
children and achieves a degree of prosperity. And then one day
Shimamoto comes back into his life, a quarter-century after they
had parted as 12-year-olds. Shimamoto is much changed. She is a
beauty. She has had an operation to repair her leg. She seems to be
unhappily in the grip of some dark power about which she says
nothing. (It is frustrating that we never find out exactly what
power does control her.) The rest of ``South of the Border, West of
the Sun'' consists of the unfolding of the strangely obsessive
attraction, the ineffable meaning, that each has for the other.
</P>
<P>
   One of Murakami's skills is to create a vague sense of menace as
his characters go about their business. This menace is linked to
the psychological fragility that is the book's leitmotif, the deep
fissures in the carapace that each character lives within, like a
turtle hiding from predators. It is as if our carefully constructed
lives can be fatally punctured with the slightest mistake, and,
given the weakness and self-centeredness that Hajime finds at the
core of his nature, the danger of that puncture always seems near.
</P>
<P>
   An invisible force seems to invest Murakami's pages, a force
that compels his characters to the very acts that will ruin them.
One false move, or one unanticipated circumstance _ the arrival of
an uninvited visitor at just the wrong moment, a snowfall that
causes a flight to be canceled _ and the damage is done.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is ever made explicit in this book, smoothly
translated from the Japanese by Philip Gabriel, but that is because
such things can never be made explicit. Murakami's narrative style
is as spare and unadorned as a traditional Japanese room, so
seemingly empty that it needs to be furnished with the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something beyond what can be seen or felt,'' Hajime
tells the wife he has almost lost, and whom he may yet lose. This
is not a spiritual or religious statement; it is an analysis of
human hunger, of the void within. Murakami's delicate and affecting
fable explicates that void, and warns of the damage it can do.

`BESHKEMPIR': GROWING UP IN KYRGYZSTAN, BOYS WILL BE BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(HLW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are no computers, televisions, hi-fi's or fast
cars in the hard-scrabble world of Aktan Abdykalykov's film,
``Beshkempir,'' the first independent movie from the Central Asian
country (and former Soviet republic) of Kyrgyzstan. And on the rare
occasions when the residents of the dusty rural village in which
the film takes place go to the movies, they gape in awe at festive
images of belly dancing and communal celebration that portray a
life far more abundant than any they are ever likely to experience.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, filmed in black and white, with occasional bursts
into color, belongs to a neo-realist tradition pioneered by ``The
Bicycle Thief'' and Satyajit Ray's ``Apu Trilogy'' that
contemplates humanity at the most basic level. Although set in the
present, the society it portrays is pre-industrial. But because it
is centered on childhood, it all feels deeply familiar.
</P>
<P>
   With a soundtrack filled with the sounds of nature, and frequent
images of the wind in the trees, the movie transports you back to
an age when, no matter how sophisticated your environment might
have been, your experience of the natural world was fresh and
filled with a sense of discovery, an age when time seemed to open
up endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   The title character of the movie, which opens on Wednesday at
the Film Forum, is a young boy who is typical of the youths of his
village except for one difference: midway through the movie, during
a squabble with a friend, Beshkempir (Mirlan Abdykalykov) discovers
he is adopted. The information throws him into a tailspin, and for
a while he feels betrayed and rebellious.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Beshkempir's adoption and its personal
reverberations when he is told the truth is only a pretext for
presenting a cinematic portrait of a stable Central Asian culture
viewed through the eyes of a boy approaching puberty.
</P>
<P>
   Beshkempir runs around with a band of youths who amuse
themselves doing the same things boys do everywhere. They have
great fun rolling around in the mud and pulling risky pranks like
stirring up bees' nests and running. One day, they make a sculpture
of a female form in the sand and, giggling, take turns lying on top
of it and simulating sex.
</P>
<P>
   Their mischief-making instincts lead them to steal eggs and to
spy on an obese bare-breasted woman dipping into a bucket and
applying leeches to her flesh. The primary pre-adolescent courtship
ritual is co-ed bike riding and walking. It is competition over a
girl that leads one boy to accuse Beshkempir of being a foundling.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over Beshkempir's household is a beloved grandmother
who is frail but wise. It is her death that gives Beshkempir his
first awareness of mortality along with a more grown-up sense of
belonging to his family after he is called upon, according to
custom, to officiate at certain posthumous rites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beshkempir'' doesn't tell us anything about Kyrgyzstan's
politics, economics, religion or social structure. What this
gentle, touching film shows is a group of hard-working human beings
living their lives and experiencing the same family and peer-group
pressures that apply to people everywhere.

 &HT;    Volvo-Navistar: Takeover talk persists
 &HT;    By Don Baker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ News reports continue to fuel speculation
that Volvo AB might buy Navistar in a possible $3 billion deal that
would more than double Volvo's share of the North American truck
market.
</P>
<P>
   The British newspaper Financial Times reported Monday that Volvo
confirmed it has held talks with Navistar on a possible takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted an unnamed source close to the talks as
saying senior executives from Volvo have met with Navistar
officials to discuss a buyout offer.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen from both companies refused to comment, saying they
don't react to rumors.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Horne, Navistar chairman, president and chief executive
officer, is scheduled to appear on the cable business channel CNBC
at 8 a.m. today in a live interview, but Navistar's spokesman said
the appearance was previously scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-based automotive industry publication Stark's
Component Ledger reported Monday that Volvo also has opened
``exploratory discussions'' on buying Mack Trucks from French car
and truck maker Renault SA. But Renault has consistently said it
will not sell its Mack Trucks division, and Stark's reported that
Volvo is more interested in buying Navistar.
</P>
<P>
   One possible scenario sketched by Stark's has Volvo buying
Navistar and selling Navistar's diesel engine operations to Ford
Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo last month announced the sale of its car division to Ford
for $6.45 billion. Ford has a long-term contract to buy engines
from Navistar.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's office for
the study of automotive transportation, said Volvo is financially
prepared to take over an American truck maker because of the
billions of dollars it received in the deal with Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would certainly be in a buying mood, and they want to be
in the heavy trucks in North America,'' Cole said. ``Volvo's really
in a growth mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Other reports said Volvo may buy only Navistar's heavy truck
line, or may negotiate a deal for some kind of alliance with
Navistar.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry is experiencing the merger mania that the
banking industry went through last year, with Volvo being a big
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of standard operating procedure to line yourself up
with whoever is best positioned worldwide,'' Cole said. ``Merger
mania is just alive and well in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Navistar's stock climbed $2 a share Friday to $35.25. More than
1.25 million shares traded, nearly three times the daily average
volume of about 420,000 shares. The financial markets in the United
States were closed Monday for the federal holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has seen heavy trading volumes in the past week after
reports of a possible deal between Navistar and Volvo hit Wall
Street Feb. 8, and at least two investment firms have increased
their share of the company _ Fidelity Management and Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity reported Friday in Securities and Exchange Commission
filings that it now owns more than 4.6 million shares of Navistar
stock _ close to 7 percent of the company and valued at nearly $164
million.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon also filed a report with the SEC saying it owns more
than 4.1 million shares of Navistar, or 6.3 percent of the company
and valued at nearly $146 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Insurance Company of America previously reported it
owns a 7.2 percent share of Navistar, or 4.77 million shares valued
at more than $168 million.
</P>
<P>
   Navistar employees and local officials were talking about the
rumored deal Monday, expressing concern about the possible effect
on the company's Clark County operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will watch it with anxiety and hope it's for the betterment
of our community,'' said Clark County Commissioner John Detrick.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said a merger or acquisition is studied intensely by both
sides before the deal is signed, but it's hard to determine exactly
what will happen in a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't know what they're going to do until they get
you and then they're going to do what's in their best business
interest,'' Cole said. ``I would be surprised if they closed
facilities, but you never know.''

AMERICAN AIRLINES BACK TO `VIRTUALLY NORMAL' SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines, for the first time since pilots began a
sickout on Feb. 6, reported Tuesday that it was flying a
``virtually normal'' schedule of flights.
</P>
<P>
   The airline and the pilots union continued negotiations over the
issue that began the labor action: how fast nearly 2,000 junior
crew members at American will be promoted as a result of American's
purchase of Reno Air in December, and how soon pay raises at Reno
will take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the company were preparing for a hearing Wednesday
morning before a U.S. District Court judge in Dallas, who will
listen to arguments over how much the airline lost from the roughly
3,600 flights canceled after the judge ordered pilots back to work
on Feb. 10. The union handed over a $10 million check to the court
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   American, in a statement Tuesday evening, said, ``The airline is
enormously disappointed that no progress is being made in our
negotiations with the Allied Pilots Association, despite the fact
that we have put forth another enhanced proposal.'' Both the
airline and the union said they were not negotiating over the
amount of the fine to be imposed by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Jenkins, an aviation consultant and professor at George
Washington University, said the company's revenues per flight
averaged about $14,500, and that fuel costs _ about the only
expense American avoided, since all workers, even the pilots, got
paid anyway _ were about $2,000 a flight.
</P>
<P>
   American said Tuesday that it had canceled 6,656 flights, a few
hundred of them on Monday even though pilots were back at work. The
reason was that planes and crews were out of position. The airline,
a subsidiary of AMR Corp., flies about 2,250 flights on a typical
day.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
estimated total pretax losses at $60 million to $100 million. But,
he said, traffic would return to American, as it did to Northwest
after the strike there last year. ``As long as this doesn't happen
again for a year or two, the public will forget this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company says integrating the two airlines will take as long
as 22 months. The pilots want the pay changes to take effect
retroactive to last Dec. 23, when American bought Reno.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just Reno pilots who would receive pay increases.
For American pilots, the purchase creates about 250 new captain
slots. In a game of musical chairs, first officers already flying
for American will get all the new captains' jobs. To fill the jobs
of the newly promoted captains, other American crew members will be
promoted. In all, nearly 2,000 will win promotions _ and pay
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Air's 294 pilots will be added near the bottom of the
seniority list of the 9,300 American pilots. The lucky among Reno's
captains will be bumped down merely to first officers, while the
unlucky will fall to the level of flight engineers, who are the
third-ranking officers on jets that use three in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite falling to the bottom of the ladder, the Reno captains
will also benefit, according to the union. ``The senior guy at Reno
makes $72 bucks an hour, with six years seniority,'' said Richard
La Voy, president of the Allied Pilots Association. ``A Super 80
captain at American gets $105 an hour.'' The Super-80 is a
relatively small McDonnell Douglas aircraft flown by American.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The newly demoted captains from the former Reno Air could move
back up to captain if American's expansion continues. A spokesman
for their union, Capt. Robert Collins, said that for some of them,
a more important consideration was whether they could continue to
be based in the West, or would have to uproot their families and
move to Miami to work as reserve flight engineers. ``Even for an
increase in money, it's not worth it,'' he said, pointing out that
seniority also gave first pick of routes and work schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Reno pilots have given up hope that American will retain Reno as
a pilot base, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Integration requires training the crews on the unfamiliar
airplanes, and the airline is planning to train a few dozen a
month, and make the pay changes as the crew members change jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The union says a clause that has been in its contract for two
decades requires that all big jets operated by American be flown by
its members, including the 25 owned by Reno. So even if the job
changes cannot happen instantly, they say, the payroll changes
must. The union once accepted a two-tier wage scale but fought hard
to eliminate it in the last two contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principles are that we are not going to operate a
second-tier airline,'' La Voy said in a telephone interview. ``We
understand it takes some transition time, but in the meanwhile we
want to have the equivalent of our green book rates.'' The green
book is the union contract.
</P>
<P>
   At American, Chris Chiames, a spokesman, said the company was
simply following the same approach as when it bought another
airline, Air Cal, in 1988. ``We had a 2-year transition there,'' he
said.

DRAGGING DEATH SAID TO BE TIED TO FINDING RECRUITS FOR WHITE
SUPREMACY GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By RICK LYMAN 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ John William King had dreamed of forming his own
chapter of a white supremacist group but felt he needed some
dramatic event to catapult him into the limelight and attract
members.
</P>
<P>
   That, prosecutors said on Tuesday for the first time, is the
theory of why King and two other young white men chained a
49-year-old black man to the back of their pickup truck last June
and dragged him three miles down a country road until his flayed
and battered body was torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   The case against King, 24, the first of the three suspects to
come to trial in the hideous death of James Byrd Jr., opened
Tuesday morning before a jury of six men and five women _ all white
except for one black man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill King needed to do something dramatic that would get media
attention, which would attract, in their warped world, new
members,'' said the Jasper County prosecutor, Guy James Gray, in
his 10-minute opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a search of the apartment that King had been sharing with his
fellow defendants _ Shawn Berry, 23, and Lawrence Brewer, 31 _
police found not only racist books but also an article from the
December 1996 issue of Esquire magazine about the killing of Emmett
Till in Mississippi, a notorious racial slaying of the 1950s,
pointing out how the accused killers had gone free when an
all-white jury acquitted them.
</P>
<P>
   Police also found some of King's own racist writings, including
a constitution he had written for an organization he hoped to
create called the Texas Rebel Soldiers Division of the Confederate
Knights of America. Also found were a code of ethics for the group,
a list of bylaws, applications for membership and a letter to be
sent out to new members.
</P>
<P>
   The new organization was to begin operating on July 4, 1998,
Gray said. Prosecutors hope to prove that the timing of Byrd's
death, less than a month earlier, was intended to help in that
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   King became a member of the Confederate Knights of America, a
prison-based white supremacy group, while serving a jail term in
the mid-1990s. It was during this stretch that he met Brewer, also
a member of the racist group. Berry had been a friend of King since
their high school days.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also introduced letters on Tuesday that were written
by King to a 15-year-old girl who had been pen pal while he was in
prison. Those letters included numerous profanities and racist
statements, particularly about sexual relations between white women
and black men.
</P>
<P>
   Haden Cribbs, the chief defense lawyer, made no opening
statement on Tuesday but reserved the right to make one later. He
did pause during one of the breaks in the trial to shake his head
at the evidence that prosecutors had unveiled in the trial's
opening day. ``The evidence does appear overwhelming,'' Cribbs
said, but he cautioned against concluding that, as a result, King
is guilty of the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to local newspapers, King has admitted to being in
the pickup the night of the murder but said he had left the others
before the killing, which he blamed on a drug deal turned sour
between Berry and Byrd. King's lawyers have yet to reveal their
trial strategy.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 110-year-old courthouse sits on an elevated green in the
center of this town of 8,400 in the pine woods of East Texas, not
far from the Louisiana line. Dozens of police officers and federal
agents stood around the courthouse grounds and in all the
entrances, enforcing Judge Joe Bob Golden's order that any
protesters be kept two blocks or more away. There was no sign of
any protesters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, downtown streets were filled with a slow-moving parade
of patrol cars and bass boats _ the opening of the trial is
coinciding with the annual Bassmasters tournament, one of the
region's prime tourist draws _ and television vans wearing
satellite dishes were parked along one side of the courthouse
square and in most available empty lots in a one-block radius.
</P>
<P>
   King's father, suffering from emphysema, sat in the front row
behind the defense table, plastic tubing connected to an oxygen
canister beneath the long bench. At the defense table, King sat
quietly watching the testimony, often resting his head in his left
hand. His two lawyers, both white, sat to his left.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the aisle, behind the prosecution table and
nearer the jury, sat two rows of the friends and relatives of Byrd.
They shook their heads, hugged one another and often some of them
had to leave the courtroom when the evidence became especially
graphic. When, at one point, Byrd's battered shoe was pulled out of
an evidence bag, two of his sisters burst into tears. Seven local
and federal prosecutors were arrayed around the prosecution table.
Federal investigators and lawyers have helped in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead in the barrel-vaulted courtroom, two rows of ceiling
fans spun lazily while sunlight seeping between slats in the
plantation shutters splashed white stripes across the walls.
Golden, wearing no judicial robes, slouched down in his chair as he
listened to the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said they expected the testimony to last only until the
end of this week or early next. ``If things keep going the way they
are, I expect it to be to the jury by Monday,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   In a methodical manner, Gray spelled out the evidence he
intended to present against King.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses will testify, he said, that the three accused men left
their apartment at 1:30 a.m. on June 7 in Berry's pickup truck and
that an hour later a pickup truck of the same type and color was
seen with three men inside and another man, Byrd, riding in the
back.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-mile up a rough logging road northeast of town,
police found an area of flattened grass, strewn with beer bottles,
where they believe the three men beat and bound Byrd. Also found at
the scene were a lighter belonging to King, a wrench with Berry's
name scratched onto it, cigarette butts containing DNA traces of
all three suspects and a beer bottle containing DNA traces from
Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   Traces of Byrd's blood were found on the bottom of Berry's truck
and on one of its tires, Gray said, and spots of the victim's blood
were found on shoes owned by each of the accused men.
</P>
<P>
   For King, whose body is festooned with racist tattoos, the
motive, the prosecutor said, was hatred of black people, mixed with
a desire to do something sufficiently grand to bring alive his
dream of heading a racist gang in Jasper County.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young man is full of hate, and he has tattoos all over
his body that reflect that hatred,'' Gray said.

 &HT;    FIRST LADY CONFIRMS SHE'S WEIGHING SENATE BID
 &HT;    280&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After weeks of speculation about her plans, first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday she would give ''careful
thought'' to running for the U.S. Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement released late in the day, Mrs. Clinton said
''a large number of people'' have urged her to run for the seat
being vacated next year by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Clinton has made no decision, President Clinton has
said he would support her ''enthusiastically'' if she chose to run
and that he thinks she ''would be terrific'' in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton presided over a White House ceremony to
announce a request for nearly $1 billion in U.S. reconstruction aid
for Central American countries ravaged last fall by Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton, everyone wants to know if you're going to run
for the Senate,'' CBS News correspondent Bill Plant shouted as the
event concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, dressed in a taupe pants suit, just smiled at the
question and waved.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, though, she gave an answer of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am deeply gratified by the large number of people who have
encouraged me to consider running for the U.S. Senate seat being
vacated by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan,'' Mrs. Clinton said in
a statement released by her office. ''Until now, I have not been
able to do so, but I will give careful thought to a potential
candidacy in order to reach a decision later this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, she said, ''I intend to continue to focus my
attention on the issues central to the president's agenda and on
which we have worked together for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton did decide to run, a prime Republican opponent
would likely be Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's press secretary released a statement Tuesday evening
saying, in part, that ``he would be more encouraged to run''
against the first lady because ``Mrs. Clinton would be the No. 1
unifier of the Republican Party in New York state.''
</P>
<P>
   First ladies are usually active in some sort of social cause
after their husbands leave office.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush, for instance, has worked to decrease illiteracy.
Nancy Reagan holds occasional events to spotlight the problem of
drug abuse, And Rosalynn Carter has been active with her husband,
former President Jimmy Carter, on issues ranging from housing for
the poor to the eradication of guinea worm disease.
</P>
<P>
   No first lady, however, has ever run for a major elective
office, said historian Myra Gutin, author of ''The President's
Partner: The First Ladies in the 20th Century.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The only other first lady who held even a quasi-public office
was Eleanor Roosevelt,'' said Gutin.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt named his
wife assistant director of civilian defense, a post responsible for
certain types of home-front contingency planning. After several
months, however, she became a lightning rod for criticism of her
husband's prosecution of the war, and she resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who often cites Mrs. Roosevelt as a role model,
has suffered similar criticism, specifically for her role in
Clinton's ill-fated first-term effort to remake the country's
health-care system. That effort, a political disaster that many
blame for the Democrats' loss of Congress in 1994, was largely
managed by Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Her popularity has soared, however, as she has soldiered on in
the face of the year-long sex and deception scandal that threatened
her husband's presidency and cast her in the very public role of a
woman wronged.
</P>
<P>
   Wildly popular among Democrats, Mrs. Clinton routinely receives
extended standing ovations at public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   A December poll of Americans by the Gallup Organization of
Princeton, N.J., showed her to be the most admired woman in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup asked 1,055 randomly selected Americans 18 years old or
older to name the woman they most admired and their second choice.
Mrs. Clinton was mentioned by 28 percent of the respondents, far
outpacing television talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey, who was
second with 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the same poll, 67 percent of Americans said they had a
favorable impression of Mrs. Clinton, with 29 percent saying they
viewed her unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
   Her popularity has become a huge asset to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   She made repeated visits to New York last fall to raise money
for the successful Senate bid of former Rep. Charles Schumer. Her
support was regarded as vital to Schumer's upset victory over
veteran Republican Sen. Al D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   When she visited Buffalo, N.Y., with her husband for a speech
last month, it was Mrs. Clinton who stole the show, drawing a
frenzied ovation and evoking cries of support from members of the
audience, many of whom held up homemade signs encouraging her to
run for Moynihan's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mrs. Clinton's popularity and the endorsement of her
husband, Gutin, a professor of communications at Rider University
in Lawrenceville, N.J., expressed doubt that the first lady would
decide to run for the New York senate seat next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton could be effective as an advocate for any of the
issues involving children, women and human rights she has taken on,
Gutin said, without exposing herself to the public scrutiny that
would surely accompany a Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Clinton has been the subject of aggressive press
reports on her role in a host of issues _ from her billings at the
Rose law firm where she worked in Little Rock, Ark., while her
husband was governor, to her role in the firing of the White House
travel office staff shortly after Clinton became president _ she
has never been exposed to the rigors of her own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has been treated very differently than the president and
certainly than a candidate,'' said Gutin. ''The scrutiny would be
magnified'' were she to run for office, she said. ''And because of
who she is, that scrutiny would go up by at least a factor of
ten.''

FEDS INVESTIGATE LAWYER WHO SOUGHT MILLIONS IN TOBACCO AWARD FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Fla., Miss.) (nk) 
 By BARRY MEIER and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department has begun a preliminary investigation
involving a Texas lawyer who sought hundreds of millions in fees
for his role in the state's lawsuit against cigarette makers, said
people contacted by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Marc D. Murr of Houston, attracted public attention
and complaints last December at a hearing held by an arbitration
panel that was convened to award fees to lawyers hired by Texas,
Florida and Mississippi to sue the tobacco industry. The states
were the first to settle lawsuits against the industry seeking to
recover health care costs spent on smoking-related ills.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Dan Morales, a Democrat who was the Texas
attorney general, argued that Murr, a longtime associate, had
played a critical role in the Texas tobacco case, which was settled
for $17.3 billion. But Morales' contention was disputed by other
lawyers hired by the attorney general to represent Texas and by
tobacco industry lawyers who said they had barely heard of Murr and
had seen little evidence of his participation in talks leading to
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   While awarding $3.3 billion in fees to a group of Texas law
firms, the arbitration panel held that Murr deserved $1 million. In
earlier arbitration involving only the state and Murr, but not
tobacco industry lawyers, Murr had won a $260 million fee award.
That claim is pending in a federal court in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the current Texas attorney general, John
Cornyn, a Republican who succeeded Morales in January, said that
the FBI had recently contacted his office about Murr. The
spokeswoman, Heather Browne, said that the FBI did not disclose the
nature of its interest in Murr.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he is knowledgeable that they are involved in the
investigation,'' Ms. Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   The precise focus of the federal inquiry involving Murr is
unclear. But several people, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said it appeared to be preliminary, adding that FBI
agents had contacted several individuals in the last two months
connected to Texas' case against the tobacco industry and asked
about Murr.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in San
Antonio, said that the Justice Department, as a matter of policy,
does not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. An FBI
spokesman in San Antonio did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Murr were unsuccessful. His lawyer, Roy Q.
Minton of Austin, said that he understood that an FBI agent had
made brief inquiries recently about aspects of the state's tobacco
lawsuit. Minton said that he did not know the nature of the
agency's inquiry but added that he could not conceive of anything
that Murr had done that might arouse the interest of the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Minton added that the issue of lawyers' fees in the tobacco case
had become a political football in Texas and that people might be
seeking to discredit Murr, who he believed had a made a substantial
contribution to the state's case.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Cornyn announced he had begun an
investigation of Murr over his fee claim. That inquiry is under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who once worked at the same law firm with Murr, did not
return telephone calls.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In December, Morales, while still attorney general, flew to New
York City to argue on Murr's behalf before a series of arbitration
hearings convened to award fees to lawyers who represented Texas,
Florida and Mississippi. Morales argued that Murr, based on a
contractual arrangement, deserved to be paid up to 3 percent of the
Texas award, a sum that could easily reach in the hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   At that hearing, the positions of Morales and Murr came under
sharp attack by lawyers hired by both the state and cigarette
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen R. Patton, a lawyer for the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco
Corp., stated in an affidavit that Murr was rarely present at or
was excluded from meetings that involved other lawyers hired to
represent Texas. Patton took sharp exception with submissions to
the arbitration panel by Morales and Murr that described Murr as
having a principal role in the state's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked Mr. Morales what role Mr. Murr had played in
connection with the litigation, he referred vaguely to unspecified
lobbying and public relations efforts,'' Patton stated in
affidavit. ``He did not refer to any `supervisory,' `oversight' or
`co-pilot' role.''

EDUCATION OFFICIALS CALL FOR PROBE OF HOUSTON-AREA SCHOOLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim, optional ending) 
 
By MELANIE MARKLEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ State education officials have called for the
investigation of 22 Houston-area schools where excessive erasures
on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills have prompted concerns
of test tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Education Agency officials say that over a three-year
period, 11 districts statewide _ including Houston, Fort Bend and
North Forest _ had schools where an unusually high number of wrong
answers were erased and changed to correct answers.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Independent School District had already begun
investigating eight schools on its own last year, but had not yet
reached any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Other districts with targeted schools include Clint, Dallas,
Ector County, Laredo, Midland, Pharr-San Juan-Alamo, San Felipe-Del
Rio Consolidated and Wilmer-Hutchins.
</P>
<P>
   Educators who tamper with test results can lose their
accreditation, and schools where cheating is proven could have
their state ratings lowered. The TASS test evaluates students'
abilities in math, reading and writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know,'' state Education Commissioner Mike Moses said in
a letter last month to the districts' superintendents, ``the TAAS
is the cornerstone of the accountability system. As such, it is
imperative that the integrity of the accountability system be kept
intact.''
</P>
<P>
   The districts have been asked to submit the findings of their
internal investigations by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, TEA began asking the testing contractor to
generate a report that analyzes erasures on the TAAS answer
documents. The schools targeted by the state have had classrooms
with excessive erasures each of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The state inquiry follows an investigation launched last summer
by HISD that examined excessive erasures in 56 classrooms at eight
schools.
</P>
<P>
   HISD officials, who examined the state erasure reports over five
years, said their probe was started in response to an anonymous tip
and still is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``An investigation like this is very time-consuming because it
involves looking at individual test papers and many interviews,''
said HISD spokesman Terry Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said HISD does not want its test achievements compromised
even though the district's overall TAAS scores would decline only
.3 percent if the results at the 15 schools aren't counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public has reason to disbelieve the results of the TAAS
testing, then school districts will lose their credibility, and
that is one major reason why we began aggressively investigating
this last year,'' he said. ``We cannot and will not stand for any
cheating on the TAAS test.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Fallon, president of the Houston Federation of Teachers,
said if wrongdoing is found, however, she fears the district
automatically will blame the teachers without looking at the
administrators at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to be real sure that they not only look at whose
classroom it came out of but who really had the opportunity if
there was any erasure leading to changes in the answers,'' Fallon
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fort Bend spokeswoman Martha Morrow and North Forest spokeswoman
Jackie Tolbert said their districts are pursuing the internal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime we get that kind of letter from TEA, we are going to
be concerned, and we are going to take this very seriously,''
Morrow said.
</P>

<P>
   Just last September, TEA officials found that central office
administrators and principals in the Austin school district boosted
ratings at several schools by changing the identification numbers
of some students whose failing test scores they didn't want
counted.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the investigation, three Austin schools had their
ratings lowered, one administrator was suspended and another was
reprimanded.

U.S. TREASURIES RALLY SHARPLY ON POLICY REVERSAL BY JAPAN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a day of volatile trading, bond prices shot
sharply higher on Tuesday, making up all of Friday's losses and
then some.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal of Friday's selloff had to be painful for many bond
traders and some investors, who had decided the selloff was a
signal that interest rates were moving higher.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal also left some analysts confused about where rates
were going. ``I am still optimistic about interest rates,'' said
Gerald Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income
department at Advest Inc. ``But I think going through 5.4 percent
was quite significant,'' he added, referring to the top of the
three-month trading range that the yield of the 30-year bond broke
through on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The spark for Tuesday's rally came from the same source as the
impetus for Friday's selling _ Japan, which is infuriating many
investors by making sudden switches in policy.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Japanese officials disappointed investors by saying
that the government did not plan to buy any more Japanese
government bonds. American investors thought this would be a way to
help reverse the rise in Japanese interest rates, which has been
undermining the American bond market by attracting investors away.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Japan partly reversed that decision, announcing that
the government would buy more government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Another apparent reversal of recent Japanese policy also helped
send the Japanese yen down sharply against the dollar. On Tuesday,
Vice Finance Minister Eisuke Sakakibara said he would accept a
weaker yen, backing away from his support of the current value of
the yen against the dollar. The dollar rally also helped attract
investors back to the American bond market, helping that rally,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading, the price of the 30-year bond rose 1 5/32, to
98 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped
to 5.34 percent, from 5.42 percent on Friday. Friday's yield was
the highest since August. In the currency market, the yen dropped
3.9 percent, to 118.65 against the dollar, from 114.05 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cloherty, market strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston, said that while bond investors had to sort out what was
going on in Japan they also had to await next week's testimony by
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. In appearances
before the House and Senate Banking Committees, he will make his
official, semiannual report to Congress on the central bank's
interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be waiting to see if the Fed thinks that the
current, unexpectedly fast pace of economic growth is worrisome
enough to consider raising interest rates. If that is the signal,
rates should move higher. The fact that strong growth has
foreclosed a chance of another Fed rate cut has already helped send
rates higher the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   But N. Graham Allen, the managing director for global fixed
income at Wells Capital Management in Los Angeles, said that
Greenspan ``is not going to surprise us'' because the Fed is on
hold right now. The central bank, he said, cannot decide to raise
interest rates until they have more information on how much a drag
the recession in Latin American will have on the United States
economy.

him 3 miles down a country road until his flayed and battered body

JUDGE IN JONES CASE SAYS SHE MAY STILL HOLD PRESIDENT IN CONTEMPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal judge who presided over Paula Jones'
lawsuit against President Clinton said on Tuesday that she was
still considering whether to hold Clinton in contempt for giving
misleading answers in a sworn deposition last year in which he
denied a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan Webber Wright of the U.S. District Court in Little
Rock, Ark., said in an order issued there that with the end of the
impeachment trial in the Senate last week, ``I believe that now it
is time for the court to address the contempt issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright also disclosed that she had been asked last month to be a
witness in the impeachment trial by one of the House managers, Rep.
Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., but that she refused. The judge said she
even told Hutchinson that she would file a motion to block any
subpoena for her participation in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's order on Tuesday was another stark reminder that the
Senate vote last week to acquit Clinton did not end all possible
legal repercussions from the president's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and his subsequent actions in the Jones case. Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel, has left open the issue of whether
he would indict the president on perjury and obstruction of justice
charges, the very same charges of which he was acquitted by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   If Wright chose to hold Clinton in contempt, she could impose a
fine or try to suspend his ability to practice law. Clinton could
appeal any such finding.
</P>
<P>
   Wright issued her order after a 30-minute conference call on
Tuesday afternoon with lawyers for both Mrs. Jones and Clinton in
which she suggested she was still troubled by the president's
deposition. Wright had traveled from Little Rock to Washington to
preside at the deposition on Jan. 17, 1998, during which Clinton
denied a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, following his grand jury appearance, Clinton
acknowledged an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and said
his earlier testimony might have been misleading. Clinton argued
that he did not commit perjury during the deposition, however, and
asserted that his answers fell within the definition of sexual
relations that was approved by Wright for the Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   But within two weeks, Wright included a surprising footnote in
an opinion on an unrelated matter saying that she might someday
consider whether to hold Clinton in contempt. The opinion was about
whether the press could have access to certain court proceedings,
and her abrupt mention of the possibility of contempt proceedings
stunned the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Her order on Tuesday said that she had put aside the contempt
issue until the completion of the impeachment proceedings. ``The
court did not want in any way to interfere with the impeachment
proceedings then under way which are governed by different
standards and are intended to protect interests other than those
protected by sanctions for contempt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright also said she was free to address the contempt issue now
because the Jones lawsuit itself had been settled last Nov. 13 when
Clinton paid Ms. Jones $850,000 to withdraw her claim that he had
made a crude sexual advance to her in a Little Rock hotel suite in
1991 while he was stilllgovernor of Arkansas. Clinton denied the
allegation even as he settled the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said on Tuesday in the order that she had considered
withdrawing from the case because of the request to be a witness at
the trial but decided, for now, not to do so. Instead, she invited
any of the lawyers to file a motion by noon on Friday asking for
her recusal if they wanted to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, she said, wanted to ask her about Clinton's
comportment at the Jan. 17, 1998 deposition when his lawyer, Robert
S. Bennett, said that the president did not have sex of any kind
with Ms. Lewinsky. Asked about Bennett's statements later, Clinton
told the grand jury that he was not paying attention. The House
prosecutors argued otherwise and charged that Clinton committed
perjury and obstruction by allowing his lawyer to say things he
knew to be incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the managers obtained an affidavit from Barry Ward,
Wright's law clerk, who testified about how closely Clinton paid
attention to Bennett during the deposition.

U.S. NEGOTIATOR AT KOSOVO TALKS VISITS MILOSEVIC
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The man who is most likely to make or break the Kosovo
peace talks, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, was
visited in Belgrade on Tuesday night by the chief American
negotiator, who brought him an account of the proceedings so far.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the negotiator, Ambassador
Christopher Hill, was also instructed to repeat to Milosevic
privately what he has been told publicly by the West: Agree to a
NATO-led ground force in Kosovo or NATO planes will bomb Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   With a Saturday deadline for the end of the talks approaching,
the pressure was increasing on Milosevic, who has ruled Kosovo with
an iron hand in the last 10 years and in the last year has turned
it into the site of another violent Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who negotiated with Milosevic at the Dayton peace talks
that ended the war in Bosnia, left the meeting without comment
after nearly four hours with the Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said on Tuesday that Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright phoned Milosevic earlier on Tuesday and asked
him to see Hill, who is the ambassador to Macedonia and the chief
negotiator at the Kosovo talks. The other two negotiators are
Wolfgang Petritsch of Austria, representing the European Union, and
Boris Mayorsky of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Because Milosevic declined to attend the talks himself, Hill was
left with little choice but to fly from Paris to Belgrade to see
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian and ethnic Albanian delegations to the talks remain
at Rambouillet, 30 miles south of Paris, where they have been
staying since the talks began at a 14th-century castle there 10
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader, a master at finding cracks in Western
expressions of unity and a master at tactical maneuvers, is
expected to keep the suspense mounting until the last minute. The
one-on-one meeting with Hill was the first of what some diplomats
believe are likely to be several visits to Milosevic as the
countdown to Saturday rolls on.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has authorized its secretary general, Javier Solana, to
order air strikes against military targets in Kosovo and in Serbia
if Milosevic does not accept a settlement that has at its heart a
force of 28,000 NATO-led peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterest pill for Milosevic to swallow is the presence of
foreign soldiers in Kosovo, which is a province of Serbia and has
been described repeatedly by Milosevic as sovereign territory.
</P>
<P>
   At the castle in Rambouillet, the ethnic Albanian delegates,
whom Albright praised during a visit there on Sunday for their
readiness to sign a peace deal, expressed uneasiness about some
aspects of the plan. They were still waiting, two of the delegates
said, to see the most important documents. These included the plans
for how the Serbian security police, who have been held responsible
by the United States for the massacre of ethnic Albanian civilians,
would be dispersed from Kosovo and the plans for how peacekeepers
would be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Vertan Surroi, a newspaper publisher and a key delegate for the
ethnic Albanian side, said the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
been fighting an insurgency against the Serbs for the last year,
should be allowed to keep some kind of ``officer structure.'' One
of the demands of the peace plan is that the guerrillas give up
their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by a cellular phone from the castle, where the
delegates have been closeted and not allowed by the French police
to leave, Surroi said of the demand to demilitarize the guerrillas:
``It is my feeling you cannot go from an existing stage to expect
the whole thing to disband. There should be a midway.''
</P>
<P>
   But Surroi, who speaks fluent English and has traveled widely in
Europe and the United States, said everything depended on
Milosevic's agreeing to the 28,000 troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acceptance of NATO by Milosevic is the biggest thing,
everything else diminishes by comparison,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, political director of the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army, said the ethnic Albanian delegation was prepared to sign an
agreement that ``guarantees peace and that the people of Kosovo are
free to have a democratic state.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was insisting that the ethnic Albanians, who
make up more than 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, should be
allowed to call a referendum on their future after three years,
Thaci said as much but without using the word ``referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the right of the people of Kosovo that at the end of the
interim period they be allowed to decide their own fate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a referendum has been pushed by the ethnic
Albanians _ and is anathema to the Serbs _ because with more than
90 percent of the population made up of ethnic Albanians, a
referendum on whether Kosovo should become independent would be
easily won. Independence for Kosovo, where two million people live
in an area the size of Connecticut, has been the basic aim of the
ethnic Albanians. But independence is opposed by the Serbs and by
the West.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement that has been put to both sides
at Rambouillet, Kosovo would become autonomous with the right to
develop its own parliament, police, courts and other institutions.
The future of the autonomy would be decided at the end of three
years.

AIRLINES SLASH FARES TO EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With international business travel weakening because of the
economic slowdown overseas, and with more flights scheduled across
the North Atlantic, most major airlines have aggressively cut fares
to Europe, exceeding in many cases their previous winter sales.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers can get flights to London for as little as $228 plus
tax round trip, for example, while San Franciscans can go to Paris
and back for $348. The sharply discounted air fares are being
offered in dozens of American cities for travel to a variety of
European destinations.
</P>
<P>
   The number of destinations is indeed more extensive than ever,
airline officials say, and the period for which the fares are valid
extends far beyond the few weeks typically available in winter
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 29 years with the company,'' said John Lampl, a spokesman
for British Airways, ``I've never seen fares so low so early as
this year, or for travel so long into spring.''
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind the discounting is overcapacity.
Despite strong demand throughout most of last year, when many
trans-Atlantic flights were added, the airlines now find themselves
with too many seats to fill in the slow winter season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all that capacity when business travel to Europe is
declining, you can just about name your price,'' said Michael
Boult, a vice president at Rosenbluth International, the travel
management company.
</P>
<P>
   And air fares for leisure travelers may remain low, at least in
the short term, as a result of the labor dispute between American
Airlines and its pilots. After a weeklong disruption of its flights
because of the pilots' sickout, American, part of AMR Corp., is
expected to introduce bargain fares on both international and
domestic flights, to try to lure back passengers. American
currently offers a range of discount fares, including a $248 round
trip from Chicago to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways set off the latest round of discounting late
last week by offering fares as low as $228 round trip to London
from New York; Newark, N.J.; Boston, and Philadelphia, and offering
comparable fares from 18 other U.S. cities. Round trip to London
from San Francisco or Denver is $328, while round trip to London
from Los Angeles, San Diego or Phoenix is $358. Travelers have
until next Wednesday to buy these tickets, and they must depart by
March 31 and return by April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Most U.S. airlines have matched British Airways, or are offering
somewhat similar bargains. United Airlines, part of UAL Corp., is
offering such round-trip fares as New York to London for $228, San
Francisco to Paris for $348 and Los Angeles to Amsterdam for $398.
Discount fares at Continental Airlines include New York or Newark
to Paris for $248 and to Rome for $298. And among the offerings by
Delta Air Lines are flights from Los Angeles to Paris for $358.
</P>
<P>
   The tickets are not refundable, the prices do not include taxes,
and other restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   The trans-Atlantic discounts have their roots in part in the
economic troubles in Asia and South America. Although Europe is not
in recession, many American businesses have cut employee travel
worldwide, and several airlines have reduced or eliminated flights
to Asia and redeployed those planes to Europe.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   United Airlines, for example, which has extensive routes to the
Pacific, had an 8.8 percent increase in trans-Atlantic traffic last
month over January 1998, but its capacity across the Atlantic grew
14.9 percent, partly because it had added planes to its European
routes that had previously flown to Asia. Other airlines made
similar moves last year and did not cut back on flights in the
slower winter season.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Virgin Atlantic briefly offered $198 round-trip
fares between New York and London. ``Those fares obviously speak to
a lot of capacity in the market,'' said Gareth Edminson-Jones, a
Virgin spokesman. Virgin's current round-trip fares, available for
purchase through next Wednesday, are $228 from New York or Newark
to London and $328 from San Francisco or Los Angeles to London.
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines has $298 round-trip fares between
Washington and Madrid and between Dallas/Forth Worth and Paris;
tickets must be purchased by this Friday. The regular 21-day
advance-purchase fares on the routes are $820 and $640,
respectively. TWA appears to offer the most generous terms,
allowing travel as late as April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Last week US Airways offered $298 round-trip fares from
Philadelphia to London or Amsterdam, and $398 from Los Angeles to
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   There may be discounts this summer, airline officials say,
possibly in August, when business travel slows for the traditional
European vacation season, but the discounts will be modest if the
American economy remains strong. Joseph Buhler, chairman of the
European Travel Commission, recently forecast that almost 11.6
million Americans will visit Europe this year, more than half of
them this summer, topping last year's record of 11 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian economic crisis is not the only reason for excess
capacity. Because almost all airlines had high passenger loads to
Europe last summer and fall, and because the struggle for market
share over the heavily traveled Atlantic is particularly intense,
most airlines either did not bother to reduce the number of
flights, or cut just a token few.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the airlines miscalculated, perhaps, was that no firm
figures were available on the cuts in corporate travel. But
harbingers existed. A survey in October of 450 of the Fortune 1,000
companies, done by the National Business Travel Association, found
that 56 percent had cut the number of employees who travel, and
that they planned to reduce overall travel by 17 percent. ``Some
airlines didn't believe us,'' said Norman Sherlock, the
association's executive director, ``but they do now.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to show that its fares are a bargain, TWA dusted
off some fares from the past. ``When we introduced our
trans-Atlantic service in 1946,'' Mark Abels, a TWA spokesman,
said, ``the New York-to-Paris round trip cost $675 _ the equivalent
of $5,273.34 now.
</P>
<P>
   Boult of Rosenbluth keeps in his office a 1957 advertisement for
Pan American's new Clipper service _ $453 for a round-trip economy
flight from New York to London. ``That was a lot of money then,''
he said.

DRAGGING DEATH SAID TO BE TIED TO FINDING RECRUITS FOR WHITE
SUPREMACY GROUP 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ John William King had dreamed of forming his own
chapter of a white supremacist group but felt he needed some
dramatic event to catapult him into the limelight and attract
members.
</P>
<P>
   That, prosecutors said on Tuesday for the first time, is the
theory of why King and two other young white men chained a
49-year-old black man to the back of their pickup truck last June
and dragged him three miles down a country road until his flayed
and battered body was torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   The case against King, 24, the first of the three suspects to
come to trial in the hideous death of James Byrd Jr., opened
Tuesday morning before a jury of seven men and five women _ all
white except for one black man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill King needed to do something dramatic that would get media
attention, which would attract, in their warped world, new
members,'' said the Jasper County prosecutor, Guy James Gray, in
his 10-minute opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a search of the apartment that King had been sharing with his
fellow defendants _ Shawn Berry, 23, and Lawrence Brewer, 31 _
police found not only racist books but also an article from the
December 1996 issue of Esquire magazine about the killing of Emmett
Till in Mississippi, a notorious racial slaying of the 1950s,
pointing out how the accused killers had gone free when an
all-white jury acquitted them.
</P>
<P>
   Police also found some of King's own racist writings, including
a constitution he had written for an organization he hoped to
create called the Texas Rebel Soldiers Division of the Confederate
Knights of America. Also found were a code of ethics for the group,
a list of bylaws, applications for membership and a letter to be
sent out to new members.
</P>
<P>
   The new organization was to begin operating on July 4, 1998,
Gray said. Prosecutors hope to prove that the timing of Byrd's
death, less than a month earlier, was intended to help in that
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   King became a member of the Confederate Knights of America, a
prison-based white supremacy group, while serving a jail term in
the mid-1990s. It was during this stretch that he met Brewer, also
a member of the racist group. Berry had been a friend of King since
their high school days.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also introduced letters on Tuesday that were written
by King to a 15-year-old girl who had been pen pal while he was in
prison. Those letters included numerous profanities and racist
statements, particularly about sexual relations between white women
and black men.
</P>
<P>
   Haden Cribbs, the chief defense lawyer, made no opening
statement on Tuesday but reserved the right to make one later. He
did pause during one of the breaks in the trial to shake his head
at the evidence that prosecutors had unveiled in the trial's
opening day. ``The evidence does appear overwhelming,'' Cribbs
said, but he cautioned against concluding that, as a result, King
is guilty of the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to local newspapers, King has admitted to being in
the pickup the night of the murder but said he had left the others
before the killing, which he blamed on a drug deal turned sour
between Berry and Byrd. King's lawyers have yet to reveal their
trial strategy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 110-year-old courthouse sits on an elevated green in the
center of this town of 8,400 in the pine woods of East Texas, not
far from the Louisiana line. Dozens of police officers and federal
agents stood around the courthouse grounds and in all the
entrances, enforcing Judge Joe Bob Golden's order that any
protesters be kept two blocks or more away. There was no sign of
any protesters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, downtown streets were filled with a slow-moving parade
of patrol cars and bass boats _ the opening of the trial is
coinciding with the annual Bassmasters tournament, one of the
region's prime tourist draws _ and television vans wearing
satellite dishes were parked along one side of the courthouse
square and in most available empty lots in a one-block radius.
</P>
<P>
   King's father, suffering from emphysema, sat in the front row
behind the defense table, plastic tubing connected to an oxygen
canister beneath the long bench. At the defense table, King sat
quietly watching the testimony, often resting his head in his left
hand. His two lawyers, both white, sat to his left.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the aisle, behind the prosecution table and
nearer the jury, sat two rows of the friends and relatives of Byrd.
They shook their heads, hugged one another and often some of them
had to leave the courtroom when the evidence became especially
graphic. When, at one point, Byrd's battered shoe was pulled out of
an evidence bag, two of his sisters burst into tears. Seven local
and federal prosecutors were arrayed around the prosecution table.
Federal investigators and lawyers have helped in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead in the barrel-vaulted courtroom, two rows of ceiling
fans spun lazily while sunlight seeping between slats in the
plantation shutters splashed white stripes across the walls.
Golden, wearing no judicial robes, slouched down in his chair as he
listened to the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said they expected the testimony to last only until the
end of this week or early next. ``If things keep going the way they
are, I expect it to be to the jury by Monday,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   In a methodical manner, Gray spelled out the evidence he
intended to present against King.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses will testify, he said, that the three accused men left
their apartment at 1:30 a.m. on June 7 in Berry's pickup truck and
that an hour later a pickup truck of the same type and color was
seen with three men inside and another man, Byrd, riding in the
back.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-mile up a rough logging road northeast of town,
police found an area of flattened grass, strewn with beer bottles,
where they believe the three men beat and bound Byrd. Also found at
the scene were a lighter belonging to King, a wrench with Berry's
name scratched onto it, cigarette butts containing DNA traces of
all three suspects and a beer bottle containing DNA traces from
Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   Traces of Byrd's blood were found on the bottom of Berry's truck
and on one of its tires, Gray said, and spots of the victim's blood
were found on shoes owned by each of the accused men.
</P>
<P>
   For King, whose body is festooned with racist tattoos, the
motive, the prosecutor said, was hatred of black people, mixed with
a desire to do something sufficiently grand to bring alive his
dream of heading a racist gang in Jasper County.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young man is full of hate, and he has tattoos all over
his body that reflect that hatred,'' Gray said.

 &HT;    On a mission of mercy: Custom-made propeller goes to Honduras
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As one of the largest manufacturers of airplane
propellers in the world, McCauley Propeller Systems in Vandalia,
Ohio sends out thousands of its hand-tooled products each year to
every corner of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But the two-blade propeller shipped out Tuesday to Honduras took
with it something more than the usual care and pride of McCauley's
280 employees. It took a bit of their hearts as well.
</P>
<P>
   Propeller No. 950635 was custom-made and donated to a mission
pilot who has worked closely with the United Christian Center of
Dayton in bringing relief to the Mosquito Coast, a remote region
that was hit hard this fall by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   To reach villages that have no passable roads, Westley Wiles has
been flying his 1966 single-engine Cessna on a wing and a prayer,
often landing on loose gravel runways and in cow pastures full of
ruts. After several mishaps, his Cessna 206, and especially his
McCauley-built propeller, had taken a beating.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Simister, general manager of McCauley, read about the
mission pilot's plight in a Jan. 31 Dayton Daily News story and was
quickly on the phone to his staff. ``We made a decision that day
that, yes, we would support our product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Simister, 49, is familiar with the logistical problems in Latin
America, having grown up in Peru, Venezuela and Ecuador as the son
of a sales manager for U.S. Royal tires. ``You go to places like
Honduras and the infrastructure is just not there,'' he said. ``We
take for granted, even in a snowstorm, that we can get on a road
and go to'' the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Simister said he's also familiar with the generosity of Latin
American people. ``If you need something to eat down there _ even
if they don't have anything themselves _ it's like, `Here, take
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Doris Swartz, pastor of Dayton's United Christian Center, said
the donation of the $9,000 propeller ``will enable us to continue
to aid the people of Honduras.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's relief efforts in Honduras include the support of a
medical clinic in the village of El Castillo, which treats as many
as 330 patients a week. Recently, the church also distributed more
than 6,000 pounds of relief supplies gathered primarily from the
Dayton area.

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN LAWSUIT AGAINST BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Sacramento Bee) 
 
By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A $25 million lawsuit filed against the Baylor College
of Medicine by a scientific researcher who was fired in 1995 for
allegedly faking lab results has been settled for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was in the second week of trial when it was
settled Thursday, had been closely watched by the nation's research
community. The scientist, Kimon Angelides, sued Baylor as well as
his former colleagues who served on a Baylor committee to decide
whether he had faked results.
</P>
<P>
   Although Baylor settled with Angelides, the medical school's
attorney Gerald Pecht said it was a ``total victory for Baylor.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelides, whose brother Phil Angelides was elected California
State Treasurer in November, was fired for allegedly faking
successful results in published papers on the ability of an
antibody to help damaged nerve cells transmit signals. The research
was part of an effort at Baylor to find new ways to treat muscular
dystrophy and multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Angelides decided to settle the day after a federal regulatory
body agreed he had committed scientific misconduct and that Baylor
properly investigated the allegations, said Angelides' attorney
James Pianelli. The lawyer said he did not expect the report to be
released during the trial, but said he did not believe it was
intentionally released at this time.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by the Departmental Appeals Board, an agency
of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that oversees
federal research grants, recommended that Angelides be barred from
receiving federal funding for five years, Pianelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Angelides, who has worked as a researcher in at the University
of Durham in England since he was fired from Baylor, maintains his
innocence but realized the report ``would be detrimental to his
case,'' Pianelli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mixed emotions about the settlement,'' Pianelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Pecht said Baylor agreed to the settlement even though it
believes it did nothing wrong because it would have cost the school
millions more to continue fighting. He said a condition of the
settlement was that Angelides not receive any of the money, which
was used to defray some of Pianelli's estimated legal expenses of
$800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Angelides claimed he was fired on trumped-up charges because he
alerted officials about a mistake in a $1 million grant. Because of
the mistake, the grant was withdrawn and Baylor lost about
$400,000, Pianelli told jurors during opening statements.
</P>
<P>
   Pecht said the case was closely watched because federal
regulations implemented in the late 1980s require that research
institutions form their own internal committees to rule on
allegations of scientific misconduct. However, the federal
regulations provide no immunity from lawsuits to scientists who
serve on such committees, and this was the first case to go to
trial in which committee members were sued, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we find a better way, no one is going to want to serve
on these committees,'' Pecht said. ``There needs to be federal
protection (from lawsuits).''
</P>
<P>
   He said under current rules, any time committee members rule
that a colleague has committed scientific misconduct they can
expect to be sued. He said there are a number of such pending suits
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the evidence discussed in the trial pointed to a history
of deception by Angelides.
</P>
<P>
   Pecht told jurors that while Angelides was a post-doctoral
fellow at Cornell University in 1979 he applied for a March of
Dimes grant and told the foundation he had a degree from Harvard
and said he published scientific papers, which he hadn't. Angelides
received $80,000 with the help of his false resume, Pecht said.
</P>
<P>
   Angelides' brother Phil went to Harvard, but the scientist did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1979, Angelides applied for a job at McGill University
in Montreal and once more said he went to Harvard and that he
published papers, which he actually had not published.
</P>
<P>
   He was hired by McGill, but he was told to quit or be fired a
little after one year because his lies had been discovered, Pecht
told jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Angelides resigned and took at job at the University of Florida,
where he was allegedly caught falsifying lab reports and was asked
to resign, Pecht said. He took a job at Baylor in 1986, and the
investigation into his scientific misconduct began in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Angelides' previous problems were reported in Nature
magazine in 1995 after he sued Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Pianelli said Angelides, who is in his late 40s, will likely
return to the Houston area to reunite with his wife, Dr. Lefki
Karaviti, and try to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brilliant scientist, he could work in industry, in a
teaching capacity and reviewing scientific literature,'' Pianelli
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pecht said the jury is still out on whether Angelides is
``brilliant,'' but said ``even if you have a brilliant mind you
have to be honest.'' &QL;

RULING FAVORS MINORS IN MEDICAL TREATMENT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ruling in the case of a 17-year-old teenager who
objected to a blood transfusion on religious grounds, the state
Appeals Court for the first time Tuesday gave minors a voice in
deciding whether they can refuse life-saving medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The court said said judges must interview the minors and
determine whether they are mature before deciding what is in their
``best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Simons, who represents the Lenox teenager, said the
ruling means minors who can convince a judge they are making a
rational, intelligent choice to refuse medical treatment may see
their wishes prevail over the objections of their parents and the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is indicating that (judges) may consider the
maturity of the child to make informed choices,'' said Simons, a
Pittsfield attorney. ``And when that child expresses their
preference and expresses their religous conviction, that's what's
significant _ rather than just saying a minor has no say in
controlling his or her medical decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case was the wishes of Alexis Demos, a
17-year-old Lenox girl who was seriously injured in a Jan. 26
snowboarding accident. As part of the medical treatment at the
Berkshire Medical Center for her lacerated spleen, doctors said she
could possibly need a life-saving blood transfusion if the spleen
started to bleed.
</P>
<P>
   Demos and her parents objected on religious grounds because as
Jehovah's Witnesses, they believe a blood transfusion would violate
a biblical prohibition on ``eating blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital then asked Berkshire Superior Court Judge Judd
Carhart to step in and permit doctors to administer the transfusion
if needed, citing the state's interest in preventing an avoidable
death of a child. Carhart, after hearing from Simons and the
hospital, agreed with the hospital and ordered transfusion to occur
if needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Demoses appealed, and the court ruled Tuesday even though
Demos is no longer in immediate medical danger. The Appeals Court
said it issued the ruling because of the scarcity of appellate
cases in the area of a minor's rights to control medical
intervention in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The court said that since a 1991 ruling by the Supreme Judicial
Court, a competent adult clearly can refuse live-saving treatment.
``The law is well-settled . . . that a competent adult may refuse
medical treatment even if the treatment is necessary to save her
life,'' Appeals Court Judge Elizabeth Porada wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it has also been clear since 1991, in a separate
SJC ruling, that judges can order life-saving treatment for minors
when a parent refuses their permission. In those situations, judges
have to weigh what is in the ``best interest of the child'' along
with the parents' wishes and the state's obligation to protect its
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The court decides what is in the child's best interest based on
six criteria: the minor's wishes, the minor's religious beliefs,
the probablity of adverse side effects from treatment, prognosis
without treatment, and the competency of the minor to make that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   But until Tuesday's decision, it was unclear whether courts
needed to hear directly from a ``mature minor'' about their wishes
and also whether the courts needed to give those ideas weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the judge did consider'' Demos's ``wishes and her
religious convictions in this matter, he made no determination as
to her maturity to make an informed choice,'' Porada wrote. Carhart
``should not have relied solely on the representations made by her
attorney and her parents, but should have heard her own
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Porada added, ``it is appropriate for a judge to consider the
maturity of the child to make an informed choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court said state law is vague about how to define a
``mature minor'' who is legally capable of making important
decisions. ``Our laws provide no bright line as to when a minor
reaches an age to make certain decisions in life,'' Porada wrote in
a footnote.

POLITICAL LANDSCAPE ALTERED, LABOR SEES GAINS FOR ITS AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ With their supporters among Republican
moderates likely to play a more forceful role in the new Congress,
union leaders who are gathered here for the AFL-CIO's winter
meeting predicted Tuesday that labor would make substantial gains
this year in advancing its legislative wish list.
</P>
<P>
   The labor leaders say the narrowing of the Republican majority
in the House to five votes will give their pet proposals, including
a higher minimum wage and a patients' bill of rights, a better
chance than in the two previous Congresses since the Republicans
took control in the 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can get more done this year,'' said Peggy Taylor,
the AFL-CIO's chief lobbyist. ``With the margin so close in the
House and the Democrats feeling so strong and the Republicans so
desperate to get something done in this Congress, I think there's a
lot of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor leaders, meeting here for four days at the
Fontainebleau Hotel, have put forward a long list of legislative
goals that range from the eminently attainable to the highly
improbable. Among them: an increase in the minimum wage to $6.15 an
hour, from the current $5.15; a requirement that part-time workers
be paid the same hourly rate as full-time employees doing the same
work; the hiring of 100,000 additional teachers to reduce class
size, as proposed by President Clinton, and defeat of the
Republican proposal that would create individual retirement
investment accounts within the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republicans' majority in the House now trimmed, and
with Republican moderates reaching out to labor, union officials
predict that Congress is unlikely to throw them on the defensive as
in the last two years. In the last Congress, Republicans not only
pushed, unsuccessfully, for legislation to limit labor's ability to
use dues for political purposes but also held investigative
hearings on a variety of unions, especially the teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is there'll be less need for defensive work,'' John
J. Sweeney, the labor federation's president, said in an interview
Tuesday. ``Our hope is we'll be able to pursue a pro-active agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans have some sense and want to turn things
around a little bit,'' Sweeney said of the party's political
fortunes, ``they'll be looking for some pieces of legislation. The
question is whether they want to deal with it seriously or just as
face-savers. If they're willing to deal with it seriously, then,
fine, we want to be at the table when it comes to a
working-families agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, vice president for labor policy at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said in a telephone interview that unions
still faced tough going in a Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``A more realistic estimate of what will happen is gridlock,''
Johnson said, ``although there'll be a few minor victories on their
side, like the minimum wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions hope to win a minimum-wage increase this year or
next, as they did in 1996, when many congressional Republicans,
feeling vulnerable in an election year, voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very successful economic period,'' Sweeney said, raising
the minimum above the current $5.15 ``is a way of showing that
workers should share in the economic progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate lobbyists maintain that a higher minimum wage will
raise business costs and so cause employers to lay off low-paid
workers, or at least hire fewer of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AFL-CIO is clearly going to run with it because it's a
terrific political issue,'' Johnson said. ``Unfortunately the vast
majority of economists agree that raising the minimum wage destroys
jobs. But the workers who will lose jobs get lost in the politics
of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson conceded that unions would probably also gain some
limited version of a patients' bill of rights. That legislation
would give members of health maintenance organizations greater
rights to use emergency rooms and to appeal HMO decisions, and
would bar ``gag rules'' by which managed care companies limit what
doctors can tell patients about treatment alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   But labor officials say their chief legislative priority is to
strengthen Social Security and to kill the Republican proposal for
privatizing part of it with individual accounts. Tuesday night the
federation sponsored a town meeting in Miami where dozens of
retired union members attacked the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having those accounts is going to end up costing more,''
because of administrative expenses, ``and it ends up taking money
away from benefits,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the
American Federation of Teachers and chairwoman of the AFL-CIO's
social policy committee. ``And where there are people who are less
sophisticated about making investment decisions, they might lose
their money and be left without a safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   As for other issues, several unions are pushing trade
legislation. The steelworkers, for instance, want tougher
restrictions on unfairly priced imported steel. And labor officials
say Clinton might push again for fast-track trade legislation,
whose renewal was blocked by unions last year on the ground that it
risked a loss of American jobs to countries that did not bear the
costs of the kinds of labor and environmental protections that
prevail in the United States. But Sweeney said he thought Clinton
might submit a reformulated proposal this year to include labor,
human rights and environmental provisions favored by the union
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president has gotten the message,'' he said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another issue is part-time workers. Union officials have voiced
frustration in recent years that despite an economic boom, the
percentage of American workers with health insurance and pensions
has dropped, especially among part-timers. Concerned that workers
who do not hold permanent, full-time jobs are getting short shrift,
the labor federation is pushing a bill to require that part-time
workers receive the same hourly pay as full-time employees doing
the same work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the federation wants a law requiring proportional
benefits for part-time workers _ that is, an employee who works 20
hours a week, say, would be guaranteed half the pension of someone
working 40 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   In a further protection for ``nontraditional'' workers, labor
leaders want legislation that would extend the Occupational Safety
and Health Act to make employers responsible for the safety of not
only their regular employees but also independent contractors and
temporary workers.

members. That, prosecutors said for the first time, is their theory
of why King and two other young white men chained a 49-year-old
black man to the back of their pickup truck last June and dragged
him 3 miles down a country road until his flayed and battered body
fell apart. The case against King, 24, the first of the three

 Employee Handbook Is Crucial  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'm on the board of directors of a small nonprofit. One
of our employees, who is otherwise competent and popular, has twice
committed to large expenditures to help our organization but
without proper authorization. What would a business do in this
situation?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  It sounds like you need clearer policies and the
gumption to tell the employee what the rules are after one
violation of the spending limits, much less two.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, you should have an employee handbook that clearly
states policies and procedures, says Baillee Serbin, human
resources senior consultant of the Management Center in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the employee handbook should state that any
expenditure over $100 (or whatever amount the board of directors
decides should be policy) must be approved by the executive
director and board treasurer (or any board member that makes sense
for your organization).
</P>
<P>
   You should probably establish what maintenance or emergency
expenditures can be undertaken without board permission, like a
broken toilet. If you have no employee handbook, you can call
Serbin at the Management Center, who consults with nonprofits on
their employee handbooks.
</P>
<P>
   You can visit the organization's Web site ( &LR; www.tmcenter.org &LR; )
and search articles in its library. You also can pay $149 to attend
the Management Center's all-day seminar today at San Francisco's
Cathedral Hill Hotel on best practices for managing employees at
nonprofits. One of the speakers is Leyna Bernstein, the author of
``Best Practices: The Model Employee Handbook for California
Nonprofits.''
</P>
<P>
   Online Prospecting
</P>
<P>
   Q: My company has used consultants and rented mailing lists to
target prospective customers. Is there a way to get customer leads
over the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: It just so happens that MySoftware Co. of Palo Alto is
announcing agreements today with Netscape, Intuit and Ameritech to
promote its online customer prospecting service. MySoftware's
``e-prospecting'' Web site,  &LR; www.myprospects.com &LR; , allows users to
select a profile of their desired customers and instantly download
highly targeted contact data from more than 13 million business
listings (provided by Experian) and 180 million consumer records
(from the Polk Co.).
</P>
<P>
   MySoftware's new partners are anxious to provide more
information and time-saving tools to their business users,
including helping them find new customers.
</P>
<P>
   It often takes hours or days for a consultant or mailing list
company to prepare a carefully tailored list of prospective
customers. And it usually costs many hundreds or thousands of
dollars. By contrast, MySoftware promises results in about six
minutes and charges from 13 cents to 50 cents per reference, or as
little as $25 for a list of 100 names.
</P>
<P>
   For consumer searches, you can select by geographic location and
26 predefined demographic niches or by specific criteria like
income, age, home ownership, size and value of dwelling, and credit
card usage. For business searches, you can screen by Standard
Industry Classification (SIC) code, location, company size, annual
revenues and other criteria.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GROW17 (79239 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  MySoftware chief executive Gregory Slayton notes that there are
several CD-ROMs loaded with consumer and business names and
addresses that cost from about $50 to $200. But the stored
information is months old while MySoftware's data is fresh. As a
sign of its bright prospects, the company was the ninth
top-performing stock last year and its shares have zipped from $4
to $20 in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   How to Host
</P>
<P>
   Q: My business is interested in selling online and establishing
a Web site but we don't know whether to run our own site or hire a
hosting service. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Deciding whether to build your own site or hire a service
is like choosing the right lease for a physical store, states
Leslie Lundquist, author of ``Selling Online for Dummies'' (IDG
Books, $24.99). She says, ``It can make a big difference in your
customer traffic and in your overhead expenses over the long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are a newcomer to online selling, she suggests hiring a
hosting service. That way, you haven't committed to buying a lot of
expensive computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   You can find Web hosting services in the back of trade
magazines. Many local Internet access providers like Earthlink,
Best communications and Pac Bell offer hosting services. So do
major portal sites like Yahoo, Excite and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   The YahooStore hosting service charges $100 a month to list 50
items and $300 a month to list 1,000 items.
</P>
<P>
   For a flat monthly fee, hosting services generally provide space
for your site's content files (typically 20 to 25 megabytes),
e-mail accounts and sometimes other services such as domain name
registration, data backup and site statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Before you go with a hosting service, Lundquist, vice president
of research for CommerceNet, a Mountain View nonprofit that
promotes electronic commerce, suggests you ask these questions:
</P>
<P>
   _Exactly what is included in your monthly service fee?
</P>
<P>
   _Are there any restrictions on the service?
</P>
<P>
   _What guarantees do you get about the site's accessibility to
your customers?
</P>
<P>
   _What site statistics do you get?
</P>
<P>
   _What type of security is provided? (Secure credit card
acceptance online often costs an extra $35 to $150 per month.)
</P>
<P>
   If you elect to host your own site, Lundquist notes that you can
find ``a lot of freeware to get you started.'' There also are
inexpensive software programs like Cold Fusion and Microsoft's
FrontPage that help create home pages without having to learn the
HTML programming language.
</P>
<P>
   But unless you have technical expertise and feel comfortable
with Unix operating systems, you probably are better off with a
hosting service.
</P>

 Levi's Sales Unraveled In 1998  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Dragged down by its flagship Levi's brand, sales at Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co. plunged 13 percent last year, the biggest sales decline at
least since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Amid slumping demand worldwide, fiscal 1998 sales fell to $6
billion from $6.9 billion in 1997. Sales have dropped about 17
percent since peaking at $7.1 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Levi's does not report earnings, but spokesman
Gavin Power said the company was profitable despite sales declines
in all of its regions.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness at Levi's comes despite robust performance in the jeans
category. Total domestic sales of men's jeans grew 6.2 percent in
1998 while women's jeans rose 7.8 percent, according to NPD Group,
a research firm based in Port Washington, NY.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, Levi's market share has dropped from about 50
percent in the early 1990s to about half that level as consumers
have flocked to rival brands on both the high and low ends, said
Isaac Lagnado of Tactical Retail Solutions, a New York
apparel-industry consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's problems are not confined to its flagship brand. Sales of
the company's Slates dress-pant line, which had been growing, were
flat last year despite healthy overall sales of tailored clothing.
</P>
<P>
   According to NPD Group, sales of men's tailored clothing rose
7.1 percent in 1998, making it one of the strongest segments of the
apparel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Power said executives consider Slates performance strong. ``That
category is not experiencing as much growth as khakis or some other
areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lagnado said Slates competitors such as Haggar and Farah have
upgraded their fabrics and are doing a better job competing against
Slates.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's secondary line, Dockers, which consists mainly of khakis,
experienced record sales and profits last year.
</P>
<P>
   Broken down by region, Levi's sales in the Americas fell 18
percent to $3.9 billion, and they dropped 5.9 percent to $1.7
billion in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Asia's economic
problems contributed to a 26.8 percent decline there, with total
sales of $369 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sales decline in fiscal 1998, which ended Nov. 29, 1998, is
the largest on record for the company since it began using modern
accounting methods in the 1940s, Power said. It is difficult to
compare earlier figures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, sales of Levi's teen-oriented fashion
lines, Silver Tab and L-2, exceeded expectations last year, Power
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is planning to introduce another teen-oriented
sub-brand, which has not yet been named, with fashion products such
as cargo pants and carpenter pants.
</P>
<P>
   Launch of the new line was scheduled for this month and March
but now is slated for later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is planning several other initiatives to get the brand on
track. It continues to sponsor rock concerts and next month will
roll out a line of 1960s-inspired clothing tied to the release of a
movie based on the ``Mod Squad'' television show.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's also is planning to broaden its custom-made jeans
business, formerly called Personal Pair and recently renamed
Original Spin, in department stores and specialty stores across the
country during the next two to three years, Power said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with the strategy on paper,'' said
Lagnado. ``The question is, `How you do it.'''

 Book Execs Are No Dummies  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Calling your customers dummies might not sound like the best
marketing strategy. But it has worked wonders for IDG Books
Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Foster City company has sold more than 60 million copies of
its 700-plus ``For Dummies'' titles since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   One key to IDG's success has been its decision to stick to a
common name on its books. In addition, its insistence early on to
sell keep-it-simple books that demystified complicated computer
topics struck a chord with those consumers who wanted to grab only
the information they needed rather than wade through thick
technical manuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to develop a brand for the masses, to talk to people
who were smart but didn't understand the technical babble and felt
left out,'' said John Kilcullen, IDG's co-founder and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   From technical subjects, IDG Books branched into business,
finance and a broad range of self-help and personal-interest books.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company saw revenues rise nearly 20 percent to
$141.5 million and profits soar 30 percent to &LR;   &LR; $10.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Dummies'' books now account for nearly two-thirds of IDG's
book business, including close to 400 new titles and editions this
year. The company also is expanding into other areas including
delivering information through the Internet and selling games and
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, IDG used an initial public offering to raise $49
million and spent $14.2 million of the proceeds in December to buy
Cliffs Notes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a logical addition. IDG Dummies titles covering business,
technology and general interest subjects are designed to help
customers conquer the frustration of learning a new skill. Cliffs
Notes on classic works of literature have been a crutch for
generations of students stumbling over term papers and preparing
for exams.
</P>
<P>
   An easily recognizable color scheme also has played a big role
in IDG's success. Emblazoned in yellow and black, the covers of
both the Dummies and Cliffs brands have become a magnet for
shoppers in book stores and superstores like Costco, Staples,
Office Max and Office Depot.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of DUMMIES1 (49325 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The company was created a decade ago as a unit of International
Data Group, which produces 290 trade magazines and newspapers
including Computerworld/Infoworld and Macworld. ``We wanted to
start a book company to increase revenues per reader,'' said
Kilcullen, 40, who spent the previous nine years in marketing and
management posts at other publishers.
</P>
<P>
   IDG's first books _ software and hardware buyer's guides, and
tips for playing video games _ ``failed miserably,'' he said. Then
Kilcullen came up with the title ``DOS for Dummies'' to help
average schmoes understand Microsoft's operating software.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company, which still owns about 78 percent of IDG
Books, had no problem with this populist approach. But editors
accustomed to writing for engineers and other cognoscenti were
nervous about addressing prospective customers as dummies.
</P>
<P>
   Some big distributors such as Waldenbooks (now part of Borders
Group) also balked. But Kilcullen pressed on with his contrarian,
Don Rickles-like fixation on dummies.
</P>
<P>
   It paid off. The first 7,500-book run of ``DOS for Dummies''
sold out, and subsequent editions have sold about 4 million copies.
Dozens of other books took off, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's a dummy at something _ doing taxes, working on the
car, installing computer memory,'' Kilcullen said. ``Our goal is to
be the first choice for people who want to learn just enough about
computers, personal finance, selling and a host of self-help topics
to get the results they need and get on with their lives _ and have
a few laughs along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel comfortable with our brand; they know they won't
get overkilled with information,'' added IDG Books President and
Publisher Steven Berkowitz, also 40, who came to the company in
1994 and helped lift annual sales from $30 million to more than
$140 million.
</P>
<P>
   IDG Books has 430 employees including about 200 editorial and
production staff. They are split between headquarters in Foster
City and Indianapolis, which Kilcullen notes has both a great
Midwestern work ethic and an employment pool of talented English
grads from nearby universities.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of DUMMIES1 (49325 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  IDG takes great care in matching subject matter with well-known
personalities who are authoritative but have a down-to-earth style.
</P>
<P>
   Not every author has taken immediately to the notion of writing
a book for dummies. Sexpert Ruth Westheimer, for example, was
offended by the request to write a book until she understood the
concept. Then she became an ardent advocate of Dummies books,
declaring ``a lesson learned with humor is a lesson retained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for authors who are great trainers,'' Kilcullen said.
For instance, golf commentator Gary McCord wrote the best-seller
``Golf for Dummies'' with a forward by Kevin Costner, whom he
coached for his role in the movie ``Tin Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   David Pogue, &UR;  &LR; author of four Dummies titles on Macs, magic,
opera and classical music, helped celebrities such as Dianne
Sawyer, Mia Farrow and Stephen Sondheim master computers.
</P>
<P>
   Experts who have the right stuff but not writing skills are
paired with proven authors. Joe Morgan, Howie Long and Kristi
Yamaguchi took this route for their Dummies books on baseball,
football and ice skating, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   IDG Books offers writers advances from $5,000 to a little more
than $100,000. That's a fraction of what many other publishers pay.
The royalty payments are about 10 percent of what retailers pay for
the books, which also is less than other publishers' standard
royalty payments.
</P>
<P>
   But IDG Books attracts a stable of thoroughbred authors because
its name often guarantees high sales volume.
</P>
<P>
   For example, even though IDG is not known for expertise in
taxes, Kilcullen said its brand recognition has carried ``Taxes for
Dummies'' to the third spot in tax-guide sales volume.
</P>
<P>
   IDG's familiar brand, pervasive book racks and online presence
have helped launch other best-sellers. These include Eric Tyson's
``Investing for Dummies'' and ``Personal Finance for Dummies,'' Zig
Ziglar's ``Success for Dummies'' and McCord's golf primer.
</P>
<P>
   This year, IDG will introduce or revise close to 400 titles and
eventually plans to launch a line of travel and language books.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of DUMMIES1 (49325 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Besides the Dummies lines, IDG Books has a large selection of
technology and 3-D visual books that are full of color graphics. It
also has licensing agreements for toys, board games, CDs and
calendars and is working with Lotus, Siemens and other companies to
provide printed-product documentation.
</P>
<P>
   IDG Books is not ignoring the Internet, either. New titles,
computer tips, cartoons, newsletters and quizzes are accessable at
 &LR; www.dummies.com  &LR; and  &LR; www.idgbooks.com &LR; .

 &HT;    Ohio enjoys incredibly low oil prices
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Kelly Black, who commutes in a gas-guzzling 1970
Pontiac with a six-cylinder engine, stops at a Citgo station in the
Warren County, Ohio hamlet of Red Lion a couple of times each week.
</P>
<P>
   When he stopped Tuesday to buy $5 worth gasoline, he found
something local motorists haven't seen since Black's Pontiac was
new gasoline priced at 78 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm driving a long way, so gas means something to me,'' Black
said. ``I'm digging it that it's this low.''
</P>
<P>
   An oversupply of crude oil worldwide has caused gasoline prices
throughout much of the Miami Valley and the nation to plummet. Area
service stations are charging between 80 and 91 cents a gallon for
gas, a level that one oil expert said could hold through the spring
and summer.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of Warren County, street-level competition has is
pushing prices down into the 70-cent range, a price not seen in two
decades. Some Franklin stations on Tuesday sold gas for as low as
75 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost unheard of in these times to have gas that low,''
said Patricia Booker, executive director of the Southwestern Ohio
Garage and Gasoline Dealers Association. ``I don't know how they
can make any money.''
</P>
<P>
   An oversupply of crude oil from oil-producing nations,
struggling foreign economies and warmer weather resulting from El
Nino have pushed down crude oil prices from $23 a barrel in 1997 to
between $10 and $12. As foreign producers try to vanquish oil
reserves, plummeting crude-oil prices have fallen to the lowest
levels ever recorded, when adjusted for inflation. Federal
officials look for gasoline prices to remain low at least into next
year.
</P>
<P>
   For the Citgo in Red Lion, dropping the price to 78 cents per
gallon from 82 cents on Sunday drove up business, said Manager
Maxine Persley. Conversely, she looks for business to cool somewhat
when prices rise, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely we'll see the difference,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, experts said, low prices strain retailers. Ohio
gas sellers pay 40 cents in state and federal taxes on each gallon
of gas sold. As per-gallon prices drop, so do profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much money to be made,'' Booker said. ``Some of
them are suffering, yes, I would say.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on overhead costs such as rent, some gas station
owners make only a few cents on the gallon, she said. In some
cases, station owners also must offer auto-repair shops and
convenience stores to bolster earnings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Franklin, a price war has erupted on East Second Street as
Dairy Mart and Swifty Service Station charge 75 cents a gallon
while nearby Amoco charges 76 cents. Also in Franklin, the gas
stations at the intersection of Ohio 123 and Interstate 75 are
holding their prices at or below 80 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Billy D. Estes, president of Billy D. Estes &AMP; Sons Oil Co.,
which sells gasoline and diesel fuel to business and industry,
attributes the low Warren County prices to competition and hefty
fuel surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that's what caused it is a glut of inventory,'' Estes
said. ``If they didn't have the product, they couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker said that while not everyone does it, it's not uncommon
for gas stations to price themselves according to what a neighbor
charges, dropping prices in pennies-per-gallon increments.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Dayton, Nick Allen, manager of a BP station, said
his station's prices have stayed under $1 for more than two months.
The low prices have translated into more sales, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the BP station in Yellow Springs, the price has topped $1
once during the past three months, said Assistant Manager Craig
McCann. Lower prices prompt people to fill up their tanks and ``get
it while it's cheap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in Kettering, the Clark Oil on Saturday dropped its price to
82 cents from 85 cents to remain competitive, said Manager Kim
Pearson. The nearby Speedway charges 82 cents per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   While no one knows how long the low prices will last, most agree
they won't last forever. Mike Kunnen, director of the Cincinnati
Gasoline Dealers Association, said prices probably could remain low
for several more months, which is good for the consumer, but bad
for gas station owners and the United States which will remain
reliant on imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Booker hopes prices will stop falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they can go much lower,'' Booker said.
``Eventually they have to start coming back up again. Might as well
enjoy it while we can.

H.W. KENDALL, 72, DIES; HUNTED DOWN QUARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Mass.)  (sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Way Kendall, one of three physicists who shared a
Nobel Prize for confirming that tiny particles called quarks were
the basic building blocks of matter, died on Monday while on an
underwater photography shoot in Wakulla Springs State Park, south
of Tallahassee, Fla. He was 72 and lived in Sharon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The local authorities reported that Kendall, an experienced
diver and underwater photographer, had joined a team from National
Geographic magazine but was working by himself before his body was
found a few feet from shore. An autopsy was being performed.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall was also known for his work with the Union of Concerned
Scientists, an advocacy group that he helped found in 1969 and led
as chairman since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall and his colleagues won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics
for experiments that confirmed the existence of quarks, the
infinitesimally tiny packets of energy that make up protons and
neutrons, which were once thought to be matter's fundamental
particles. Dr. Richard E. Taylor, a Canadian professor at Stanford
University, and Dr. Jerome I. Friedman, a fellow scientist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were recognized with
Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Their work from 1967 to 1973 validated what had been
hypothesized independently in the early 1960s by Dr. Murray
Gel-Mann and Dr. George Zweig at the California Institute of
Technology. Gell-Mann named these elusive particles ``quarks'' on a
whim, borrowing the word from James Joyce's ``Finnegan's Wake.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, Taylor and Friedman, who first met as graduate students
at Stanford, conducted their research at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center using a two-mile-long particle accelerator able
to boost beams of electrons to an energy of 22 billion
electron-volts. They directed the beams at targets containing
liquid hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose was to achieve a special kind of collision that
occurs when electrons hit protons (which constitute the nuclei of
hydrogen) at certain energies. Initial results were ambiguous. But
as the three fine-tuned their instruments, the results clearly
showed that both protons and neutrons contained hard, electrically
charged, point-like particles corresponding to the quarks foretold
in theory.
</P>
<P>
   That confirmation allowed physicists to proceed confidently with
developing what is known as the standard model theory of matter.
The Nobel Prize panel applauded their feat as a ``breakthrough in
our understanding of matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In his role with the Union of Concerned Scientists, Kendall
opposed President Ronald Reagan's ``Star Wars'' anti-missile
project, and he challenged the concept that such a system could
defend American cities from nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall consistently warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons,
space-based arsenals and radiation leaks from nuclear power
generators. His organization also studied the greenhouse effect, a
warming of the earth's climate as a result of emissions of
heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. Kendall helped to brief
President Clinton on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, who was born in Boston, graduated from Amherst College
in 1950 and received a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1955. He was a National
Science Foundation Fellow at MIT at the time. He lectured at
Stanford before joining the MIT faculty in 1961, rose to full
professor in 1967 and was named as the J.A. Stratton Professor of
Physics in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   His research interests covered nucleon structure, high-energy
electron scattering, and meson and neutrino physics. He was a
fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the recipient of
the 1981 Leo Szilard Award of the American Physical Society and a
1982 Bertrand Russell Society Award.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall is survived by a brother, John, also of Sharon.

   The Kurdish PKK party which has organized the mass takeover of
Greek embassies around Europe, is a hard outfit. No one should be
in any doubt about that.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should there be any doubt about the party's leader, Abdullah
Ocalan, whose rapid ejection from the Greek embassy in Nairobi and
extradition to Turkey has set off this explosion of protest.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the PKK for the last 14 years, he is a terrorist
with an appalling record of murder and torture.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the IRA, the PKK is a mirror image of the forces that
have suppressed it. There are peoples for whom history has shown no
remorse.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds are one of them. Caught in their mountain homeland at
the point where Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran all meet, they have
suffered the fate of being continually hounded by those nations.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole the Iraqi Kurds have come out with a degree of
dignity and some democracy, with their suffering at the hands of
Saddam Hussein rightly condemned and their interests partially
protected by the allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds from Turkey have been less fortunate. Oppressed with
the utmost brutality by the Turkish army, they have responded in
kind, matching terror for terror.
</P>
<P>
   They have also, as we see now, taken their cause to Europe, in
demonstrations, assassinations and hostage-taking that have shown
as much organizational sophistication as ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing Greek official buildings in 10 cities simultaneously
cannot be interpreted as an outpouring of spontaneous anger. It is
clearly the result of a plan long laid, probably directed
originally at Italy when it was considering extraditing the PKK
leader, now directed at Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations and occupations must be ended decisively, and
Turkey and Greece must be supported. Whatever the rights and wrongs
of causes, the principles of extradition and the sanctity of
diplomatic representation are far too crucial for compromise to be
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Europe must also accept that the Kurds have been
forced to take their struggle outside their own countries, and have
the means to do so. There are now Kurdish communities throughout
Europe, most of whom are genuine victims of political oppression at
home with a right to asylum abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Turkey, a determined applicant for European
Union membership and a stalwart ally in NATO, must be considered as
part of a wider Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The one fact needs to be balanced with the other. Turkey should
be encouraged in its drive to join the EU. It should be supported
in its extradition and trial of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time it should be quietly made clear that the
trial must be fair, and seen to be fair and that, in the end, the
Turkish government will have to exercise democratic control of its
security forces in the east of the country and deal by negotiation
with Kurdish demands for autonomy. That is what being part of
modern Europe means. &QL;

STRONG QUARTER BY DELL DOES NOT SATISFY WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dell Computer Corp. reported fourth-quarter earnings
Tuesday that matched analysts' estimates and would have been
stupendous for any other maker of personal computers. But it was
not enough for Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   That was because a slowing of the growth rate of Dell's revenue
touched off fears that the company's days of defying gravity were
over.
</P>
<P>
   Dell shares closed Tuesday at $88.75, down $1.125, in Nasdaq
trading, and traded as low as $85 after hours. But the real action
had already occurred, on Friday, when Dell shares tumbled $12, to
$89.8750, dragging the market with them, after two analysts
predicted that intensified competition would slow Dell's sales
growth from an average of 56 percent in the last eight quarters, to
something closer to 40 percent. In fact, on Tuesday Dell reported
sales growth of just 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is: Was the slowing down in growth rate a
lasting change in the metric of the company, or is it a one-quarter
phenomenon?'' said Charles Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon
Read. ``You can't expect a company of $18 billion in revenues to
continue to grow at 50 percent, but the signals were out there to
suggest that their growth rate would be much higher than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell, the company's founder, chairman and chief
executive, said in a telephone interview that by any conventional
measure, Dell's performance was strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't forecast our growth rate in units or revenues, but we
do believe we can outgrow the industry,'' he said. ``When you look
at our performance in the quarter, we set records for basically
everything. On a broad scale, it was a great quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Jan. 29, Dell reported earnings of $425
million, or 31 cents a share, up 49 percent from $285 million, or
20 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Revenues
rose 38 percent, to $5.17 billion, from $3.74 billion in the fourth
quarter of the 1998 fiscal year. Per-share figures reflect a
reduction in the number of shares outstanding; Dell spent $390
million during the quarter repurchasing shares.
</P>
<P>
   Dell noted that at 55 percent, Dell's growth rate, measured in
units, was still three and a half times that of the personal
computer industry as a whole and three times that of its nearest
competitor. ``Our win rate in corporate accounts continues to
climb, and we have what we think is a very strong pipeline,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that for any other company, Dell's performance in
the quarter would have been considered exemplary. But because the
company has outperformed the industry and exceeded estimates so
consistently for so long, any slowdown is cause for concern. Dell
shares have commanded a huge premium relative to other computer
manufacturers because the company's growth rate was so much higher.
If that growth rate declines, the stock price could fall sharply,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is really predicated on everything working, revenues
and earnings, and the revenues were far below expectations, about
$300 million low,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P.
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were it any other company, then it would have been an
outrageous quarter,'' said Wolf of Warburg Dillon Read. ``But at
Dell, with the stock trading at 75 times earnings, the betting has
been that the growth will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Dell reported earnings of $1.46 billion, or $1.05
a share, up 55 percent from $944 million, or 64 cents a share, in
the 1998 fiscal year. Revenues rose 48 percent, to $18.24 billion,
from $12.33 billion in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Dell said Tuesday that its board had declared a
2-for-1 stock split, the company's seventh in the last seven years.
All per-share data reflect the number of shares outstanding prior
to this split.

   The leader of the PKK for the last 14 years, he is a terrorist
with an appalling record of murder and torture.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the IRA, the PKK is a mirror image of the forces that
have suppressed it. There are peoples for whom history has shown no
remorse.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds are one of them. Caught in their mountain homeland at
the point where Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran all meet, they have
suffered the fate of being continually hounded by those nations.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole the Iraqi Kurds have come out with a degree of
dignity and some democracy, with their suffering at the hands of
Saddam Hussein rightly condemned and their interests partially
protected by the allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds from Turkey have been less fortunate. Oppressed with
the utmost brutality by the Turkish army, they have responded in
kind, matching terror for terror.
</P>
<P>
   They have also, as we see now, taken their cause to Europe, in
demonstrations, assassinations and hostage-taking that have shown
as much organizational sophistication as ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing Greek official buildings in 10 cities simultaneously
cannot be interpreted as an outpouring of spontaneous anger. It is
clearly the result of a plan long laid, probably directed
originally at Italy when it was considering extraditing the PKK
leader, now directed at Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations and occupations must be ended decisively, and
Turkey and Greece must be supported. Whatever the rights and wrongs
of causes, the principles of extradition and the sanctity of
diplomatic representation are far too crucial for compromise to be
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Europe must also accept that the Kurds have been
forced to take their struggle outside their own countries, and have
the means to do so. There are now Kurdish communities throughout
Europe, most of whom are genuine victims of political oppression at
home with a right to asylum abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Turkey, a determined applicant for European
Union membership and a stalwart ally in NATO, must be considered as
part of a wider Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The one fact needs to be balanced with the other. Turkey should
be encouraged in its drive to join the EU. It should be supported
in its extradition and trial of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time it should be quietly made clear that the
trial must be fair, and seen to be fair and that, in the end, the
Turkish government will have to exercise democratic control of its
security forces in the east of the country and deal by negotiation
with Kurdish demands for autonomy. That is what being part of
modern Europe means. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ Offering one of his regular Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) cease-fires to the Turkish army, Abdullah Ocalan appeared at
a damp, draughty press conference in a cement shack in the Bekaa
Valley in Lebanon six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His theme: the brotherhood of the Turkish and Kurdish peoples.
``We are so close, we are like the finger and the fingernail,'' he
announced. And I couldn't help wondering how often the two had been
separated in southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is, even in many Kurdish eyes, a psychopathic killer _ a
Kurdish Abu Nidal who punished suspicion with death, whose
guerrillas tamed their opponents not just with collaborator
executions but with the slaughter of every member of the family of
every collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish security forces responded with murder, ethnic
cleansing and wholesale invasion of the very northern Iraqi ``safe
haven'' which the West set up for the genocide-stricken Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is no political innocent, no abider by human rights, no
Robin Hood _ though the socialist characteristic might suit the man
with the bright, staring eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Kurds and Turks are tired of bloodletting,'' he told us
back in 1993. ``Permit me to return unarmed to Kurdistan in peace
to practice political action and start a dialogue between us.'' The
Turks told him to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   But the events of the last 24 hours embrace more than just
international hypocrisy. There is a broader, far more important
context to the capture of Abdullah Ocalan _ a story of American
intrigue, Kurdish betrayal and superpower support for the Muslim
nation, Turkey, which has become Israel's newest ally in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's seizure of the Kurds' most radical leader is likely to
lead to much further violence: to the hijacking of Turkish
aircraft, to attacks on Turkish embassies and diplomats _ as the
Turks are themselves well aware.
</P>
<P>
   But it also raises questions about the policies of the United
States towards Kurdistan's 20 million people, the largest nation in
the world without a state.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, the United States, whose CIA mission in
northern Iraq was destroyed by Saddam Hussein in 1996, was trying
yet again to create an anti-Saddam alliance between the two more
parochial Kurdish leaders, Massoud Barzani of the Kurdish
Democratic Party (KDP) and Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK).
</P>
<P>
   After their visit to Washington, Barzani, whose movement
collaborated with Saddam Hussein to destroy the PUK three years
ago, and Talabani, whose support from Iran gave Barzani an excuse
for seeking his overthrow, are now _ more or less _ on board the
latest American campaign to overthrow the Beast of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   With very good reason, Turkey was deeply troubled at this latest
alliance. If Barzani and Talabani were ever to create an embryo
Kurdish state in northern Iraq, the threat of a much larger Kurdish
entity _ including parts of Turkey, Syria and Iran as well as Iraq
_ would appear greater. The Turks were thus very suspicious of
Washington's latest ``peacemaking.''
</P>
<P>
   If the western Allies had offered independence to the Arabs who
overthrew their mutual enemies (the Ottoman Empire) in the First
World War, why shouldn't Washington offer Kurdish independence to
the Kurds if they helped to topple Saddam Hussein?
</P>
<P>
   How could Turkey show its anger? One way: to invite a senior
Iraqi official to Ankara to discuss a withdrawal of Turkish landing
rights for U.S. and British fighter-bombers at the Incirlik and
Batman air bases in southern Turkey _ the very airfields from which
Anglo-U.S. aircraft are bombing northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Tariq Aziz duly arrived in Ankara at the weekend as an honored
guest of the Turkish prime minister, Bulent Ecevit _ only to be
told, on Monday, that his request had been turned down.
</P>
<P>
   And then _ momentum mirabilis _ within hours of Turkey's rebuff
to the Iraqis, Ocalan fell into their hands in Nairobi, the one
city in which the CIA happens to have its Africa headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   After its military-strategic alliance with Israel, Turkey has
become one of America's best friends in the Middle East and an even
more important strategic ally against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Ocalan was put aboard a flight out of Syria last year
for Moscow, Rome and points east and south, Washington has demanded
the PKK leader's extradition to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. administration knew that Turkey would demand capital
punishment for its most infamous ``terrorist'' _ so its advice was,
in effect, a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens next? True, it's not a good time to fly on
Turkish Airlines or take a Turkish vacation or queue at a Turkish
embassy visa office.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's chums are about as choosy as a Cruise missile when it
comes to the civilians they slaughter in the pursuit of their
longer-term political aims. But without Ocalan, the most militant
Kurds, perhaps the largest of the surviving anti-western militias,
is now leaderless because _ like all messianic dictators _ Ocalan
groomed no obvious successors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kurds, whose existence merits a state every bit as much
as the Palestinians, are again a major issue in the Middle East.
They are _ to use a State Department cliche _ once more ``on the
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it could be by chance that the Barzani-Talabani agreement
presaged Tariq Aziz's visit to Ankara. And maybe it was just
coincidence that Aziz's mission collapsed hours before Ocalan's
capture in America's most CIA-infiltrated African city. But I doubt
it.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Ocalan has now returned to Turkey unarmed, as he
said he wished to do in 1993. And he can now embark on the
``political action'' he spoke about then - in a court appearance
that will be one of the most closely observed in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is always supposing he doesn't suffer the
unfortunate fate of other Kurdish prisoners: to be found one day,
an inexplicable suicide, hanging from his cell window. &QL;

EDWARDS'S KNEE INJURY VIEWED WITH PESSIMISM AFTER SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Robert Edwards's knee injury looks like a career-ender.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards underwent four hours of surgery Tuesday at Massachusetts
General Hospital, and when it was all over Patriots team physician
Bert Zarins said he was pessimistic about the running back's
chances to ever play football again.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, the team's top draft choice and leading rusher in 1998,
severely injured his left knee while playing in a flag football
game on the beach in Hawaii two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news was that, to the surprise of both the
Patriots and the NFL, Edwards has an insurance policy that
apparently would cover what is owed to him on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is good news,'' says Patriots vice president Andy
Wasynczuk. ``We didn't know anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarins, with help from Dr. Jesse Jupiter and Dr. Art Boland,
repaired four ligaments in Edwards's left knee. Unfortunately, they
found that the nerve controlling movement below the knee was
stretched and damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Zarins said the capacity of this nerve to heal and function will
determine whether Edwards will be able to play again. He definitely
will miss the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards began rehabilitation immediately, with continuous
passive motion. That is expected to continue for 4-6 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was thought that because Edwards's injury was not sustained
during an NFL game or workout _ but in an event sponsored by NFL
Properties _ that the collective bargaining agreement would
prohibit the Patriots from paying him if he couldn't play.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that his contract with New England _ worth
approximately $5.75 million over five years _ has been insured by
his lawyer, Andy Ree of Marietta, Ga., who referred the matter to
Ted Dipple, CEO of American Specialty Underwriters of Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a policy on Edwards but I can't reveal how much it is
for,'' said Dipple said Tuesday. ``That's all I can say on the
policy, but I will say that the NFL should have insured that game
that Edwards played in and they wouldn't have had to worry about
any of these problems. For not a lot of money, they could have
insured Edwards and all of the other players in that game against
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards signed a release with NFL Properties that absolved it of
liability in case of injury. The flag football game, featuring top
NFL rookies, has been part of Pro Bowl festivities in Hawaii for
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   When he signed with New England last spring, Edwards received a
bonus of approximately $2 million, collecting $1 million up front.
Even though they don't have to do so, the Patriots will send him a
check in the near future for another $1 million to complete the
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation is that Edwards's attorney took out a $2 million
policy against disability in case Edwards was injured away from
football. So even if he cannot play again, it appears that he would
be able to collect, tax free, that amount of money, which is just
about what he would make, after taxes, in the remaining four years
of his Patriots contract.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards's contractual agents, Terris Harris and Allan Wade, did
not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue was upset that Edwards was hurt
in the event and might have blown millions of dollars in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were unaware that he had some insurance, which is the good
news,'' said an NFL spokesman, ``but we are still very concerned
about Robert Edwards and his future. The matter of these kinds of
games are still under review.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who recently lost two key players in free agency _
center Dave Wohlabaugh and punter Tom Tupa _ brought in Green Bay
nose tackle Bob Kuberski and Cincinnati punter Lee Johnson to
Foxborough Tuesday for exploratory talks.

   WASHINGTON _ The smoke has started to clear from the
battlefield. The political casualties on both sides are being
counted, and _ on the Republican side at least _ they are huge.
</P>
<P>
   But out of the mists of battle, President Bill Clinton emerges,
still in office, as large as life and twice as boisterous, with two
years of his presidency left to run.
</P>
<P>
   The past year has focused, to an unprecedented degree, on him,
on his intimate life and his personal habits. The issue was not, as
it was with Richard Nixon, all those angular staff members plotting
war in the furthest corners of Southeast Asia while breeding dark
conspiracies closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   All of the accessories here _ the Betty Curries and Vernon
Jordans, ambassadors and private detectives _ were apparently
subordinate to the earthly desires of one man, President William
Jefferson Clinton, and the ways in which he had gone about
concealing them.
</P>
<P>
   And it is tempting to conclude that his salvation, too, lay
ultimately within himself, in his personal resources of strength
and his popularity in the country.
</P>
<P>
   He argued from the beginning to his former adviser Dick Morris
that it would be necessary to struggle to win the case, that there
were no short cuts.
</P>
<P>
   After he and Morris had discussed the possibility of an
immediate admission of guilt, he concluded that there was only one
way out. ``We just have to win,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing the past year has aught us about Bill
Clinton _ if we did not know it already _ it is his remarkable
resolve in the face of crisis, his ability to turn a major setback
into a rousing victory.
</P>
<P>
   He has three tasks ahead of him. The first is to show that he
will move on, that politics is now about America and not about him.
</P>
<P>
   The second is to create a platform that will pay dividends for
the Democrats in the next elections.
</P>
<P>
   The third, which will be the most difficult, is to persuade
Americans that his presidency was about more than just sex, lying
about sex, and the obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty of talk in the next few days about the huge
damage done to political institutions, to the presidency, to
politics itself, and most of it _ in the short term _ can be
written off. The president has confounded his enemies, and he has
emerged above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   The institution of the presidency has been weakened for decades,
at least since Watergate, arguably since Lyndon B. Johnson's
decision not to stand again in 1968 after the disasters of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's personal life may be in ruins, his dignity may be
in shreds, but he is still president. And he has huge assets to
deploy.
</P>
<P>
   What saved him was, in part, the astonishing way he has of
communicating with the people of America, individually, en masse,
on television, from the rostrum or the flagstones. It is a
pre-modern skill; it draws those around him, mystifies and
fascinates them.
</P>
<P>
   He will go out into America, campaign before the election even
gets under way, and make some noise. He also has a firmer grasp on
his own party than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Relationships have been formed under fire for the past year that
will be crucial in the next 12 months, especially with Richard
Gephardt, leader of the Democrats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   With Gephardt and Vice-President Al Gore, he will now start to
shape a strategy for keeping the White House, winning the Congress
and making a clean sweep in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   What he cannot judge, what no one can at the moment, is what
will happen next.
</P>
<P>
   The personal consequences for the president have been enormous.
If it is true that part of his deal with his wife was that his
philandering would be at least discreet, then that bargain is over.
</P>
<P>
   Not only the details of what he did, but his thoughts on his
marriage _ that it was loveless, that he was not sure if it would
survive the next two years _ are now horribly public.
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with his daughter, Chelsea, is said to have
suffered particularly badly.
</P>
<P>
   But the riddles and the contradictions of impeachment, and its
deepest scars, do not lie in the personality and biology of the
president. They lie in the internal dynamics of Washington, in the
Southern states where white conservatives came to loathe him so
much, and in the hearts and minds of people who believed they could
topple a president, even when it was clear that that was not what
the country wanted.
</P>
<P>
   We have been told so often that the president's survival was
puzzling that we have almost forgotten: this man was elected to
office, twice, and probably would be again if he could stand again.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, America has been changing. Clinton represents
this nation better than the Republicans, and that shone through
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to think he is a good man, or honest, or the
best president: you just had to watch the Republicans Friday,
wondering what had hit them, and realizing that it was Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago he was written off as terminally wounded. He had to
win; he did; and now he will seek to win again. &QL;

   MICROSOFT TESTIMONY ATTACKED ON SEVERAL FRONTS
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft's antitrust trial, a government lawyer attacked the
testimony of Brad Chase, the company's senior marketing executive,
on multiple fronts, and at times the witness's explanations seemed
to cause even the judge to question his credibility. During his two
days on the witness stand, Chase tried to hammer home one central
point: Microsoft's decision to bundle a Web browser with the
Windows operating system was not anticompetitive because
alternative browsers are easily available. The government argued
that the company's browser was gaining market share only because it
was bundled with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   FUND CREATED FOR VICTIMS OF NAZIS
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany announced the creation
of a fund, projected to amount to $1.7 billion, financed by 12
German companies to compensate victims of the Nazis. The companies
that announced their participation in the fund were
DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Siemens, Volkswagen, Hoechst,
Dresdner Bank, Krupp, Allianz, BASF, Bayer, BMW and Degussa.
</P>
<P>
   HEWLETT POSTS MIXED RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard reported mixed financial results, with
first-quarter earnings well above Wall Street estimates, but both
revenues and orders below expectations. For the quarter, which
ended Jan. 31, Hewlett-Packard reported earnings of $960 million,
or 92 cents a share, up 3.3 percent from $929 million, or 86 cents
a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 1 percent, to
$11.94 billion. Earnings were released after the markets closed.
The company's shares fell $5.9375, to $70.50.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer acquired Zip2, a privately held company that
helps newspapers develop city directory-type Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   DELTA TO BUY REST OF SMALL CARRIER
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines plans to pay $700 million to acquire the part of
Atlantic Southeast Airlines that it does not own in a deal with the
potential for labor problems similar to those that recently
disrupted American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   WAL-MART EARNINGS RISE 21%
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter earnings at Wal-Mart Stores rose a
better-than-expected 21 percent as the retailer continued to
attract shoppers with its affordable prices and wide selection.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS MIXED; DOW UP 22 POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were mixed as Dell Computer fell for a second session,
but a bond rally lifted financial companies. The Dow industrials
rose 22.14 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,297.03. The S&AMP;P
500 rose 11.74 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 1,241.87. Nasdaq
fell 8.02 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 2,313.87,
erasing a 46-point gain.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of volatile trading, bond prices shot sharply higher,
making up all of Friday's losses and then some.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET INDIFFERENT TO JAPAN MOVE
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bond yields declined slightly while the yen fell
noticeably after Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced that
the Government would resume buying a small amount of the bonds it
issues. But the move failed to quell general concerns over the bond
market and rising long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   XL CAPITAL TO BUY NAC RE
</P>
<P>
   XL Capital, one of the leaders in providing insurance against
huge corporate losses, announced that it was buying Nac Re, an
insurer in Greenwich, Conn., greatly expanding its reach into the
U.S. market.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aside from President Bill Clinton, who has emerged
from a year of scandal with his political authority undented and
his approval ratings sky high, the Lewinsky scandal has produced a
crop of winners and losers, some of them as unpredictable as
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (WINNER): The betrayed wife has emerged
with her dignity intact, her popularity soaring and the prospect of
her own political career on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Mrs. Clinton, 51, turned what could have been an
embarrassment into a personal triumph when she appeared on
television to deny misconduct by her husband and blame a ``vast
right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   When, seven months later, he confessed his ``inappropriate
conduct,'' she stood by him, campaigning the length and breadth of
the nation for Democrats for the November midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   She was also her husband's most effective weapon against his
feminist critics, who felt: ``If it's all right by Hillary, it's
all right by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton now attracts as much, if not more public applause
than her husband. The state of her marriage, however, is far from
clear.
</P>
<P>
   KENNETH STARR (LOSER): Appointed independent prosecutor in 1994
to investigate the Whitewater land deal and other allegations of
wrongdoing by President Clinton, extended his inquiry to cover the
Lewinsky affair in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pilloried throughout the long and expensive investigation by the
White House and Clinton supporters, Starr, 52, delivered his report
last September, a rip-roaring read of sex and dissemblance in the
White House, based mainly on Monica Lewinsky's confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was hailed by his (few) supporters as a conscientious
seeker after truth and condemned by the rest as a sex-crazed
investigator out to get the president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite periodic attempts to humanize his public image, he
remained typecast as a straitlaced zealot.
</P>
<P>
   CHERYL MILLS (WINNER): Thirty-three-year-old lawyer who became a
star after her passionate presentation of Clinton's case in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A slim, earnest woman, she spoke slowly and deliberately of the
sanctity of the ``rule of law'' and ``those facts, those stubborn
facts'' that stood in the way of the obstruction- of-justice
charge.
</P>
<P>
   A self-styled ``Army brat'' who grew up on military bases,
mainly in Virginia, she was recruited by the White House from a
Washington law firm when Clinton came to office and is as loyal as
any of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   While a glittering legal career now promises, there is one
shadow for Mills. She, too, is under investigation after evidence
she gave to a Congressional committee relating to another White
House scandal _ the presence of confidential FBI files in the White
House _ was condemned as perjurious.
</P>
<P>
   NEWT GINGRICH (LOSER): Having pledged to use every opportunity
in the campaign for the midterm Congressional elections to condemn
Clinton's behavior with Lewinsky, the House Speaker, 55, saw his
party suffer a net loss in the House of Representatives and only
maintain its representation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting responsibility for his party's failure, Gingrich
resigned from his position and the House, becoming the
highest-ranking and least predicted victim of the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   MATT DRUDGE (WINNER): The Internet gossip columnist demonstrated
to the world that a combination of brazen flair and modern
technology can run rings around the hidebound journalism-school
graduates who comprise the cream of the American media.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge, whose trademark trilby was a more and more frequent
sight on television talk shows as the year progressed, has been
shunned by the mainstream as a risk-taking maverick, but he was
more often vindicated than not.
</P>
<P>
   PAULA JONES (LOSER): An Arkansas native, now living in
California, whose sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton set off
the train of events that led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case was dismissed by an Arkansas judge last April
before it came to court, Clinton agreed to settle last December,
rather than risk the case being revived on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones received $850,000, much if not all of that will go
to lawyers' fees and she did not even get the presidential apology
she had held out for. &QL;

 &HT;    Governor asked to spare life of death row inmate
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If Wilford Berry is put to death Friday, Ohio
will have assisted in a mentally ill person's suicide, according to
an advocacy group which on Tuesday asked Gov. Bob Taft to spare the
life of the condemned killer known as The Volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   As the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill urged Taft not to
become an ``accessory to suicide,'' a bipartisan group of 11
lawmakers, including state Sen. Rhine McLin, D-Dayton, met with the
new governor in a separate bid to convince him to commute Berry's
death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel with all the questions about Berry's competency,
his mental illness, there's enough doubt to commute his death
sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole,''
said Sen. Mark Mallory, D-Cincinnati. ``Whether we convinced (Taft)
remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft spokesman Scott Milburn said the governor is ``watching
this thing unfold in the courts'' as he mulls whether to commute
Berry's sentence. Taft on Tuesday also spoke with the
brother-in-law of Berry's victim, who supports the execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Taft) is taking a very thoughtful look at it,'' Milburn
said. ``He's a death penalty supporter, but he takes the
commutation authority very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill doesn't have a
position on the death penalty, but ``opposes the execution of
someone with a biological brain disorder,'' said Terry Russell, the
group's Ohio executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 36, of Cleveland, who triedto kill himself at age 9 and
was physically and sexually abused as a child, has been diagnosed
with schizophrenia but has also been found legally competent in the
1989 robbery-murder of his boss, baker Charles Mitroff Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the state of Ohio should be assisting in Mr.
Berry's wish to die, which is a symptom of his disorder,'' Russell
said. ``We're not suggesting in any way he shouldn't be responsible
for his crime. We just believe the state shouldn't be putting a
mentally ill person to death.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Taft, national NAMI Executive Director Laurie
Flynn likened Berry to Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski, a mentally ill
killer who escaped the death penalty. ``Mr. Berry may lack a Ph.
D., as well as Mr. Kaczynski's national notoriety, but the
principle is the same. He should not be executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, called The Volunteer because he forfeited his rights to
legal appeals, is to become the first person to be executed in Ohio
in more than 35 years when he receives a lethal injection at 9 p.m.
Friday at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility at Lucasville. He
says he prefers death to life in prison. His scheduled execution
last March was halted by an 11th-hour stay.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals is considering a plea by
public defenders to again stop the execution so Berry can get a new
mental competency hearing on the grounds that he suffered brain
damage in a September 1997 riot on death row at Mansfield
Correctional Institution.
</P>
<P>
   If that effort fails, the public defender plans to file a
last-moment lawsuit in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, where
Berry was convicted. The appeal would cite a 1986 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling that found it unconstitutional to execute a person who
didn't understand why he was being put to death.

   WASHINGTON _ Aside from President Bill Clinton, who has emerged
from a year of scandal with his political authority undented and
his approval ratings sky high, the Lewinsky scandal has produced a
crop of winners and losers, some of them as unpredictable as
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (WINNER): The betrayed wife has emerged
with her dignity intact, her popularity soaring and the prospect of
her own political career on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Mrs. Clinton, 51, turned what could have been an
embarrassment into a personal triumph when she appeared on
television to deny misconduct by her husband and blame a ``vast
right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   When, seven months later, he confessed his ``inappropriate
conduct,'' she stood by him, campaigning the length and breadth of
the nation for Democrats for the November midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   She was also her husband's most effective weapon against his
feminist critics, who felt: ``If it's all right by Hillary, it's
all right by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton now attracts as much, if not more public applause
than her husband. The state of her marriage, however, is far from
clear.
</P>
<P>
   KENNETH STARR (LOSER): Appointed independent prosecutor in 1994
to investigate the Whitewater land deal and other allegations of
wrongdoing by President Clinton, extended his inquiry to cover the
Lewinsky affair in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pilloried throughout the long and expensive investigation by the
White House and Clinton supporters, Starr, 52, delivered his report
last September, a rip-roaring read of sex and dissemblance in the
White House, based mainly on Monica Lewinsky's confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was hailed by his (few) supporters as a conscientious
seeker after truth and condemned by the rest as a sex-crazed
investigator out to get the president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite periodic attempts to humanize his public image, he
remained typecast as a straitlaced zealot.
</P>
<P>
   CHERYL MILLS (WINNER): Thirty-three-year-old lawyer who became a
star after her passionate presentation of Clinton's case in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A slim, earnest woman, she spoke slowly and deliberately of the
sanctity of the ``rule of law'' and ``those facts, those stubborn
facts'' that stood in the way of the obstruction- of-justice
charge.
</P>
<P>
   A self-styled ``Army brat'' who grew up on military bases,
mainly in Virginia, she was recruited by the White House from a
Washington law firm when Clinton came to office and is as loyal as
any of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   While a glittering legal career now promises, there is one
shadow for Mills. She, too, is under investigation after evidence
she gave to a Congressional committee relating to another White
House scandal _ the presence of confidential FBI files in the White
House _ was condemned as perjurious.
</P>
<P>
   NEWT GINGRICH (LOSER): Having pledged to use every opportunity
in the campaign for the midterm Congressional elections to condemn
Clinton's behavior with Lewinsky, the House Speaker, 55, saw his
party suffer a net loss in the House of Representatives and only
maintain its representation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting responsibility for his party's failure, Gingrich
resigned from his position and the House, becoming the
highest-ranking and least predicted victim of the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   MATT DRUDGE (WINNER): The Internet gossip columnist demonstrated
to the world that a combination of brazen flair and modern
technology can run rings around the hidebound journalism-school
graduates who comprise the cream of the American media.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge, whose trademark trilby was a more and more frequent
sight on television talk shows as the year progressed, has been
shunned by the mainstream as a risk-taking maverick, but he was
more often vindicated than not.
</P>
<P>
   PAULA JONES (LOSER): An Arkansas native, now living in
California, whose sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton set off
the train of events that led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case was dismissed by an Arkansas judge last April
before it came to court, Clinton agreed to settle last December,
rather than risk the case being revived on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones received $850,000, much if not all of that will go
to lawyers' fees and she did not even get the presidential apology
she had held out for. &QL;

   LONDON _ International medical experts rallied to the cause of
the baked potato as one of the most effective defenses against
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   They were challenging a U.S. study that suggested dietary fiber,
found in abundance in potatoes with skins and in other vegetables,
failed to protect against bowel cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon McVie, director general of the Cancer Research Campaign,
said Tuesday the study of 89,000 nurses in the New England Journal
of Medicine last month was not representative of the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England Journal paper does not change the message. A
high-fiber, low-fat diet protects against bowel cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The study contradicted the accepted wisdom of the benefits of
fiber. The U.S. researchers said cancer was as common in women,
regardless of how much fiber they ate.
</P>
<P>
   But Professor McVie reviewed the research on fiber and cancer,
and said the overwhelming evidence supports the benefits of a
high-fiber diet, which can also reduce the risk of heart disease,
high-blood pressure and non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 39 studies on fiber and cancer, most showed it had a
protective effect. The latest research, in the European Journal of
Cancer Prevention, was further proof of the benefits of fiber, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Professor McVie said more research was needed but the
recommended intake of 18 to 20 grams of fiber, or five portions of
fruit and vegetables a day, still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Ten slices of wholemeal bread, 18 bananas, four baked potatoes
or 64 wholemeal crackers contain the suggested daily allowance of
fiber but Professor McVie suggested a variety of fiber-rich foods
to keep cancer at bay. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Feeling lacklustre? Prone to allergies or
headaches? Well here, at least according to the latest medical
health-kick fad in America, is the reason: you aren't getting
enough oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In prehistoric times, before we started deforesting the
planet, 30 percent of the air was oxygen. Now the average is around
21 percent and in cities like Los Angeles it is as low as 12 to 14
percent. That leads to disease and fatigue,'' explains John Wood, a
vegan chef who considers himself something of an expert on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   As indeed he should. Wood is the general manager of a trendy new
``oxygen bar'' on Hollywood's Sunset Strip where, for $13 a pop,
customers are invited to insert a plastic canula tube up their
noses and spend 20 minutes breathing a cocktail of ``oxygen rich''
air, fruit flavorings and aromatherapy oils with names like
Clarity, Passion and Joy.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the queues snaking around the corner from his
establishment on weekend nights, the concept is catching on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a company called Rose Creek Health Products recently
took out full-page ads in ``USA Today'' for a product called
Vitamin O. O stands for oxygen, and the product _ a liquid to be
taken in drop form _ claims to add the oxygen to your system that
simple breathing cannot provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bloodstream absorbs the Vitamin O and carries the pure
oxygen straight to your cells and tissues,'' the ad explained.
``There, it maximizes your nutrients, purifies your bloodstream and
eliminates toxins and poisons.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds so simple it is almost brilliant. ``There's not enough
oxygen in the air in big cities, or in northern latitudes in
wintertime, because there is no grass producing oxygen or leaves on
the trees,'' said Rose Creek's president Don Smith.
</P>
<P>
   His company has been selling 50,000 vials of Vitamin O per
month, and he swears he has received testimonials from grateful
customers, young and old, who have enjoyed relief from conditions
such as wheezing and achiness.
</P>
<P>
   Richard DeAndrea, a Los Angeles doctor and part-owner of the O2
oxygen bar, makes even more grandiose claims: ``Studies have shown
oxygen to be beneficial in fighting cancer, heart disease, chronic
fatigue and migraine headaches. Oxygen may even slow the aging
process.''
</P>
<P>
   So is this the great medical breakthrough we have all been
waiting for, or a load of baloney?
</P>
<P>
   According to Bob Park, a physics professor at the University of
Maryland who specializes in debunking pseudoscience, the makers of
Vitamin O blow their own gaffe when they admit in their adverts
that their product contains ``a liquid solution of sodium chloride
and distilled water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell people exactly what they are buying,'' he says,
``ordinary salt water.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the company claims Vitamin O is ``so safe you can drop
it in your eye.'' Whether it is worth $40 for a four-ounce vial,
though, is open to question.
</P>
<P>
   Is it not possible that the water has been oxygen-enhanced? It
is possible, acknowledges Professor Park, but to extract the oxygen
the consumer would need gills. ``You get more oxygen from a single
deep breath than from a daily dose of Vitamin O,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Your correspondent was too tightfisted to try Vitamin O for
himself, but he did venture to the O2 bar on Sunset Strip, where
the oxygen is consumed on a long circular banquette adorned with
brightly colored cushions.
</P>
<P>
   Behind hang an array of metal flexi-tubes which transport the
oxygen down into flavored aromatic water and up into your nose.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing looks and feels like an opium den, except that
the merest trace of vice has been erased.
</P>
<P>
   O2 _ which curiously is co-owned by Hollywood bad boy Woody
Harrelson _ is so pure it serves no alcohol, and its restaurant
offers only uncooked vegan food.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen bars did not start in California, but made their way here
via Tokyo and Toronto, where they are also popular.
</P>
<P>
   If there are not more of them in the United States it is partly
because of federal restrictions on natural gases in places of
public entertainment _ hence, despite numerous efforts, no oxygen
bars in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   So who frequents them? According to O2 staff members, the oxygen
treatment is popular not just with health freaks but also with
high-spirited customers from the Red Rock bar next door, who come
in at the end of a boozy night to sober up and hope they can stave
off a hangover.
</P>
<P>
   With the canula inserted up my nose and a steady stream of
Clarity-flavored oxygen whooshing into my system, I asked the
manager, John Wood, whether the gas comes straight from a tank or
is purified in-house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not oxygen, it's oxygen-rich air,'' he explained, a
little cagily. Street air is passed through a custom-built filter
to make it purer. How much purer? He wouldn't say, for fear that
any claim might be challenged in court by some smartipants
customer.
</P>
<P>
   How did he or Dr. DeAndrea know the oxygen was so beneficial?
Again, he looked sheepish and acknowledged that part of the
phenomenon was a ``placebo effect'' _ people feeling better because
they want to.
</P>
<P>
   Along with my companion, I walked out into the maelstrom of West
Hollywood feeling slightly giddy, not unlike the sensation of
having breathed in exhaust fumes. Within minutes, both of us felt
an oncoming headache.
</P>
<P>
   The bar's slogan is ``Eat _ Drink _ Breathe _ Love!'' Fine
sentiments, but I'm not sure I'll be rushing back for more. &QL;

<P>
   It sounds so simple it is almost brilliant. ``There's not enough
oxygen in the air in big cities, or in northern latitudes in
wintertime, because there is no grass producing oxygen or leaves on
the trees,'' said Rose Creek's president Don Smith.
</P>
<P>
   His company has been selling 50,000 vials of Vitamin O per
month, and he swears he has received testimonials from grateful
customers, young and old, who have enjoyed relief from conditions
such as wheezing and achiness.
</P>
<P>
   Richard DeAndrea, a Los Angeles doctor and part-owner of the O2
oxygen bar, makes even more grandiose claims: ``Studies have shown
oxygen to be beneficial in fighting cancer, heart disease, chronic
fatigue and migraine headaches. Oxygen may even slow the aging
process.''
</P>
<P>
   So is this the great medical breakthrough we have all been
waiting for, or a load of baloney?
</P>
<P>
   According to Bob Park, a physics professor at the University of
Maryland who specializes in debunking pseudoscience, the makers of
Vitamin O blow their own gaffe when they admit in their adverts
that their product contains ``a liquid solution of sodium chloride
and distilled water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell people exactly what they are buying,'' he says,
``ordinary salt water.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the company claims Vitamin O is ``so safe you can drop
it in your eye.'' Whether it is worth $40 for a four-ounce vial,
though, is open to question.
</P>
<P>
   Is it not possible that the water has been oxygen-enhanced? It
is possible, acknowledges Professor Park, but to extract the oxygen
the consumer would need gills. ``You get more oxygen from a single
deep breath than from a daily dose of Vitamin O,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Your correspondent was too tightfisted to try Vitamin O for
himself, but he did venture to the O2 bar on Sunset Strip, where
the oxygen is consumed on a long circular banquette adorned with
brightly colored cushions.
</P>
<P>
   Behind hang an array of metal flexi-tubes which transport the
oxygen down into flavored aromatic water and up into your nose.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing looks and feels like an opium den, except that
the merest trace of vice has been erased.
</P>
<P>
   O2 _ which curiously is co-owned by Hollywood bad boy Woody
Harrelson _ is so pure it serves no alcohol, and its restaurant
offers only uncooked vegan food.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen bars did not start in California, but made their way here
via Tokyo and Toronto, where they are also popular.
</P>
<P>
   If there are not more of them in the United States it is partly
because of federal restrictions on natural gases in places of
public entertainment _ hence, despite numerous efforts, no oxygen
bars in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   So who frequents them? According to O2 staff members, the oxygen
treatment is popular not just with health freaks but also with
high-spirited customers from the Red Rock bar next door, who come
in at the end of a boozy night to sober up and hope they can stave
off a hangover.
</P>
<P>
   With the canula inserted up my nose and a steady stream of
Clarity-flavored oxygen whooshing into my system, I asked the
manager, John Wood, whether the gas comes straight from a tank or
is purified in-house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not oxygen, it's oxygen-rich air,'' he explained, a
little cagily. Street air is passed through a custom-built filter
to make it purer. How much purer? He wouldn't say, for fear that
any claim might be challenged in court by some smartipants
customer.
</P>
<P>
   How did he or Dr. DeAndrea know the oxygen was so beneficial?
Again, he looked sheepish and acknowledged that part of the
phenomenon was a ``placebo effect'' _ people feeling better because
they want to.
</P>
<P>
   Along with my companion, I walked out into the maelstrom of West
Hollywood feeling slightly giddy, not unlike the sensation of
having breathed in exhaust fumes. Within minutes, both of us felt
an oncoming headache.
</P>
<P>
   The bar's slogan is ``Eat _ Drink _ Breathe _ Love!'' Fine
sentiments, but I'm not sure I'll be rushing back for more. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ It came into our building here in Washington a few
months ago, and at first I barely noticed it. But it was always
there, somewhere, floating in the air just out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   It is music. Or rather, it is muzak, for there is a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Muzak should properly be given a capital M. As well as being a
generic term, it is also a large and thriving company based in
Seattle, in the fashionable Pacific Northwest of the U.S., with
revenues of about $100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It pumps out its product via satellite feeds to thousands of
businesses across America every day, broadcasting 60 different
programs, of which only one is now classic ``background music.''
</P>
<P>
   It has its origins way back in the 1920s, when a military
officer was trying his hand at the new science of telephony.
</P>
<P>
   General George Squiers was a formidable character, who
experimented with radio in 1897, only a year after Marconi sent the
first ever wireless message, and was the first-ever passenger in an
aircraft when he flew with the Wright Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   He helped to create two of the most powerful instruments of
American global domination: the United States Air Force, and Muzak.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Squiers formed the name of his company from ``music'' and
the name of his favorite high-technology company, Kodak. It was a
roaring success, and it very quickly became the soundtrack to the
American century.
</P>
<P>
   Whispering strings played cover versions of the Carpenters'
``Afternoon Delight'' or ``A Walk in the Black Forest'' as
Americans went to the supermarket, the garage, motels, restaurants,
fast-food joints or the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   It even accompanied Neil Armstrong to the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans left Vietnam in 1975, the helicopters
clattering away through small-arms fire, Muzak played heedlessly on
in the lobby of the American Embassy while puzzled North Vietnamese
soldiers skidded about the marble floor.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was, by common consent, terrible. It was
unimaginative, dreary, saccharine-sweet rubbish that grated on the
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   If that is your mental image of Muzak, however, it is perhaps
time to think again.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the company had a small revolution, and it has
put the emphasis back on the main product.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company was built on believing in the power of music,''
says Kenny Kahn, the vice president for marketing, and music is now
what it is about.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the programs offered by Muzak these days are what they
call ``foreground music'' _ original versions of the songs, not
camped-up reproductions. And it is more likely to be Nirvana or
Jimi Hendrix, great products of the city of Seattle, than Puff the
Magic Dragon arranged for strings.
</P>
<P>
   The company itself no longer wishes to think about the bad old
days and has become (slightly self-consciously) hip. ``Our goal is
to say to people, we are not what you think we are,'' says Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   It has a whizzo web site and lots of new concepts to describe
what it does, which sound like the sleeve notes from a techno
album. Its technicians are now described as ``audio architects.''
</P>
<P>
   And it has paid off: last week, the company was bought out for
over $250 million dollars by a Boston-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a long time before the word loses its associations,
but at least people have heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with that,'' says Kahn. ``It's better to be
recognized in some shape or another than not to be recognized,'' he
says, paraphrasing Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Muzak is the world's largest radio station, sending
DJ-free music around the nation by satellite and wire. It is about
to start using the World-Wide Web to sell its wares, taking a
logical step on from its earlier use of technology: after all, Gen.
Squier's company was originally called ``Wired Radio.''
</P>
<P>
   And Muzak is no longer a term of pure invective, as it was a
decade ago. Background music has become deeply fashionable, with
the old 101-Strings sound repackaged as ambient, ``lounge'' or
``cocktail.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Not everybody likes it, of course: indeed some people see it as
the single greatest threat to civilization.
</P>
<P>
   A British organization, based in Wiltshire, called Pipedown
seeks to expunge the menace from England's green and pleasant land.
``The right to public silence is one we must fight to establish,''
it says, claiming success at Gatwick Airport and Sainsburys.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been universally popular in the Independent building
in Washington. The property company which owns the block told us in
their newsletter that everyone loved it, and that feet had been
seen tapping in the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, were banging their heads on the wall. There were
dark plots hatched, whisperings about pliers and wiring systems.
Suddenly last week, the seventh floor was silent again.
</P>
<P>
   But by Monday, it was back: Muzak is, it seems, an unstoppable
force. &QL;

U.S. EDUCATION CHIEF URGES BETTER TEACHER LICENSING AND
INCENTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his annual speech assessing the state of
American education, Education Secretary Richard Riley on Tuesday
recommended that states adopt more thorough licensing systems to
screen new teachers and reward experienced teachers with special
designations and extra pay.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's remarks, made before an audience of educators at
California State University in Long Beach, underlined the growing
concern nationally about the quality and training of teachers and
represented the secretary's most detailed proposal yet for trying
to improve the situation through a change in the way teachers are
licensed.
</P>
<P>
   States are in no way compelled to follow the model that Riley is
advocating, and many have already raised standards for
certification. Educators said Riley's plea could nudge some states
that have been contemplating changes toward finally committing to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next few years are, in my opinion, critical for the future
of American education,'' Riley said. ``We can no longer fiddle
around the edges of how we recruit, prepare, retain and reward
America's teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his recommendations about licensing, Riley
announced several efforts by the Education Department intended to
improve teachers' professional lives as well as to spur discussion
about ways to enhance their skills.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Education Department was creating a job bank that
would help connect teachers around the country with available jobs
that matched their skills. In addition, he said, the department
would convene a National Conference on Teacher Quality and
establish a National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching
for the 21st Century.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Part of what lay behind Riley's remarks were two statistics. One
is a federal estimate that in the next 10 years, as teachers retire
and student enrollment rises, the country will need 2.2 million new
teachers, and education officials will have to attract and hire
them at a higher rate than they have in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The other statistic comes from a 1998 survey, released in
January, showing that only one-fifth of more than 4,000 teachers
across the country said they felt well qualified to teach in a
modern classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia
University, said that though educators in many states were trying
to address that problem and to toughen the standards for new
teachers, those efforts were bound to be undermined by the sheer
physical need for men and women in front of the nation's
blackboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``States are actually going to have to lower requirements to get
warm bodies in the classroom,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the problem was being exacerbated by the increasingly
popular pledge by political candidates to reduce classroom size.
</P>
<P>
   Levine nonetheless saluted Riley's expressed vision of teaching
as a selective profession with an arc of advancement and escalating
financial rewards. Other educators were also enthusiastic, saying
that Riley's goals were commendable and that his word did carry
weight with state education officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bully pulpit is very powerful here in calling on states to
do this,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the American
Federation of Teachers, the nation's second-largest teachers union.
Ms. Feldman said the union basically supported Riley's licensing
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Riley proposed that there be three state licenses
for different stages of a teacher's career. Teachers would
initially be licensed to begin teaching; they would then be
licensed to continue teaching after a few years if they passed,
among other things, a peer review process much broader than the one
most states currently use.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, experienced teachers who pursued further education and
obtained extra skills could receive licenses that would give them a
special designation and a higher salary.
</P>
<P>
   Every state licenses new teachers in some manner, but after that
point, state policies diverge widely. Teachers around the country
can obtain a kind of special certification through the National
Board for Professional Teaching Standards, but a minority of states
reward teachers who go through the intensive, expensive program
with additional compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a sea change in public thinking about the value of
teaching,'' Riley said, adding that ``too many teachers are leaving
the profession because of low pay, poor working conditions and weak
school leadership.''

HOUSE MEMBERS PROTEST USE OF FEDERAL MONEY IN RESEARCH ON STEM CELL
RESEARCH
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a letter, 70 members of the House of Representatives have
asked the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
to rescind a ruling that federal money may be used for research on
human embryonic stem cells, the primordial cells from which all the
tissues of the body are developed.
</P>
<P>
   Human embryonic stem cells were isolated and cultivated for the
first time last year in work that scientists have hailed as a first
step to novel and far-reaching therapies, particularly to replace
aged or damaged human tissues.
</P>
<P>
   But the manner of obtaining the embryonic stem cells is viewed
as morally unacceptable by opponents of abortion, including the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops. The stem cells were
derived by one group of biologists from long-frozen embryos that
had been created in fertility clinics in excess of the patients'
needs and by another group from aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional letter to Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala was drafted by the House pro-life caucus, chaired by
Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., and James Barcia, D-Mich. Most of
its signatories, including Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip,
and Richard Armey, R-Texas, the majority leader, and Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., are anti-abortion Republicans, although eight Democrats are
also among the signers.
</P>
<P>
   The letter says that the position of the Department of Health
and Human Services on stem cell research, enunciated in a ruling
last month by Harriet S. Rabb, the department's general counsel,
``would violate both the letter and spirit of the federal law''
that bars federal support for research in which human embryos are
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The department has said federally supported biologists may not
derive stem cells from embryos _ the specific prohibition of the
law _ but may conduct research on the stem cells derived by other
scientists using private funds.
</P>
<P>
   The House letter asserts that Congress' ban on federal funds to
derive the cells obviously extended to research conducted on such
cells.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the department, Laurie Boeder, said it could
not comment on the House letter without further study.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' ban on federal financing for embryo research has been
exerted in the form of a rider attached for the last three years to
the appropriations bill that sets the budget for the National
Institutes of Health. The rider has originated in the House, from
Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark. But U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the
chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that handles
NIH, is a strong supporter of stem cell research, as is the ranking
minority member, Sen. Tom Harkin, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said on Tuesday that ``we are in very deep water'' on
the issues raised by the House members and that he would hold a
hearing on their concerns
</P>
<P>
   ``But what we are looking at in broader terms is the possible
cure for major diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer and
heart disease, from the use of what are essentially discarded
embryos,'' Specter said. Researchers hope stem cell research will
lead to ways to grow replacement tissues for use in people with
these and other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he had taken time out from the impeachment
proceedings against President Clinton to discuss stem cell research
with Dr. Harold Varmus, the director of the National Institutes of
Health. In his view, Varmus should continue reviewing research
applications while the House members' letter is being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Doerflinger, associate director for policy development
at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the House
members' letter accorded with arguments he had made at two recent
hearings on stem cell research held by Specter. He said the
disagreement was not a clash between science and religion but ``a
clash between obtaining medical progress in morally acceptable and
morally unacceptable means.''

THANKS TO ARBITRATION, JETER GETS $5 MILLION DEAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Derek Jeter realized a childhood dream in playing
shortstop for the Yankees and winning two championships in his
first three years. To Jeter, the money that comes with the position
has never seemed quite as important as the job. Even if he had lost
in arbitration Tuesday, he would have been satisfied. ``If I lose,
I'll be making $3 million and I don't think I can sit around and
cry about that,'' Jeter said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But he won: A three-man arbitration panel on Tuesday awarded
Jeter a $5 million salary, rather than the Yankees' proposal of
$3.2 million. Jeter, paid $750,000 last year, will make the highest
salary in history for any player with between three and four years
of service time.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's agent, Casey Close, offered to settle the case at $4.1
million just minutes before Monday's hearing, but Yankees General
Manager Brian Cashman rejected that and forged ahead, sure he had a
winning argument. After being informed of the decision _ and
delivering the news to the volatile owner George Steinbrenner _
Cashman said forlornly, ``I think George is happy with Derek, and
disappointed in me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of money,'' Jeter said. ``I'm not going to kid
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's award matches the second-largest in baseball history;
pitcher Jack McDowell was awarded $5.3 million in 1994 and
outfielder Ruben Sierra won $5 million in 1992. The $1.8 million
disparity between the numbers submitted in the Jeter hearing was
the largest ever. The previous high was $1.5 million, set in 1992
when Rafael Palmeiro won $3.85 million rather than the $2.35
million proposed by the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees officials, reeling after being informed of the decision
Tuesday, are faced with another case Wednesday, when closer Mariano
Rivera is set for arbitration. Rivera is asking for $4.25 million
and the Yankees are proposing $3 million, but there have been
indications the two sides will look to settle the case before the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' payroll will be in the range of $83 million to $84
million, and even with his record salary, Jeter, 24, will be the
seventh-highest-paid Yankee player.
</P>
<P>
   Above and beyond any of his teammates, however, Jeter possesses
star quality _ he's personable, a teen idol, and spectacular in
what he does and how he does it. Jeter is becoming one of
baseball's most recognizable figures, an heir apparent to Cal
Ripken Jr., a status that is reflected in his growing number of
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   His agent noted Jeter's star qualities in his presentation
Monday to the three arbitrators after reciting his statistics. As
Jeter listened calmly, Close presented exhibits regarding the
player's endorsements and the growing number of Internet inquiries
about Jeter in the players association's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   To the Yankees' officials, this seemed a reach. The cold, hard
numbers, they felt, were clearly in their favor. Juan Gonzalez of
the Texas Rangers previously had the top salary for a position
player between three and four years of service time, $3.4 million
in 1994, and he had led the league with 46 home runs the year
before. Close was proposing that Jeter be paid about 50 percent
more than Gonzalez had been. Last week, Mark Grudzielanek, a
lesser-known shortstop with three solid years in the majors, lost
his case and will be paid $1.9 million _ and Nicholas Zumas, the
arbitrator who made that decision, was sitting on the Jeter panel
Monday, along with Gilbert Vernon and Ira Jaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Casey, who had already won two cases for teams this
spring, presented the Yankees' case, lauding Jeter's performance
but arguing the precedent did not support his bid. The shortstop
spoke only once, saying politely that he had nothing to add to his
agent's arguments. Yankee officials left the room feeling they
would win _ though they were leery about the fact that the teams
had won all five previous arbitration decisions this spring. The
pendulum was bound to swing back, they felt. And it did.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cashman, who recently received a three-year contract extension,
blamed himself. With Steinbrenner unreachable Monday morning,
Cashman had made the decision to forgo a settlement and push ahead
with the hearing; for this, Cashman may well have been the target
of extreme anger by Steinbrenner in their 20-minute conversation
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision to arbitrate this case,'' said Cashman,
sounding like a post-hurricane weather vane. ``I thought their
figure was extremely out of line, but I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider Derek part of the family,'' Steinbrenner said.
``Derek did what he had to do. Cash did what he had to do, I have
no bad feeling. I'm just a lot poorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is tied to the team for at least three more seasons, after
which he would become eligible for free agency. &QL;

JAPAN BOND PLAN FAILS TO IMPRESS MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WUDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The markets conceded only a small victory to the
Japanese government Tuesday after it announced that it would resume
buying a small amount of the bonds it issues.
</P>
<P>
   The bond markets here have been racked in recent weeks by the
government's financial woes, including bank bailouts, expensive
stimulus packages, emergency loans, budget deficits and a
ballooning debt burden. Investors have dumped bonds over the last
four months, and Japanese politicians have been watching with
trepidation as the yields on long-term Japanese bonds have tripled,
threatening to snuff out any early recovery from the worst
recession since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The government's move Tuesday failed to quell general concerns
over the bond market and rising long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a token gesture in the face of political demand,'' said
William Campbell, fixed-income analyst at J.P. Morgan here. ``But
we don't see much impact on the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yields on the benchmark 10-year bond settled slightly lower
Tuesday, falling 15 basis points, or hundredths of a point, to 1.99
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The yen noticeably weakened, partly on remarks by Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that an agency that manages public pension
funds would buy bonds. And the influential Vice Finance Minister
Eisuke Sakakibara seemed to reverse position when he said late
Monday that he would support a weaker yen. Miyazawa also endorsed a
weaker yen, which touched 117.50 to the dollar at one point here
Tuesday. The yen declined further in New York trading, settling at
118.74 to the dollar, a sharp fall in value from 114.21 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japanese interest rates are very low by world
standards, their recent rise makes borrowing more expensive at
home, further depressing an already feeble economy. Rates shot up
last fall when Miyazawa said the government would stop using the
pension management agency to buy bonds. In December and in
February, investors dumped bonds _ sending their prices down and
their yields, which move in the opposite direction, soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Worries over interest rates have also affected the bond market
in New York, sending prices down sharply last Friday, though
Treasuries reversed course and rose Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates in Japan could lure capital from U.S. Treasury
debt, as Japanese investors see increasingly attractive returns at
home and become skittish about taking risks that the yen will
strengthen and reduce the value of their dollar-denominated
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that began happening last month as investors here sold
bonds and other holdings in the United States and elsewhere to
bring profits back to cover losses in preparation for settling
books at the end of the fiscal year on March 31. One of the worst
nightmares of American officials is a selloff of U.S. Treasury
bonds by cash-needy Japanese corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is a natural exporter of capital, and any hiccup in
outflow can have a disruptive effect,'' said Jeffrey Young,
economist at Salomon Smith Barney here. ``We see the U.S. Treasury
yields rising and the yen strong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By some measures, Japan's bond market is set sometime this year
to become the world's largest, surpassing that of the United States
_ though much of that reflects the yen's strength. By most
accounts, the U.S. bond market is still the largest, but the trend
seems clear. Budget surpluses in Washington would reduce the amount
of bonds the Treasury has to issue, while growing burdens in Japan
mean several more years of money-raising and a swelling bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's move caught the markets off guard. When word leaked
out early Tuesday morning of the impending announcement, buyers
lined up before the bond market opened. But the buying spree was
short-lived as investors learned that the purchases would last only
until March and amount to 200 billion yen, or $1.7 billion, a month
_ less than one-sixth of the government's monthly purchases last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the move appeared aimed at appeasing financial
institutions and companies sitting on huge bond losses that they
will have to absorb at the end of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's policy-makers have grown increasingly worried about the
nation's public finances. The budget deficit this year is rising to
10 percent of output, and its accumulated debt is expected to
exceed the total size of the economy. As early as 2000, the
government will have to pay back a portion of postal savings
deposits worth 100 trillion yen, now about $850 billion. Officials
say that about half of those deposits will be renewed, leaving
roughly $425 billion to be repaid in the first two years of the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for all this, analysts say the government has to turn to
the bond markets to raise money, and the idea that Japan this year
has to raise more than $500 billion has roiled the markets. Another
way to raise money is to sell part of its current bond holdings,
but that could roil the debt markets further.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the nation's central bank said it would bring the
overnight lending rate down to a thread above zero. The bond
markets did not settle down, however, and the Finance Ministry
began to worry, analysts say. Some are calling the purchases a
``price-keeping operation,'' or PKO, an attempt to support the
market with government money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've entered the silly season,'' Campbell of J.P. Morgan
said. ``It's a symbolic PKO for February and March. What it really
implies is a window-dressing operation.''

A RIVAL PLUCKS AUTISSIER FROM THE SOUTH PACIFIC  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The overnight search for Isabelle Autissier, the French solo
sailor, ended with a successful rescue at sea early on Tuesday in a
remote ocean area 1,900 miles from South America.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni Soldini, one of the French sailor's rivals in an
around-the-world yacht race called Around Alone, fetched Autissier
from her overturned yacht in the South Pacific. She was apparently
uninjured, and is now safely aboard Soldini's 60-foot sailboat,
Fila.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello,'' Soldini called to race headquarters by satellite
phone. ``This is Fila. I have Isa inboard with me. Isa and I are
going back to the race. Gio.''
</P>
<P>
   The cryptic message early on Tuesday was music to the ears of
race organizers, who had feared the worst. But with the help of
emergency radio beacons and the high-tech signals of a
satellite-tracking system known as Comstat-C, Soldini found his
proverbial needle in a haystack.
</P>
<P>
   At first the situation looked grim. On arriving at the apparent
search area after a 200-mile diversion from his race route, Soldini
did not see Autissier's 60-foot sailboat in the early-morning
darkness. He wasn't sure if she had capsized, or was in a life
raft.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw nothing but open sea, he changed direction slightly
to the northwest. Two miles into the new course, the 32-year-old
Soldini spotted Autissier's upturned hull bobbing in rough seas.
</P>
<P>
   He made two passes by the boat, yelling her name, but got no
response. On the third pass, Soldini threw a hammer at the
upside-down hull. With that, Autissier appeared, presumably from a
hatch opening in the boat's stern. She told Soldini she had been
sleeping, and had not expected anyone to find her so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Race organizers learned through Autissier's shore crew on
Tuesday that the capsizing appeared to be the result of a problem
with the boat's self-steering gear. The yacht reared up in 20 knots
of breeze, then laid over on its side.
</P>
<P>
   The full story of her demise is likely to become known as the
two sailors head toward Punta del Este, Uruguay, the next port of
call in the 27,000-mile race that began last Sept. 16 in
Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boat suddenly turned more than 90 degrees, and I could no
longer be in the cockpit,'' Autissier was quoted as saying by The
Associated Press. ``Then it suddenly turned over, and I didn't have
time to shut the door.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very quickly, the mast snapped into pieces,'' she said. ``When
I saw that, I sent the signal because there was nothing else I
could do. Then I began to get organized, getting security material
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Autissier was first over all at the start of this leg of the
race, which began on Feb. 6 from Auckland, New Zealand. While she
is no longer a competitor, Soldini is still considered an official
race entry. As long as Autissier does not help him sail Fila, he
will keep his place in the race. Soldini will probably receive a
time allotment for changing course.
</P>
<P>
   It was a joyful conclusion to a horrific situation. For the
second time in her solo-racing career, Autissier found herself
stranded on a wrecked 60-foot sailboat in the middle of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   This time, one individual found her against every odd but
technology. Soldini followed a path of latitude and longitude
reports being emitted from two emergency beacons triggered during
Autissier's capsizing. He also had an unquestioning goal _ to find
a friend and fellow competitor lost at sea.

HILLARY CLINTON GIVING `CAREFUL THOUGHT' TO SENATE RACE IN NEW
YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Tuesday that she is
giving ``careful thought'' to running for the U.S. Senate from New
York, the first lady's friends and advisers warned her that a race
could be brutal and that the easy victory predicted by state party
leaders is not at all guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said that she will reach a decision ``later this
year'' and added that she is ``deeply gratified by the large number
of people'' who are encouraging her to seek the seat of Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a nasty fight,'' said one of Mrs. Clinton's
longtime friends and political advisers, speaking of a potential
opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City. ``Everything in
Hillary's background will be recycled,'' continued the adviser, who
insisted on anonymity. ``She has to think about whether she is
prepared to go through this battering.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in New York and elsewhere were taken aback on Tuesday
by Mrs. Clinton's statement that she will delay a decision until
later in the year. If she waits too long, the delay would paralyze
other Democratic candidates who need the time to raise the $10
million to $20 million required for the race.``She needs to think
and think fast,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of
Columbia's delegate to Congress. ``That is, unless you want to give
the New York Senate seat to Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Rep. Nita Lowey of Westchester County is the only
Democrat to say she is seriously considering the race. Lowey has
repeatedly said that she will not run if the first lady does.
</P>
<P>
   Major Democratic fundraisers said on Tuesday that Mrs. Clinton
would have no problem raising money, and that she could do it in
two to three months.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Clinton mulls her decision, her advisers are making
calls to New York political leaders and consultants to gauge the
depth of the first lady's support in New York. Polls show her to be
enormously popular statewide, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ickes, a former White House official who discussed the
Senate race with Mrs. Clinton just a few days ago, is to meet on
Wednesday in Miami with Dennis Rivera, one of the most powerful
labor leaders in New York City. ``I'm anxious to talk to him about
it,'' said Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the hospital workers
union. ``We certainly are encouraging her to run.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton's advisers say the first lady must resolve a
number of concerns before she enters the race.
</P>
<P>
   The most important concern, they say, is that she and President
Clinton are already in serious debt and face what one adviser
estimated to be more than $3 million in legal bills. Senators make
$136,700 a year, and conflict-of-interest rules constrain their
ability to earn outside income.
</P>
<P>
   After the Clintons leave the White House, many Democrats view
Mrs. Clinton as the more marketable of the two through the lecture
circuit and a multimillion-dollar book contract should she write
her memoirs. One longtime friend of Mrs. Clinton said it was
unfair, however, that the first lady, who has been the primary
breadwinner through most of the Clintons' marriage, should be
expected to continue in that role after her husband leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it her responsibility to take care of the financial
situation?'' the friend asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's advisers are also telling her that she will face
personal attacks from her opponents on her role in the Whitewater
and Travelgate scandals and her failure on health care reform.
Friends say she has little experience in dealing with the press on
her own, and that her relationship with reporters is often skittish
and tense. Numerous Democrats said on Tuesday that the New York
press corps is particularly combative.
</P>
<P>
   One Clinton adviser called Giuliani a ``formidable candidate''
who would run on a record of lowered crime, reduced welfare rolls
and the overall comeback of New York City in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Giuliani refused to discuss Mrs. Clinton's a
possible candidacy. ``I have no idea what problems there would be
in a hypothetical race that hasn't taken place yet except in your
imaginations,'' Giuliani said at a news conference. ``She hasn't
decided to run. I haven't decided to run. I learned in politics a
long time ago that until there is a race everything is
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Powers, the former deputy mayor who managed Giuliani's
mayoral campaigns, said Mrs. Clinton is ``untested'' as a candidate
and that ``she'd have to prove why she should be senator over
someone who's turned around a city when everybody said it couldn't
be turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how popular she is now, Mrs. Clinton's advisers said
that she would be making a mistake if she is tempted to conduct a
Rose Garden strategy and stick close to the White House. New
Yorkers would expect her to spend large amounts of time campaigning
in the state, even without a serious primary opponent. (Under New
York law, a candidate for U.S. Senate does not have to establish
residency in the state until Election Day _ November, 2000 in this
case.)
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers are going to give her a lot of latitude if she
decides to run,'' said one adviser. ``They won't count it against
her if she's an out-of-stater. But she can't run in absentia.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional problem, the adviser said, is that Mrs. Clinton
might take positions that conflict with her husband's. ``Let's say
she disagrees with her husband on trade policy, as a
hypothetical,'' the adviser said. ``It will be trumpeted as a big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Other White House advisers say they think a Senate campaign is
more appealing to Mrs. Clinton than actually serving in the Senate,
where she would be a freshman and perhaps not part of the majority
party. The advisers say that Mrs. Clinton is very enticed by the
idea of at last having an independent voice, particularly after her
husband risked his presidency and publicly humiliated her by his
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   One close friend said on Tuesday that the Clinton marriage has
been healing since Mrs. Clinton's birthday in October, and that
Clinton is ``thrilled'' at the prospect of his wife's Senate
candidacy. On Monday, Clinton said that his wife would be a
``great'' senator from New York, but that the idea had not occurred
to her until ``a lot of people started calling.''

 &HT;    15 years ago and 11 seconds
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was 15 years ago; it was 15 minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   The short version:
</P>
<P>
   Larry Schellenberg grabbed a rebound, dribbled to halfcourt and
passed to Roosevelt Chapman, who sent the ball ahead to Ed Young,
12 feet from the basket smack in the middle of the lane. Young, a
lefty, made a reverse pivot to his right and put up a high, soft
12-foot fallaway jump shot that kissed the glass and whooshed
through the basket. The ball bounced once on the University of
Dayton's then-Tartan floor, the clock ticked to 0:00 and UD had a
72-71 upset of No. 3 DePaul that sent an electric jolt through a
city.
</P>
<P>
   The long version:
</P>
<P>
   It happened 15 years ago Thursday, but the memories are as fresh
as the first loaf out of the oven at Wonder Bread Bakery every
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking there were 11 seconds,'' Schellenberg said when I
called him a couple of nights ago. ``I remember as I dribbled up
the sideline in front of the DePaul bench (assistant) Joey Meyer
was yelling that I was out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, it's still burned into his memory like the
Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the ball from Schelly, I remember thinking to
myself, `This is my showtime, right now,' '' said Chapman, when I
reached him. ``But for some reason, I saw Ed slice into the middle
and I passed it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later and Chapman remembered verbatim the voice
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember on the foul before the missed free throw I was over
there hacking at the DePaul guy,'' Young said when I also caught
him without warning. ``Larry was on the other side. I had four
fouls on me, so that would have been my fifth, but they called it
on Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, and Young remembered his foul count.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in UD Land, someone can probably tell you how many
revolutions Young's shot took on its rainbow path.
</P>
<P>
   In their careers at UD, that was one of 365 rebounds
Schellenberg collected, one of 338 assists by Chapman and one of
490 buckets by Young. But put together into one entity, there has
probably not been a more memorable sequence in UD lore. The shot
was voted the ``biggest basket in UD history'' in an unscientific
December poll of UD fans on an Internet e-mail list devoted to UD
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't even close,'' said UD program editor Brett Hoover,
who conducted the poll.
</P>
<P>
   DePaul was 19-1, ranked No. 3, and its patriarchal coach, Ray
Meyer, had already announced his retirement. As a topper, Meyer
considered this team, led by Tyrone Corbin, his best.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, meanwhile, began the season 7-7 but had won 7 of 8 when
the Blue Demons walked down the ramp into the Arena.
</P>
<P>
   DePaul owned the first 35 minutes. With just under five minutes
to play, the Blue Demons were up 11 and cruising. Remember, this
was 1984. There was no shot clock, so teams could stall; and there
was no 3-point stripe, so trailing teams came back like snails, two
points at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But then, having shown no signs of life previously, UD started
playing as if possessed. Young, Chapman, Sedric Toney, Dan Christie
and Schellenberg made huge plays. DePaul missed three free throws
and committed two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it was 71-68 and Schellenberg did it again, snagging an
offensive rebound and being fouled at 0:13. He made both freebies
to cut it to 71-70. On the in-bounds pass, DePaul's Raymond McCoy,
a .736 free throw shooter inserted specifically for this situation,
was hacked and everyone walked to the other end as 12,723 fans
roared like lions on the Serengeti.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy rimmed the free throw and it came out hot. DePaul's Marty
Embry, in the 2-spot on the lane, reached over Young and tipped the
ball back to himself. Schellenberg, in the 3-spot, leapt over Embry
and pulled it away with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was like the opening of the Oklahoma territory with
everyone on the court thundering to the other end. Followed by a
shot that kissed the glass like a mother kissing a baby's head . .
. and bedlam. Students rushed the floor as if a professor were out
there handing out As.
</P>
<P>
   Schellenberg is 35 and is no longer the 6-foot-3, 181-pound kid
we remember. Now 240 pounds, he is an imposing presence on the
sidelines in his first year as head coach at his old high school,
Floyds Central, in Floyds Knobs, Ind., in the southwest corner of
the state. Married with three kids, ages 12, 9 and 5, Schellenberg
said he has found his comfort zone and hopes to finish his coaching
career at Floyds Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is, I use that play in my coaching,'' he said.
``I use it to show them how important that 3-spot on the lane is in
rebounding missed free throws. I explain how big that game was, and
I tell them how important the little things are in winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman is 36 and, like Schellenberg, a teacher-coach back in
his old neighborhood in Brooklyn, where he was a basketball legend
nicknamed Velvet. Chapman is a coordinator/dean at David Ruggles
Junior High and also ``oversees'' the school's basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have no idea of who I am,'' said Chapman, who is
close to his playing day numbers of 6-4, 200 pounds. ``They're too
young to remember. But their parents know. Especially the fathers.
They'll say, `You're Mr. Chapman? Is your first name Roosevelt?'
And then it's, `Man, I remember watching you do this or that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Young is 35 and, like Schellenberg, has added to his once
svelte, 6-7, 196-pound frame. ``I'm 253 and I haven't touched a
basketball in six years,'' he said. ``Right now I'm strong into
golf.'' A salesman for ECG Scanning, a medical supply company,
Young married Channel 2 weekend anchor Kathy Hart last October.
They live in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I graduated,'' Young said, ``I went to Belgium to play
ball. ``This was four years later, in 1988. One of the first guys I
see over there is Marty Embry. It wasn't just that he lost the
rebound to Schelly. He also had his hand in my face as I took the
shot. The first thing he said was, `Oh, God, not you again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery remains of why Chapman passed the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went over that situation every day in practice,'' said
then-coach Don Donoher this week. ``The idea was always to get the
ball to Chapman. He was so good at creating a shot. When he got the
ball that day, I thought he'd do some kind of dance, create a shot
and either make it or get fouled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got Chap the ball, I thought we were in great shape,''
Schellenberg said. ``Then when he gave the ball up, I thought, `I
can't believe it. What's he doin'?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew we had to get Chap the ball,'' Young said. ``I was
just running down looking for a rebound, and then all of a sudden I
had the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when I lived in Dayton,'' Chapman said, ``people would
always be asking, `Velvet, what possessed you to pass the ball?'
All I can say is that it looked to me like Ed had great post-up
position in the lane, and I knew Ed rarely missed a shot from that
degree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' Ed Young said. ``I was just lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to be said for lucky.
</P>
<P>
   They are bonded tightly in UD lore, but the three do not keep in
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Schellenberg and Young last saw each other in 1989 at
Schellenberg's basketball camp when Schellenberg was head coach at
Centerville High.
</P>
<P>
   Schellenberg can't remember the last time he saw Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Chapman saw each other briefly three or four years
ago. ``I was driving past UD and I saw Roosevelt on his bike,''
Young said. ``I pulled over and said, `Whatcha doin'' And he said,
`Nothin', going to play ball at the PAC.' That was it. It was just,
`How you been?' That kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, 11 seconds tied them together. But even if
they never see each other again, time can never untie them.

 &HT;    CEO of NCR on a winning streak
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Lars Nyberg, chairman and chief executive of
Dayton-based NCR Corp., stands to collect $5.8 million in cash
bonuses this year on top of his usual yearly salary and bonus,
which could easily exceed $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The windfall will make Nyberg, 47, extraordinarily well paid
when compared with executives in other high-tech businesses. It
also shows just how valued his leadership is by the NCR board.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all Nyberg stands to gain this year. If he is
still with the company in September, Nyberg will receive 149,533
shares of NCR stock worth $6.6 million at Tuesday's closing price
of $44.62. At the same time, he will be eligible to purchase
another 149,533 shares at $33.44 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The stock option and grant, and $5,875,000 in cash bonuses, are
part of an agreement Nyberg and NCR reached three years ago at a
time when the company's future was tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for Nyberg to receive $3,875,000 if he is
still with NCR as of June 1 and another $2 million if he agrees to
stay with the company for another two years, according to a
preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Nyberg said last month that he is happy at NCR and
plans to stay with the computer equipment and services company.
</P>
<P>
   Nyberg has led NCR since June 1, 1995. At the time, NCR was a
wholly owned subsidiary of AT&AMP;T Corp. that was losing an estimated
$2 million a day. Nyberg, then an unknown former executive from
Europe, initiated a massive restructuring that led to thousands of
layoffs and widespread changes in company operations.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T divested a healthier NCR in a spinoff in early 1997. NCR
languished that year, but made a dramatic turnaround last year,
boosting earnings 1,642 percent to $122 million, or $1.20 per
share, compared with $7 million, or 7 cents per share, for all of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect NCR to do even better this year, essentially
doubling its earnings to $2 per share or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``One should be compensated for leading that kind of
performance,'' said NCR spokesman Anthony Sprauve. He noted that
NCR's stock options and bonuses are similar to what is offered by
other Fortune 500 companies and Nyberg's bonus was cut due to the
company's poor performance in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nyberg's base salary last year was $962,000. His 1998
performance bonus and 1999 salary will be determined by the
company's board of directors next month, Sprauve said. The average
salary and bonus last year for 14 chief executives of high-tech
companies reviewed by Executive Compensation Advisory Services was
$1.26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nyberg shepherded NCR through a turn around by focusing on data
warehousing and professional services, ditching the computer
manufacturing business and dumping its old system of having
independent operating units in 130 countries. It decided to
consolidate operations into five global business units run from the
Dayton headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation and other reasons has led to the departure of
eight senior managers since late 1996. The latest is Senior Vice
President Hideh Takahashi, who is scheduled to leave March 31 for
personal reasons, according to the proxy statement.
</P>
<P>
   NCR is also asking the SEC, board members and shareholders to
approve an unusual plan to consolidate the number of stockholders,
according to the proxy statement.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, NCR will ask shareholders at its April 15 annual
meeting to approve a plan to purchase shares from 628,000 people
who own fewer than 10 NCR shares.
</P>
<P>
   The move is expected to save $2.5 million a year in
administrative and mailing costs. NCR will pay the transaction
costs, making it attractive to shareholders who want to avoid
paying broker fees. If these stockholders do not want to be cashed
out, they have to purchase more or consolidate their multiple
accounts so that they hold at least 10 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Sprauve said SEC approval is expected this week. A final proxy
to be mailed in the first week of March will detail the plan to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   NCR has about 1.5 million shareholders, mostly because it used
to be part of AT&AMP;T, which is one of the most widely held public
companies. NCR shed 800,000 stockholders through two voluntary
buy-back programs offered to those who owned less than 10 shares.
But the company wants to further consolidate the stockholder base,
Sprauve said.

U.S. CUSTOMS ADMITS TAINT OF CORRUPTION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The front-line role of the Customs Service in the
government's war against illegal drugs has left the agency highly
vulnerable to narcotics-related corruption, Customs officials
acknowledged Tuesday in a report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was sent to a House panel with jurisdiction
over the agency, admitted that the service had failed to
aggressively combat corruption. In an atmosphere of neglect,
internal affairs inquiries languished and were sometimes impeded
because of infighting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the service's most extensive and critical
examination of how it deals with narcotics-related corruption and
other internal affairs issues after years in which sporadic
corruption cases have tarnished the image of an agency with 12,000
field inspection employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large amounts of illegal drugs that pass through U.S.
Customs land, sea and air ports of entry and the enormous amount of
money at the disposal of drug traffickers to corrupt law
enforcement personnel place Customs and its employees at great risk
to corruption,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Once focused on preventing the entry of illegal trade goods and
farm products, the service has been thrust in recent years into
broad responsibilities in interdicting narcotics, as inspectors
monitor more than 300 ports of entry through which marijuana,
cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs flow into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The report was ordered by lawmakers, but Customs officials said
that the agency had taken the initiative to review its approach to
corruption issues. But the report was sent to Congress at a time
when lawmakers in the House and Senate are expected to critically
examine the agency's internal affairs performance.
</P>
<P>
   The report sought to focus on corrective measures and Customs
Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, who is a former New York City police
commissioner, said in an interview Tuesday that he had introduced a
series of changes. He has elevated Internal Affairs so that it
reports directly to him, ordered a tougher recruit screening system
and sought to reduce the years-long backlog of periodic personnel
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the agency announced Tuesday the hiring of William
A. Keefer, a former federal prosecutor, to head Internal Affairs.
Keefer is replacing Homer J. Williams, a Customs official who was
transferred after he became the subject of a federal inquiry in
California into whether he told a colleague that she was under
scrutiny in a corruption case.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his experience as police commissioner in New York,
Kelly said in a letter to Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., chairman of an
appropriations committee panel that monitors Customs, ``I know that
questions of integrity can erode public confidence in our law
enforcement institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Customs Service's Office of Professional
Responsibility sidestepped the issue of the extent to which
corruption had already damaged the agency's effectiveness. Although
the service opened more than 180 felony or misdemeanor cases
against employees in 1997, the last year that statistics were
available, Kelly said the Internal Affairs system was unable to
precisely define the scope of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not uncover evidence of systematic corruption in
its ranks, but did conclude that ``individual acts of corruption
have occurred and continue to occur'' that placed the agency in
danger of being undermined by its own employees.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, eight Customs officers have been convicted
of taking payments from drug traffickers. In one case, in El Paso,
Texas, two customs inspectors tried to shake down an informer
posing as a drug smuggler, one of them demanding more than $1
million to look the other way when cocaine-laden vehicles crossed
Juarez, the Mexican border city, into the United Sates.
</P>
<P>
   Federal counter-narcotics officials have said the level of
corruption might be higher than the numbers suggest based on the
frequency of drug intelligence reports indicating that federal
agents on the border had been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the officials said the number of cases might be higher
because the corruption often requires little involvement by an
officer whose only overt activity is to turn away when a car
carrying drugs pulls up at an inspection lane.
</P>
<P>
   Such cases are extremely difficult to detect, given the volume
of cross-border traffic. In 1997, the last year statistics were
available, the agency processed more than 400 million passengers
and 17 million cargo shipments and seized about 400 tons of illegal
drugs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the most serious issues to emerge in the report was the
existence of bitter animosity between the agency's Internal Affairs
unit and the Office of Investigations, which conducts criminal
inquiries into violations of customs laws.
</P>
<P>
   The report found what it called a ``long history of strife and
infighting'' between the two units, an animosity that was based on
``the belief of agents from Investigations that agents assigned to
Internal Affairs are incompetent, overzealous and spend too much
time investigating matters that are unrelated to corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Internal Affairs agents who were interviewed during the review
said that the hostility had ``a debilitating effect on their
ability to perform their jobs diligently'' and ``diminished the
importance of their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Some agents cited instances in which Investigations agents
interfered with or compromised investigations. The report did not
cite specifics but said that two federal prosecutors had considered
excluding Customs agents from corruption cases because of the
conflict which the report said had reached ``critical
proportions.''

RACIAL HATRED DETAILED IN LETTER FROM DRAGGING DEATH DEFENDANT
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ From prison three years ago, John William
``Bill'' King Jr. wrote that white women who sleep with
African-Americans should be lynched alongside their black lovers.
</P>
<P>
   The correspondence to a 16-year-old girl, half romantic, half
hate-filled, was the first evidence presented on Tuesday in the
capital murder trial of King, 24, who is accused of chaining a
black man behind a pickup and dragging him to his death.
</P>
<P>
   King pleaded ``not guilty, your honor,'' in a hushed, respectful
tone at the start of the prosecution's case yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray told jurors _ 11 whites and one
black _ that King was attempting to form a hate group in Jasper
before his arrest. It was to be called the Texas Rebel Soldiers, a
division of the white supremacist Confederate Knights of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence will show Bill King needed to do something dramatic
in order to gain in their warped world respect for his newly formed
gang, to attract media attention,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   That, Gray suggested, was the motivation behind the slaying of
James Byrd Jr., 49.
</P>
<P>
   King is accused of masterminding the kidnap-slaying. Two
friends, also ex-convicts, will stand trial later on the same
capital murder charge. King has insisted that one of them, Shawn
Berry, killed Byrd over a drug deal after dropping King and the
other friend at the apartment where all three lived.
</P>
<P>
   But Gray told jurors on Tuesday that all three men would be tied
to the crime through DNA tests on samples taken from their
footwear, cigarette butts and longneck beer bottles. Also found at
the crime scene were a Zippo lighter inscribed with a Ku Klux Klan
symbol and King's prison nickname _ ``Possum'' _ and tools
inscribed with Berry's name.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors displayed a large aerial photograph showing where
Byrd was beaten and chained to the truck, where his body and right
arm were found and, a mile away, the rest of his body. His tattered
clothes, broken dentures, watch, wallet and ball cap, discovered
along the three-mile route where he was dragged, were entered as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sisters daubed their eyes with tissues and silently wept
as Sheriff Billy Rowles, the first witness, described how the
dismembered body was found.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-year-old Jasper man who knew Byrd, Steven Scott, said he
saw Byrd the early morning hours of June 7 walking along Martin
Luther King Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was staggering over the road,'' Scott said, adding it was
obvious Byrd was drunk. When he arrived home a short time later, he
saw Byrd pass by, seated in the back of a gray-primer-colored
pickup. Three white men were in the truck cab, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   King looked on blankly while 18-year-old Michelle Chapman read
anti-black and anti-semitic portions of letters that she received
from King during his 1995-96 prison stay. She also testified that
King had a tattoo on his arm showing a black man swinging from a
noose. King was serving time on a parole violation, after being
convicted of theft in a video rental shop.
</P>
<P>
   King, who Chapman said she had dated once when she was 15,
affectionately addressed her as his ``Aryan princess.'' The letters
interspersed questions about her school life and expressions of
longing with crude bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   In one, King called Jasper a ``town full of race traitoring''
women blind to the ``pride of their race &AMP; heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb 26, 1996, he wrote that any white woman ``should be hung
along side'' the African-American with whom she had sex. ``White is
right!!!''
</P>
<P>
   From his cell in the Beto I state prison unit, King told Chapman
he would leave prison with his 65 percent of his body _ including
his genitals _ covered with tattoos to intimidate non-whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to ----- with a 209-lb aggrivated (sic)
peckerwood covered in skin art,'' he wrote. ``Till then, take care
and stay white and beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also introduced into evidence the hand-written
by-laws, constitution, code of ethics, and recruiting materials for
the hate group King was forming. All were signed, ``John W. King,
Captain, Confederate Knights of America, Texas Rebel Soldiers.'' No
gays, bisexuals or anyone ``outside the white Aryan race'' could
join.
</P>
<P>
   King's attorneys, who declined to make an opening statement,
were overruled when they objected to introduction of evidence about
King's tattoos, writings and political affiliations. They contended
the evidence violated his constitutional guarantees of free speech,
and also objected to introduction of autopsy photos, saying they
were so gruesome the jury would be prejudiced against King.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said that examination of the crime scene convinced
him that he was dealing with a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a brand new sheriff and I didn't even know the definition
of a hate crime,'' said Rowles, who had been office two years after
serving 27 years as a state trooper. ``But I knew someone was
murdered because he was black.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when he called the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smartest thing Billy Rowles ever did,'' the sheriff said. ``We
thought we'd looked at everything until the FBI got there.''

SI NEAR THE EXTREME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's safe to assume very few men received subscriptions to
Sports Illustrated as Valentine's Day gifts from their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   There are undoubtedly thousands of women with enough
self-confidence to allow their husbands of boyfriends to read
Playboy and Penthouse, or let them linger on the latest mailing
from Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   But Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue has become the
equivalent of a nakedly ambitious sneak attack. SI presents foxes
in modest wolves clothing, and its latest edition represents ground
zero in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The special issue which hit mail boxes and news stands last
week, and which will stay on the shelves for another month, was
SI's most audacious effort yet, pushing the arbitrary extremes of
taste and art to the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the cover. Model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is wearing a
two-piece swimsuit made of small chains.
</P>
<P>
   Move to the foldout on page 12, where Sarah O'Hare is wearing
sand in the places where a two-piece would usually go.
</P>
<P>
   Page 66 begins an 18-page feature on models wearing nothing but
paint. Joanne Gair, a world-renowned body painter, was hailed to
the Virgin Islands to use the models as her canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's swell. But the fact Gair did her work based on
actual swimsuits makes one ask why. If a great-looking suit exists,
then having the models painted accordingly looks like an exercise
in prurient shock value.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, you can find models wearing swimsuits made of
netting, swimsuits with see-through bottoms, models wearing
expensive T-shirts that happen to be wet, and a model using a few
well-placed fig leaves to show off a sarong.
</P>
<P>
   That all leads to the ultimate moment later in the magazine,
where cover girl Rebecca is seen looking at a swim suit drying on a
line. It is her swimsuit, and, yes, she is naked.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a healthy male who can appreciate the issue for its base
instincts. And as far as the issue itself, I've always enjoyed a
good debate. It's fun to hear people take sides and get all fussy
on this annual discussion.
</P>
<P>
   To me, the SI swimsuit issue harms no one. These are
professional models whose business is wearing clothing that can fit
in your pocket. It isn't a precursor to anything other than
magazine sales. Some women might find it demeaning, but they're
better off finding more salacious battles to fight than SI's
once-a-year leer.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, two of the stories in the SI swimsuit issue were more
offensive than any pictures. One writer began an article about
model Heidi Klum by describing his butt. Another covered the model
painting with a smirk better suited to junior high school. In a
reference to his professionalism, he says, ``I confess that at
times, such as when Heidi stood topless before me poolside, it was
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But I do have a line to draw in the sand, right next to Ms.
O'Hare.
</P>
<P>
   The '90s will likely be remembered for the way people and
institutions tried to play both sides of issues. Entertainment
corporations in the business of making money now own teams that are
in the business of winning games. TV networks have news divisions
that cover athletes who snort drugs and slap wives, and sports
divisions with billions tied up in sports right fees.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are having a difficult time trying to be all things
to all people thanks to the success of tabloid TV, talk radio and
local TV news, to the degree that they sometimes exchange
objectivity for entertainment and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   SI pretends 51 weeks of the year to be the most serious-minded
and credible sports magazine on the market, to the degree that it
views its chief new rival, ESPN Magazine, as a crayon-armed
teenager with raging hormones and a short attention span.
</P>
<P>
   SI is the magazine which published a cover story saying Pat
Summitt was the new Wizard, the best college basketball coach in
the land. SI put a small black child on the cover as introduction
to a story on athletes who abandon their children and have several
out of wedlock. SI posed the ``whatever happened to the white
athlete?'' question on its cover.
</P>
<P>
   (Having read all three articles, I can confide that SI's
swimsuit issue was much better executed.)
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether an institution can have it both ways.
Can SI do a serious article on Summitt one month and trot out a
naked Klum the next? Can it turn a story on rogue male athletes who
beat their spouses one day and paint swimsuits on women the next?
Can it pontificate one week and pander the next?
</P>
<P>
   It wants to. I'm not sure it can or should. In the era of the
10-second sound bite and the loud screech of talk radio, SI's first
paint-by-numbers swimsuit issue looks like it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not nearly as becoming as Rebecca, Heidi or Laetitia
Casta.
</P>

COMMENTARY: AMBITION AS AN ADDRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's a wacky moment in politics.
</P>
<P>
   We could have a Bush, a Dole and a Clinton running in 2000, but
not that Bush, that Dole or that Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, Bob Dole and Bill Clinton might step into the
unaccustomed roles of kibitzers to son, wife and wife. If you
combine all the elections of these veteran campaigners, it's a
century of experience.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine the three tireless pols, with no more
campaigns of their own left to run, making a nuisance of themselves
in their loved ones' races _ lecturing son, wife and wife on how to
work the crowd in Sioux Falls or Niagara Falls. (``Argggghhhh,''
Bob Dole grunts at Elizabeth's campaign manager.)
</P>
<P>
   With Hillary Clinton pondering a New York Senate run and with
Elizabeth Dole on the cusp of a presidential run, there is a heady
sense of dutiful political wives on the lam.
</P>
<P>
   The press is thrilled at the prospect of distaff races.
``Elizabeth Dole,'' one male reporter confided in me, ``has the
best nails in politics. Red and perfectly groomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild scenarios abound.
</P>
<P>
   Picture St. Hillary running against St. Rudy in a battle of the
righteous. The corporate lawyer who made $100,000 as a commodities
trader simply, she says, by reading The Wall Street Journal vs. the
prosecutor who had Wall Street traders dragged away in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Picture Liddy Dole being pestered with questions about her
spouse being undersexed _ and then becoming a Viagra guinea pig and
spokesman to cure ``erectile dysfunction'' in ads featuring 1-800
numbers _ even as Hillary is pestered with questions about her
spouse being oversexed.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Meet the Press,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan slyly
tweaked the first lady eyeing his seat, saying she would bring a
blast of ``Illinois-Arkansas enthusiasm to New York.'' But we would
expect Mrs. Clinton to carpetbag, renting an apartment or hotel
room to run in New York. The Clintons have always seemed oddly
deracinated and unmortgaged.
</P>
<P>
   They have lived in public housing most of their married lives,
and their vacation retreats are determined by poll numbers and
rentals and the availability of their friends' houses.
</P>
<P>
   When the specter lurked of President Clinton being forced from
office, journalists wanted to make comparisons to a disgraced
Richard Nixon flying off in a helicopter to San Clemente, but they
couldn't figure out where the heck the Clintons would fly off to.
All Bill Clinton has is a proposed library site in the river flats
of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, like the Doles and the Gores, have been more
intent on scrambling up the political ladder than on nesting. Their
ambition is their address. Their career is the pillow they nuzzle
at night.
</P>
<P>
   If Elizabeth Dole ends up running against Al Gore, it would be a
contest between two toney Washington ZIP codes, between people who
have lived within a few miles of the Capitol for the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the American public recoils from Washington
insiders, here is a race of ultimate insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's forget the primaries,'' jokes Howard Fineman of
Newsweek. ``Let's make it who can get the best table at the
Washington restaurant of their choice.''
</P>
<P>
   As Fineman has noted, the Doles have spent most of their adult
lives in a two-mile-square area in downtown Washington. Bob Dole's
idea of triangulation was to travel from the Watergate to Congress
to the ``Meet the Press'' studio. He would appear on the Sunday
talk show _ ``the Church of Russert,'' Fineman calls it _ while
Elizabeth went to the Presbyterian church next door.
</P>
<P>
   As the son of Sen. Al Gore Sr. of Tennessee, Prince Albert grew
up as the capital's version of Eloise at the Plaza, ensconced in a
three-bedroom apartment in the elegant Fairfax Hotel on Embassy
Row. Sometimes, when his parents went out, the future vice
president would order room service from the hotel kitchen, now
transformed into the pricey Jockey Club restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   So, really, the race would be between the mahogany-stuffy
Fairfax and the marble-stuffy Watergate, or between Massachusetts
Avenue and Virginia Avenue, or between the Jockey Club, which
offers rack of lamb with cracked black pepper, basil and jus for
$29.50, and the Watergate's Aquarelle, which offers rack of lamb
encrusted in a spicy lamb sausage with rosemary and garlic essences
for $32.
</P>
<P>
   How insular can insular get? It makes you want to forgive a
little carpetbagging.

 For a Mere $10,000 Down, You Could Become the Next DeBartolo  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Calling all couch potatoes and BarcaLounger quarterbacks, it's your
turn to own a piece of a Bay Area professional sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   What's that you say, you're not the Ohio-bred offspring of an
Italian American shopping center mogul? You mean, you didn't ring
up millions running a publicly held supermarket chain?
</P>
<P>
   Fear not. You still have a shot at becoming a DeBartolo or a
McGowan of your own making. All you need to do is plunk down some
cold cash and purchase a chunk of the San Francisco Bay Seals.
</P>
<P>
   No, not a revival of the beloved minor league baseball team of
yore. The Seals are a scrappy minor league soccer club that calls
Kezar Stadium home. And now the fledgling franchise is seeking
outside investors through a private placement.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to raise money for team development, the San
Francisco Soccer Development Corp. is offering 1 million shares at
a buck a share to qualified investors, says the company's director
of corporate finance, Jan Skwarka.
</P>
<P>
   The offering ``is a great way for soccer to get more exposure on
Wall Street, and soccer needs all of the help it can get,'' says
Skwarka, a Los Angeles native who played professionally in Germany
for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you may not need to be the second coming of George
Steinbrenner (a shipbuilder, by the way), but you still need a fair
amount of scratch to procure a seat in the owners' box _ even in
minor league soccer. The minimum investment in the Seals is
$10,000, and shareholders must earn at least $200,000 a year
($300,000 for couples) and boast a net worth in excess of $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, before you get out your 49er-inscribed checkbook, it
might behoove any potential investor to study the Seals' business
model. And of course, it's highly advised that they read the
offering prospectus carefully.
</P>
<P>
   First, a little history. The Seals were founded in 1982 as a
youth team by Dr. Tom Simpson, who is still the head coach and
president of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a labor of love for Simpson, who has built his
homespun soccer club into a pro squad that competes at the
second-highest level of American professional soccer in the United
Soccer Leagues. The top tier of the USL is Major League Soccer,
which includes teams such as the San Jose Clash (whom the Seals
have beaten) and Los Angeles Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET17 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  After first playing at the University of San Francisco, the
professional Seals moved to downsized Kezar last year, where its
largest crowd was 3,000. Capacity is 10,000 and tickets range
between $5 and $10, says company spokesman Burt Glass.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the team's 1998 revenue of $201,000 came
from gate receipts. And you can forget about salary cap headaches.
The good news for investors is that 1999 player payroll expenses
are projected at about $150,000. Players make about $2,000 a month,
which allowed the mighty Seals to eke out a profit of $2,296 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   OK. So, those aren't exactly Ruthian financials. But at least
the organization is profitable. To be sure, the bet with the Seals
isn't based on earnings but on the potential for the franchise
value to grow _ which is a possibility because the 30-team league
has capped its number of franchises at 32, explains Skwara, an
investment banker and stockbroker by trade.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, franchise values will rise as the next generation of
sports fans, many of whom played soccer growing up, begin taking
their families to watch soccer. In the meantime, it's an investment
in family entertainment not unlike minor league baseball, which has
been financially successful under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   With the hyper-inflation of major league ticket and concession
prices, families are turning to the minors as a more affordable
entertainment option, says professional photographer Michael
Christmas, who owns 22,000 shares in San Diego's USL team, the
Flash.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas was an early investor in the Flash, the first minor
league team to sell stock in a private placement, which plans to go
public later this year. The native Brit watched and played soccer
growing up, but he insists that his stake in the Flash isn't
clouded by sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be truthful, I'm just trying to make money. It's a
business,'' Christmas says.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. Stan Berkovitz, a semiretired retail executive
from Boca Raton, Fla., is a major shareholder in the Flash who sees
his investment ``as an opportunity to get in on the ground floor''
of something significant.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET17 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``I'm not a soccer fan looking for an investment,'' Berkovitz
explains. ``I'm an investor looking for an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, like any sports franchise at any level, the financial
success of the Seals will be determined by the organization's
performance _ both on and off the field. And for prospective Seals
stockholders, the value of their shares are likely to ride on the
quality of their product.

 &HT;    3 greyhounds died of unidentified illness, tests find
 &HT;    By Peter Donald

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Necropsies performed on three greyhounds
revealed the dogs died of an unidentified viral illness _ not
``kennel cough,'' the epidemic that shut down races at the Palm
Beach Kennel Club for 10 days earlier this year, veterinarians said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators at the University of Florida veterinary college
tried to identify the virus, the kennel cough epidemic appeared to
have run its course in West Palm Beach, with only two new cases
reported since the suburban West Palm Beach dog track reopened Feb.
5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all the dogs are off the vet's list,'' said track
veterinarian Dr. William Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   He said the kennel cough epidemic was actually a blessing in
disguise because quarantines were in place that probably also
stemmed the spread of the more serious mystery illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dogs are looking real good,'' said track publicity
director Theresa Hume. ``The thing that killed our dog was not
kennel cough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume estimated the club lost nearly $400,000 as a result of the
closures from Jan. 27 to Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, Chances Are Free _ a 3-year-old greyhound that raced
at the Palm Beach Kennel Club _ died after suffering a raging fever
and internal bleeding. Because the death occurred in the middle of
the kennel cough epidemic, there was speculation that the dog had
died as a result of complications from the disease, which
veterinarians likened to whooping cough in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Infectious tracheobronchitis, or kennel cough, is a contagious
disease spread through the air within confined kennels. It has been
choking the greyhound racing industry with track closures in
Kansas, Alabama and other states.
</P>
<P>
   But a necropsy performed on Chances Are Free two weeks ago
revealed the dog died of an unrelated and unidentified viral
illness _ not kennel cough.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, an unusual form of viral respiratory disease is
suspected, but not proven, as the primary problem,'' said Dr.
William Castleman, a pathobiologist at the veterinary college of
the University of Florida who is investigating greyhound deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Castleman also conducted necropsies on one dog from the St.
Petersburg track and one from the Daytona Beach track, with similar
results. A total of eight greyhounds, including six at St.
Petersburg's Derby Lane, have died in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs were originally believed to have succumbed to
complications from kennel cough, but the results of diagnostic
tests suggested a virus of unknown origins that caused the dogs to
bleed to death as well as other complications stemming from that
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the dogs that died had bacterial pneumonia associated
with E. coli as a complication of the suspected viral disease,''
Castleman concluded. ``The other two dogs have no evidence of
bacterial disease or other common infections of dogs.''

A DEPICTOR OR DANCE REACHES BEYOND IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Will Joyner, a former editor for Arts and Leisure, wrote most
recently for the section about sexuality in European and American
films.  
 By WILL JOYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's Academy Award nominations offer many reasons for
deep satisfaction, but one such reason hasn't attracted much
attention. Tucked at the end of the list of nominees for best
foreign film, just below Roberto Benigni's ubiquitous ``Life Is
Beautiful,'' is ``Tango,'' an entry from Argentina that is the work
of the hugely gifted, hugely perplexing Spanish director Carlos
Saura.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wonderful in any case for Saura, 67, to be noted
again for Oscar consideration (his ``Carmen'' was nominated in
1983). But it is especially gratifying with ``Tango,'' because
while ``Tango'' is certainly a dance film _ the sort of film that
Saura has come to be associated with in the last 20 years _ it is
not a dance film above all.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the director's distinctive way of depicting dance from the
inside out does not overshadow his more venerable gift for
commenting in a dramatic narrative on subjects like political
repression, personal loss and emotional survival.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Tango,'' the story of an aging film director
intent on using tango to make a politically frank epic in
present-day Buenos Aires, is not an example of a master filmmaker
doing what comes easily, what the public expects of him. Rather, it
is an example of a master filmmaker using a blatant, bravely drawn
alter-ego to look back unblinkingly and try to bring the various
provinces of his own career into closer alignment.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when he turned to making movies that had the
brashly erotic, rural flourish of flamenco at their heart, Saura
seemed to be performing an about-face esthetically. In the 60s and
70s, he had more quietly illustrated the dark, largely urban
landscape of Franco's Spain in dramas like ``Peppermint Frappe,''
``Cria Cuervos'' and ``Elisa, Vida Mia,'' all of which starred
Geraldine Chaplin, his companion.
</P>
<P>
   With a measured, unobtrusive style that bordered on the surreal
without dwelling on it, he left a memorable impression of a people
whose motives and dreams had been irredeemably marred by politics.
Then, suddenly, he shifted his greatest energies to folklore and
the less ambiguous swirl of stage performance.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of cultural acuity, or even political commitment, there
was actually nothing so inconsistent in this shift. Certainly the
sources adapted in the three flamenco movies that brought Saura
such acclaim in the 80s _ ``Blood Wedding,'' from the play by
Federico Garcia Lorca, ``Carmen'' and ``El Amor Brujo,'' from a
ballet by Manuel de Falla _ were rich in themes that will always
resonate in Spain: love, betrayal, violence, memory, forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But Saura brought to these classic vehicles directorial touches
that enhanced their contemporary significance. ``Blood Wedding,''
for example, was presented as a near-documentary of a rehearsal; it
eavesdrops on the musicians and dancers, contrasting their
professional dedication and their backstage preening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmen'' included a real love muddle that mirrored the one
under production. At the start of ``El Amor Brujo,'' a camera
panned in from the wings of a darkened but high-tech soundstage to
the rough, highly stylized set, a Gypsy village, giving the
landscape the aura of both past and future.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what dominated in these movies was the flamenco _
especially the brilliant choreography and execution of Saura's
collaborater, Antonio Gades, with the support of scores of other
gifted artists. As Saura's cameras took their place on stage with
the dancers, bringing the audience into the action, the movies
became _ for American viewers, at least _ an education in a dance
and musical form.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more accurately, an education in how flamenco's plaintive
verses and its clapping and stomping added up to something more
sophisticated, more poetic than the sum of the flamboyantly
emotional parts. Watched on video today, as accomplished as they
are, these three films have the feel of artifacts: if you're
naturally mesmerized by the dance, you'll persist, with pleasure;
if not, you'll quickly press stop.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you won't stop and rewind a movie like ``Cria
Cuervos.'' This is Saura's 1976 film about a 9-year-old girl in an
upper-class Madrid family who refuses to accept the death by cancer
of her supremely gifted and neglected mother or to look away from
the various strategies of deceit surrounding her father, an army
officer who dies in the clutches of his best friend's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, the middle of three sisters, is played by the stunning
child actress Ana Torrent (she's perhaps even better remembered for
Victor Erice's ``Spirit of the Beehive''); the mother, who is
summoned from the dead by the child's imagination, is portrayed in
brief, heartbreaking tableaus by Ms. Chaplin.
</P>
<P>
   Although it takes place in the later days of the Franco era, the
particulars of which are sometimes difficult for non-Spaniards to
decipher, ``Cria'' is an urgent, instantly relevant study in the
arbitrary, often cruel manner in which strong identities are formed
and maintained.
</P>
<P>
   From its first moments _ a sweeping shot of Buenos Aires on a
gray winter day _ ``Tango'' carries this same sense of urgency, on
essentially the same topic. But ``Tango'' was created by an older,
even wiser person than the one who created ``Cria,'' so while its
message is just as chilling, its devices are more straightforward,
more assured, more self-reflective.
</P>
<P>
   By recounting the situation of a venerable, popular filmmaker
who wants to stretch the precise, elegant, urban terms of the
tango, Saura has, of course, devised a context for large ironies
and large judgments at his own expense, and he never shrinks from
the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The largest and most telling irony in ``Tango'' is that amid
sustained, slyly designed performances by the best tango artists in
the world _ they're led by Juan Carlos Copes, and the Argentine
ballet superstar Julio Bocca even makes an appearance _ the crucial
performance is that of a man hobbled by a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   As Saura's alter-ego, the director Mario Suarez (Miguel Angel
Sola) limps from scene to scene with the kind of dignity and
wide-eyed innocence that belongs only to the brutally honest. As
Mario coordinates his complex production, stands up to his nervous
backers, falls in love with his young star, then admits to her his
doubts about life, the character engages in a blunt, uncontrived
commentary that serves to reconcile the strains of Saura's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the dramatic line that unifies all this?'' Mario asks
at one point. Saura's blunt answer, all the more powerful for being
spoken against a relief of chic, cutting-edge dance, comes a bit
later: ``Imagination is a guardrail that stops you from plunging
into the pit of horror.''

 &HT;    Racial death aimed to recruit white supremacists, jury told
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER _ James Byrd Jr. lost his life behind a zig-zagging
pickup truck because a neo-Nazi needed to perform a high-profile
feat to earn respect for his new hate group _ the Texas Rebel
Soldiers, a jury was told Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen members of the Byrd family filled the first two rows in
the Jasper County courtroom as a jury of 11 whites and one black
heard the first day of testimony in the trial of John William
``Bill'' King, 24, the alleged ringleader of Byrd's barbaric
dragging death.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Byrd's daughters left the courtroom in tears. His
eldest daughter, Renee Mullins, 28, fled when a prosecutor, wearing
latex gloves, pulled the first item of Byrd's tattered clothing
from a brown paper evidence bag. The white underwear wasshredded
and stained with dirt or dried blood.
</P>
<P>
   King's father had a front-row seat across the aisle from the
Byrd family, but the families did not speak. Ronald King was
accompanied by a local Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, is one of three white men accused of dragging Byrd, a
disabled black man, nearly three miles on a backwoods road until he
was decapitated last June. The murder shocked the world and brought
unwanted shame to this pine forested town of 8,000 near the
Louisiana state line.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not guilty, your honor,'' was the only thing King said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury heard much more from King in the form of the
written
</P>
<P>
   word. Prosecutors introduced into evidence dozens of King's
handwritten letters and tracts that he laced with racist threats
and dogma.
</P>
<P>
   ''White is right!!!'' King wrote in a 1996 prison letter to a
white Jasper girl whom he called ''my precious Aryan princess.'' In
a racially incedinary letter, he said that white women are race
traitors for dating black men and should be lynched alongside them.
</P>
<P>
   King wrote a code of ethics, by-laws and recruitment letters as
captain of the Texas Rebel Soldiers, a branch of the Confederate
Knights of America, a white supremacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Evidence (will show) that Bill King needed to do something
dramatic that would attract media attention in order to gain, in
their warped world, respect for his newly formed gang,'' Jasper
County District Attorney Guy James Gray told jurors in his
10-minute opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said King is a neo-Nazi whose body and arms are covered
with white supremacy tattoos _ a Confederate flag, a burning cross,
a lynched black man, an ''Aryan Pride'' symbol, and swastikas.
''He's what they call a full-sleever,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This young man is full of hate,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The two court-appointed defense attorneys for King did not make
any opening statements to the jury. But they wasted no time in
objecting to much of the evidence offered by the prosecution, which
includes two assistant U.S. attorneys from Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Brack Jones Jr. said the government's photographs of Byrd's
battered body were ''inflammatory and and overly gruesome,'' but
State District Judge Joe Bob Golden allowed the jury to see the
photos.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which includes a black man who went to middle school
with King and now works in a private prison, had been seated for
just over an hour when the 14 photographs of Byrd's dismembered
body were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Each juror was given a bound copy of a notebook with 8x10 color
glossy photos showing Byrd's body as it was found on the rural road
on June as well as at the autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're pretty rough to handle, particularly for some of you
ladies,'' Gray said. ''It will be a little rough, but you can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman wiped her eyes as she viewed the photos, and several
other jurors scowled.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is comprised of five white women, six white men and one
black man. A white man and a white woman serve as alternates.
Prosecutors, who originally summoned 400 Jasper County residents
for jury selection, had hoped to have three blacks on the jury
because of the controversial racial nature of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors arrived together in a white van from the Jasper
Hillcrest Baptist Church with armed escorts, but they are not being
sequestered during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors used an overhead projector to show jurors some of
King's prolific writings and close-ups of his tattoos, including a
satanic pentagram-type symbol on the back of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys objected to exhibits about the tattoos because
they said King's skin art was protected by the U.S. Constitution's
protection of free association. The judge overruled the objections.
</P>
<P>
   The first witness in the trial was Jasper County Sheriff Billy
Rowles, who recounted walking several miles over the road where
Byrd died and marking the spots where Byrd's body parts and
belongings were found. He said he feared the worse when a lighter
engraved with a KKK symbol was found nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a brand new sheriff, and I didn't even know the definition
of a hate crime,'' Rowles said. ''But I knew somebody was murdered
because he was black.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rowles spoke, King's father took the oxygen tube he uses
because of emphasyma and nervously twisted it around his finger.
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle, some of Byrd's six sisters clutched tissues
and dabbed their eyes. Byrd's one brother kept his arm around one
of his sisters most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   King never glanced at the Byrd family, and he kept his eyes
locked on the table where he sat when one of the dead man's sisters
testified about what clothing her brother wore on the day he was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bryd family prepared for the trial by gathering Monday night
and watching videos of James Byrd Jr., playing the piano and
singing with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all crowded together and we encouraged and supported one
another,'' said Clara Taylor, one of Byrd's sisters.

 &HT;    Sugar growers ready to crow over possible record crop
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEWISTON, Fla. _ With the federal government predicting a
record 2 million-ton sugar cane crop for Florida this year, growers
have much to crow about.
</P>
<P>
   They'll get the chance today, as about 15 congressional aides
fly into Palm Beach International Airport for the 15th annual
congressional staff tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were wine makers, this could be a vintage year,'' said
Dalton Yancey, executive vice president of the Florida Sugar Cane
League, which co-sponsors the junket with the Sugar Cane Growers
Cooperative of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of sunshine and just enough rain this season have produced
what looks like a record crop, Yancey said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts Florida's output of
raw sugar will surpass 2 million tons this year for the first time
ever. Last year's harvest produced 1.9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the larger yield and several weather delays, the
sugar cane harvest, which typically ends in March, is expected to
stretch into April.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest and loading operations are on the agenda for the tour,
which is paid for by the Belle Glade-based co-op, and the Florida
Sugar Cane League, which lobbies Washington lawmakers on behalf of
this area's two sugar giants: the Fanjul family's Florida Crystals
Corp. and U.S. Sugar Corp. of Clewiston.
</P>
<P>
   This year's attendees include aides to Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
and aides to congressmen from agricultural states such as Arkansas
and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The co-op, made up of 56 smaller sugar farmers, will host
today's activities _ an Everglades tour via airboat and dinner with
growers.
</P>
<P>
   After a night at the Clewiston Inn, attendees will visit U.S.
Sugar's insect lab and its new refinery, as well as Florida
Crystals' Okeelanta mill near South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important not only to see the equipment and the process,
but also to see the people,'' Yancey said.
</P>
<P>
   Before flying back to Washington on Friday, attendees will get a
look at the sugar shipping operation at the Port of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, businesses nationwide try to lure staffers on
educational tours during the President's Day recess.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar growers invited 100 this year, and are expecting just 15.
Yancey said the tour costs growers between $500 and $750 a person,
depending on the cost of air fare.
</P>
<P>
   The junket must adhere to certain rules _ for example,
educational trips can be two nights only _ and must be cleared by
the House and Senate ethics committees.

 &HT;    List omits Florida's strengths, official says
 &HT;    By David Sedore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida dropped two notches to ninth on
Site Selection magazine's annual ranking of states with the most
new or expanded corporate plants or offices during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which released the rankings Monday, also reported
that the number of new or expanded plants or offices fell by about
18 percent in Florida from the previous year while corporate
movement nationally set a new record. Site Selection credited
Florida with 430 locations in 1998 vs. 526 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Enterprise Florida Vice President Buzz Canup said his office
reported 567 moves during the year that met the criteria the
magazine uses to calculate its rankings. If the magazine had
counted all those moves, Florida would have ranked seventh once
again.
</P>
<P>
   Site Selection Editor Jack Lyne said moves must meet one of
three criteria to be counted. They must involve a capital
investment of at least $1 million, create at least 50 new jobs or
add at least 20,000 square feet of floor space.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine develops its lists from newspaper clips, news
releases and surveys of economic development agencies such as
Enterprise Florida, Lyne said. It does not count retail and
government projects, schools and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy between Enterprise Florida's numbers and the
magazine's most likely is because of projects that were the wrong
type or too small, projects about which the magazine had unanswered
questions at deadline or projects that were included in the
previous year's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely almost all fall into one of the three groups,''
said Managing Editor Tim Venable.
</P>
<P>
   Canup said the magazine's numbers, even accepted at face value,
don't reflect negatively on Florida given their slant toward
manufacturing projects, which isn't one of the state's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that where Florida is relatively weak, we
actually showed up in the top 10 again,'' Canup said. ``That's a
real kudo for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that might mitigate the drop is the dominance of
smaller businesses in the state, many of which would have
expansions too small to be counted by Site Selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure a lot are not coming up on the radar screen because
of the criteria,'' said George Haygood, economic development
director for the St. Lucie County Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Florida ranked 11th on the magazine's list of jobs created for
each million in population and 20th in terms of capital investment.
It finished eighth in number of expansions and new facilities for
each 1,000 square miles of area.

   ``Some of you may have come in here thinking you don't
understand gay and lesbian students, but you know what it's like to
be 13 and feel like you have nobody to turn to,'' Kevin Jennings,
executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Educators
Network, said during a workshop. ``And you know you have to deal
with these students who feel lost and abandoned, if only because
they don't do well in school.''
</P>
<P>
   The training workshop for guidance counselors, school
psychologists and principals, which cost $2,000, represented the
district's first step toward making school safe for gay students,
Jennings said. Today, the school board will consider the next step:
a new policy that could be approved this spring to prohibit
harassment of and discrimination against gay students.
</P>
<P>
   School district attorneys started work on the policy before the
district earned a failing grade from the gay educators network for
its protection of gay and lesbian students, and its lack of any
gay-oriented curriculum, said Cynthia Prettyman, school board
attorney. The proposed policy is like those in Miami-Dade and
Broward counties that treat anti-gay discrimination the same as
race or age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that needed to be done,'' Prettyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Without such a policy, the school district opens itself to
lawsuits like the one filed by Jamie Nabozny, a Wisconsin
seventh-grader whose classmates called him names and kicked and
spit on him, and whose principal said simply, ``Boys will be
boys.'' In 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled public schools and
their individual officials could be held liable for failing to
address anti-gay abuse, and Nabozny eventually won $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   For Jennings however, these types of policies aren't so much
about protecting districts from lawsuits as they are about
protecting gay students from name-calling, nasty whispers and
vicious pushes into hallway lockers. According to a Massachusetts
Department of Education study, 46 percent of gay and lesbian
students have attempted suicide and 22 percent have skipped school
because they feel unsafe on campus.
</P>
<P>
   At COMPASS, a West Palm Beach agency that serves gays and
lesbians, about 26 percent of the 200 teens who have attended
support sessions have dropped out of school, program director
Sheila Bewsee said. Almost all of them said they didn't feel safe
in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   A study done by Iowa high school students found that the average
high school student hears anti-gay epithets about 25 times a day.
Teachers who hear those words fail to respond 97 percent of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know kids get harassed here in Palm Beach County. I know
that for a fact,'' said Sybil Adcock, a music teacher in the
district and co-chair of the local gay educators chapter. ``I know
kids are scared to death to come out. They get pushed in the halls;
they get, `Here comes the faggot.' The emotional scars are
horrendous, but nobody pays attention because it's OK to hate
fags.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the testimony of gay and lesbian teachers, who say
some 14,000 students in Palm Beach County could be gay, some
parents wonder why sexual orientation has to be added to the
policy. Sexual harassment doesn't have anything to do with gender,
and it most often has to do with heterosexual men and women, wrote
David Walsh, chairman of the Boca Raton High School school advisory
committee, in a memo to board members.
</P>
<P>
   It's a controversial topic, but the policies and workshops don't
endorse homosexuality or tell kids it's OK to be gay, members of
the gay educators network point out. And network members aren't
currently working on bringing any pro-gay curriculum into the
school district, Adcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal today is not to get you to like gay people,''
Jennings told the guidance counselors. ``You're entitled to think
I'm a disgusting gay pervert. But you're not entitled to bring that
attitude into the classroom. As teachers, we have an ethical and
professional obligation to support every child, regardless of the
differences among them.''

FBI PROBING POSSIBLE BIAS IN STOPPING OF DEA AGENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The FBI is investigating allegations that two police
officers in a town outside Boston violated the civil rights of a
black federal Drug Enforcement Administration agent after a traffic
stop.
</P>
<P>
   DEA Special Agent Paul L.D. Russell Jr. said he was harassed and
detained by two uniformed officers even though he was driving an
unmarked Pontiac Grand Am equipped with blue lights and a radio,
and showed them his badge and his credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no problem with the initial stop, he was just doing his
job,'' Russell said. ``But there was no reason to continue after I
told him I was a federal agent and the car was insured. I was
arrested for an unarrestable offense that was fueled by race _
`He's black in a white town, what's he doing here?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Reading Police Chief Edward Marchand insists that his men
did nothing wrong, and that the incident was not racial.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point I don't see any crime committed of civil rights
by anybody,'' Marchand said. ``It's just a misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Richard J. Sinnott, who represents Russell and lodged
his civil rights complaint with the FBI, said the Reading officers
illegally detained, searched, arrested and assaulted Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do this to someone who looks like L.D. (Russell) does
and clearly identifies himself as a DEA agent, then I really have
to worry about how they treat the general public,'' Sinnott said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the confrontation happened the afternoon of Nov. 3
when Officer Robert Moreschi followed, then pulled over Russell's
Pontiac on High Street, just after the officer stopped to ask
directions at a nearby gas station. Russell said Moreschi told him
the car's registration had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who was conducting a background check on a DEA
applicant, said he told the officer, ``I'm with DEA. I'm on the
job. I know there are problems with the plate and the DEA is trying
to resolve them. It's a surveillance car.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said he produced his gold badge, his DEA credentials and
his Massachusetts driver's license. He said Moreschi was
unimpressed, and called for backup.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said he was standing beside the police cruiser when Sgt.
Peter Garchinsky arrived and ordered him to move to a nearby fence
and yelled, ``You! Get over there!''
</P>
<P>
   Garchinsky ``says, `You know there's some holes in your
story,''' said Russell. ``I said, `I'm a federal agent in a federal
vehicle doing my job on federal time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the sergeant pushed him up against the hood of the
Pontiac and thoroughly frisked him. Moreschi seized Russell's
DEA-issued 9mm Glock, which was strapped to his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the officers boxed in the Pontiac with their
cruisers and ordered him to get into his car and follow them back
to the Reading police station.
</P>
<P>
   While enroute, Russell said, he called his DEA supervisor,
Michael Cunniff, on his cellular telephone, and Cunniff advised him
to ``maintain your cool.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a DEA report, Cunniff called the station to
complain, but officers told him that Chief Marchand was on vacation
and Garchinsky was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, Garchinsky called Cunniff, who confirmed that
Russell was a DEA agent. Cunniff also warned Garchinsky there would
be ``serious consequences'' for his conduct _ including the fact
that Russell was forced to the police station for a motor vehicle
infraction that wasn't an arrestable offense, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Marchand said his officers told him that Russell went
to the police station voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Sgt. Garchinsky, he's certainly a good sergeant,''
Marchand said. ``I've never heard him utter anything in regards to
any nationality or race or anything else. If he made a
determination to ask him to come back to the station, I would
certainly think it was a legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchand said Moreschi has a reputation for being ``very
diligent in his apprehension of motor vehicle violators. He's known
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Moreschi questioned Russell and discovered the car was
registered to someone else, he didn't know whether Russell's
identification was valid, the chief said. Typically, DEA
surveillance cars are registered under false names and addresses to
protect the identity of the agents who drive them.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand said there are no blacks on the 41-member force and
just one woman, but estimated that the town's black population is
about 1 or 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, 44, a clean-cut church deacon who has been a federal
agent for 17 years, has worked with state and local police for
years on various task forces. He has worked undercover targeting
inner-city gangs and teaches a course about undercover work at the
State Police Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said he told the officer the problem with the
registration happened when a Boston Police cadet mailed a citation
to the vehicle's registered owner after spotting the car make a
traffic violation. Since then, the DEA had resolved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, DEA Special Agent George Festa met with
Chief Marchand while conducting an internal probe. Festa declined
to comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   DEA spokesman Pamela Mersky said the agency would only
acknowledge that Russell was in an official government vehicle and
conducting an investigation when the Reading officers stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, there is an ongoing investigation and possible civil
rights suit and because of this we don't want to comment,'' Mersky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand said he was ``dumbfounded'' when an FBI agent,
investigating Russell's civil rights complaint, contacted him a
couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate it happened the way it did,'' Marchand said.
``It's too bad it couldn't have been handled right at the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Gail Marcinkiewicz said the FBI is the agency
responsible for investigating civil rights violations. Nationwide,
75 percent of the FBI's civil rights investigations involve
federal, state or local officers.

INVESTMENT STANDOUT DONATES $10 MILLION-PLUS TO COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston College received the largest gift in its
136-year history Tuesday, with the donation of more than $10
million to its school of education from investment mogul Peter
Lynch and his wife, Carolyn.
</P>
<P>
   The gift also breaks a record for Lynch, who said it was ``by
far'' the largest gift made by him and his wife, who privately and
through their foundation donated to 265 charities last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynches said they were giving to the school, which will be
renamed for them, because of its reputation for a focus on training
teachers, and because of its commitment to improving urban
elementary and secondary schools, an area of particular interest to
the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps predictably, the celebrated stock-picker spoke of his
donation in terms of investing _ this time, in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask why I don't give to the school of management,''
Lynch said in an interview Tuesday. ``We look at this as `Where can
you get a lot for your money?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Brabeck, dean of the BC school of education, called the
gift an ``enormous, enormous'' boost for the often-beleaguered
profession of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day, when we've become so cynical about education,
this is an incredible statement, that Peter Lynch thinks education
is worth investing in,'' she said. ``It sends an enormous message
to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lynches asked to keep the specific amount private, except to
say that it surpasses the last-largest gift of $10 million 10 years
ago, and is under $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   It falls far behind the largest gifts to higher education _ the
largest was $295 million in stock donated by three private
foundations to Atlanta's Emory University in Atlanta three years
ago, and several Ivy League schools have received donations of more
than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the gift is a significant milestone for the school of
education and for the college, which has lifted itself up over the
last 25 years from a nearly-bankrupt college for commuter students
to a ``hot'' school with a national and international reputation
and an $814 million endowment. It has vaulted into the top 40 on
the US News &AMP; World Report rankings, and into the top 50 for
schools with the largest endowments.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, a BC graduate, parent, and trustee, said improving the
college had been like ``pushing a snowball up the hill for a while,
but gravity seems to be working with them.'' Still, he said, ``the
school of education hasn't gotten its proper recognition. It's
dwarfed by arts and sciences, the law school, the management
school.''
</P>
<P>
   The money, which will become part of the BC endowment, is
unrestricted, meaning it can be spent on any aspect of the school
of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand that we want to help strengthen teaching,
particularly in the inner city,'' Lynch said. ``And that's for all
types of students, public and parochial schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other ventures, the money will go toward improving the
college's partnerships with public elementary schools the nearby
Allston-Brighton section of Boston, its teacher training programs,
and research, which includes research on testing and the
administration of the widely-regarded Third International Math and
Science Study, or TIMSS, which compares 52 nations on everything
from students' math performance to how much homework they are
assigned, allowing informed comparisons about what works and what
doesn't in teaching math and science.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful gift for education . . . for our children,
and for Boston College,'' said President William P. Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   Peter and Carolyn Lynch are known for their commitment to
education. Since 1991, the year after Lynch stepped down from the
helm of Fidelity's Magellan Fund at the peak of his career, he has
been the chairman of the Inner City Scholarship fund, which last
year raised $3.3 million to help send needy students to Catholic
schools in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He has helped set up partnerships between the city's prominent
banking and law firms and the schools of the Archdiocese of Boston,
taking potential donors on an annual bus tour to see the conditions
in the schools firsthand. At BC, he helped set up the Urban
Catholic Teachers Corps, which houses, trains, and pays beginning
teachers to teach in parochial schools for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynches are particularly concerned about high dropout rates
in the nation's cities, in some places, close to 50 percent. And
the age at which students drop out, Lynch noted, is getting lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the scholarships and loans in this country are set up to
go to colleges,'' Lynch said. ``I'm not opposed to that, but
there's nothing to keep kids in fourth grade, in seventh grade.
It's hard to get these kids to think so far ahead; if they're 9 or
10, a scholarship to Bates or Bowdoin or Duke seems far off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving kids hope,'' he said. ``They can all make it.
People say these kids are hopeless. It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lynches's interest in education began with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Lynch's father was a teacher, principal, and
superintendent of schools in Delaware and Pennsylvania. Peter
Lynch's father taught mathematics at Boston College for six years
after receiving his masters from the school. He died when his son
was 11. Lynch went to BC on a $300 caddying scholarship, earning
the other $700 in tuition by caddying at the Braeburn Country Club,
where he happened to caddy for the president of Fidelity. He went
to work at the company in 1968 after a tour in the Army, and by the
time he retired at age 46 had taken the Magellan Fund from $20
million in assets to over $14 billion, for a total gain of 2,700
percent.

CREDIBILITY OF MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE IS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the Microsoft trial on Tuesday, a government
attorney attacked the testimony of the company's senior marketing
executive on multiple fronts, and at times the witness'
explanations seemed to cause even the judge to question his
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   During his two days on the witness stand, Brad Chase, a
Microsoft vice president, tried to hammer home one central point:
Microsoft's decision to bundle a Web browser with the Windows
operating system was not anti-competitive because alternative
browsers are easily available.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he argued, if Microsoft's browser, Internet
Explorer, is gaining market share, that is only because it is a
superior product.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, David Boies, the government's lead trial
lawyer, introduced a document from Microsoft files prepared last
May. Titled ``Internet Explorer Marketing Review,'' it was loaded
with statistics, analyses and marketing assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Boies pointed to one conclusion: Most people who switched to
Internet Explorer did so because ``it came with my computer,''
suggesting that the browser was gaining ground largely because it
was bundled with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that, Chase explained that the 20-page strategy
assessment ``was done by a summer intern'' and had no standing
within the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where a supposed summer intern got all this
information?'' Boies asked, his voice laced with incredulity. Chase
said he did not, prompting Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to observe
that the study appeared to be in the form of a slide show for a
meeting, and to ask, ``Do summer interns do slide presentations at
Microsoft?''
</P>
<P>
   Chase said it was possible that an intern prepared the show and
never presented it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Boies continued to challenge a videotape
Chase played last Thursday that purported to show how easy it was
to download Netscape Navigator, the principal competition to
Internet Explorer from Netscape Communications Corp. Boies began
the attack last Thursday, noting that the difficult and
time-consuming parts of downloading and installing Navigator had
been edited out.
</P>
<P>
   Boies tried to show his own demonstration tape on Thursday to
counter Microsoft's. But under the rules of the trial, he had to
allow Microsoft 72 hours to examine it.
</P>
<P>
   When Boies finally played his tape on Tuesday, he managed to
force Chase to acknowledge that some answers he had given Jackson
on Thursday had been incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Chase had told the judge that an America Online
customer downloading Netscape from the service would see a simple,
self-explanatory series of screens that makes the process easy. The
tape Boies played Tuesday showed that the process was considerably
more complicated. Jackson asked several questions along the way
indicating that he was confused.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Boies tried to deflate Chase's assertion that Internet
Explorer had won the majority of critical product reviews in the
last two years. Among other things, he showed the results of a
Microsoft tracking poll of professional Web developers, who
concluded in the fall of 1997 that ``Netscape is still perceived as
having the best browser.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase offered the view that these developers used Netscape
primarily to check their Web sites to assure that they worked well
with Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The judge seemed puzzled by that explanation and asked, ``Is
this just speculation, or do you know that for a fact?''
</P>
<P>
   Chase said several Web developers had told him that.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, Boies offered what he thought would be an explosive
new document, one that a government official called ``a naked
attempt at market division.''
</P>
<P>
   The document did appear to be just that, but it was so old that
Microsoft's lawyer appeared successful in convincing the judge that
it was irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The document, an e-mail message to Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates, Chase and others, was dated March 1990 and was written by
Mike Slade, a Microsoft executive who had just returned from a
meeting with the leaders of Intuit, manufacturers of Quicken, the
popular accounting software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a fairly surprising proposal to them,'' he wrote.
``Usually we can topple anyone,'' but ``we'd rather not compete
with you. So how about this?'' Then he suggested that Intuit write
software for Apple computers and others running DOS but leave the
new market for Windows computers to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   He said Intuit's leaders seemed receptive, and ``if they were
listening carefully, this could have been interpreted as a chance
to avoid competition with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is quite similar to one that the government charges
Microsoft made to Netscape several years later, an accusation that
Microsoft denies. Boies said he was offering this memo, despite its
age, ``because this is something that shows a pattern of
anticompetitive behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chase said he had no recollection of the document or events
surrounding it. And eventually the judge told Boies to move on to
another subject.
</P>
<P>
   After Chase completed his testimony Tuesday evening, William
Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for law and corporate
affairs, asserted that he ``hasn't been moved an inch off of the
central point of his testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, John Rose, a senior vice president for Compaq
Computer Corp., takes the stand. In his direct written testimony
made public Tuesday, he said he believed that most consumers wanted
a computer ``with broad functionality that is simple and easy to
use right out of the box.'' He endorsed the idea of giving them a
Web browser but added, ``It is irrelevant to users whether the
feature is incorporated in application or operating-system
software.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose also took issue with the government's accusation that
Microsoft threatened in 1996 to cancel Compaq's license to sell
Windows with its computers when Microsoft learned that Compaq was
also loading Netscape on its machines.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said the real problem was that Compaq was deleting some
on-screen icons, including one for Internet Explorer, that
Microsoft had preloaded. This was done, he added, as the result of
an agreement with America Online. When Compaq restored the icons,
Rose said, Microsoft withdrew its threat.

BOSTON HOUSING AGENCY FACES HUD REPRIMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY AND TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Federal housing authorities are expected to severely
reprimand the Boston Housing Authority Wednesday for failing to
shield eight minority families from racial harassment in the city's
public housing developments.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the families filed a complaint with the US
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the agency is expected
to finally address the grievances of 34 blacks and Hispanics who
say they suffered relentless vandalism, verbal abuse, and
playground assaults on children while living in South Boston and
Charlestown public housing developments from the late 1980s through
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The form of HUD's sanctions was not clear Tuesday, but could
involve measures ranging from lawsuits to new restrictions on how
to spend federal money, the lifeblood of public housing. The agency
announced a press conference in Washington, listing a fair housing
case in Boston as one of the agenda items.
</P>
<P>
   Ozell Hudson, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for
Civil Rights, which represents the families, said the evidence
supplied to HUD is overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``HUD would be negligent in its responsibility to enforce fair
housing laws if it did not find that there was a strong basis to
believe BHA systematically discriminated against the tenants of
color in the developments,'' Hudson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the BHA knew that some white residents were upset
about the desegregation of traditionally white developments in
South Boston and Charlestown, the tenants are hoping the federal
government will punish local housing officials for allegedly
failing to stop the harassment, clean up offensive graffitti, or
let them move away from the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints that HUD is expected to uphold include
allegations that a shot was fired into a minority tenant's bedroom
as he slept, rocks were thrown from windows at minority residents,
and doorknobs to minority tenants' apartments were tied by ropes to
prevent exit, according to records and sources.
</P>
<P>
   All the incidents allegedly occurred in the historically white
housing developments in South Boston _ Mary Ellen McCormack, West
Broadway, and Old Colony _ and the Bunker Hill housing development
in Charlestown.
</P>
<P>
   BHA director Sandra Henriquez, who took over the authority after
the complaints were filed, said she has installed policies to
remedy problems like the delays in covering racist graffiti, and
she has made it her mission to evict tenants who break the law or
cause disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that they look at all the training, all the
programs we've done, the policies we've put in place,'' said
Henriquez.
</P>
<P>
   If HUD decides to file suit, the case likely would proceed on a
separate track from the one already brought in US District Court by
Hudson's clients, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hudson said, his clients' case would be bolstered by
the HUD reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will strengthen our clients claim to both HUD and federal
court and should expedite settlement discussions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of its course, any action by HUD is likely to salt
Boston's racial wounds and refresh tensions. Despite periodic
incidents of racial intolerance or even violence, local officials
have declared the desegregation efforts at BHA developments to be
successful, achieved with a minimum of disruption through the
careful efforts of city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The case will undoubtedly dispute that perception, harking back
to the bad old days of the BHA, when it was held in receivership by
HUD for mismanagement, and was subject to a battery of lawsuits
over its failure to integrate developments, particularly those in
South Boston and Charlestown.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the underlying claim of the tenants' lawsuit is that
minorities were harassed in those developments so they would be
pressured into requesting transfers. But, the complaint asserts,
city officials thwarted their emergency bids for transfers because
they were under court orders to integrate the developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some families paid rent, but lived elsewhere,'' Hudson said.
``Others were so afraid that they wouldn't come home until dark.''
</P>
<P>
   BHA knew about this, he said, and not only failed to address the
problems, ``but failed to protect them from continued acts of
racial violence by not granting them civil rights transfers.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Henriquez said, ``I didn't need a lawsuit or a HUD
complaint to actively pursue issues around training and diversity
in this organization.''

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Dolphins' quarterback Dan Marino and
Panthers' right wing Scott Mellanby will play unusual positions
this year _ registered lobbyists in a multimillion-dollar fight
against the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   The sports stars will tell lawmakers during the upcoming
legislative session why insurers should be required to pay benefits
for autistic children, said Ron Book, who lobbies for Dolphins' and
Panthers' owner Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   Book said he will submit Marino's and Mellanby's names to the
state's lobbyist registry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people know Dan has an autistic child, but not many know
that Scott does as well,'' Book said. ``They've committed to coming
up to help pass the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 3,700 children in Florida with autism, a
developmental condition that makes it hard for them to communicate
and socialize. They include Marino's son, Michael Joseph, 10, and
Mellanby's son, Carter, who is almost 3.
</P>
<P>
   Marino spoke on behalf of an autism center two years ago but
this is a more sweeping proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment costs as much as $45,000 per year and insurance
companies say this and other proposals to make them pay for
infertility and other treatments could mean some small businesses
couldn't afford to offer insurance to their workers. Insurance
officials acknowledge they dread facing Marino and Mellanby, whose
message is they can afford treatment but many others cannot because
insurers won't pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be very tough to oppose,'' said Sam Miller,
vice president of the Florida Insurance Council, because it deals
with autistic children. ``And Dan Marino's on the other team.''

U.S. NEGOTIATOR AT KOSOVO TALKS VISITS MILOSEVIC
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 4th graf, Hill, who negotiated ..., to UPDATE with
Milosevic issuing statement against foreign troops in Kosovo,
raising graf from lower in story on what diplomats expect; tightens
throughout.)

 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The man who is most likely to make or break the Kosovo
peace talks, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, was
visited in Belgrade on Tuesday night by the chief American
negotiator, who brought him an account of the proceedings so far.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the negotiator, Ambassador
Christopher Hill, was also instructed to repeat to Milosevic
privately what he has been told publicly by the West: Agree to a
NATO-led ground force in Kosovo or NATO planes will bomb Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   With a Saturday deadline for the end of the talks approaching,
the pressure was increasing on Milosevic, who has ruled Kosovo with
an iron hand in the last 10 years and in the last year has turned
it into the site of another violent Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who negotiated with Milosevic at the Dayton talks that
ended the war in Bosnia, left the meeting without comment after
nearly four hours with the Yugoslav leader. After Hill's departure,
Milosevic's office issued a statement reiterating his ``negative
position'' on allowing foreign troops into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   However, diplomats are expected to continue pressing Milosevic.
The Yugoslav leader, a master at finding cracks in Western
expressions of unity and at tactical maneuvers, is expected to keep
the suspense mounting on his final position until the last minute,
and Tuesday's meeting was the first of what some diplomats believe
are likely to be several visits to Milosevic as the countdown to
Saturday rolls on.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said on Tuesday that Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had phoned Milosevic earlier on Tuesday and
asked him to see Hill, who is the ambassador to Macedonia. The
other two negotiators at the Kosovo talks are Wolfgang Petritsch of
Austria, representing the European Union, and Boris Mayorsky of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Because Milosevic declined to attend the talks himself, Hill was
left with little choice but to fly from Paris to Belgrade to see
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian and ethnic Albanian delegations to the talks remain
at Rambouillet, 30 miles south of Paris, where they have been
staying since the talks began at a 14th-century castle there 10
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has authorized its secretary general, Javier Solana, to
order air strikes against military targets in Kosovo and in Serbia
if Milosevic does not accept a settlement that has at its heart a
force of 28,000 NATO-led peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterest pill for Milosevic to swallow is the presence of
foreign soldiers in Kosovo, which is a province of Serbia and has
been described repeatedly by Milosevic as sovereign territory.
</P>
<P>
   At the castle in Rambouillet, the ethnic Albanian delegates,
whom Albright praised during a visit there on Sunday for their
readiness to sign a peace deal, expressed uneasiness about some
aspects of the plan. They were still waiting, two of them said, to
see the most important documents. These included the plans for how
the Serbian security police, who have been held responsible by the
United States for the massacre of ethnic Albanian civilians, would
be dispersed from Kosovo and for how peacekeepers would be
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Vertan Surroi, a newspaper publisher and a key delegate for the
ethnic Albanian side, said the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
been fighting an insurgency against the Serbs for the last year,
should be allowed to keep some kind of ``officer structure.'' One
of the demands of the peace plan is that the guerrillas give up
their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by phone from the castle, Surroi said of the demand to
demilitarize the guerrillas: ``It is my feeling you cannot go from
an existing stage to expect the whole thing to disband. There
should be a midway.''
</P>
<P>
   But Surroi said everything depended on Milosevic's agreeing to
the 28,000 troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, political director of the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army, said the ethnic Albanian delegation was prepared to sign an
agreement that ``guarantees peace and that the people of Kosovo are
free to have a democratic state.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was insisting that the ethnic Albanians, who
make up more than 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, should be
allowed to call a referendum on their future after three years,
Thaci said as much but without using the word ``referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the right of the people of Kosovo that at the end of the
interim period they be allowed to decide their own fate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a referendum has been pushed by the ethnic
Albanians _ and is anathema to the Serbs _ because the Albanians
would easily win a referendum on whether Kosovo should become
independent. But independence is opposed by the Serbs and by the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement that has been put to both sides
at Rambouillet, Kosovo would become autonomous with the right to
develop its own parliament, police, courts and other institutions.
The future of the autonomy would be decided at the end of three
years.

 &HT;    Unusual cases of typhoid fever stump health officials
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Health officials are investigating Palm
Beach County's first two cases of typhoid fever reported in
residents who haven't visited countries where the disease is
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen typhoid fever before in Palm Beach County
with people who haven't traveled outside the country,'' Dr. Jean
Malecki, county health director, said Tuesday. ``This is very
unusual in the United States, and it causes us concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Typhoid fever is transmitted by eating or drinking food or
beverages contaminated with bacteria from an infected person.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about handwashing, handwashing, handwashing,'' Malecki
emphasized. ``That's the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, officials in Miami-Dade County announced an outbreak
of three confirmed and three probable cases of the disease, which
is more typically found in areas such as Latin America and the
Caribbean. The Miami cases are also among people who had not left
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The local patients are a 30-year-old man from Hypoluxo, whose
symptoms first appeared on Jan. 24, and a 3-year-old Lake Worth boy
who developed symptoms Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The child was treated with antibiotics at a hospital emergency
room and sent home; he received additional treatment as an
out-patient, Malecki said. The man remains hospitalized, and both
patients are under isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Because the disease is spread when feces from an infected person
contaminates food or drinks, the patients' relatives who work in
food-service jobs are being kept home from work until they can be
tested, Malecki said. There are two such family members but neither
appears sick, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tests are being done to determine if both patients contracted a
common strain of the bacteria, but results will not be available
until the end of the week, Malecki said. These cases will then be
compared to the Miami cases, but no link is now apparent between
any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sign of an outbreak at this time,'' Malecki said.
``These are sporadic cases, but there is something going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials are concerned that the two patients may have
contracted the disease either from a carrier of the bacteria who
isn't sick or from food bought or eaten at the same store or
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   To track the source, both patients have answered a 12-page
questionnaires about where they have eaten and shopped. Their
answers will then be compared for a common link, Malecki said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the county health department sent letters to
nearly 2,000 infection control practitioners, emergency room
physicians and doctors with hospital privileges, Malecki said. The
alert notified doctors to watch for typical symptoms of typhoid
fever and to report any suspected cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``These symptoms are very similar to other types of diseases and
I just want to make sure people are looking for it,'' Malecki said.
</P>
<P>
   Typhoid fever is not unheard of in this area. In 1997, two cases
were reported in Palm Beach County, and three last year. But all of
those occurred in people who had recently traveled outside the
U.S., Malecki said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida records from 10 to 20 cases of typhoid fever a year,
according to the state Department of Health, with most of those
occurring in Miami-Dade County because its airport is an
international hub.

INVESTMENT STANDOUT DONATES $10 MILLION-PLUS TO COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston College received the largest gift in its
136-year history Tuesday, with the donation of more than $10
million to its school of education from investment mogul Peter
Lynch and his wife, Carolyn.
</P>
<P>
   The gift also breaks a record for Lynch, who said it was ``by
far'' the largest gift made by him and his wife, who privately and
through their foundation donated to 265 charities last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynches said they were giving to the school, which will be
renamed for them, because of its reputation for a focus on training
teachers, and because of its commitment to improving urban
elementary and secondary schools, an area of particular interest to
the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps predictably, the celebrated stock-picker spoke of his
donation in terms of investing _ this time, in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask why I don't give to the school of management,''
Lynch said in an interview Tuesday. ``We look at this as `Where can
you get a lot for your money?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Brabeck, dean of the BC school of education, called the
gift an ``enormous, enormous'' boost for the often-beleaguered
profession of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day, when we've become so cynical about education,
this is an incredible statement, that Peter Lynch thinks education
is worth investing in,'' she said. ``It sends an enormous message
to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lynches asked to keep the specific amount private, except to
say that it surpasses the last-largest gift of $10 million 10 years
ago, and is under $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   It falls far behind the largest gifts to higher education _ the
largest was $295 million in stock donated by three private
foundations to Atlanta's Emory University in Atlanta three years
ago, and several Ivy League schools have received donations of more
than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the gift is a significant milestone for the school of
education and for the college, which has lifted itself up over the
last 25 years from a nearly-bankrupt college for commuter students
to a ``hot'' school with a national and international reputation
and an $814 million endowment. It has vaulted into the top 40 on
the US News &AMP; World Report rankings, and into the top 50 for
schools with the largest endowments.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, a BC graduate, parent, and trustee, said improving the
college had been like ``pushing a snowball up the hill for a while,
but gravity seems to be working with them.'' Still, he said, ``the
school of education hasn't gotten its proper recognition. It's
dwarfed by arts and sciences, the law school, the management
school.''
</P>
<P>
   The money, which will become part of the BC endowment, is
unrestricted, meaning it can be spent on any aspect of the school
of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand that we want to help strengthen teaching,
particularly in the inner city,'' Lynch said. ``And that's for all
types of students, public and parochial schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other ventures, the money will go toward improving the
college's partnerships with public elementary schools the nearby
Allston-Brighton section of Boston, its teacher training programs,
and research, which includes research on testing and the
administration of the widely-regarded Third International Math and
Science Study, or TIMSS, which compares 52 nations on everything
from students' math performance to how much homework they are
assigned, allowing informed comparisons about what works and what
doesn't in teaching math and science.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful gift for education . . . for our children,
and for Boston College,'' said President William P. Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   Peter and Carolyn Lynch are known for their commitment to
education. Since 1991, the year after Lynch stepped down from the
helm of Fidelity's Magellan Fund at the peak of his career, he has
been the chairman of the Inner City Scholarship fund, which last
year raised $3.3 million to help send needy students to Catholic
schools in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He has helped set up partnerships between the city's prominent
banking and law firms and the schools of the Archdiocese of Boston,
taking potential donors on an annual bus tour to see the conditions
in the schools firsthand. At BC, he helped set up the Urban
Catholic Teachers Corps, which houses, trains, and pays beginning
teachers to teach in parochial schools for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynches are particularly concerned about high dropout rates
in the nation's cities, in some places, close to 50 percent. And
the age at which students drop out, Lynch noted, is getting lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the scholarships and loans in this country are set up to
go to colleges,'' Lynch said. ``I'm not opposed to that, but
there's nothing to keep kids in fourth grade, in seventh grade.
It's hard to get these kids to think so far ahead; if they're 9 or
10, a scholarship to Bates or Bowdoin or Duke seems far off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving kids hope,'' he said. ``They can all make it.
People say these kids are hopeless. It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lynches's interest in education began with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Lynch's father was a teacher, principal, and
superintendent of schools in Delaware and Pennsylvania. Peter
Lynch's father taught mathematics at Boston College for six years
after receiving his masters from the school. He died when his son
was 11. Lynch went to BC on a $300 caddying scholarship, earning
the other $700 in tuition by caddying at the Braeburn Country Club,
where he happened to caddy for the president of Fidelity. He went
to work at the company in 1968 after a tour in the Army, and by the
time he retired at age 46 had taken the Magellan Fund from $20
million in assets to over $14 billion, for a total gain of 2,700
percent.

MURDER CHARGE AGAINST OFFICER STIRS DEBATE ON RISK 
</HEADLINE>

 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW MILFORD, Conn. _ In the privacy of his lawyer's office,
Officer Scott B. Smith began to feel sick to his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours earlier, his future had seemed so promising. He had
been filling in for a detective, showing the brass what he could
do. He had passed the written, oral and agility tests of the
Connecticut State Police, and hoped to become a trooper in training
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But that late December day in the lawyer's office, it was all
falling apart. The New Milford police officer had shot and killed a
fleeing suspect, and some of the facts did not look good. He had
shot the suspect in the back, while the man was on his knees, and
from such a close range that the muzzle flash had burned the man's
shirt. The suspect, Franklyn D. Reid, had no gun. He was black.
Smith is white.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 27, contends that if he had not fired that shot, it would
have been his body there on the grassy shoulder of U.S. 202. Reid,
the officer said, had refused to show his hands, and had begun to
reach for his midsection.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors see it differently, and now Smith is facing a murder
charge, the first Connecticut police officer ever to be charged
with murder in the line of duty. Such a charge is so rare
nationally that Smith's lawyer says he has been unable to find a
similar case to help in preparing a defense.
</P>
<P>
   The repercussions of the case have been felt throughout
Connecticut among police and the public alike. Many police officers
say they fear that the case will set a grave precedent that could
make them hesitate a fatal extra second when confronted with a
knife or a gun. The prosecutor, John A. Connelly, contends that the
police just are not used to being held as accountable as other
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Since Smith was arrested, the public reaction in Litchfield
County, known for the lakefront summer homes of New York's wealthy,
has been loud and angry. But in direct contrast to the recent
demonstrations in New York City after an unarmed street vendor was
killed in a confrontation with four officers, the outcry has been
almost all in favor of the officer.
</P>
<P>
   When a rock radio station in Hartford held a protest rally at
the Capitol, it was to call for Connelly's resignation. The morning
host at WZMX-FM, who goes by the name Sebastian, appeared beneath a
banner that said, ``Sebastian Backs the Blue,'' and drew whistles
and cheers when he referred to the prosecutor as a barnyard animal.
</P>
<P>
   Police departments throughout the state have helped whip up
public support for Smith by selling ``Officer Needs Assistance''
T-shirts, holding dinners to benefit a legal defense fund and
setting up a Web page (members.aol.com/copsupport) that draws 400
to 800 e-mail messages a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it really necessary that the police take the first
bullet?'' the Web page asks.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the officers' anger is focused on Connelly. During a
recent hearing in the case, about 200 officers massed outside the
courthouse to denounce Connelly as ``Judas.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Connelly called a meeting of several police chiefs to
try to defuse the tension. ``Murder is defined as the intentional
killing of an individual,'' he said in an interview. ``There's no
provision saying that if you're a cop, the law doesn't apply to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly, a former head of the State Police, said that the
evidence _ including the statement of a witness who said Reid had
already been subdued when he was shot _ convinced him that murder
was the only appropriate charge, one that could result in a
sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after Smith was charged on Jan. 19, an East Hartford
officer was shot in the head as he responded to a noise complaint,
leading some fellow officers to wonder whether he hesitated to draw
his gun because of the New Milford case. Three days later, the only
police officer in the Connecticut legislature committed suicide.
The events, although perhaps unrelated, have left police officers
rattled throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are saying it's been tough to even come to
work,'' Officer Peter M. DeLouis, 34, said as he steered his
cruiser along the narrow, winding former cart paths of New Milford.
</P>
<P>
   Besides raising old questions about the proper bounds of deadly
force, the case exposes a predicament for prosecutors in
Connecticut. In this state, prosecutors _ not a grand jury _ are
responsible for deciding whether an officer will face criminal
charges after a shooting. But those same prosecutors also rely on
the testimony of police officers in making cases against everyone
from bad drivers to drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   New Milford officers who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said that they had already decided against drawing their guns in
situations where their training calls for them to do so, including
answering a report of an armed man in a parking lot, and said they
feared their partners would do the same. One tale, which could not
be verified but has become instant folklore among the state's
police officers, says that some paranoid officers are carrying guns
without bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to tie our hands and arrest us for doing our
jobs,'' said Sgt. Jim Duda, ``then all of us should just hand in
our badges, hand in our guns and get a job that pays just as much
without the risk of having our own life taken.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is mystifying and even infuriating to Reid's family,
which immigrated from Jamaica in 1986. His mother, Pearlylyn Reid,
acknowledged that her son, who had a long criminal record, had made
mistakes in his life, but added softly, ``The punishment didn't fit
the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reid's father, Wilbert A. Shaw Jr., 70, considers his
grandson's death to be the culmination of persistent indignities
and outrages that he has faced as a black man in largely white New
Milford. From bar fights to traffic stops to a refusal to consider
his application for a job as a custodian, Shaw said that he had
always felt unwelcome here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been a white boy,'' Shaw said, speaking about his
grandson, ``they wouldn't have been so afraid. They would have
handcuffed him and taken him into custody.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Smith has spent his life striving within the system, while Reid
always fought it. The blond, blue-eyed officer played three sports
at Newtown High School, graduated from Quinnipiac College in 1994
with a degree in social services, and is working on a master's
degree in criminal justice from the University of New Haven. He had
worked as a cardiopulmonary resuscitation instructor for the
American Red Cross, was a volunteer emergency medical technician
for his hometown ambulance corps, and got his first taste of law
enforcement as a security guard at Macy's in the Danbury Fair Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been suspended with pay, Smith retains unanimous
support in his department. He drops by several times a week in
jeans and a sweater to chat with colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, on the other hand, was what the police call a ``repeat
customer.'' Reid, who, like Smith, was 27, had served time for
stabbing a relative and for sexual assault. Over the years he had
been charged with child endangerment, drug possession, resisting
arrest and other offenses. When he died, the police were trying to
serve warrants on him for failure to appear in court and
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 case report, an officer who drove Reid to the police
station wrote that the suspect had ``told me to stop my patrol car
so that we could fight it out,'' called him a disparaging term for
a white person and ``threatened to get even with me someday.''
</P>
<P>
   So like other members of the 39-officer force here, Smith knew
all about Franklyn Reid at 11 a.m. on Dec. 29 when a detective told
him that a sergeant was chasing Reid on foot. Smith grabbed the
keys to an unmarked police car, two other detective jumped in, and
they headed south on U.S. 202, where they spotted Reid in the
parking lot of a Sunoco station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stated, `That's Franklyn Reid' as I rolled down the
window,'' Smith recalled in a six-page affidavit that his lawyer
provided to the Connecticut State Police, which investigated the
shooting. ``When we were within 10 to 15 feet of Mr. Reid I stopped
the car and opened my door and Mr. Reid immediately took off
running. I identified myself as a police officer and ordered him to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reid did not, and Smith chased him on foot through traffic
to the other side of the two-lane highway. ``I continued to yell at
him, instructing him to show me his hands because I could not see
them,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he pulled Reid onto the shoulder of the highway.
``As we struggled on the grass near the shoulder of the southbound
lane I continued to hold Reid's clothing with my left hand by his
shoulder area and I forced him to his knees,'' he said. ``Based on
the motions he was making with his arms and shoulders, and based on
the fact that he refused to show me his hands, I believed he was
preparing to use a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was yelling at him to show me his hands with my weapon
pointed at him, he made a sudden motion with his body in an
apparent attempt to return to his feet,'' Smith continued. ``At the
same instant I saw both of his arms begin to move quickly away from
his midsection and his body came upwards toward mine. I believed at
that time he was either going to shoot me or stab me. Out of fear
for my life at that instant, I discharged my weapon one time,
striking Mr. Reid.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Reid family, Richard A. Bieder, asserted that
the confrontation could have been settled in a much less
catastrophic way. Smith, he pointed out, is 6 feet 2 and weighs 190
pounds, while Reid was much slighter _ 5 feet 4 and 129 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers protest, however, that no one can recreate the
horror of those few seconds. ``The bad guys know where the guns
are, but we don't,'' said Investigator James M. Mullin, 40.
</P>
<P>
   In an unzippered jacket pocket, Reid had a folding pocket knife
with a 2}-inch blade. In part because the jacket was found near his
body, rather than on it, the authorities have declared that he was
unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder of U.S. 202 now has a makeshift memorial to Reid _
a dozen bouquets, now dead and muddy, and a cross fashioned from
two chunks of molding and bound together with a red Christmas
garland. Reid's younger brother, Wayne, 21, sports a massive
memorial tattoo on his left bicep showing a cross laced with the
word, ``Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly, the prosecutor, said that he had no plans to back down
from the murder charge. ``The police are not above the law,'' he
said. ``If they don't have faith in the justice system what does
that tell other people?''

RIVAL BECOMES RESCUER IN WORLD YACHT RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through the gale-driven spray, Giovanni Soldini spotted the
capsized hull of the yacht he hoped still contained his friend and
sailing competitor, Isabelle Autissier. Soldini could see the
wrecked rigging and equipment on Autissier's boat, smashed by the
pounding of mountainous seas. He called out. No response.
</P>
<P>
   He circled back and made another pass, yelling her name over the
wind, but again, no response. On the third pass, Soldini got close
enough to throw a hammer at the hull, and after a few more
agonizing moments, Autissier appeared, crawling out of the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's dramatic rescue came after Soldini, who was closest to
Autissier in a solo around-the-world race, had sailed more than 10
hours through 30-foot waves and high winds to reach a remote spot
in the South Pacific, 1,800 miles from land, halfway between New
Zealand and Cape Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Once she was safely aboard his boat, Autissier explained to
Soldini that she had not expected him to rescue her so soon, and
had fallen asleep after making her mayday calls. She had not heard
him until the sound of the hammer woke her.
</P>
<P>
   Though the weather still roared around them, and with an even
larger gale bearing down, the two sailors took a moment to break
out some wine and cheese, toasting the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   That was the picture related back to race headquarters Tuesday
afternoon after Autissier, 42, the most popular female sports
figure in France, had for the second time in her career escaped
from a disastrous wreck. She was leading 10 other sailors in the
27,000-mile Around Alone sailboat race that started from
Charleston, S.C., Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Autissier's rescuer, Soldini, was sailing a similar 60-foot boat
about 200 miles to the north when an emergency satellite signal
beamed to Race Operations Center in Charleston, signaling
Autissier's predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The beacon, known as a Global Positioning Emergency Radio
Beacon, set in motion a rescue that was equal parts
state-of-the-art navigational electronics and heroic seamanship.
</P>
<P>
   The wind was blowing 40 knots and the waves were up to 40 feet
high, said Autissier, when she first sent her team headquarters a
crackling radio transmission saying she had capsized but providing
no details.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boat suddenly turned more than 90 degrees,'' she told
headquarters, ``and I could no longer be in the cockpit. Then it
suddenly turned over and I didn't have time to shut the door.''
</P>
<P>
   At first report, Autissier was said to have gotten into a
lifeboat, but later reports suggested she stayed aboard the
upturned hull of her sailboat, even though equipment was breaking
up as it pitched and rolled in the stormy seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very quickly, the mast snapped to pieces,'' she radioed.
``When I saw that, I sent the signal because there was nothing else
I could do. Then, I began getting organized, getting security
material together.''
</P>
<P>
   Because she was so far from commercial shipping areas,
Autissier's only hope was a fellow competitor. Such rescues are
well within the expectations of participant sailors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994-95 BOC race, a precursor to this year's Around
Alone, Autissier's boat was dismasted in the Southern Ocean. She
had to jury-rig a sail using a spinnaker pole and other supports,
and sailed more than 1,000 miles until she was rescued by ship and
helicopter after being rolled by a second storm near the coast of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest disaster struck too far from land for anyone but
the nearest competitor, Soldini, to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone had to do this, he was the one,'' said Dan Miller, a
race spokesman in Charleston. ``He's been rescued himself before,
and knew the state of mind someone in that position would be in.
Also, he knew the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   The electronic signal that led to the rescue made a
globe-hopping triangle. When Autissier's boat capsized, it sent out
an emergency beacon to a satellite, which relayed the yacht's exact
position to receivers in Charleston. When it was determined that
Soldini was closest to her, race chairman Mark Schrader directed
him to the rescue. Race headquarters e-mailed, via satellite,
updated information on the position of Autissier's yacht, locating
it within 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing through winds upwards of 30 knots, Soldini made his way
south, his average hull speed nearly 20 knots. At about 9 a.m. EST
Tuesday, he radioed to Charleston, ``I am heading for PBR (the name
of Autissier's boat). I'm not letting up until I have found Isa.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a half-hour, with the wind calming to 29-31 knots,
Soldini had made contact, homing in on another electronic signal
from PBR. At 9:37 a.m., the rescue was complete, though Soldini did
not say exactly how he got Autissier from one boat to another in
the heaving seas.
</P>
<P>
   As they resumed sailing toward the northeast Tuesday, another
gale was aproaching from the south, and Soldini told race
headquaters, even as they shared their wine and cheese, ``We're
getting out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Their destination is Uruguay, the second of three stopovers in
the eight-month world-rounding competition that is scheduled to end
in Charleson in May. The two should reach their destination in
about seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The quadrennial race evolved from the BOC Around Alone race that
started in Newport, R.I., in 1982-83.
</P>
<P>
   Since the rules stipulate single-handed, unaided sailing,
Soldini will be held to the special exception afforded rescues;
Autissier is allowed to sail ``as a passenger'' but forbidden to
aid him with sailing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rescue was successful, Autissier's capsizing is
bound to renew scrutiny and criticism of long-distance sailboat
racing. Her 1995 rescue cost Australia an estimate $6 million in
Naval operations.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months ago, six sailors died and seven were boats
abandoned when a 650-mile race from Sydney to Tasmania was
devastated by a storm front with 80-knot winds kicking up gigantic
seas.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the four previous sailings of the Around Alone race,
only two of 87 competitors died at sea, according to race spokesman
Dan McConnell, and 56 of that number have finished the races.

 AN IMPEACHMENT SEQUEL STARS LINDSEY GRAHAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON, S.C. _ Didn't Lindsey Graham get the memo?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, freed at last from the months-long impeachment
ordeal in Washington, are supposed to be following a ``pivot
strategy,'' wherein they shuck the scandal and delve into real
issues that affect real people. But Graham, the folksy Southerner
who soared to national attention on the wings of impeachment and
cable television, is not inclined just yet to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is anyone here to talk about Social Security?'' he asked with
a big grin as he walked into a town meeting on Tuesday night in the
chamber of the U.S. District Courthouse, where an overflow audience
cheered and yelled and gave him a standing ovation. ``My God, I
can't believe this!''
</P>
<P>
   Without wasting a minute, the congressman plunged into Topic A:
``Let's talk about what happened and the future of the country,''
he said. For the next 20 minutes he relit the fires that have been
officially declared extinguished, using just a word or two _ ``the
referral,'' ``the dress,'' ``the rule of law'' _ to prompt the
collective memory of his audience, which was with him every step of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   No need to name names. President Clinton became simply ``he,''
as in: ``When he called her at 2:30 in the morning, he was up to no
good,'' eliciting laughter and groans.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party orthodoxy holds that no good can come of
reliving the impeachment wars. Not so here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell them what I did and why,'' Graham said earlier
in Washington as he looked forward to Tuesday night's series of
three town meetings, a kind of victory lap for the hometown boy
even though Republicans lost the case and the Senate acquitted
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time for the country as a whole to understand what went
on here and where we're going to go,'' Graham said. ``What are the
consequences of this case? What do you do with the next federal
judge who has got wandering hands in the office and someone's got
the courage to say, `No, you shouldn't treat me that way,' and he
starts hiding evidence and getting others to lie for him _ what do
we do with that case?''
</P>
<P>
   Few appeared to ride, if not enjoy, the twists and turns of the
impeachment process more than Graham. The junior U.S. senator in
South Carolina, Ernest Hollings, a 77-year-old Democrat, likened
the ordeal to ``passing a kidney stone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Graham, 43, one of the 1994 class of Republican
revolutionaries, a chance to demonstrate a down-home folksiness
that stood in sharp contrast to the dour scowls and legal mumbo
jumbo of many of his fellow managers. He became an instant hit on
the all-Monica-all-the-time cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   Was the Lewinsky scandal Watergate or Peyton Place? he mused out
loud. What, after all, is a high crime, he asked. ``How about if an
important person hurts somebody of low means?''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Graham's district, which covers much of the up
country in the northwestern part of South Carolina _ rewarded him
in his first town meeting here since last August. Of the two dozen
questions he was asked, half were about impeachment. Many called
him a hero. One shouted he should run for president and drew more
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Fowler, 30, a certified public accountant, said after
the meeting that she thought it was entirely appropriate that
Graham devote so much time to impeachment. ``I've been following
this story since it first broke,'' she said, indicating she
approved of Graham's role. ``He didn't go after the president. He
just looked at the facts and put them into everyday language. He's
got a bright future ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The natural assumption is that Graham, the first Republican
elected here since 1877, will use his exposure in the impeachment
case as a springboard to higher office. But some say his current
popularity is fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have the legs to run the distance,'' said Dick
Harpootlian, the state's Democratic Party chairman, who vows to put
up a candidate against him in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because people don't like Bill Clinton doesn't mean they
do like Lindsey Graham,'' Harpootlian said in a telephone interview
from Columbia. ``Once Lindsey Graham's 15 minutes of Jerry Springer
fame fades, people in his district will understand that he's
carrying water for the radical right.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some on his own side think Graham would do well to move on.
``The smart thing for him to do,'' said Whit Ayres, an
Atlanta-based pollster who has worked extensively in South
Carolina, ``is to use the name recognition that he's developed
through this process to build some legislative achievements. This
is the start, rather than the end, of a political career.''

 &HT;    Racial death aimed to recruit white supremacists, jury told
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ James Byrd Jr. lost his life behind a
zig-zagging pickup truck because a neo-Nazi needed to perform a
high-profile feat to earn respect for his new hate group _ the
Texas Rebel Soldiers, a jury was told Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen members of the Byrd family filled the first two rows in
the Jasper County courtroom as a jury of 11 whites and one black
heard the first day of testimony in the trial of John William
``Bill'' King, 24, the alleged ringleader of Byrd's barbaric
dragging death.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Byrd's daughters left the courtroom in tears. His
eldest daughter, Renee Mullins, 28, fled when a prosecutor, wearing
latex gloves, pulled the first item of Byrd's tattered clothing
from a brown paper evidence bag. The white underwear wasshredded
and stained with dirt or dried blood.
</P>
<P>
   King's father had a front-row seat across the aisle from the
Byrd family, but the families did not speak. Ronald King was
accompanied by a local Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, is one of three white men accused of dragging Byrd, a
disabled black man, nearly three miles on a backwoods road until he
was decapitated last June. The murder shocked the world and brought
unwanted shame to this pine forested town of 8,000 near the
Louisiana state line.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not guilty, your honor,'' was the only thing King said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury heard much more from King in the form of the
written
</P>
<P>
   word. Prosecutors introduced into evidence dozens of King's
handwritten letters and tracts that he laced with racist threats
and dogma.
</P>
<P>
   ''White is right!!!'' King wrote in a 1996 prison letter to a
white Jasper girl whom he called ''my precious Aryan princess.'' In
a racially incedinary letter, he said that white women are race
traitors for dating black men and should be lynched alongside them.
</P>
<P>
   King wrote a code of ethics, by-laws and recruitment letters as
captain of the Texas Rebel Soldiers, a branch of the Confederate
Knights of America, a white supremacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Evidence (will show) that Bill King needed to do something
dramatic that would attract media attention in order to gain, in
their warped world, respect for his newly formed gang,'' Jasper
County District Attorney Guy James Gray told jurors in his
10-minute opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said King is a neo-Nazi whose body and arms are covered
with white supremacy tattoos _ a Confederate flag, a burning cross,
a lynched black man, an ''Aryan Pride'' symbol, and swastikas.
''He's what they call a full-sleever,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This young man is full of hate,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The two court-appointed defense attorneys for King did not make
any opening statements to the jury. But they wasted no time in
objecting to much of the evidence offered by the prosecution, which
includes two assistant U.S. attorneys from Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Brack Jones Jr. said the government's photographs of Byrd's
battered body were ''inflammatory and and overly gruesome,'' but
State District Judge Joe Bob Golden allowed the jury to see the
photos.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which includes a black man who went to middle school
with King and now works in a private prison, had been seated for
just over an hour when the 14 photographs of Byrd's dismembered
body were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Each juror was given a bound copy of a notebook with 8x10 color
glossy photos showing Byrd's body as it was found on the rural road
on June as well as at the autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're pretty rough to handle, particularly for some of you
ladies,'' Gray said. ''It will be a little rough, but you can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman wiped her eyes as she viewed the photos, and several
other jurors scowled.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is comprised of five white women, six white men and one
black man. A white man and a white woman serve as alternates.
Prosecutors, who originally summoned 400 Jasper County residents
for jury selection, had hoped to have three blacks on the jury
because of the controversial racial nature of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors arrived together in a white van from the Jasper
Hillcrest Baptist Church with armed escorts, but they are not being
sequestered during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors used an overhead projector to show jurors some of
King's prolific writings and close-ups of his tattoos, including a
satanic pentagram-type symbol on the back of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys objected to exhibits about the tattoos because
they said King's skin art was protected by the U.S. Constitution's
protection of free association. The judge overruled the objections.
</P>
<P>
   The first witness in the trial was Jasper County Sheriff Billy
Rowles, who recounted walking several miles over the road where
Byrd died and marking the spots where Byrd's body parts and
belongings were found. He said he feared the worse when a lighter
engraved with a KKK symbol was found nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a brand new sheriff, and I didn't even know the definition
of a hate crime,'' Rowles said. ''But I knew somebody was murdered
because he was black.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rowles spoke, King's father took the oxygen tube he uses
because of emphasyma and nervously twisted it around his finger.
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle, some of Byrd's six sisters clutched tissues
and dabbed their eyes. Byrd's one brother kept his arm around one
of his sisters most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   King never glanced at the Byrd family, and he kept his eyes
locked on the table where he sat when one of the dead man's sisters
testified about what clothing her brother wore on the day he was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bryd family prepared for the trial by gathering Monday night
and watching videos of James Byrd Jr., playing the piano and
singing with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all crowded together and we encouraged and supported one
another,'' said Clara Taylor, one of Byrd's sisters.

ADVERTISING: THE UNCONVENTIONAL ALTERNATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new agency bearing a name with a double meaning is
stepping up efforts to promote itself as offering advertisers,
fittingly enough, two types of services.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, based in New York, is called Artustry Partnership,
combining the words ``art'' and ``industry'' to create a coined
word meant to be pronounced like ``artistry.'' Artustry, started by
three longtime denizens of Madison Avenue, is seeking to provide
both creative and strategic services to marketers that want to work
outside the realm of traditional agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening last fall, Artustry has landed clients that
include the Chase Manhattan Bank unit of Chase Manhattan Corp.;
Tabacalera de Espana, the Spanish tobacco company, which sells
cigar brands like Romeo y Julieta; Texaco Inc., and Trump
Properties. The agency has already taken part in several reviews
and has just been awarded the account of the Today's Man retail
chain.
</P>
<P>
   The start-up of Artustry is indicative of a trend that has been
reshaping the industry as unconventional alternatives to the
standard full-service agency proliferate. Whether they bill
themselves as consultants, research groups, hybrid agencies or what
the trade publication Advertising Age describes as ``strategic
communications boutiques,'' the goal of all the entrepreneurial
newcomers is the same: to respond to the changing, increasingly
complicated needs of clients in ways that can be sold as, to quote
the old advertising promise, new and improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, what we do resembles closely what a
traditional agency does,'' David Sklaver, one of the three partners
at Artustry, said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   A key difference, he added, is that he and his partners are
following ``the production company business model, handpicking the
people for the specific assignment to get the job done right rather
than selling people you have on the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Giraldi, another partner at Artustry, said the fledgling
agency was eager to look beyond the tried-and-true advertising
forms, particularly the 30-second commercial, if clients require.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, said Giraldi, who joined Sklaver for the
interview, Artustry hired a director of music videos to produce a
promotional film for the developer Donald Trump to make prospective
buyers ``feel good about spending $11 million for an apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Tabacalera, Artustry is producing print advertisements
for a new cigar, Quintero, as well as an image campaign similar to
what a brand consultant might develop, centered on a seal
displaying the letter ``T'' and ``creating a place in the minds of
cigar smokers,'' Sklaver said, focused on ``the ritual that
romances the cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   One image ad, for example, carries this headline: ``The modern
cigar shares its birthplace with flamenco, bullfighting and
all-night parties. (No wonder we love it so.)''
</P>
<P>
   Sklaver's background includes stints at New York agencies like
DDB Needham Worldwide, part of Omnicom Group, and Wells BDDP, now
defunct. Giraldi is the director of well-known commercials for
advertisers like the Pepsi-Cola Co. unit of Pepsico Inc.; he will
continue with his other pursuits, which include Giraldi Suarez
Productions, the commercial production company, and a long-running
restaurant partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The third partner in Artustry is Bill Perna, who has been
involved in broadcast production for agencies and independent
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very impressed with what David Sklaver and his
group is able to bring to the party,'' said Matt Golonka, vice
president for advertising at Today's Man in Moorestown, N.J., which
awarded its creative account to Artustry after a review that also
included several creative boutiques that he declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading articles in Advertising Age and Adweek showed me a
number of new creative resources that are popping up,'' Golonka
said, ``but a lot are attached to full-service agencies, which we
didn't need.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of marketers need to utilize a full-service agency
because for them, one-stop shopping is important,'' he added. ``For
clients like ourselves, which need creative firepower and already
have an understanding of the business housed within the company,
this kind of relationship is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Artustry will replace Adworks in Washington, where Golonka had
been the senior account manager on the Today's Man account before
joining the retailer. Today's Man, which spent almost $13 million
last year on advertising, Golonka said, will use Artustry ``for
everything from our most visible branding work, television and
radio commercials, down to the store level.'' Media services will
continue to be handled by Harmelin Mediaindep in Philadelphia;
Metis/America Marketing in Richmond, Va., will continue to serve as
a database management consultant to Today's Man.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every effort by Artustry is, well, artistic (or
artustic). Last month, Artustry was bested by a traditional agency,
Trahan, Burden &AMP; Charles in Baltimore, in a review for the creative
account of the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn., owned by
the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put together a killer presentation,'' Giraldi said, which
tried to capitalize on negative perceptions about the principal
Foxwoods rival, Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   The theme? Foxwoods, ``where winning is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's creative.

<P>
   CONAKRY, Guinea _ Sunlight sifted through the dusty air and the
sweet voice of the muezzin calling Muslims to prayer washed over
the worshipers from a loudspeaker near the vaulted ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   In twos and threes, women dressed in gowns of blue, yellow,
copper and purple, their hair bound in bolts of matching cotton,
knelt by Kadiadou Diallo, kissed her on each cheek and pressed her
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo was the center of attention in Guinea's main mosque
Tuesday just as she was in New York City after her son Amadou's
death at the hands of four police officers. She was home, no longer
swallowed up by throngs of strangers but cradled in the embrace of
a huge extended family that includes some of the country's top
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, 22, a street vendor, was shot to death on Feb. 4 by four
police officers who fired 41 times as he stood, unarmed, at the
entrance to his Bronx apartment building. While the shooting
provoked fierce protests in New York and calls for the immediate
arrest of the police officers involved, the response in Guinea has
been more muted but still tangible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 41 bullets _ that's what made this a distinct case, even
in the United States itself,'' said the foreign minister, Lamine
Kamara, who attended the prayer service at the Faycal Mosque in
central Conakry, the capital. ``Guinea decided this was not just a
family affair but a national affair.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has put a fleet of cars and officials at the
Diallo family's disposal and arranged motorcades and formal
ceremonies that rival the arrangements usually made for heads of
state. Guinean state television and radio have interviewed the
family; government ministers and members of the parliament met them
at the airport on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Guineans have been exhorted by radio to turn out on the street
when Diallo's coffin passes by on its way to Hollade Bouru, a
village about 300 miles from Conakry, for burial Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, the rallies in New York and the public
ceremonies in Guinea, Mrs. Diallo has appeared to adapt with steely
serenity to being thrust into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership is not something I can impose on myself, but
sacrificing myself and being an example would be very good _ to
change bad into good,'' Mrs. Diallo said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, she has become a spokeswoman for a cause that black
leaders, like the Rev. Al Sharpton, have defined as a fight for
racial justice. Back home, in this country of seven million people
linked by tribal and family ties, she has taken on another kind of
public role, representing, in her dignified grief, the fears of
many Guinean families with relatives abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that in this or that family there is a cousin or a
brother who is in America,'' said Fanta Kouyat, a Foreign Ministry
official who lived in New York City for several years as a child
when her father was the Guinean ambassador to the United Nations.
``So we think that what happened to this family could happen to any
family here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo herself spent many years outside Guinea. She married
Saikou Amad Diallo at the age of 17 and moved with him to
neighboring Liberia, where he was a trader in agricultural products
and other commodities. It was there, she said, that she learned
English in a private college.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had four children _ Amadou was the eldest _ and
eventually moved to Thailand and Singapore, where Mrs. Diallo
helped her husband set up and run a business importing gemstones
until they divorced in 1994. With her second husband, Boubacar
Sankarela Diallo, who is not related to her first husband, Mrs.
Diallo now runs a gem trading company in Conakry.
</P>
<P>
   Her three younger children _ Laouratou, 20; Ibrahima, 17; and
Abdul Sallam, 16 _ live with them.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo grew up in a family that considered itself ``an
intellectual family,'' said Fifi Diallo, one of her older sisters.
Their father, who was a manager in Guinea's timber industry,
insisted that all his nine children, including the five girls, get
a good education. Two sisters now are accountants. One is a
midwife. Another is getting a degree in finance. All of Mrs.
Diallo's siblings live in Guinea, except for a brother who lives in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Her extended family of cousins, aunts, nieces and in-laws joined
Mrs. Diallo in the central mosque of Conakry Tuesday for a prayer
service and tribute to Amadou Diallo that was organized by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mrs. Diallo's sisters, Halimatou Diallo, said, ``Amadou
was a boy of 22 years and he's treated like a head of state
today.''
</P>
<P>
   After the service, Mrs. Diallo said: ``I didn't want to be a
public person. I agree that my son died, but I want him to live, as
a symbol of youth, of all the innocent people who are victims of
police brutality.''

HEWLETT-PACKARD TOPS EARNINGS ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hewlett-Packard Co. reported mixed financial
results on Tuesday, with first-quarter earnings well above Wall
Street analysts' estimates, but both revenues and orders below
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell $5.9375, to $70.50, on the New
York Stock Exchange. The earnings were released after the markets
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Hewlett-Packard's ability to deliver strong
earnings despite slow revenue growth spoke well for the company's
financial management. But they said the company must soon show it
could also increase sales. Hewlett-Packard management had at one
time suggested the company could have double-digit sales growth
this year, a goal they conceded on Tuesday that they were unlikely
to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have clearly developed a low-revenue-growth kind of
model, and it worked very well this quarter,'' said Daniel
Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. ``Clearly by moderating PC
growth, they were able to turn up earnings,'' he said, referring to
previous quarters when the company pursued market share in personal
computers at the expense of profitability. ``But I think there are
going to be many questions about the top line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, which ended Jan. 31, Hewlett-Packard reported
earnings of $960 million, or 92 cents a diluted share, up 3.3
percent from $929 million, or 86 cents a share, in the period a
year earlier. Revenues rose 1 percent, to $11.94 billion, from
$11.82 billion in the first quarter of the 1998 fiscal year.
Per-share figures reflect a reduction in the number of shares
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Hewlett-Packard to earn 83 cents a share,
according to First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've achieved a good profit outcome despite softness in some
of our businesses and weak revenue growth,'' Lewis Platt,
Hewlett-Packard's chairman, president and chief executive, said in
a statement. ``Even businesses whose revenue was weak or negative
turned in decent profitability,'' he said. ``Still, we're not
meeting our growth objectives. We need to stay sharply focused on
stimulating business while remaining sensitive to the need for
careful expense management.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard said total orders were down 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's weakest business was test and measurement
equipment, which declined 14 percent. Revenue from Unix-based
computer systems also declined compared with a strong quarter a
year earlier, mostly attributed to weak sales in the midrange,
which has changed products. PC revenue growth was mixed, because of
the company's emphasis on profitability, while printer growth was
strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the company has to do something on the product side to
get revenue growth,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch. ``In addition to products they need to articulate an
Internet vision. They've sort of been left out of that,'' he said,
allowing Sun Microsystems and IBM to take the lead.

ARIZONANS FLY INTO AIR DANGER ZONE OVER IRAQ  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAR THE IRAQI BORDER _ An Air Force stratotanker had nearly
finished its three-hour refueling mission along Iraq's northern
border Monday when voices of alarm squealed over the headset:
``Triple-A airburst! Triple-A airburst at Bull 135!''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Aaron Vangelisti, an Arizona National Guardsman and pilot
of the KC-135, craned his neck looking out the cockpit window.
Iraqi anti-aircraft fire was confirmed by white puffs of smoke
visible above the cloud line to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Other voices began to squawk over the radio in rapid fire
succession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miller is attacking Target 54 from the west . . . unauthorized
aircraft . . . the SAM missile launch . . . There it is. See the
contrail?''
</P>
<P>
   For crew members aboard Ice One, the Arizona National Guard's
refueling ship, it was a gripping moment in the cat-and-mouse
military game being played by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and
his troops.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, a pair of F-15s had taken turns hooking up to a
boom that hangs from the tail of this flying gas station. The
fighter jets appeared to be motionless as they sucked up tons of
fuel while traveling at 460 miles per hour, eyeball to eyeball with
the boom operator.
</P>
<P>
   Once sated, they rolled away 26,000 feet over southern Turkey
and headed into the no-fly zone. Six other fighters had done the
same thing during this mission, which crew members said went
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as the KC-135 finished its last elliptical pattern
over jagged, snow-capped peaks, at least two surface-to-air
missiles were fired by Iraqi ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Tech. Sgt. Steve Hanson climbed into the boom pod _ a windowed
cavity in the jet's tail _ and watched the rear through portals. If
a missile was coming, he'd help Vangelisti decide out how to get
out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The radio traffic grew confusing as two journalists watched and
listened from vantage points aboard the tanker. Air Force officials
said they were the first civilian reporters allowed onto Turkey's
Incirlik air base, or on an Operation Northern Watch mission, in
more than three years. And they'd gotten into the thick of it.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in late December, Iraqi forces started taking potshots
at U.S., British and Turkish aircraft in the no-fly zones. The
areas of northern and southern Iraq were established as part of the
complex U.S. and U.N. formula to contain and control Saddam Hussein
after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Although coalition fliers and support teams have been acting as
sky cops for more than eight years, public awareness pops up seldom
_ except when there is an exchange of fire. Yet on an almost daily
basis thousands of personnel here and in the United Arab Emirates
have been sending up fighter jets, reconnaissance planes, AWACS
airborne command ships and refueling tankers to patrol the border
airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Northern Watch began three years ago. U.S. authorities
say none of their planes has been hit since then. Pilots and crew
members nervously joke about the feebleness and inaccuracy of Iraqi
firepower. But in dozens of interviews, they also acknowledged a
nagging fear that the Iraqis could score a lucky hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody'd be lying if they told you they weren't scared out
there,'' said Tech. Sgt. Bill Garrett, a boom operator on his way
home to Avondale after three weeks based at Incirlik.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety level escalated in recent weeks as Iraqi gunners
became emboldened by political instability in Turkey and news
reports suggesting that Saddam would get new weapons from Russia.
On Monday, as Ice One flew within miles of the Iraqi border, Tariq
Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, was in Ankara trying to
persuade Turkish officials to keep the Americans and British out of
Incirlik.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vangelisti was trying to cope with a missile and
anti-aircraft fire. He said his mind locked on a series of
defensive strategies _ something he and other Guard members have
trained for constantly from their base at Sky Harbor International
Airport. But this time, the hostile fire was real. Vangelisti also
flashed on his wife, Heidi, and their 2-year-old daughter, Bryanna,
back home in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know where it was,'' Vangelisti said of the flak.
What he did know is that the KC-135 is particularly vulnerable; a
Boeing jetliner that, instead of passengers, carries tons of fuel
in its fuselage and wings.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard units from Arizona and other states fly these
sitting ducks in vulturelike circles just a few miles above Iraq's
northern line. Their job is to fuel the attack aircraft responsible
for enforcing no-fly conditions.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard crews are not active duty Air Force personnel,
but weekend warriors who volunteer once or twice a year to go on
refueling missions. Arizona's wing includes teachers, cops,
accountants and bureaucrats who leave their jobs behind, traveling
7,000 miles around the world on three-week tours.
</P>
<P>
   Vangelisti is a United Airlines pilot. Hanson is a Peoria
firefighter. Maj. Gunnar Buzzard of Scottsdale, another pilot, is
president of a computer company.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Guard has six KC-135s based at Incirlik. Over a
two-month period, more than 300 members will have left home to
support this refueling mission _ not just pilots and boom
operators, but maintenance crews, intelligence specialists and
ground support.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's shootout, in fact, the Arizona Guard had three
KC-135s aloft, crewed mostly by Valley residents.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ice One took off at dawn, Lt. Col. Joe Smith, the Guard's
public information officer, warned of potential combat conditions.
If the tanker starts swerving, he said, that means Iraqi aircraft
have penetrated the no-fly zone and we're getting out. Smith added
that the KC-135s are protected by a unified team of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam's fliers breach the border, Smith said, ``They'll be
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Hanson lay on his belly in the boom pod and added
more sober words: ``If we do go down, I want you to do exactly what
I tell you. There's going to be good people looking for you, and
maybe bad people . . . this is not a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson, 44, recited emergency procedures, showing how to open
doors, slide down ropes and run for cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be waiting for anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For three hours the flight was unremarkable except for the raw
beauty of southern Turkey. Rising from the tarmac at Incirlik,
there is a view of fertile croplands and the teeming city of Adana.
That sight yields in moments to the Mediterranean coast, and then
to magnificent peaks ranging east and south from the air base. The
terrain is cold, white and bleak.
</P>
<P>
   As crew members looked down they managed to break tension with
occasional wisecracks. Shortly after takeoff, someone asked, ``We
all right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a little chest pain,'' came the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breathe deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly they focused on the job at hand, taking navigational
readings, checking fuel levels, flying toward Iraq. This was their
last mission after a three-week tour and they didn't want anything
to go wrong. Once they reached the appointed refueling pattern,
F-15s and F-16s took turns hooking up to the dangling boom, then
rolling away to patrol duties.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint of trouble came via radio reports of a smoke
plume in Iraq. Fighters with code names like Mad Dog and Reaper
closed in for a look. Moments later, the Triple-A salvos were
hurled skyward, followed by a pair of missiles. It was impossible
to tell who was targeted or how many rounds were fired.
</P>
<P>
   One crew member said there was no doubt who Saddam was aiming at
because the KC-135 is a big, slow, valuable asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those missiles were fired at us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others indicated that the missiles were launched from 60
miles away and fizzled after traveling about 30 miles north. The
flak also was a long way off. After making some quick mental
calculations, Vangelisti decided there was no need to take evasive
action. At that point, he said, ``We were just in a front-row
seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hanson of Tempe (no relation to Steve), a backup boom
operator, took it all in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were far enough away and all those (U.S.) fighter pilots
were out there,'' Hanson said after Ice One had landed safely. ``I
mean, it was interesting, but I had paperwork to do up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after Guard members, known as Copperheads, returned to
Incirlik did they learn the full story of what went on. U.S.
fighter jets answered the Iraqi volleys by blasting away at Iraq's
anti-aircraft batteries. Saddam responded with threats to attack
not only U.S. aircraft, but Incirlik and other American military
bases _ through the skies or via terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   As Arizona crewmen later boarded a flight from Turkey to Spain
to New Jersey to Phoenix, U.S. officials were taking the threat
seriously. Personnel at Incirlik reportedly were barred from
leaving the base due to concerns about terrorism. That included
about 120 Arizona National Guard members who continue enforcing the
no-fly zone as part of Operation Northern Watch. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: ENFORCER RETURNS TO GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Used to be that after having played against the
Knicks, opponents needed respirators and paramedics in order to
leave the arena. And the major cause of such mayhem was Charles
Oakley, all 6 feet 9 inches and 245 foreboding pounds of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I went to the basket, I knew I was going to be hit
by Charles Oakley,'' Grant Hill recalled Tuesday with a kind of
respect, and maybe some admiration, too. ``So I always made sure I
knew where he was on the court, to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Every player in the league knew that he was going to be hit by
Charles Oakley _ still does. But it is Charles Oakley in a
different uniform, the shocking purple of the Toronto Raptors, and
not the orange, white and blue of the Knicks. And Tuesday night
Oakley returned to Madison Square Garden, the scene of so many of
his greatest collisions, clobbers and clouts, for the first time
since he was traded for Marcus Camby over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   He had expressed unhappiness about being traded from the team he
had been a part of for 10 years _ or at least the manner in which
he was traded _ but then Oakley wears unhappiness as a kind of
badge. (There was a leaked report the night of the trade, and
Knicks general manager Ernie Grunfeld said he tried but couldn't
reach Oakley until later in the night.)
</P>
<P>
   Grumpiness was one of the elements that made Oakley so endearing
to Knick fans. One always got the impression that Charles' shoes,
or shorts, fit too tight. And maybe that was part of the motivation
for his energetic play, which included his diving head first into
the stands for the ball, crashing into and flummoxing fans. It was
never a good idea to sit with a drink or a box of popcorn in your
hands in the first five rows of a Knick game with Oakley in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   One fan, who has sat courtside for 25 years, wrote of him in The
New York Observer last year: ``Oakley has been a consistently
tremendous ballplayer for the New York Knicks who has contributed
mightily night after night, season after season, and actually gets
better with age. Of course, I'd hate to wake up in the middle of
the night and find him hovering over my bed with that look on his
face, but on the court he's worth every cent they pay him.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Woody Allen's assessment, and most Knick fans would
surely agree with it. But times change, and the Knicks sought a
young, springy Camby _ Oakley is 35, Camby 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might work out for them,'' said Hill, whose Piston team
lost to the Knicks Monday afternoon, ``but right now they miss
Oakley.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, the Knicks' often enigmatic center, said that he
missed Oakley, though Oakley wondered about that. ``He never told
me that,'' Oakley said before Tuesday night's game, which the
Knicks won, 95-85. The two never were bosom pals, and sometimes
Oakley, after a good game, shooed reporters from his locker. ``How
come you're comin' over to me now?'' he said more than once. ``Why
don't you go back to Patrick's locker, where y'all usually are?''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, there was significant interest in Oakley's return to
the Garden, and he received a standing ovation Tuesday night when
introduced before the game. At halftime, the Knicks put on a film
tribute of Oakley's career, which had to include some of his most
arresting fouls. Oakley, who was never a great shooter (though a
competent one when standing in one spot), who often fell when he
tried to dribble, who was a decent passer when he wasn't trying to
be fancy and flinging the ball behind his back and over the
scorer's table, was a good defender, a ferocious rebounder and a
general terror.
</P>
<P>
   He holds a little-known National Basketball Association career
record of having committed 30 flagrant fouls _ that is, contact
deemed excessive, and/or unnecessary _ since that infraction was
instituted nine seasons ago (next in line are those righteous
brothers _ Charles Barkley with 26, and Dennis Rodman, 21).
</P>
<P>
   Oakley has been suspended twice because of the thumping number
of flagrants in a given season, also a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people been building this up like a Tyson-Evander
Holyfield rematch,'' Oakley said before Tuesday night's game, ``but
it's not. I'm not gonna bite anyone's ear off. I don't carry a
grudge.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had nothing but good thoughts about New York, which
gave him an opportunity to, he said, ``expand my business
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the game: ``I'm not gonna get caught up in trying to
score 20 points. I'm just gonna try to help my team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Charles Oakley has always tried to do. Often to
the benefit of the team he was playing for, as well as to the good
fortune of those in the neighborhood selling medical supplies. &QL;

THE ACTOR WARS: ANOTHER CHAPTER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FELICIA R. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trade agreement governing the number of British and American
actors working on opposite sides of the Atlantic is under attack by
Britain's main international cultural agency, prompting hopes that
the unions involved will reconsider the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current rules, a producer who wants to bring a British
actor to New York must seek the approval of Actors Equity, the
American union, just as British Equity's approval is needed to
allow an American actor to go to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the two unions try to balance the exchange, and there
are categories for exemptions. For example, actors who are
``stars'' need not be approved. But over the years, some Britons
have charged that provisions for exchange have been unevenly and
unfairly applied.
</P>
<P>
   The sometimes bitter wrangling was reactivated a little more
than two weeks ago with the release of a critical report from the
Arts Council, Britain's principal agency for international cultural
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that American Equity's influence in the actor
exchange ``is unquestionably operating in restraint of free trade
between the countries.'' It added that the American union's
rationale for its approach was based on ``short-term quasi-economic
arguments for which there is little if any justification.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans have said that because so much British theater is
government subsidized and because it costs less both to produce
shows in Britain and to use their casts of British actors in New
York, jobs for Americans would be reduced in a more open
marketplace in which Britain would be even more alluring.
</P>
<P>
   It costs roughly $300,000 to mount a straight play in London,
compared with some $1.5 million in New York. Also, American actors
make more money than their British counterparts and must maintain
their American pay standards if they work in London, according to
American Equity their American pay standards if they work in
London, according to American Equity agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The Arts Council report argues that the current policies mean
that audiences in both countries miss seeing a great deal of
theater and that many actors lose opportunities to work.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Bernstein, executive director of the League of American
Theaters and Producers, the trade organization, said recently that
the current system was a failure. But Alan Eisenberg, executive
director of American Equity, said that the trade agreement was
still needed to protect American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see a subsidy situation in this country,''
Eisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The league advocates a joint fund for American actors in England
with the Society of London Theater, the British counterpart to the
league, and the Theatrical Management Association, which represents
regional theaters. Money from the fund would help pay the higher
salaries for American actors that are dictated by American Equity.
</P>
<P>
   The league also favors the creation of a forum in the United
States for British producers to audition American talent, and that
videotapes of Broadway shows housed at the New York Public Library
for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center be made available to the
London Theater Museum, with an eye toward showing off talent on
both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Members of British and American Equities and the two trade
organizations met in London in 1997 but did not reach any
resolution. Next month, British Equity will present the Arts
Council report to its members. All four parties say they are open
to meeting again sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terribly difficult situation and emotions run high,''
Sally Cowling, head of Drama and Dance for the Arts Council said in
a telephone interview from London. ``It's the only situation of its
kind in the world and terribly close to artists' hearts.''

JAPANESE RARITIES THAT EVEN THE JAPANESE SELDOM SEE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y., N.J., N.M.)   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lloyd E. Cotsen, a mega-collector of ordinary and offbeat
objects that most people ignore, goes to great lengths to share
them with the public. He gave 40,000 children's books to the
Firestone Library at Princeton University, and he sent 2,500 pieces
of folk art and textiles to the Museum of International Folk Art in
Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cotsen, who is 69 and lives in Los Angeles, is letting the
public view his most treasured artifacts _ Japanese bamboo baskets.
The 900 baskets in his collection, which is considered the largest
and most distinguished in private hands, are a type of artifact
that is virtually unknown to all but a small group of experts, even
in Japan, where such objects are seldom exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   So Cotsen lent 100 rarities to the Asia Society in Manhattan for
``Bamboo Masterworks: Japanese Baskets from the Lloyd Cotsen
Collection,'' a show on view through May 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've collected baskets for 40 years,'' he said. ``I'm always
testing myself to be sure that I choose a basket visually _ first
for its form, then for its texture and finally for its technique.
It goes from my eye to my heart to my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotsen mastered his hunting and gathering skills as a boy,
chasing after baseball cards, stamps, marbles, used matchbooks and
the Big Little Books that many of his generation remember from
childhood. As an adult, he amassed huge, scholarly collections,
like the two he gave away.
</P>
<P>
   The folk art was donated with Neutrogena Corp., makers of
moisturizers and health care products, of which he was chairman and
chief executive until 1994 when he sold the company for $924
million to Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   His basket collection is chock full of sculptural prizes. The
most distinctive in the show resemble a Nautilus shell, a cone of
pick up sticks, a wine glass sprouting twigs and the spiraling form
of the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He bought his first basket in 1953, when he went to Japan as a
lieutenant in the United States Navy. On a visit to Kyushu, he
picked up a box-like bamboo work fitted with trays like a picnic
basket. Five years later, on a trip to San Francisco, he acquired a
curvy flower basket that was purposely dented in on one side, a
feature that proved irresistible to him. He has been a confirmed
collector ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, even the most imaginative baskets Cotsen acquired
were anonymous works. But in recent years he has bought numerous
signed baskets, assisted by Mary Hunt Kahlenberg, his chief
curator, who helped organize the show at the Asia Society, and
Robert Coffland, her husband. Coffland visited artists in Japan to
find works that he photographed or sent back for Cotsen's
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The show also includes baskets by Japan's most celebrated
masters of the craft _ the three artists who have been named Living
National Treasures. A tall, angular bowl with deep pockets and a
star-patterned base was created by Shono Shounsai, the first so
honored, in 1967. A satiny black basket of knotted bows is by Izuka
Shokansai (1982), and a basket of thin twigs shaped like
overlapping waves is by Maeda Chikubosai II (1995).
</P>
<P>
   Other artists who were not so recognized fashioned baskets in
equally stunning ways: Izuka Rokansai devised a pocketbook-like
basket from a single sheet of bamboo in the 1930s and Higashi
Takesonosai bent scores of bamboo rods into a glorious rolling wave
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the spirited shaping of Japanese baskets began a
century ago when artists changed the traditional cylindrical,
rectangular and bowl-like forms long popular in Japan, forms that
had originated in ancient China. By exaggerating the asymmetrical
shapes, the robust proportions and the daring scale, the craftsmen
transformed the conventional baskets into ones that were more
Japanese in character.
</P>
<P>
   In one provocative piece in the show, a tiny basket perches like
a hat on top of a tall, skinny Eiffel Tower-like base. This
triumphant work was signed by Izuka Hosai II, a late-19th-century
artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese basket producers are masters at making the complex
look simple,'' Cotsen said. ``You look at a basket and don't see
the understructure of knots that hold the weaving in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotsen takes pleasure in discovering knots and other secrets
artists have hidden in their baskets. On a vivid orange
window-box-like basket, he was puzzled by the base, which is plain
inside but elaborately patterned outside, until he noticed that it
had a false bottom.
</P>
<P>
   More subtle was the basket that looked as supple as a weaving of
satin ribbons but was in fact woven of 300-year-old sooted bamboo
strips, bands so brittle that they had to be softened into a
silkenlike mesh by a painstaking moisturizing process.
</P>
<P>
   It is a basket that Cotsen loves to touch, but other people dare
not, fearing it might crumble. ``I'm interested in how things
feel,'' he said. ``That's part of what attracts me to these
baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   And since no two baskets ever feel the same, he touches every
one _ often. ``After all,'' he said, ``I've spent my life in the
skin business.''

INVESTMENT GROUP BUYS THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER AND STAR MAGAZINE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan investment firm has purchased the company
that owns The National Enquirer and Star magazine and hired the
head of the nation's third-largest magazine publisher to run and
expand it.
</P>
<P>
   The investment group, Evercore Capital Partners LLC, headed by
former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C. Altman, announced on
Tuesday that it had acquired the publications for $294 million from
American Media Inc., and that David J. Pecker, the president and
chief executive officer of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, a unit of
Lagardere Group, would head the company and receive an equity
stake. American Media is a public company whose two biggest
stockholders are the venture capital firm Boston Ventures and
MacFadden Holdings Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker's goal, along with his new partners at Evercore, is to
extend the National Enquirer brand to an array of new ventures that
may include more television programming, new magazines _ such as
Enquirer spinoffs for teen-agers and Hispanic readers _ and online
services. The company owns Country Weekly and The Weekly World
News.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after years of declining circulation for The
Enquirer as Americans have begun to see reporting that might once
have been considered salacious or sensational appear in mainstream
publications.
</P>
<P>
   The National Enquirer has a circulation of 2,300,000, according
to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, down from its 1977 high of 5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The news weekly regularly runs articles about celebrity diets
and hardly an issue goes by without some sort of swipe at Monica
Lewinsky (``Monica's Gay Secret _ Shocking Report From Inside the
White House''), but in a quest to raise sagging circulation, it has
tried to run more legitimate articles. Steve Coz, the editor of The
Enquirer, said Tuesday that he had tried to make the weekly
newspaper more appealing to readers, most recently asking Roseanne
Barr to guest-edit the newest issue. Ms. Barr once guest-edited an
issue of The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction included the assumption of $473 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The venture is not without financial risk. American Media's
total revenue for the nine months ended in December was $222.2
million, of which advertising was $16.9 million, or a relatively
small 7.6 percent. Operating income for those six months was $43.2
million, but the company had $35.6 million in interest expense and
$8.3 million in taxes. The company had net income of $569,000, down
from $6.8 million in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Cheen, an analyst who follows the company for First Union
Capital Markets, said American Media had failed to move
aggressively in the changed news environment. ``They were going to
buy Canadian tabloids, go down to Mexico,'' he said. ``But they
never did anything with the company. So they shouldered the costs
of newsprints without any economy of scale. And the ad economy has
been great, but they didn't participate because advertising is such
a small part of its revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Pecker called The Enquirer and Star ``the two most undermarketed
and underpromoted newspapers in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   In his decade as president of Hachette magazines, Pecker earned
something of a reputation as an enfant terrible with an arduous eye
on the bottom line. He cut editorial staffs, slashed budgets and
offered deep discounts to choice advertisers. He posed for
photographs astride motorcycles or with cigars dangling from his
lips. And during his tenure, he built the magazine publisher into a
competitor in the American marketplace, promoting Elle magazine in
such a way that it has leaped over Harper's Bazaar and now trails
only one women's magazine, Vogue, in both circulation and
advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker began several divisions within Hachette, including
Hachette New Media and Hachette Productions, which produces films
like the Isaac Mizrahi documentary ``Unzipped'' and television
programming. And he attracted a burst of publicity by introducing
George, which is edited by John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase is Evercore's second as a private equity investor _
its first was a company that sells insulation products _ so it is
clear that it could use Pecker's assets as a magazine publisher.
Altman is one of the firm's three founders and continues to be a
partner. He did not return a phone call to his home. Pecker would
not disclose the percentage of his equity stake.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker will leave Hachette on March 31. Following his departure,
the day-to-day operations of Hachette Filipacchi will be overseen
by Daniel Filipachhi, the chairman of Hachette Filipacchi
Magazines. No successor has been announced.

COMPAQ BUYS ZIP2 TO ENHANCE ALTAVISTA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to make its Internet search engine, Altavista, more
competitive with rivals like Yahoo, Lycos and Excite, Compaq
Computer Corp. announced on Tuesday that it had acquired Zip2
Corp., a privately held company that helps newspapers develop city
directory-type Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the all-cash deal were not disclosed, but Rod Schrock,
president and chief executive of Altavista, said Tuesday that $300
million as a ballpark figure was ``a reasonable estimation.'' The
board of Zip2 unanimously approved the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Zip2, based in Mountain View, Calif., will become an operating
unit of Altavista Co., a search engine based in Palo Alto, Calif.,
that Compaq acquired last year in its takeover of Digital Equipment
Corp. Compaq, which is based in Houston, has said it hopes to spin
off Altavista as a separately traded company later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also announced Tuesday that its $220 million offer for
the Internet commerce site Shopping.com had been accepted at $18.25
a share. Compaq stock closed at $42.8125, down 18.75 cents,
Tuesday. Shopping.com closed at 18.3125, up 31.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing both Zip2 and Shopping.com into the Altavista fold,
Schrock said, will help Altavista achieve its goal of becoming a
one-stop online shopping and information destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be one of the top three revenue sites on the Net by
year-end 2002, and to do that, you have to bring the Internet to a
relevant local perspective that's in touch with your everyday
life,'' Schrock said. ``The trick in the online world is to achieve
scale where you get enough audience to view those classifieds and
buy products once users find them.''
</P>
<P>
   The online ratings firm Relevant Knowledge lists Altavista as
ninth of all sites on the World Wide Web in terms of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   While Altavista can attract international traffic from its
parent company, Compaq, the world's largest maker of personal
computers, the deals with Shopping.com and Zip2 let Altavista enter
the commerce and local information arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Zip2 already has partnerships with media companies in 60 of the
100 top metropolitan areas, including New York Times Co., for which
it helped to create the online city guide, New York Today.
</P>
<P>
   While considered among the fastest and most powerful of the
Internet search engines, Altavista has been perceived by analysts
to have lagged behind its competitors in the race to aggregate
content and visitors to one site online. Inroads to local markets
are critically important for search engines, which are typically
broad in scope, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altavista has had a great presence, and it doesn't want to
squander that,'' said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen
Communications, a research firm based in Bethesda, Md. ``It's a
reminder on the heels of whatever becomes of the Lycos-USA Networks
deal that consolidation is the name of the game here. The idea of
merging skills from slightly different sectors is important.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, is the idea of merging the revenue from classified
advertisements, a crucial revenue source for newspapers, with the
growing online medium. The marriage between Zip2 and Altavista may
give Zip2's media partners a wider Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lisa Allen, an analyst for Forrester Research, based in
Cambridge, Mass., was not optimistic about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're late, they're late, they're really late _ no matter
how good they may be,'' Ms. Allen said. ``We've seen or heard
nothing about how these assets will be integrated. It all feels
really squishy. It's like, `We've been a stand-alone company for
three weeks; we have to make a deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zip2's interim chief executive, Derek Proudian, said the deal
with Altavista would enable the company to ``put the pedal to the
metal'' on other products Zip2 had not had the capital to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, in conjunction with our local media partners, have the
platform and content, the raw DNA to become the major traffic site
on the Internet,'' Proudian said.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Zip2 canceled plans to merge with CitySearch, a
competing creator of city guides, a month after an alliance was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate move, Zip2 plans to announce a new software
product on Wednesday at the Editor &AMP; Publisher's Interactive
Newspaper Conference in Atlanta. Proudian said the product, called
Home Base, would be licensed to its media partners and would add
wider personalization tools to its existing online guides.

 &HT;    Time running out to save ancient Miami site
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A Buddhist with a shaved head and flowing white robe
skips barefooted down the street with an armful of leaflets, while
an earnest young New Age researcher slaps duct tape to a bed sheet
banner. Nearby, votive candles flicker in the South Florida
twilight while two Native American holy men beat drums and chant
their prayers to the rising stars.
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere in one of the gleaming glass-and-steel high rises
overlooking this neck of Miami's financial district, a developer
with $100 million at stake must be shaking his head and wondering
what laws of karma have their teeth firmly clenched around his back
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for twin towers filled with luxury shops and apartments on
one of the last open waterfront parcels remaining in Miami's
downtown district have run aground on the discovery of an ancient
Native American ceremonial circle hewn from the limestone rock
underlying the site.
</P>
<P>
   As in the science fiction movie ``Contact,'' in which news of an
intelligent message beamed to Earth from outer space sparks an
outpouring of spiritual froth, the Miami Circle _ as it's come to
be known _ has triggered an international flurry among everyone
from New Age spiritualists
</P>
<P>
   and Internet-browsing shamans
</P>
<P>
   to academics, tourism-minded boosters and fast-talking
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never found anything as profoundly unique as this,''
Miami-Dade County Archaeologist Robert Carr told Miami City
Commissioners at a jam-packed meeting Tuesday. ``This is the only
site known of this type in all of North America.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, dozens of protesters have gathered daily
on a draw bridge overlooking the site, which sits by the mouth of
the Miami River. They hold banners pleading with powers political
and otherworldly to ``Save the Circle,'' sometimes chanting,
praying and singing through a bullhorn, as drivers speeding past
honk and wave.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site, www.MiamiCircle.org, lays out theories on the
site's mysterious makers, while Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has been
swamped with calls and e-mails begging the state to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This didn't happen by coincidence,'' said Christopher Lee, a
Buddhist who has joined the throngs on the bridge. ``Read the
Celestine Prophecy or other New Age books about the Aztecs or the
Mayans or other ancient cultures. The developer may think he owns
this land, but you don't own anything. It's all our planet. We all
own it together, and we need to save this site to learn from the
people who were here first.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ancient circle may not lay undisturbed much longer.
</P>
<P>
   After cooperating with researchers for months, developer Michael
Baumann says he can no longer afford to delay construction. He has
given archaeologists until Feb. 26 to remove the circle or make a
plaster cast of it, saying he'll pay for the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have cooperated and will continue to cooperate,'' said
Vicky Garcia-Toledo, Baumann's attorney. ``But you have to
understand, the developer is ready to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Baumann's ultimatum has rung hollow. A stone mason he
hired who was supposed to begin cutting the circle out of the
ground this week backed out at the last second after speaking with
a Seminole Indian holy man who has set up vigil outside a
chain-link fence surrounding the 2.2-acre plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came to the conclusion that this was not something I
could do in good conscience,'' mason Joshua Billig said. ``I didn't
realize how important this is to so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas wants to save the circle,
and has barraged state and federal officials with calls trying to
come up with money to buy out Baumann. So far, he has no firm money
in hand.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Penelas appealed to the Miami City Commission for a
solid commitment to preserving the circle, which lies within
Miami's city limits.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami's commissioners passed only a lukewarm resolution
urging Baumann to save the site. The city, just emerging from a
long financial nightmare that saw it teetering on the verge of
bankruptcy, has no money to buy the land. Officials also fear
making any statements that might discourage Baumann's financial
backers, which could lead to a lawsuit against the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City of Miami is not going to be the fall guy and end up
paying $40 million to $50 million or even $60 million,'' Miami
Mayor Joe Carollo said Tuesday. ``That would mean the end of us as
an entity.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Feb. 26 deadline looms.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe the site may have been used by Native
Americans as long ago as 2,000 years, but date the circle to only
about 800 years ago. They believe it was built by the Tequesta
Indians, who inhabited a village near the river mouth in the 1500s
when Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon explored Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The site was actually covered for the past 50 years by an
apartment building, which was knocked down last summer to make way
for Baumann's development, to be called Brickell Pointe. A surveyor
spotted some relics and called in Carr, who, with Baumann's
permission, took a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   So far he has found some 200 holes that form a perfect circle 38
feet in diameter, perhaps dug to hold up poles on some type of
ceremonial lodge. He also found two stone axes, however, which are
made from rock not native to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That discovery_plus the fact that another line of holes outside
the circle lines up with seasonal movements of the sun_has prompted
speculation that the site was built by Mayans, the Indian people
who constructed massive, astronomically-aligned temples in Mexico
and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its origins, the circle has prompted an outpouring of
interest from around the world. School children have come by the
bus load, along with New Age devotees, amateur historians and
top-ranking archaeologists from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some preservationists hope that the discovery of four human
teeth might delay development, since a state law bans building on
burial sites. But state officials say there must be harder proof
than just a few teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Baumann has all the permits he needs to build, and unless the
county quickly raises millions to buy him out or finds some grounds
to ask a court to stop the project, construction may go forward.
</P>
<P>
   That would devastate the rainbow array of activists holding
vigil near the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paving covers up so much,'' said Alan Muskat, who lectures on
ancient cultures. ``There's so much disconnection. Now is our
chance to reestablish the connection. If we can preserve this, it
shows there is hope. If we can do it here, we can do it anywhere.''

<P>
   ROME _ Enraged by the capture of the foremost Kurdish rebel
leader, protesters stormed diplomatic posts throughout Europe on
Tuesday, taking hostages and setting fires _ and in some cities,
even setting themselves on fire.
</P>
<P>
   With what seemed like extraordinary coordination, Kurds in
Paris, Moscow, London, Frankfurt, Milan, Bern and more than a dozen
other cities as far away as Sydney went on rampages of rage and
protest over the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish
Workers Party. Although there was no clear evidence that the
protests were orchestrated, Kurds held rallies, seized consulates,
battled police and threatened mass suicides.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, many hundreds of Kurds had been arrested,
and most of the almost two dozen hostages had been released. At
least three Kurds in European cities had set themselves on fire,
including a 17-year-old girl in Germany, who like the others was
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds in Europe did not focus their anger on Turkey, which
captured Ocalan in Nairobi, Kenya, late on Monday. Instead, they
turned their rage on Greece, which at least for a while had
provided him shelter, and on Kenya _ the two countries they
believed betrayed him in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, apparently had been
providing Ocalan with a place to hide after he was forced to leave
Italy last month. Government officials in both Athens and Nairobi
nervously denied being the ones who actually turned Ocalan over to
Turkish security forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Istanbul, Turkey, about 1,000 Kurds marched through a Kurdish
neighborhood, setting cars on fire. But there were also
demonstrations of joy in Turkey by other Turks, who view Ocalan as
a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 20 million Kurds in Turkey and nearby
countries, who have long suffered persecution by successive
governments of countries in which they live. Ocalan has led a
14-year often-violent guerrilla movement for Kurdish self-rule and
civil rights in Turkey, which has been met with violent repression
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Athens were relatively quiet on Tuesday, perhaps
because Greek police rounded up more than 350 Kurds preemptively
early in the morning and held them in an abandoned army camp. In
the evening, under tight security, a rally of Greeks and Kurds in
support of Ocalan took place in downtown Athens without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Europe had no such early warning, though. Nations that had
sought to avoid getting drawn into the dispute between Kurdish
separatists and the Turkish government, fearing a backlash of
violence in their own countries, were engulfed by the crisis
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, Kurdish protesters took the Greek ambassador to
Austria and his wife hostage in their embassy, while others set
fire to the Kenyan Embassy there.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, where Ocalan had hoped to go after leaving
Kenya, by some reports, about 150 Kurds stormed the Greek
ambassador's residence in the Hague about 5 a.m. and took three
hostages, including the ambassador's wife and their 8-year-old son.
[They were released early Wednesday, Reuters reported. Riot
policemen had tried earlier to force their way into the building,
unsuccessfully.)
</P>
<P>
   In Bonn, Germany, protesters took two hostages at the Kenyan
Embassy and another at the Greek Embassy. In Leipzig, protesters
took three people hostage at the Greek consulate but later released
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These attacks weren't really organized,'' said Mehmet Atac, a
28-year-old Kurd who was among several hundred who stood vigil
outside the Greek consulate in Frankfurt this afternoon after Kurds
occupied it. ``We heard news reports that Ocalan had been arrested,
and we all started calling each other to see what we should do. It
was one person talking to another and to another.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also less forceful, but equally fervent, marches by
chanting demonstrators outside United Nations buildings in Geneva
and other European cities and at the gates of the Council of Europe
headquarters in Strasbourg, France.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, a spokesman a group that calls itself the
Kurdish Parliament in exile issued a statement asking demonstrators
in Europe to desist. Some did.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters in Moscow walked out of the Greek Embassy at midday
and surrendered to Russian police. Fourteen men and two women who
occupied the Kenyan Embassy in Paris for more than three hours,
threatening to immolate themselves and their hostages, surrendered
quietly to the Paris police. And by evening, French police had
liberated all occupied consulates and embassies in their nation.
But in other places, many others said they would not give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stay here until we get some answers from the Greek
authorities,'' one of the Kurds occupying the Greek Embassy in
London told a British radio station. ``We are not representing
anyone, but I can tell you that we have support'' from the
Kurdistan Workers Party, Ocalan's group.
</P>
<P>
   Police surrounded that embassy after an estimated 50 Kurdish
protesters broke into the building about 2:30 a.m. and held a
custodian hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, as many as 600 demonstrators held back by steel
barricades fought briefly with police, who used dogs and truncheons
to quell the violence. One Kurdish woman set herself on fire and
was badly injured before a police officer could put out the flames
with a fire extinguisher.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the Kurds inside the embassy, who gave his name only
as Ofter, told reporters by telephone: ``We are completely
committed. We will do anything if we are made to leave. The
protesters inside are ready to burn themselves or throw themselves
out of the windows if the police try to break in. We will stay here
for as long as it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which had refused to issue an extradition order for
Ocalan last November because officials feared it would provoke the
very kind of violence that sprang up on Tuesday, was not spared
despite all its caution. About 500,000 Kurds live in Germany,
including 10,000 in Frankfurt. Police and demonstrators battled in
nine German cities, from Leipzig to Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Schily, the German interior minister, pleaded with the
Kurds to leave the various consulates peacefully. Police in
Frankfurt used truncheons and water cannons to subdue Kurds who
were turning over cars. Between 100 and 200 demonstrators were
arrested there after clashes with police this morning, and hundreds
more were arrested in Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the '60s-era French student radical who is
now a representative of the Green Party in the European Parliament,
arrived in Frankfurt late Tuesday afternoon to act as a mediator.
Police had cordoned off the street where the Greek consulate is
situated and surrounded the building with trucks, video cameras and
even water cannons. But they also allowed more than a hundred
Kurdish demonstrators to remain in front of the occupied building
and to sing protest songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, a 17-year-old Kurdish girl
set herself on fire and was taken to the hospital with severe
burns.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder sought on Tuesday to distance
Germany from the Ocalan affair. ``This is a matter that only
affects the countries involved _ those that extradited him and
Turkey,'' he said. ``The German government is not dealing with this
matter.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   For months, Ocalan had appealed to European countries for
political asylum or an international trial that would allow him to
avoid being deported to Turkey, where he could face the death
penalty. Turkey applied intense pressure, and Syria, Russia and
finally Italy expelled him. Ocalan was unable to find harbor
elsewhere in Europe and ended up in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 million Kurds live in Turkey, most in the poor
southeastern region. Kurds share a common language, related to
Persian, and many are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Kurds were promised a homeland in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres,
which carved up Turkey after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, fought to
regain the land, destroying plans for a Kurdish state. There have
been numerous Kurdish revolts since.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, Kurds are not recognized as a minority. Recognized
minorities have the right to teach in their respective languages. A
ban imposed by Turkey's last military government on the use of
Kurdish in unofficial settings was lifted in 1991, but Kurdish is
illegal in broadcasts and in educational or political settings. A
court case to ban Turkey's main pro-Kurdish party is under way.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as 30 protesters surrendered four hours after
storming the Greek consulate in Milan, Italy, and holding six
people hostage, including the consul, the Italian government
implored Turkey to give Ocalan a fair trial. Italy had refused to
extradite him to Turkey last November, citing a law that bans Italy
from extraditing prisoners to countries that use capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Veltroni, leader of the largest party in Italy's
center-left government, warned Turkey on Tuesday not to apply the
death penalty, saying, ``That would place Turkey irretrievably
outside Europe.''

EDITORIAL: DOUBTS ABOUT TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 17: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardiest perennials of modern American politics is
back. We speak of the new predictions that Republican moderates
will any moment now seize control of their party. As in the past,
these moderates, mostly from the Northeast and Midwest, complain
that the conservative stranglehold on the party threatens its
chances in the next election. Many urge Republicans to forget about
culture wars and return to the genial tax-cutting conservatism of
Ronald Reagan. The advice is attractive, but its fiscal logic may
be outdated. Grassroots feedback suggests that the GOP needs to
re-examine its worship of sweeping tax cuts like that being
promoted this week by the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, Republicans are suffering from their own past
success. President Clinton speaks the words of compassion, but his
domestic program is the essence of conservatism. How else to
describe spending three-quarters of the 15-year surplus of $4
trillion to pay down the national debt and  &UR; conserve &LR;  Social
Security and Medicare? Republican theorists and their supporters in
Congress may think they have a better way, perhaps even a more
elegant intellectual way, of restructuring both of these solid old
programs. But the public appears to be in no mood to transform them
radically along the lines suggested by the Cato Institute and the
Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of Republican moderates last weekend in Miami, two
Northeastern governors had some scathing words for their
colleagues, especially those who made the demonization of Clinton a
centerpiece of the party's message. Christie Whitman of New Jersey
said Americans perceived the party as ``mean-spirited'' and
``vindictive,'' while John Rowland of Connecticut said: ``I will
report to you that the good news is that the rich people and the
business people still like us. But that's about it.'' Yet at a
citizens' meeting in a pro-Reagan suburb of Detroit, Lott once
again pushed for an across-the-board tax cut that would
overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest 10 percent of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion has moved since President Reagan carried the area
in 1980 and 1984. The polls show that Americans are not clamoring
about high taxes right now, in part because those who are paying
higher taxes are doing so as a result of their income having grown
substantially in the current boom. Perhaps more important,
priorities have shifted, and voters have redefined fiscal prudence.
Even Alan Greenspan has urged Congress to pay down the national
debt rather than pass the money out in tax cuts. Unlike the late
1970s, when Reagan and the congressional Republicans embraced tax
cuts as a cure-all, there is little need to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Some moderate Republicans have already rejected the
across-the-board tax cuts advocated by Lott, pushing instead for
targeted tax breaks for married couples and perhaps a cut in the
estate tax. If more join them, there might be a chance of a
bipartisan tax-cut deal with the White House, which wants its own
limited tax breaks for school construction, long-term health care
and care of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican margin so slight in the House, and many
independent-minded Senate Republicans joining in the desire for
paying down debt, the across-the-board tax cut is in deep political
trouble only a few weeks after it was proclaimed as the salvation
in the post-impeachment era. Republicans are also saying they want
to spend more money on defense and education in the next few years.
These trends could mute the tax-cut battle cry in the next year and
give moderates a chance to promote a more nuanced fiscal policy for
the GOP.

DELTA TO BUY REST OF STAKE IN ATLANTIC
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Texas, Southeast)  (nk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines announced Tuesday that it would pay $700 million
to acquire the part of Atlantic Southeast Airlines that it does not
already own in a deal with the potential for labor problems similar
to those that recently disrupted American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, which owns 28 percent of the regional carrier, will pay
$34 each for the rest of the shares of ASA Holdings Inc., the
parent of Atlantic Southeast, and make ASA a wholly owned
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is intended to protect Delta's grip on Texas and the
Southeast. Analysts, however, say that with contract talks between
Delta and its pilots' union scheduled for this fall, the large gap
in salaries between Delta pilots and those at Atlantic Southeast is
certain to become a contentious bargaining issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as this deal doesn't run into labor headwinds, it
makes sense,'' said James Higgins, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette. ``But Delta may be underestimating the potential labor
issues here, which are really an extension of the same problems as
at American. You've got to wonder, in light of what's happened in
the industry, whether this issue will come back to bite them.''
</P>
<P>
   The operations of American Airlines, the nation's second-largest
carrier, were severely disrupted for a week in a dispute over
pilots' salaries related to American's acquisition of Reno Air
Inc., a regional carrier in the West where pilots make
significantly less than those at American. American's pilots
returned to work Tuesday in greater numbers under a court order
after staging a sickout.
</P>
<P>
   At Delta, a captain of a Boeing 737, a fleet mainstay with about
110 seats, can be paid up to $135,000 a year. At regional airlines,
which have 50- to 70-seat jets that serve similar distances and
cities as a 737, pilots are paid $70,000 to $75,000 a year. Pilots
in general see the lower salaries of regional jet pilots as a
threat to their wages. And this wage dispute has only grown as big
carriers like Delta, the nation's third largest, and American are
buying regional carriers rather than taking stakes and keeping an
arm's-length arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal has very serious labor implications,'' said Julius
Maldutis, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer. ``The airline and the
pilots have already started labor discussions, and this will become
a contentious issue in the upcoming negotiations with pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ASA and Delta are based in Atlanta, and the deal is
intended to protect Delta's grip on its main market, the Southeast
and Texas. ASA will bring passengers from smaller cities to Delta's
hubs in Atlanta and Dallas, blocking other carriers from making
inroads into that territory.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is also a departure for Delta, which typically takes
only equity stakes in regional carriers and does not buy them
outright, as do American, Northwest and Continental. Right now,
Delta has stakes in six regional airlines, including Comair
Holdings Inc. in the Midwest and Skywest Airlines Inc. in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta cannot afford to have other airlines take passengers
around Atlanta,'' said Thomas Longman, an analyst with Arnhold &AMP; S.
Bleichroeder. ``And if Delta controls ASA, it will enable ASA to
get up to a level of jet service that Delta wants much quicker.
This gives Delta much more leverage with its pilots. The pilots may
not like the deal, but it will catch their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Delta fell 6.25 cents Tuesday, to $52.50, while ASA
rose $1.8125, to $33.75. The tender offer for ASA's shares begins
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Leo F. Mullin, Delta's chief executive, said Delta planned to
expand the number of ASA's jets, which make up 20 percent of its
fleet. ``Plans call for that number to grow substantially in the
coming years,'' Mullin said. ``Regional jets represent a strategic
opportunity for ASA.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of regional jet fleets, which are replacing
propeller airplanes, is shaking up the airline industry by
providing customers with option of bypassing many hub cities and
giving hub-based carriers, like Delta, the opportunity to draw
customers from greater distances.

EDITORIAL: THE CAPTURE OF A KURDISH REBEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Feb. 17: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The deadly guerrilla war between Turkey and Kurdish separatists
seemed a lot less distant to many Europeans Tuesday as Kurdish
immigrants, enraged by Turkey's abduction of a violent Kurdish
rebel leader, stormed Greek and Kenyan diplomatic posts in nearly a
score of European cities. They believed, probably mistakenly, that
Greece and Kenya had cooperated with Turkish commandos who seized
Abdullah Ocalan in Nairobi, Kenya. The unruly demonstrations, which
seemed to be coordinated, were an unpardonable attack against civil
order across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 14 years from the safety of exile, Ocalan has
directed a brutal armed campaign for Kurdish separatism in eastern
Turkey. His guerrilla fighters are allegedly responsible for 30,000
deaths, including those of many civilians. In response to this
uprising, Turkey has intensified its own repression and violence
against its 8 to 10 million Kurdish citizens, sending its army
against defenseless Kurdish villages and creating hundreds of
thousands of refugees. Those who dared to defend Kurdish causes in
print in Turkey, or questioned the army's brutality, were subjected
to long imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's capture and trial should be used to help diminish this
terrible conflict, not inflame it. Turkey's treatment of its
Kurdish minority has undercut its democracy and damaged its
international standing. Kurdish violence and terror, including the
violence of Ocalan supporters now living in Europe, have provided
excuses for Turkey's actions. Kurdish terrorism has obscured the
legitimate grievances suffered by millions of nonviolent Kurds who
have suffered systematic discrimination and been subjected to
Turkish attempts to suppress Kurdish language and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides now need to behave more constructively and
responsibly. Turkey must explain more fully the circumstances of
Ocalan's abduction and assure that his detention and trial meet
international standards of fairness. Ankara has not always met such
standards in the past. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, a lifelong
human rights advocate, now has an opportunity to put his beliefs
into practice. Turkey should also use the occasion of Ocalan's
arrest to rein in its counterinsurgency campaign in Kurdish areas
and move toward a conciliatory and peaceful solution of the long
conflict. The Kurds, including Ocalan's followers in Europe, must
do their part by turning decisively away from violence, both in
Turkey and abroad.

GRAND JURY BEGINS WEIGHING DIALLO SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As another protest over the police shooting of Amadou
Diallo ended on a tense note Tuesday afternoon, a Bronx grand jury
began hearing evidence in the case in order to consider possible
criminal charges against the four officers involved.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is expected to take about three weeks to hear
witnesses and to decide whether to indict the officers, said Steven
R. Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney, Robert T.
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charge that the officers are considered likely
to face is second-degree murder, but they also could be indicted on
the lesser charges of manslaughter or criminally negligent
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Grand jury proceedings are secret, but the panel of 23 jurors is
expected to hear from medical and forensic experts and neighbors or
other witnesses who saw some part of the events of that night.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury will not compel the four officers _ Sean Carroll,
Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss _ to testify. The
lawyers for Carroll, Murphy and Boss would not comment Tuesday on
whether their clients would volunteer to testify. Stephen Worth,
the lawyer for McMellon, said his client intended to do so, but
that could change.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with the case said that for a grand jury to
conclude that Diallo's killing was justified, the officers
themselves would most likely have to present the justification _
that they thought he had a gun and that any reasonable person would
have drawn that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But if the officers believe that they will be indicted anyway,
they are unlikely to appear voluntarily before the grand jury,
because any statements they make could be used against them in a
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury convened in the criminal court building, a block
from the state supreme courthouse, where earlier in the day
hundreds of people showed up to call for criminal charges against
the officers.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was led by the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, who announced a
daily vigil in front of the courthouse, saying, ``We're going to be
here every day at 11; we're going to carry this through to the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied by the Rev. Ruben Diaz of the New York
Hispanic Clergy Organization, his son, Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr.,
and other politicians and religious leaders. Most of those who
attended the rally, chanting ``No justice, no peace,'' were black
men.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1 p.m., the speakers left the courthouse steps and cut
off the sound system. But rather than dispersing, a small part of
the crowd marched toward the criminal courthouse, trailed by
officers who appeared to have been taken by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 protesters and hundreds of officers faced off across
the street from the criminal courthouse and in front of the
building where Johnson's office is. Police reinforcements continued
to arrive and set up barricades between the two groups.
``Murderers, murderers,'' the crowd chanted.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters then moved west, engaging in another standoff
with the police at the corner of 161st Street and River Avenue.
``Stop the killing,'' they yelled.
</P>
<P>
   Officers stood by, but the crowd slowly dispersed with no
arrests.

ELECTRONICS COMPANIES IN PACT ON DIGITAL WATERMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five giants in the computer and consumer electronics industries
announced an agreement Tuesday on a ``watermark'' standard for
protecting digital movies and videos from unauthorized copying.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reconciles two competing standards _ one supported
by IBM and NEC Corp., the other supported by Hitachi Ltd., Pioneer
Electronic Corp. and Sony Corp. The agreement among the five
companies promises to remove the last major obstacle preventing
manufacturers from bringing digital video recording devices to the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, which call themselves the Galaxy group, said they
expected the first significant application of digital watermarks to
be in DVD _ digital videodisk _ systems. The new technology is also
expected to be used to protect video distributed electronically by
digital broadcasts and networks.
</P>
<P>
   An invisible, indelible bit of binary code, known as a
watermark, will be embedded in every frame of a digital recording.
The companies said it would be able to survive compression and
decompression (packing data tightly for fast delivery, then
unpacking it when it arrives) and conversion of any kind of digital
video to any other digital format.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sullivan, the IBM vice president who oversees Asia-Pacific
technical operations, said Tuesday that the technologies agreed
upon had already been proved effective. While the protection is
strong enough to prevent illegal copying, he said, a consumer who
recorded digital material eight hours a day would get a false
positive _ that is, be prevented from making a legitimate copy _
only once in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The base technology is ready today,'' Sullivan said. ``The
implementation cycle will be based on motion picture studios
acquiring the equipment and marking their works and on the time
needed for consumer electronics manufacturers to design the
watermark detectors into their machines. Realistically, we think
the market will open in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the watermarking would allow unlimited analog
copies to be made on existing VCRs. But he said the watermark was
so deeply embedded in the protected content that a digital
recording device, like a DVD recorder, would even refuse to make a
digital copy of an analog copy of the original video.
</P>
<P>
   The concern with digital copies is that they are virtually
perfect clones of originals, enabling unlimited copying without
protective technologies in place. Analog copies, in contrast,
deteriorate rapidly over each generation. &QL;

 &HT;    Tabloids to be sold
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANTANA, Fla. _ Ending a bumpy run as a stockholder-owned
company, the publisher of the National Enquirer and the Star
tabloids said Tuesday it will sell the company for $767 million to
Evercore Capital Partners, a group of New York investors that will
take it private.
</P>
<P>
   Evercore will pay $300 million in cash and assume nearly $470
million in debt in its deal for Lantana-based American Media, the
owner of the weekly supermarket tabloids. Holders of American Media
Class A and C stock will get $7 a share in the deal. The company's
stock closed Tuesday at $6.56, up 38 cents a share77.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner _ an investment firm headed by former U.S. Deputy
Treasury Secretary Roger Altman _ has no plans to move the
Enquirer's and Weekly World News' operation from Lantana _ or the
Star's from Tarrytown, N.Y., Enquirer Editor Steve Coz said.
American Media employs about 200 people in Lantana.
</P>
<P>
   Highly regarded magazine publisher David J. Pecker will become
chairman and chief executive officer of American Media, which will
keep its name, and get an equity stake in the company. To take the
job, Pecker, who has a home in Palm Beach, resigned as chief
executive officer of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines in New York,
whose titles include Elle and John F. Kennedy Jr.'s George .
</P>
<P>
   Pecker doubled Hachette's sales in his seven years there,
according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a demonstrated, proven value builder,'' said Austin
Beutner, principal and founder of Evercore.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close in two to three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fantastic for the Enquirer,'' Coz said. ``These guys
are top-drawer experts of multimedia. They bring to the Enquirer
multimedia vision _ and a boatload of cash to expand and turn it
into a launching pad for ventures for the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer and Star have evolved over the years into celebrity
and entertainment coverage, leaving behind the aliens and the
supernatural _ or at least leaving them to their wacky sibling, the
Weekly World News.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the editorial shift to the People-like mainstream, the
circulation of the tabloids has been slipping. The Enquirer dropped
to 2.24 million copies at the end of last year from 2.72 million in
June 1997. The Star's circulation fell to 1.82 million from 2.22
million during the same time.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in 1977, the Enquirer sold 5 million copies a week.
The Star topped out at 3.6 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Profit has been heading in the same direction. The company
reported a profit of $569,000 for the first nine months of fiscal
1998, compared to $6.8 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner plans a $50 million advertising campaign to
promote the publications, Beutner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's an opportunity to take the brands to another
level, `` said Beutner, suggesting an Enquirer for teens and one in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The company could expand by starting new publications, buying
turnaround candidates and even buying established titles, Beutner
said. The company hopes to lure readers to television and Internet
offerings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exiting the limelight of public trading and the demands of
shareholders will eliminate a distraction as the new owners attempt
to build American Media.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock price (NYSE: ENQ) closed at $6.56 a share
Tuesday. It hit a low of $2.88 in May 1996 after reaching a lofty
$21.38 less than a year after going public in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A special shareholder dividend of $7 a share _ part of a
settlement with shareholders after the company tried to go private
in 1994 _ has been blamed for some of the stock's problems. The
dividend meant a $292 million payout.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Going private) changes the focus of your management,'' said
Beutner, who has a home on Jupiter Island. ``We're trying to build
value five years from now. We're less concerned with this
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Beutner's first involvement with American Media. A
decade ago, he handled the sale of the company as a partner in the
Blackstone Group after the 1988 death of then-owner Generoso Pope
Jr. of Manalapan. Pecker's actions have attracted the publishing
world's attention over the years. He once killed an article set to
run in Premiere magazine that included information about actor
Sylvester Stallone's business role in the Planet Hollywood
restaurant chain. Premiere co-owner Ron Perelman, a part-time Palm
Beach resident, then was a co-owner of the magazine and reportedly
was planning a deal with Planet Hollywood at the time. The
magazine's top editors resigned after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   American Media Chairman Peter Callahan, who came to the company
with Boston Partners, won't continue with the new company, Coz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders will receive $7 for each Class A and Class C share
they own, a 26.1 percent premium on the average closing price in
the past 15 trading days, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, subject to shareholder approval, is expected to close
in two or three months. Boston Ventures affiliates and company
executives own 51.1 percent of the total shares outstanding and
control 75.5 percent of the voting rights of American Media.
They've agreed to vote in favor of the deal and have given Evercore
an option to buy their shares.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, American Media, which also publishes Country
Weekly , said it was selling its money-losing Soap Opera News and
Soap Opera Magazine to Primedia of New York, the publisher of
competitor Soap Opera Digest, for $10 million.
</P>

Beach, Fla. Palm Beach Post wire services and staff researcher

   LOS ANGELES _.MDBU/ The .MDBU/Mavericks'.MDNM/ season is seven
games old, .MDBU/and.MDNM/ the.MDBU/y.MDNM/ are already stumbling
into a familiar hole. &QL; 
.MDNM/ Some touted this as a playoff team two weeks ago. So far,
though, this year's model looks surprising like the Mavericks who
have been in the NBA draft lottery each of the past eight seasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A young .MDBU/Mavericks .MDNM/team with four new players has
been hurt by a lockout-shortened training camp and a schedule that
has included Utah, Houston and Seattle, which .MDBU/were .MDNM/a
combined 15-1 heading into Tuesday's games. The Mavericks are 1-6
and tied with Denver for the second-worst record in the NBA. And
they trailed the Nuggets by 15 points at halftime of their loss in
Denver. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coach/general manager Don Nelson has watched his team basically
play only one half of productive basketball every game, or have a
few players shine while others struggle. The total picture has been
devastating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a game this year where we've hit on all of our
cylinders,'' Nelson said. ``There's always somebody who's not
playing well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait until we start playing some games where
everybody's hitting and playing in the 90th percentile of their
game, because I still think we can be pretty good.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have played five of their first seven on the road,
and the two home games were against Utah and Houston. But the
schedule doesn't get any easier with tonight's 9:30 game a.MDBU/t
the Los Angeles.MDNM/ Lakers and three more games left on a
seven-game, 11-day road trip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible schedule for us, and we've somehow got to
figure out how to become better in a really tough situation,''
center Shawn Bradley said. ``The lockout really, really hurt teams
like us that are trying to get better.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has not been able to unlock his game so far this season.
His scoring is down from 11.4 points per game last season to 5.6
and his rebounds have dropped from 8.1 to 5.9 per game. Starting
guard Michael Finley has also struggled; his scoring has dropped
from 21.5 points per game last season to 17.0 this season and he's
shooting 38.9 percent from the field.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Steve Nash hasn't found his shooting touch, hitting
33.8 percent of his attempts, though he is averaging 6.3 assists
per game. The up-and-down play of rookie Dirk Nowitzki has led
Nelson to running a revolving door at forward that has included
A.C. Green, Samaki Walker, Gary Trent and .MDBU/John .MDNM/``Hot
Rod'' Williams playing significant minutes at different times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Mavericks are shooting .MDBU/only
.MDNM/40.MDBU/..MDNM/8 .MDBU/percent .MDNM/from the field and are
being outscored, 25-21, in the first quarter. The Mavericks are
scoring 90.3 points per game and allowing 97.3. They also are being
outrebounded, 47.7 to 43.3 per game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nash said the Mavericks need some practice time to work out
their problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for coach .MDBU/\R.MDNM/Nelson.MDBU/\S.MDNM/
because he's out there calling plays and he doesn't have a lot of
time to correct the mistakes that we're making on the practice
floor,'' he said. ``He can draw them on the chalkboard, but we
don't get a chance to really run through them and try to practice
on the offense because of the short season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two weeks of practice before we saw what was going to
happen in the games, and then it's like wildfire. It's difficult
when you're a young team, because we're still trying to learn,
we're inexperienced and we're new to each other.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked what can be done to .MDBU/overcome the 1-6 start.MDNM/,
Finley said: ``Go 6-0. We just have to take it one game at a time,
but at the same time we just have to keep our heads and stay as
focused as we can, despite the 1-6 record.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he can't be concerned about the slow start. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to develop a young team here, so whatever happens
in that regard happens,'' he said. ``I don't like losing any more
than anybody else. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But one of the things we had talked about was finding
ourselves on this road trip, and some of us are.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Ceballos, who averages 12.9 points per game off the
bench, tried to take blame for the Mavericks' malady. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bench's fault.MDBU/,.MDNM/ and I take full blame
because I'm supposed to bring that energy and help us contribute,''
he said. ``I don't know what it is. But we need to find it out so
we won't get too far deep in the hole.'' &QL;

His scoring is down from 11.4 points per game last season to 5.6
and his rebounds have dropped from 8.1 to 5.9 per game. Starting
guard Michael Finley has also struggled; his scoring has dropped
from 21.5 points per game last season to 17.0 this season and he's
shooting 38.9 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Steve Nash hasn't found his shooting touch, hitting
33.8 percent of his attempts, though he is averaging 6.3 assists
per game. The up-and-down play of rookie Dirk Nowitzki has led
Nelson to running a revolving door at forward that has included
A.C. Green, Samaki Walker, Gary Trent and John ``Hot Rod'' Williams
playing significant minutes at different times.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Mavericks are shooting only 40.8 percent from the
field and are being outscored, 25-21, in the first quarter. The
Mavericks are scoring 90.3 points per game and allowing 97.3. They
also are being outrebounded, 47.7 to 43.3 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Nash said the Mavericks need some practice time to work out
their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for coach \RNelson\S because he's out there calling
plays and he doesn't have a lot of time to correct the mistakes
that we're making on the practice floor,'' he said. ``He can draw
them on the chalkboard, but we don't get a chance to really run
through them and try to practice on the offense because of the
short season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two weeks of practice before we saw what was going to
happen in the games, and then it's like wildfire. It's difficult
when you're a young team, because we're still trying to learn,
we're inexperienced and we're new to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what can be done to overcome the 1-6 start, Finley said:
``Go 6-0. We just have to take it one game at a time, but at the
same time we just have to keep our heads and stay as focused as we
can, despite the 1-6 record.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he can't be concerned about the slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to develop a young team here, so whatever happens
in that regard happens,'' he said. ``I don't like losing any more
than anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one of the things we had talked about was finding
ourselves on this road trip, and some of us are.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Ceballos, who averages 12.9 points per game off the
bench, tried to take blame for the Mavericks' malady.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bench's fault, and I take full blame because I'm
supposed to bring that energy and help us contribute,'' he said.
``I don't know what it is. But we need to find it out so we won't
get too far deep in the hole.'' /

EVEN INJURED, TEXAS TECH'S YOUNG IS A BIG-GAME THREAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you had your television tuned to any of the sports roundup
shows over the weekend, you saw a clip of Texas Tech guard Rayford
Young.
</P>
<P>
   Young's career-high 41 points in the Red Raiders' upset of
Kansas was highlight news on all the networks. And the clip you saw
was of one of Young's trademark moves from the past. He drives to
the hoop, reverses back outside the 3-point line, turns and jacks
it. Swish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been one of my favorite moves my whole life,'' the Pampa
junior recalled. ``But with me being as limited as I have been most
of the season, I haven't been able to do it much. In a big game
like that was, though, when the score is close, you've got to go to
your strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   That particular shot against the Jayhawks, incidentally, gave
the Raiders a 70-69 lead with 4:20 to play. They would not trail
again on the way to a 90-84 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Young's injury _ a combination of a bad sprain and bone bruise
above his left ankle suffered in practice Dec. 16 _ continues to
limit the Raiders' explosive point guard despite his sometimes
sensational scoring bursts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always pretty swollen after games,'' Young said. ``But
the intensity is so high during games that I really can't feel
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't rob him of some of the explosive quickness that
remains one of his best assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that helps make him the player he is are his
wheels,'' Tech coach James Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having a hard time with his trademark move, Young
also has lost that quicker-than-you-are first step that allowed him
to frequently blow past a defender on his way into the heart of the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been harder to do that because it's so hard to push
off,'' Young said. ``And a lot of the time when I go to the basket,
instead of going off one foot, I have to jump-stop and try to go
off two. And that gives the defensive player that much more time to
catch up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   We discuss Young's problems with the ankle _ which will heal
only with extended rest _ only to elevate Saturday's
accomplishments. Thirty-two points in the final 8:56, including
18-for-18 at the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little painful for me to recall, but Rayford Young was
sensational,'' Kansas coach Roy Williams said. ``As good a
performance for 10 or 12 minutes there as I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey likewise could not remember witnessing such an individual
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best I've ever seen by an individual player in a game of
that magnitude,'' Dickey said. ``He was on fire offensively. He put
us on his shoulders and carried us.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Rick Barnes, whose conference-leading Longhorns
catch Young's act tonight in Austin's Erwin Center, can recall only
one other such performance _ when Eric Murdock scored 45 at Arizona
for his Providence team in December 1990. That still ranks as the
top performance by a collegiate player in the McKale Center.
</P>
<P>
   But after watching Young score 21 against his team last month,
Barnes didn't need to watch tapes of Tech against Kansas to
convince him that Young is a quality player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up to Rayford after our game and told him he was one of
the best guards in the Big 12,'' Barnes said. ``I still believe
that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's only been back in Tech's starting lineup for
eight games after missing five, Young's 16.3-point Big 12-scoring
average among guards trails only that of Oklahoma State's Adrian
Peterson (17.5). Young also averages almost four assists a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say who is the best player in the league,''
Dickey said. ``But I believe Rayford is as good as any point guard
in the league when he's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not bad now.

`DANCE IN AMERICA': AILEY THE STYLE, AILEY THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its long and solid history of creating dance experiences for
television, the ``Great Performances: Dance in America'' series has
achieved a high point with ``A Hymn for Alvin Ailey.'' Filmmaker
Orlando Bagwell uses Judith Jamison's ``Hymn'' as a departure point
for an even larger look at Ailey, his work, his dancers and what
they have meant to audiences around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jamison's 1993 dance took interviews with Ailey dancers,
sensitively conducted and edited by playwright and performance
artist Anna Deavere Smith, and put them together with a driving
musical score by Robert Ruggieri. Ms. Jamison's choreography is a
fusion of African, jazz and modern-dance styles informed by the
dancers' ballet training.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged from ``Hymn'' was an evocation of Ailey and his
dancers and how they interacted to create classics of American
modern dance like ``Revelations'' and ``Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Hymn for Alvin Ailey'' also includes scenes of Ailey as a
young dancer and of Ms. Jamison in ``Cry,'' as well as interviews
with Ailey over the years and a glimpse of his being celebrated at
the Kennedy Center Honors performance in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a haunting art-film clip of Ailey in a subway
station along with views of the memorial service held for Ailey,
who died in 1989, at New York's Cathedral of St. John the Divine,
where the program opens.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, a producer for the PBS series ``Eyes on the Prize,''
adds material from interviews conducted with longtime Ailey
colleagues, among them a poetic Carmen de Lavallade and a sharply
analytical George Faison. Jack Mitchell recalls photographing Ailey
over the years. Sylvia Waters, the director of the Ailey junior
troupe, talks about Ailey the man with perceptive warmth, and
Masazumi Chaya, the associate artistic director of the senior
company, speaks about the choreographer and his work with poignant,
eloquent simplicity. Ms. Jamison and Ms. Smith are the connecting
threads through the program, as they are in ``Hymn'' itself.
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully photographed and edited, by Michael Chin and Jean
Tsien respectively, ``A Hymn for Alvin Ailey'' offers a record of
powerful dancing. It is very likely to serve as a compelling primer
for people new to Ailey's work as well as material for thought for
those familiar with it.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to see the Ailey style close up and held nearly
still in time, for example, in the rooted bodies of the opening
moments of ``Hymn.'' And the style is revealed as a complex amalgam
of theatricality and dance forms rather than more easily
dismissable theatricalized jazz dance, for which Ailey was
sometimes criticized.
</P>
<P>
   The tributes paid to Ailey and Ms. Jamison late in the program
occasionally sound a little pat and repetitive. And Ms. Smith's
presence is sometimes jarring and confusing. But ``A Hymn for Alvin
Ailey'' gives words as eloquent as Ailey's best choreography to
what he expressed without words in those dances.

U.S. COLLEGES INUNDATED BY FRESHMAN APPLICANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Yale set a record this year, and Harvard nearly did. But the
rising tide of college applications was hardly limited to the Ivy
League.
</P>
<P>
   As the deadline for next fall's freshman class passed at many
campuses on Monday, admissions officers from Yale and Harvard to
St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn., and Sweet Briar College in
Virginia, all reported big gains.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is demographic: There are more high school
graduates than ever. But another important factor, some officials
say, is the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Several Web sites now offer users the possibility of sending
electronic applications in bulk. Some colleges encourage the
practice by waiving the fee for an electronic application, saying
it saves them the expense of entering data.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Berman, a spokesman for College Edge, a division of Snap
Technology in San Francisco, said his rapidly growing electronic
application service, which guides students to fill out the
application form and then sends it along to desired colleges, had
processed 500,000 applications this year. The colleges, not the
applicants, pay the costs.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, many colleges have accepted a common
application form that can be copied and submitted to more than one
institution. Now, students with computers can go to a college Web
site or a CD-ROM and fill out an application _ often without ever
touching paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no fussing with typewriter margins and all of that
time-consuming stuff,'' said Evan Schnittman, a spokesman for the
Princeton Review. ``It's no wonder there's an explosive use of
these electronic tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Apply!, an application service that was bought by the Princeton
Review last May, distributes a CD-ROM to some 700,000 high schools
around the country. It contains application forms for more than 600
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaplan Educational Centers, another college preparation
service, distributes a CD-ROM that enables students to connect with
Collegelink and Collegenet _ two electronic application providers.
Students can also link with these services from Kaplan's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As applications pour in, admissions officers say they have never
worked so hard. ``Our staff is going seven days a week, 10 hours a
day,'' said Richard Shaw, dean of admissions at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the extra work, some educators say they fear that
colleges and universities are beginning to lose control of the
application process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to apply to college through the Internet or with a
CD-ROM has made it a kind of game that students play,'' said Joyce
E. Smith, executive director of the National Association for
College Admissions Counseling. ``It has changed the face of how
colleges are chosen, and left counselors confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that high school students would start the
application process by sitting around the kitchen table with their
parents,'' Ms. Smith continued. ``Then they would discuss the
matter with the school's guidance counselor, and bounce it back and
forth before they reached a decision about which three or four
schools might be right. But with online applications that the
student does with his or her own computer, the counselor and even
the parents are left out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia A. Carey, dean of admissions at the College of William
and Mary _ one of the few campuses that reported a decline in
applications this year _ said the prevalence of electronic
applications had ``confounded all of the projections that we try to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the student has filled out the application, or had one of
the services do it, he or she can apply to additional colleges just
by typing in the school's code,'' Ms. Carey said. ``But how
seriously are we to take those applications? When the fee is waived
for electronic applications, are they really just as serious as a
paper application that enclosed a $40 fee?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Besides the rise in the numbers of high school graduates and of
electronic applications, admissions officers offer a variety of
explanations for the gain in applications. Ivy League campuses, for
example, have increased financial aid. ``You know that had to
help,'' said William R. Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions at Harvard,
where applications were up 7 percent (to 18,183) this year.
</P>
<P>
   At Fairfield University in Connecticut, where applications rose
11 percent this year, Mary Spiegel, director of admissions, said
the recent success of the university's varsity teams had helped,
and so had a policy of encouraging prospective applicants to make a
campus visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come and they like what they see,'' Ms. Spiegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Whiteside, the admissions chief of Tulane University in
New Orleans, said that applications were up 5.5 percent but that he
was even more pleased by a rise in applicants' average SAT score _
to 1,284 from 1,264.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being seen as a more and more selective institution,''
Whiteside said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that applications were given a lift by the lure of New
Orleans, small class sizes and the performance of Tulane's football
team, which was undefeated last season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rise in applications has left many admissions
officers wary. Margaret Williams, admissions director of Sweet
Briar College, said the increase in applicants had greatly
complicated her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``By around May or June,'' Ms. Williams said, ``I want to be
able to go to our president and say it looks as though we're going
to have a freshman class in the fall and this is the size and shape
of it, but now that's a lot more difficult to do. I recently
learned that one of our applicants had applied to 10 schools. It
makes it difficult for us to decide how seriously interested that
student is and whether we should hold a place for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carey, the dean of admissions at William and Mary, said that
last year she started to write a detailed response to a parent who
described her son's academic record and asked if he might qualify
for a merit award.
</P>
<P>
   Then she noticed a line at the top of the query: ``This question
has been sent to at least 100 institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carey decided not to reply.

FINSTERWALD BORN TOO SOON?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The man who was born too soon will be honored as a
past champion this week, when the Nissan Open returns to Riviera
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Finsterwald, 69, winner of the 1960 Nissan (then called the
Los Angeles Open) must wonder at times about his timing.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the finest golfers or his era and finished second
or third in tour earnings for five straight years at the height of
his skills. But Finsterwald's combined winnings during that 1956-60
stretch totaled just $170,225 _ less than a third what the Nissan
winner will earn !ital!this week and at least $7 million shy of
what a similar five-year stretch would earn in this era.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Finsterwald's birth date of September 6, 1929, came just
four days before the birth of another eventual pro golfer of note _
Arnold Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   And when Finsterwald turned 50, in 1970, there was no such thing
as a Senior PGA Tour. But Finsterwald has no thoughts about being
born too soon:
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't feel that,'' he said. ``A dollar probably went
a little further then and it probably went a little easier. . . . I
enjoyed it when I had it and I had it going good, and I hope the
guys that are going good now enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, there's so many good players now, I don't know if I
could have finished that high. I feel very fortunate to win what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   His Los Angeles Open victory came at Rancho Park, where he won
by a stroke with a closing 71 after final-round leader Eric Monti
shot 80. Finsterwald remains gracious in victory 39 years after the
fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did win the tournament, but it was kind of a back-door
thing,'' he said. ``I was behind by five strokes going into the
last round. . . . Eric Monti, who had been been leading, was a golf
professional next door at Hillcrest. I think he had an awful lot of
members over there pulling for him, but it was just a tough day for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for having to go head-to-head throughout his career against
Palmer, the man acknowledged as the finest golfer of his
generation, Finsterwald said he enjoyed the opportunity:
</P>
<P>
   ``Being overshadowed by him, you don't mind. Just to get in his
shadow, you've done a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Finsterwald finished with 12 tour victories, including a
two-stroke win over Hall of Famer Billy Casper in the 1958 PGA
Championship, the first year that tournament switched from match to
stroke play.
</P>
<P>
   __ Clubs for kids: Anyone donating a new or used golf club to
the Nissan Open's Clubs for Kids program today will be granted free
admission to pro-am play at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs will be accepted at the Longworth Ave. entrance, where
daily shuttle service will bring fans from parking lots at the
Veterans Administration Hospital in Brentwood.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Clubs for Kids program produced 250 donated clubs
in the Nissan Open held at Valencia Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   __ Final qualifiers: Bo Van Pelt of Reston, Wash., and Alan
Bratton of Ft. Worth, Texas, claimed the final two berths in this
week's Nissan Open, topping a 142-player qualifying tournament at
Los Serranos.
</P>
<P>
   Van Pelt shot 7-under-par 65 in the competition held on the
North course. Bratton eliminated 16-year-old James Oh of Lakewood
in a one-hole playoff.

   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The students milling around the entrance gate
at the University of California here take little notice of Clark
Kerr as he passes by on a mild winter afternoon, a balding emeritus
professor in a wool sports jacket and comfortable-looking black
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, he would not have escaped their attention. In
the 1960s, Clark Kerr was at the center of the cultural hurricane
that engulfed virtually every American campus, and he paid for it
with his job. Gov. Ronald Reagan and the California Board of
Regents dismissed him as president of the university, saying he had
been too lenient with the protesters in the Free Speech Movement at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   It is not how Kerr would like to be remembered, or even,
necessarily, how he should be. At 87, he is perhaps the grand old
man of higher education, the president and chancellor who
engineered Berkeley's pre-eminence and that of the whole California
university system.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Berkeley's campus carries his name. His slender volume,
``The Uses of the University,'' (Harvard University Press, 1964)
was translated into six languages (including Urdu), and is still in
print. Time, Business Week and Psychology Today all featured him in
cover stories.
</P>
<P>
   After his dismissal in 1967, he became chairman and executive
director of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education. Now he is
completing his memoirs, for publication next year by the University
of California Press, and as he shows a visitor around the campus he
reflects on his experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Although student protests have cooled somewhat, the issues
roiling the University of California _ and other universities _
today are not unlike those faced by Kerr, first as chancellor at
Berkeley and then as president of the university, issues like
diversity, making better use of the campuses and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   He emphatically supports a diverse student body _ to create a
sense of opportunity and because the labor force will increasingly
be made up of minority workers _ but he does not see affirmative
action as the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program, I felt, was inherently flawed,'' Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   He takes the long view, and would like to see a focus on better
preparation of students, beginning in primary school, and on
helping students who are admitted to college to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he condemns the Regents for prohibiting preferential
admissions, because he fears that will be a signal to minorities
that they are not welcome. And he was dismayed that the Regents
took admissions policy out of the hands of the university Senate,
which he views as an important part of the university's success.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not expect political involvement in higher education
to disappear, because of the growing need for a college diploma and
the central role of universities in scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't very important before,'' he said. ``We were a
series of institutions on the side of the highway. Now higher
education is the engine pulling society.''
</P>
<P>
   As other states scramble to replicate Berkeley's success, Kerr
said that California's critical decision for higher education was
to have three distinct tiers _ community colleges offering open
enrollment, four-year undergraduate colleges and research
universities _ and to concentrate research support on a limited
number of campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have politicians saying they can't finance it any
more,'' Kerr said, ``but they are not speaking against the master
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He bemoans the reduced public spending on universities today,
but does not expect a reversal because growth in productivity is
not as strong as it used to be. It is time for higher education
``to start paying attention to being cost effective,'' Kerr said,
sounding more like a corporate trustee than an educator.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants university administrators to pay more attention to
ethics. He says public trust has eroded because of scandals in
athletics and actions like Berkeley's recent agreement to give a
Swiss biotechnology company, Novartis, first rights to
commercializing some research from the university's plant biology
department. Critics complained that Berkeley was auctioning off
research capacity paid for by public support.
</P>
<P>
   And Kerr is critical of the California State University's
decision to remove remedial courses from its curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want some diversity,'' he said, ``you are going to have
to do some remediation work, considering the state of our high
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Kerr is pleased when he looks back on his
years at the university, but he said that writing his memoirs had
brought back ``nightmares'' about his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what troubled him most about the episode, Kerr's gray eyes
look off into the distance and his face clouds momentarily. In his
soft, even voice he talks about how people he had looked upon as
his friends voted against him.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, he often thinks about what he might have said to
the Regents had they given him a chance to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the response of the labor leader John L. Lewis to
industrialists who accused Lewis during a conference after World
War II of not being a good American. ``Why am I not a good
American?'' Lewis asked. ``Because I improved conditions for my
workers? Because I got pensions for their widows?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I might have said,'' Kerr mused. ``But I had the
good sense not to say anything. I accepted what they did and
thanked them for the chance to serve.''

`CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS': SAILORS AT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No need to wait for Fleet Week to encounter the
hardest-working crew in or out of New York Harbor. The men are on
the job right now, at the Manhattan Theater Club, lifting anchor,
dropping line, hoisting sails, swabbing decks, climbing masts,
scaling fish and yes, even singing more prettily in multipart
harmony than any a capella group from Princeton or Yale.
</P>
<P>
   They are the lusty, vocally trained sailors of ``Captains
Courageous,'' the new musical based on the Rudyard Kipling novel
about a blueblooded brat who falls off an ocean liner and into the
lives of a Portuguese seaman and his mates on a New England fishing
trawler. The show, which opened Tuesday night, features Treat
Williams as the fearless Portuguese fisherman, Manuel; young
Brandon Espinoza as the rich boy who earns his comeuppance and his
sea legs, and 14 other able-bodied actors in an all-male cast who
do so many ship-related chores they could turn in their Equity
cards and immediately qualify for the seafarers' union.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Lynne Meadow, dreams up an endless checklist of
tasks for her actors, and as ``Captains Courageous'' progresses,
the reason becomes clear. She is desperately trying to create the
illusion of something happening. For all its handsome rigging, for
all the muscular chanteys and wistful sailing songs by the
songwriting team of Frederick Freyer and Patrick Cook, the show
itself is rather static and pale; it lacks the sense of momentum
and profusion of color that should develop naturally in a musical
drama that rides the swells of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a pleasingly uncomplicated performance by Williams and
the robust if undifferentiated portrayals by much of the rest of
the cast, ``Captains Courageous'' is the equivalent of a torpid
cruise in shallow water. All of the story's tension, it seems,
resides in those ropes the sailors are constantly tugging.
</P>
<P>
   Freyer, who wrote the music, and Cook, responsible for the book
and lyrics, apparently have been grooming their musical for years;
it has been through numerous workshops at the theater club and
elsewhere. The loving care is obvious. Their score is tasteful and
polished and easy on the ears. For example, Harvey Ellesworth
Cheyne, the wealthy boy played by Espinoza, is picked out of the
sea by Manuel in the middle of Williams' gentle entrance number,
``Little Fish.'' The song segues nicely from Manuel's primitive
ruminations on fishing, to the rescue of the boy, establishing both
Manuel's simple nature and the relationship that will frame the
rest of the show.
</P>
<P>
   But as with so much of the score of ``Captains Courageous,''
``Little Fish'' provides little more than unassuming background
music for the mild, incremental advances in the story. The composer
and lyricist favor songs and song fragments that express a general
mood _ the sailors sing on such predictable ideas as adventure and
loneliness _ over those that might reveal character or drive the
plot. Thus the music, while full of verve, never achieves much
individuality. On the rare occasions that it does, as in ``Regular
Fellas,'' an energetic if routine Act II comedy song performed by
Manuel and Harvey, the parched audience responds with something
like deep gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   In its diminished capacity, the score _ with its chiming echoes
of ship's bells and other sounds of the sea in the rich
orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick _ becomes merely atmospheric. It
serves roughly the same function as the backdrop footage of the
turbulent ocean in the 1937 movie version with Spencer Tracy and
Freddie Bartholomew, or the vivid descriptions of ship life in the
1897 novel.
</P>
<P>
   This, obviously, does not set the stage for musical theater of
the most compelling variety, though it's only fair to point out
that with this source material, Freyer, Cook and Ms. Meadow, the
theater club's artistic director, had a major challenge from the
start. The story of ``Captains Courageous,'' a sea voyage during
which Harvey learns from Manuel what it means to be a man, takes
the form of a travelogue and as such is not inherently dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The solution the musical comes up with is to stretch out
Harvey's transformation from prig to productive crewman _ in the
novel and movie his change in temperament occurs practically
overnight _ to occupy virtually the entire first act. (A supposed
rivalry with the crew of an unseen fishing boat is another
underwhelming effort to beef up the plot.)
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's a long way to intermission. Espinoza, an
accomplished young actor, is forever curling his lip and stamping
his feet like a pint-size John McEnroe. ``I'm Harvey Ellesworth
Cheyne!'' he sings haughtily again and again, long after it has
grown tiresome. (It's not until much too late in the show, the
closing song of Act I, ``You Never Saw,'' that Harvey has a chance
to explain his behavior.)
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the crewmen are arrayed in choirlike formations
on Derek McLane's revolving platform, which is used to represent
both ship and shore. Rather than being allowed to emerge as
characters, the men, all played by fine Broadway actors, are
defined by their chores: there is the captain (Michael Mulheren),
the captain's son (Jim Stanek), the cook (Norm Lewis). In Jerry
Mitchell's staging of the musical numbers, they are positioned like
furniture, and their songs are theatrical wallpaper. ``Somewhere in
Gloucester/A ship sails today/So farewell, my lady/I'm going
away,'' is a typical verse, delivered in ethereal harmony with
almost a liturgical cast.
</P>
<P>
   The job of bringing this airy musical to earth is borne chiefly
by Williams. And in the tighter second act, more successful because
it narrows the emotional focus and follows through musically with
touching duets like ``I'm Home,'' he and Espinoza almost pull off
the impossible. As Manuel, Williams is always appealing, whether
teaching Harvey the ins and outs of landing cod or making up songs
to the accompaniment of his ``squeeze box,'' the concertina he
inherited from his father. Possessed of a pleasant, delicate
singing voice, and a more plausible Portuguese accent than the
laughable one Tracy employed in his Oscar-winning performance,
Williams proves a warmly embraceable father figure, soft and
masculine, too.
</P>
<P>
   The role is not the most challenging, of course; pure-hearted
Manuel is about as far as an actor could travel from the broodingly
complex police officer Williams portrayed so compellingly in Sidney
Lumet's ``Prince of the City.'' Espinoza, on the other hand, has to
undergo a radical metamorphosis in ``Captains Courageous,'' and he
carries it off expertly. It is not his fault that he's made to seem
so ludicrously shrill in the first act. The closer he gets to
goodness, the better he gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Captains Courageous,'' unfortunately, never gets particularly
close to musicalizing the story of Manuel and Harvey in a way that
gives their bonding a blood-coursing urgency. Little that happens
onstage seems real: No one, in fact, gets dirty, or even wet. The
show holds out the promise of taking you on a journey to somewhere
new. But like the platform the production is perched on, it only
goes in circles.

FIREFIGHTERS' DEATHS RECALL PAIN OF PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For 11 years now, this has been the worst
week of the year for Randal Goodwin. Yesterday's screaming
headline, ``Firefighters die,'' guaranteed this year would be no
different.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin was on the dreaded elliptical cross-trainer at Huguley
Fitness Center when I walked in yesterday morning, sweat soaking
his T-shirt and running down his forehead and into his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He's there every day, the center's ``welcome wagon'' volunteer,
always smiling, singing along with the music in his headphones,
rolling through another two-hour workout.
</P>
<P>
   He hits the treadmill. He pumps iron. He rotates among the
machines, working the upper body, then the legs. And at every
machine, every weight bench, every Stairmaster, he shares a joke or
a smile. He seems to know everyone and everyone knows Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   He's the guy with no feet.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin gets by quite well, thank you, with prostheses made of
plastic and rubber and metal taking the place of both his feet,
which were amputated above the ankles 11 years ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand the inspiration he brings to the regulars at
Huguley. It's just that yesterday, for the first time in all the
times I've seen him there, his smile was forced, the pain in his
eyes _ and in his heart _ plain for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   Three of his ``brothers'' died Monday in Lake Worth, Texas, just
outside Fort Worth. Goodwin felt that pain all the way down into
the feet he no longer has.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, 31, was a firefighter, too, until a fire took away his
feet and his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sad today,'' he said after we'd both served our
sentences on the cross-trainer. ``In the business we're in, we're
all basically related. When brothers get hurt or die in the line of
duty, we're all impacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can detach yourself. You have to be able to do
that. But when it comes inside, there's no escaping it. In a few
weeks, the world will move on, but for those families and those
friends, what happened yesterday will always be felt and those men
will always be missing.''
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, Goodwin should me missing, too. How he survived
his own ordeal 11 years ago, when he was a 20-year-old volunteer
for the Briar Oaks Fire Department, just south of Burleson in
Johnson County, remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin's unit had responded to a grass fire. What they didn't
know was that a downed power line had caused the fire and was still
very much alive. The surging electricity arced to the water stream
from the truck. James Salzman, on the hose, slumped over. Mark
Crawford, rushing to Salzman's aid, went down when he stepped off
the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin immediately began a rescue operation to try to save his
fellow crew members. He was off the truck, running parallel to the
hot wire, when it arced again.
</P>
<P>
   The electrical current, all 69,000 volts, hit Goodwin above the
right eye, surged through him and into the ground, then threw him
40 feet, over the line itself.
</P>
<P>
   His insulated fireman's coat and pants, built to protect him
from outside heat, also kept the heat inside when the clothes he
was wearing underneath burst into flames. The stethoscope that hung
around his neck welded itself to the left side of his chest.
</P>
<P>
   As crew member Jim Flynn worked to save him, Goodwin's heart
arrested twice, then a third time in the Care Flight helicopter,
where they had to shock him back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, none of the three firefighters died, though all were
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin's injuries were so extensive _ he had second- and
third-degree burns over 87 percent of his body _ that doctors saw
no hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told my parents that I wasn't going to make it through
the night and they thought transfusions would be a waste of
blood,'' he said. ``The organ-donor people were there to prepare my
organs for harvesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin fooled them all. He refused to die. Transfusions were
performed, but as fast as the blood went in, it poured back out
again through his ruined feet, which had taken the brunt of the
electrical charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors decided to start at the bottom and work up,''
Goodwin said of the amputations. ``They said they'd stop when they
found good tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Four-and-a-half months later, a full year earlier than doctors
had predicted, Goodwin left the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he runs a support unit for Johnson County firefighters
called Emergency Support Service, providing food, fluids and
on-site medical evaluations as firefighters do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides losing his feet, Goodwin is also blind in his right eye
and has limited vision in his left. But he refuses to let his
physical impairment handicap him emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a point in your life where, `Great, I'm alive,' or
`GREAT, I'm alive!' It's where you put the emphasis,'' said
Goodwin, who married his best friend Grace two years after the
incident. ``Obviously, it was a big change in my life. You think
you have everything mapped out, then it's as if God puts out a hand
and says, `Whoa, time to start over.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to live my life to the fullest. I don't let anyone
set my expectations for me. I try to live without limits. I don't
set out every day to inspire anyone else, but if somebody learns
something from what happened to me, that's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as painful as losing his feet was the loss of his dream
of being a firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to understand that dream a little better. I have a
son who shares it and has begun his training to be a firefighter,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets in your blood,'' Goodwin said. ``I'd do it again
in a heartbeat. If a magic time machine could transport me back to
that day, Feb. 21, 1988, I don't know if I would change a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huguley Fitness Center is a haven for firefighters from all
over the area. They came there to stay in shape and to stay sharp,
knowing the day could come when they will need every ounce of
strength, every bit of smarts, to save others and to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, though, was quieter out of respect for their fallen
comrades. You know it's a sad day when even Goodwin struggles to
muster a smile.

SOUTHERN METHODIST CLIMBS UP WAC MOUNTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With SMU sweeping two Western Athletic Conference home games
last week, the title picture in the Mountain Division emerged with
crystal clarity.
</P>
<P>
   It is now obvious that any of seven teams can win the
championship. Most of them, of course, could also finish seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Mustangs players have indicated that winning the
championship is their true goal; but at this point, SMU coach Mike
Dement would probably settle for a berth in the WAC tournament in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   He figures that will require a minimum of seven conference
victories, which means that the Mustangs (11-12, 5-5) must win at
least two of their remaining four games. Three would be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, by beating Colorado State and Wyoming \Rboth 5-6\S we
jumped over them in the standings,'' Dement said, ``But they each
have two home games left, and I don't think anyone will beat them
up there. We're certainly not assured of anything at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow night, the Mustangs visit Air Force (8-14, 1-9) with
what would appear to be a great opportunity for a rare WAC road
victory. There's a catch, however.
</P>
<P>
   While the Falcons figure to be out of the running _ the seventh-
and eighth-place teams in each division miss the trip to Las Vegas
_ they might be more unlucky than inept. For starters, they rank
sixth nationally in 3-point shots made per game (8.7).
</P>
<P>
   They have four league losses by a total of eight points _
including a one-point defeat to division leader Nevada-Las Vegas
(8-2) and a 73-71 loss to SMU at Moody Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a clutch 3-point shot from Stephen Woods to beat
them,'' Dement said. ``And they had the UNLV game won when, for
some reason, they came back onto the floor with six men after a
timeout. UNLV got the ball on the penalty and hit a last-second
shot to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mustangs have pulled out three last-minute victories in
a row.
</P>
<P>
   Jeryl Sasser has averaged 21 points, nine rebounds and 2.3
steals over his past 14 games; Willie Davis is averaging 18.5
points and 10.5 boards over his past four; Woods scored the winning
points to beat Air Force and Wyoming and is shooting 46 percent
from 3-point range over the past six games. In victories over TCU,
CSU and Wyoming, Davis averaged 12.3 rebounds. Against the Cowboys,
SMU also got 11 points and tough play inside from freshman forward
Michael Niemi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are looking better, but we still have a lot of work to
do,'' Dement said.
THE BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   UNLV (15-8, 8-2) gained some breathing room, recovering from a
loss Saturday at Rice with a 54-53 victory at Tulsa late Monday _
handing the Golden Hurricane (18-8, 6-5) their first home loss in
their new arena. The victory opened up a 11/2-game lead over the
surprising Owls (16-7, 7-4), but it was also costly. Center Kaspars
Kambala (6-foot-9, 250 pounds) left the game with a sprained knee
and his status was still uncertain last night. The Rebels are host
to SMU on Saturday and TCU on Monday night. ... ESPN's Dick Vitale
picked Utah guard Andre Miller and TCU's Lee Nailon _ both
finalists for the Naismith Award _ for his ``All-Rolls Royce
Team.'' Nailon was the division's player of the week and has taken
over the WAC scoring lead (23.0), ranking eighth nationally. ...
Utah (20-4, 10-0) has won 15 in a row and leads the Pacific
Division by 21/2 games. The Utes are ranked 12th nationally. ...
Led by Becky Hammon's 27 points Sunday in a victory against SMU,
the Colorado State women (26-1, 11-0) moved up to a No. 4 national
ranking.

NEW DALLAS SPORTS ARENA WILL FEATURE UNIQUE ELEMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ By any standard, the new Dallas sports arena will be a
superior facility to 19-year-old Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The building, plans for which are scheduled to be unveiled in
the next month or so, will boast more and better concessions,
extensive premium seating and improved restrooms and parking _ all
marks of modern arenas.
</P>
<P>
   But the next home of the Mavericks and Stars (scheduled to be
open for the 2001-02 seasons) also will feature unique design
elements that will distinguish it from modern buildings elsewhere
in the country, project architects and team executives said, citing
several examples.
</P>
<P>
   The standard racetrack-style concourse at Reunion and other
sports arenas is being junked for a series of high-ceiling great
rooms, rotundas and hallways creating what architects say will be a
far more welcoming public space, where fans will want to linger.
The new arena will take up about twice the area of Reunion, but the
building will retain some intimacy thanks to architects' efforts to
build in what they call nooks and crannies in seating areas and
concourses.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the ``end-zone'' seating areas will be set at a steeper
pitch than in most arenas, putting fans closer to the action, and
the arena's exterior should be distinctive and allow people inside
to look out on downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our peers around the country are constructing
buildings, and we said right from the beginning that we wanted to
do something unique and different,'' Mavericks president Terdema
Ussery said. ``We wanted better sightlines and more intimacy. We
wanted our basketball fans to have almost a collegiate atmosphere.
Given the size of the building, we think we've done that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Explained arena architect David Schwarz: ``We're trying to make
this a humane building, where being in the building is a great deal
of fun. That's not a new idea. It's just restoring some traditional
architectural values.''
</P>
<P>
   Architects say they can distinguish the $230 million downtown
Dallas arena, in part, by creating soaring public spaces in the
concourses and by allowing for some asymmetrical design elements in
the seating bowl. There will be, for example, three levels of
suites on one end of the court, one level on the opposite end, and
two levels on the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz suggests that the features which distinguish baseball
stadiums such as The Ballpark in Arlington, which he designed, can
also be built into indoor arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People,'' he said, ``have not done arenas as well as stadiums.
Arenas, too, can have nooks and crannies.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Schwarz's ideas is to give fans inside the arena views to
what's outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have huge quantities of glass in our rooms because we want
you to know where you are when you're on the inside,'' Schwarz
said. ``We don't ever want you to feel lost. In other buildings,
you don't know where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Trubey, vice president and director of the sports
facilities group at HKS, the Dallas architectural firm working with
Schwarz, said arena architects ``worked to create more of a
collegiate basketball atmosphere in the \Rseating\S bowl'' by
effectively pulling the end-court areas in tighter to the playing
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Trubey called this task ``difficult to achieve in a pro sports
arena where you have both hockey and basketball'' because permanent
seating has to be designed around the hockey surface, which is
larger than the basketball court. Standard attempts to bring fans
closer to the court using retractable seating have had only
marginal success.
</P>
<P>
   While both the Stars' and Mavericks' needs were satisfied by the
seating design, the two franchises don't share all elements of
their wish lists. Arena Group president Brad Mayne said, for
example, that the Stars wanted a modern press box in the new arena,
and the Mavericks wanted a separate practice court. However, the
Stars had no need for a practice rink, and the Mavericks no need
for a press box. Ultimately, he suggested, the new arena will have
both the practice court and press box because each is necessary in
a modern facility.
</P>
<P>
   Stars president James Lites agreed that project architects were
asked to come up with a building that met many different desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the new arena to be bigger \Rthan Reunion\S, but not
too big. We wanted it to feel grander but not too cold,'' Lites
said. ``We wanted to make the concourses wider but intimate. We
wanted steeper angles \Rin seating areas\S, but we didn't want it
too tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Other building users, including the circus, ice shows and
concerts, have special needs, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The give-and-take sessions take place weekly,'' Mayne said.
``We're basically building from scratch.''

PROSECUTOR SAYS JASPER SUSPECT WANTED `RESPECT' FOR NEW RACIST
GANG 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Dragging a black man to death behind a pickup
was just the bold event a young racist needed to attract recruits
for his new white supremacist group, a prosecutor told jurors
Tuesday, the first day of testimony in John W. ``Bill'' King's
capital murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill King had laid out his intention to form a hate group in
Jasper, Texas,'' Guy James Gray said in his 15-minute, low-key
opening statement. ``And he needed to do something dramatic to
attract media attention in order to gain, in their warped world,
respect for this newly formed gang.''
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, is the first of three white men to be tried in the
June 7, 1998, killing of James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old disabled
man. Byrd, who had accepted a ride from King and two of his
friends, was found dead the next morning, his beaten, dismembered
remains strung over a three-mile trail on a back road east of town.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, King would face either life in prison or death by
injection.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, the Jasper County district attorney, began the day by
apologetically showing the jury of 11 whites and one
African-American a book of more than a dozen color photographs of
Byrd's mutilated corpse, saying, ``It'll be a little rough on you,
but you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Byrd, while he may have been drunk, was
alive and conscious when he was chained to the pickup. As proof, he
offered photos of Byrd's elbows, which were ground down to the bone
when he attempted to keep his head off the pavement as he was being
dragged.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors showed little emotion, but Byrd's 17-year-old daughter,
Jamie, left the courtroom in tears, accompanied by her brother,
Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just walking in here, we realized they wouldn't be able to
stay,'' said Mylinda Washington, James Byrd's sister. ``It's just
too hard. It's rough to hear this.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as prosecutors showed the jury Byrd's shredded underwear
and other clothing ripped from his body as he was dragged, Byrd's
sister, Clara Taylor, and his daughter, Rene Mullins, left the
courtroom briefly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Byrd's three children, the first few rows of the
courtroom were filled with other family members, including the
victim's father, seven siblings, his former wife and his 2-year-old
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The family had arrived Monday night in Jasper and watched videos
of James Byrd Jr., whom they called ``Son,'' playing the piano.
</P>
<P>
   King's father, Ronald, sat opposite the Byrd family and was
accompanied briefly, by the defendant's girlfriend, Kylie Greeney,
who had to leave the courtroom as soon as testimony began because
she may be called as a witness in the case.
</P>
<P>
   King, dressed in green slacks and a plaid, long-sleeved shirt
that covered his heavily tattooed arms, sat quietly at the defense
table, speaking only once, to politely answer, ``Not guilty, your
honor,'' when state District Judge Joe Bob Golden requested his
plea.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr. declined to give
an opening statement, but reserved the right to do so later.
</P>
<P>
   Gray spent much of the morning taking Jasper County Sheriff
Billy Rowles through methodic testimony of his investigation,
enumerating each piece of evidence found at the crime scene: King's
Zippo cigarette lighter, engraved with the ex-con's prison
nickname, Possum, and a symbol of the Ku Klux Klan, tools of
co-defendant Shawn Allen Berry, Byrd's dentures and his clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said that once he realized he was dealing with a
dragging and not a hit-and-run case, he drove to the FBI office in
Beaumont and asked for help.
</P>
<P>
   Once the federal agents arrived in Jasper, he formed a
roundtable discussion, and ``we went through everything, and
everything and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that turned out to be a good idea, the sheriff
answered, ``You betcha _ smartest thing Billy Rowles ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution also offered evidence found at King's apartment,
including King's hand-written notes, racist drawings and a
membership application, constitution, bylaws and code of ethics for
a hate group King allegedly planned to form July 4, 1998. The
group, which King had named the Texas Rebel Soldiers of the
Confederate Knights of America, was to be formed in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys objected to each piece of evidence and each
photo of King's racist, Satanic and anti-Semitic tattoos, saying
they were constitutionally protected as free speech and could
prejudice jurors against their client. Golden overruled all the
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying Tuesday was 18-year-old Michele Chapman, who
said she had met King at a party when she was 13 and later
corresponded with him while he was serving time in a Tennessee
Colony prison from 1995-97.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said she received 19 letters from King, many of them
touting his racist beliefs, and turned all of them over to the FBI
following King's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors read aloud portions of three letters, which
contained descriptions of King's tattoos, as well as racial slurs
and fantasies of erotic interludes.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of letters written in 1996, when Chapman was 15,
King called her his ``Aryan princess'' or ``my beautiful kitten
(Puss In Boots).'' Many of the letters were romantic, but strewn
with racial slurs and vulgarities about Jasper-area ``whores'' who
became traitors to their race by dating blacks. Such women should
hang from the same tree as their black boyfriends, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   King also groused about not getting parole, but said he had more
to look forward to in prison than at home. ``I have it made in all
actuality, why give it up for a world full of nothing?
</P>
<P>
   ``At least in here, I don't have to worry about much,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The thing King clearly liked best about prison is the
availability of free ``skin art,'' as he called his tattoos. He
bragged that he had gotten $3,000 worth of free tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Once he got out of prison, Chapman testified, he visited her at
her home and showed off his tattoos. Describing one tattoo
depicting a black man hanging from a rope, Gray asked her, ``Was he
proud of that one?'' and she responded, ``As anybody would be, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   After the testimony, Gray described the day as slow and
``disjointed,'' but promised he would pull everything together for
the jury in the next few days. Planned for today is testimony from
a DNA expert, who will tell the jury that Byrd's blood was found on
the shoes of King and his co-defendants, Berry, 24, and Lawrence
Russell Brewer Jr., 31. Berry and Brewer will be tried later.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities Tuesday braced for the arrival of black militant
groups, who had called to say they would fight Judge Golden's order
keeping demonstrators off the courthouse square. None showed up,
but Houston black activist Quannel X said he and a group of
followers plan to attend the trial Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he spoke to Golden several times, assuring him they
would not be disruptive, but intend to wear their black
military-style uniforms in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   He also warned that if authorities attempt to arrest them, armed
members of the group would be prepared to defend them.

POLICE DOG FINDS MORE EVIDENCE OF ACCELERANT IN CHURCH FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 By JACK DOUGLAS Jr. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Texas _ A specially trained police dog found more
evidence of accelerants Tuesday in the charred ruins of a church
fire that killed three area firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The dog's discoveries led authorities to believe that it's
possible that an arsonist set a fire Monday inside Precious Faith
Temple in Lake Worth outside Fort Worth, investigators said. But
they said the samples may just as likely have come from common
household goods kept inside the church, such as glue.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the same dog _ a yellow Labrador retriever from
Wichita Falls _ found evidence of accelerants in the rubble of a
storage shed behind the church. That prompted investigators to
describe the fire as ``suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   No official ruling has been made in the cause of the blaze, but
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has issued a
$10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of anyone responsible for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, reported shortly before 10:45 a.m., is being
investigated by the multiagency Tarrant County Arson Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Collins, 35, Phillip Dean, 29, and Garry Sanders, 20, were
killed when the fire spread rapidly and a portion of the roof
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Four volunteer firefighters were injured. Joe Hamilton, 24, and
Andrew Ailara, 29, were released yesterday from Parkland Memorial
Hospital in Dallas. Harry Mayes Sr., 55, and Paul Burns, 37, were
treated Monday at area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Dean and Collins were full-time Fort Worth firefighters who at
the time of their deaths were working as volunteers for the
suburban River Oaks Fire Department. Sanders was a volunteer Sansom
Park firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   The dog, named Buddy, hit on about six locations of soil and
charred debris that may contain a flammable substance, mostly in
the very back interior of what remains of the building, said Lt.
Kent Worley, spokesman for the Fort Worth Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Worley said it's possible that the dog caught the scent of an
arsonist who worked from within the church. But he was quick to add
that it is too early to know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Precious Faith Temple pastor J.C. Terry said Tuesday that paint
to touch up the church had been kept inside. Other than that, he
said, he was unaware of any flammable chemicals in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Samples are being sent to ATF laboratories in San Francisco, and
some test results are expected back Wednesday, Tarrant County Fire
Marshal Randy Renois said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Initially, investigators were going to obtain a search warrant
before sending the dog into the debris. But they said that would
have been time-consuming, so they opted to have the church's pastor
sign a consent-to-search order.
</P>
<P>
   Terry said he was glad to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they're looking for, but they must have some
reason to look, which I don't mind at all,'' he said. ``They can
search all they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone charged with setting a fire that results in a
firefighter's death could face murder charges, Assistant District
Attorney David Montague said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law allows for a capital murder charge when the facts show
that a firefighter is intentionally killed as he carried out his
duties, Montague said. Proving the intent to kill would probably be
difficult in Monday's fire, he said.
