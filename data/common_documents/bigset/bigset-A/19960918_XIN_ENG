UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Day
of Peace was observed in the United Nations here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before ringing the Peace Bell in the U.N.
headquarters, U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said
that peace, a common dream of the world people, remained far too
remote for far too many people.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to promote a culture of peace. We must never
forget that peace is much more than the absence of conflict. We
must show solidarity with those who are suffering or deprived. And
we must be willing, in the face of inevitable obstacles and
setbacks, to take risks for peace. The future well-being of
humanity demands nothing less," he said.
</P>
<P>
To commemorate and strengthen the ideals of peace both within
and among all nations of the world, the United Nations General
Assembly in 1981 proclaimed the third Tuesday of September as
the International Day of Peace.

<HEADLINE> World Industrial Robot Sales Surge in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- After three years of recession
and a slight recovery in 1994, worldwide sales of industrial
robots in 1995 surged by 26 percent over 1994, reaching 75,500
units, an industry report released here on Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Industrial Robots 1996 report prepared
by the UN Economic Commission for Europe and the International
Federation of Robotics, worldwide sales of industrial robots
peaked in 1990, when they reached almost 81,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Following the recession in 1991-1993, sales of robots plummeted
to about 56,000 units in 1993 and recovered slightly in 1994 with
sales of about 60,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that continued booming markets in the
United States and western Europe, and a recovered Japanese market
will result in impressive growth in world robot sales in 1996 of
about 20 percent over the 1995 level.
</P>
<P>
In the period from 1997 to 1999, the growth in robot sales is
forecast to drop slowly to about 15 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of units, robot sales are estimated to increase form
about 75,500 units in 1995 to over 90,000 units in 1996 and to
about 145,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Japan has by far the highest density
of advanced robots. In 1995 it amounted to 210 units per 10,000
persons engaged in manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
Sweden had the second highest density with 54 units, followed
by Germany with 52, South Korea with 51, and Italy with 41 units.
</P>
<P>
In the other countries in western Europe, Australia and the
United States, the density ranged between about 15 and 40 units.
The countries in central and eastern Europe had densities in the
range of two to five.
</P>
<P>
In all the robot-using countries, welding and assembly are the
largest robot application areas and the motor vehicle industry is
the largest robot user branch.
</P>
<P>
For every 10,000 people employed in the motor vehicle industry
in 1995, there were over 800 robots in Japan, about 400 in Italy,
300 in the United States, 230 in Germany, and just under 200 in
France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the potential for robot application is
enormous.
</P>
<P>
If other industrialized countries were to approach the robot
density of Japan and if industry in general were to reach only
half the robot density of the motor vehicle sector, the robot
stock would increase manifold and this is not counting the
potential for robots in the service industries, the report said.

London Commodities Exchange (LCE) and London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) began operation as
a merged market Monday, according to Financial Times today.
</P>
<P>
The merger of LIFFE and LCE, which was announced at the end of
last year, creates the only exchange in the world to offer trading
in futures and options on financial, agricultural, soft commodity
and equity-index products as well as options on individual
equities.
</P>
<P>
The driving force for the merger was continuing European
integration, said Jack Wigglesworth, chairman of the merged
exchange.
</P>
<P>
"The merger strengthens London's position as Europe's leading
financial center," he added.
</P>
<P>
The merged market plans to develop new European agricultural
products. "The merger reaffirms London as one of the principal
international centers for commodity trading," said Robin Woodhead,
chief executive of the former LCE Monday.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the merger was designed to strengthen the
existing LCE commodity markets and to ensure London's ability to

<HEADLINE> HK Textile Manufacturers to Be Affected by Dutch Ban on AZO Dyestuffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- As the Netherlands becomes
the first country to follow Germany in banning the import of goods
 containing certain AZO-dyestuffs, it will affect Hong Kong's
exports of clothing, footwear and textiles to that country, Hong
Kong's Trade Development Council (TDC) warned today.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the production and import of goods containing the
said dyestuffs believed to cause cancer in humans under certain
conditions, became effective in Germany on April 1, 1996, a TDC
report said.
</P>
<P>
Goods imported or ordered before August 1, 1996 will be
permitted for treatment in the Netherlands until September 1,
1997, after which the ban will be total.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's garment exports to the Netherlands are expected to
be the most affected, the TDC report said. The Dutch and German
legislation is similar in terms of agreed methods of testing for
the presence of AZO-dyestuffs, it said.
</P>
<P>
Many Hong Kong manufacturers are requested by their German
buyers to prove that their products are free of the forbidden
dyestuffs, which forced manufacturers to extra costs of
certification and a switch to substitute dyestuffs.
</P>
<P>
As there will be a growing and general restriction in Europe on
 AZO-dyestuffs, TDC advised Hong Kong exporters to be aware of
legislative trends restricting use of dyestuffs which may take
effect at any time over the next year.

DHAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina today described her just-concluded China visit as a
"complete success".
</P>
<P>
She led a 50-member delegation to China on September 12-16, her
first official visit to a foreign country since she became prime
minister on June 23.
</P>
<P>
In a crowded press conference here this evening, the prime

Zemin and Premier Li Peng in a most cordial atmosphere for
increasing further economic cooperation as well as cementing the
already existing cordial relations between us."
</P>
<P>
Besides signing four agreements on avoiding double taxation,
investment and Chinese grants and soft loans for Bangladesh,
meaningful and positive discussions were held with the Chinese
authorities for further increasing trade and economic relations,
particularly Chinese investment in Bangladesh, she noted.

Referring to the "sincere attitude" of the Chinese leadership
towards Bangladesh, Hasina praised China for its "already existing
initiatives" in the development of various infrastructure projects
in Bangladesh, including the construction of friendship bridges,
development of the Barapukuria Coal Mine and setting up power
generating stations.

BAGHDAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, who just returned from the session of
the Arab Foreign Minister Council concluded in Cairo Sunday,
said that all Arabs voiced their support for Iraq and rejected
any interference with Iraq's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted today by the Iraqi News Agency as saying that the
final statement of the council expressed all Arabs' rejection of
any interference with Iraq's internal affairs and stressed the
need for the preservation of Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the statement also expressed
concern about the recent development of events in Iraq as a
result of foreign intervention, which threatens Iraq's unity,
security and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Arab council, he said, called for an end to the suffering
of the Iraqi people caused by more than six years of crippling
U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He added that the statement also urged a quick implementation
of the oil-for-food agreement signed by Iraq and the United
Nations on May 20.
</P>

The Iraqi-U.N. oil agreement allows Iraq to sell two billion
dollars worth of oil every six months to buy badly needed food,
medicines and other humanitarian materials.

The Iraqi foreign minister said that the final statement of
the council unanimously opposed Turkey's intention to establish
a buffer zone along the borders with Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The UK's Securities and
Investments Board (SIB) and the US Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) today issued the "Final Report From the
Co-Chairmen of the May 1995 Windsor Meeting to the Technical
Committee of the International Organization of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO)".
</P>
<P>
The Final Report outlines the governmental and private sector
initiatives which have been completed to implement the
recommendations set out in the May l995 Windsor Declaration signed
by futures market regulatory authorities from l6 jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
Significant concrete steps have been taken in a remarkably
short period of time to implement the Windsor recommendations,
including large exposure information sharing, market crisis
procedures, enhanced transparency of market protection and
procedures, and client asset protection measures, according to a
press release by SIB.
</P>
<P>
These measures will minimize the systemic effects of a market
disruption and enhance existing regulatory safeguards, the press
release added.
</P>
<P>
The Final Report particularly notes the significance for
greater regulatory co-operation resulting from the execution of
the "Declaration of Co-operation and Supervision of International
Futures Exchanges and Clearing Organizations" initially signed in
March 1996 and signed to date by 15 international regulators.
</P>
<P>
In connection with the release of the Final Report, Sir Andrew
Large, chairman of the SIB, said, he was pleased with the progress
that had been made in implementing the ambitious agenda announced
at Windsor, England.
</P>
<P>
"The co-operative approach, that was endorsed at Windsor, is
widely seen as central to regulating global markets," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Recent events demonstrate that no one regulator or market
authority alone will have the information necessary to evaluate
the risks to its markets," Sir Andrew Large concluded.

<HEADLINE> Israel Orders Confiscation of Palestinian Lands in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel today ordered to
confiscate lands belonging to Palestinians in Hebron for building
a new road, a Palestinian press service reported.
</P>
<P>
The orders, signed by Israeli Military Commander in West
Bank Ozi Dayan, involved the lands that belong to three
Palestinian families, the report issued by Jerusalem Media and
Communications Center (JMCC) said.
</P>
<P>
Israel justified the confiscation on military reasons, but
Palestinians charged that it aimed at opening a new road to
link Kiryat Arba settlement with the Machpela Temple in
Hebron, the volatile West Bank town for Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and violence.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also expressed concern that the planned road
would lead to the demolition of dozens of their homes.
</P>
<P>
Hebron Municipality's Secretary Azam Muhtaseb criticized Israel
for confiscating the Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
"These plans are still depending on cheating and deviousness
in confiscating Palestinian lands and rights, and are justified
with either security, demographic or historic reasons," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, Israel wants peace and security at one time and
on the costs of historical and legitimate rights of
Palestinians," he charged.
</P>
<P>
Land confiscation has been one of the explosive issues in
the ties between Israel and Palestinians. The orders are
expected to fuel the rising tension in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, hundreds of Palestinian protesters confronted
Israeli soldiers in Hebron as they tried to reopen a vegetable
market which has been closed since the 1994 massacre, in which a
Jew shot dead 29 Palestinian worshipers.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat is to
meet with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Wednesday
to discuss Israeli troops' redeployment from Hebron, the first
stumbling obstacle blocking the peace process.

year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The country has maintained its momentum in economic development
with rapid growth in the economy, accompanied by a dramatic drop
in prices. In the meantime, he noted, severe natural disasters
have been overcome and a vigorous crackdown on criminal activities
has been carried out nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The country has also made headway in pushing for the
reunification of the motherland and in its diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
Li said that, viewing the country as a whole, the situation was
good during the first half of the year, but that there were still
quite a few problems. Economic efficiency in enterprises
declined, and some state-owned enterprises had greater
difficulties in both production and management. The readjustment
of product mix could not meet the market needs and total profit in
industrial enterprises went down.

<HEADLINE> Athens Bourse Up as General Elections Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Athens bourse has risen
for the fifth consecutive day today, closing at 974.20 points, up
16.01 points, with the country's general elections only four days
away.
</P>
<P>
Since last Monday, the bourse has risen 46.83 points, or 5.05
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the rise of the Athens bourse has more to do
about expectations that the government which will emerge from
Sunday's elections is bound to make bolder moves in cutting public
deficits and accelerating privatizations.
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a poll showing the ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (PASOK) widening its lead over the opposition
conservatives may have contributed, they claimed. The Athens
bourse had, after a steep rise immediately after early elections
were called in August, stalled when polls had predicted a tight
race between the two major parties.
</P>
<P>
Yannis Markopoulos, head of stockbrokers of Sigman Securities,
expected the market to continue rising until the elections.
</P>
<P>
Investors expect the election winners to make quick moves in
tackling the public sector deficit and privatizing state firms, he
said, adding that any delay would dampen their enthusiasm very
quickly while a decisive action would see the Athens stock market
break through the 1,000-point level very soon.

Money-losing enterprises continued to lose money and the number
of those that halt production kept increasing. The readjustment of
the product mix in quite a few of them did not keep up with market
demand, putting them at a disadvantage in the face of strong
domestic and international competition.
</P>
<P>
The premier explained that these problems are the result of the
following: their management methods have not improved and their
products do not respond to market demand, and they had some social
burdens resulted from the past.
</P>
<P>
For the work of the coming months, he said that efforts should
be made to ensure this year's harvest, and urged localities to
prepare in advance to make purchases and pay farmers in cash, to
give them incentive to produce. He also stressed the importance of
building water conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
The premier called for greater efforts at curbing inflation and
in readjusting investment structure, adding that more key
construction projects should be arranged in the central and
western parts of the country and in infrastructure and agriculture.
</P>

He urged foreign trade departments to pay greater attention to
efficiency and to management reforms, and to work hard to readjust

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Meet Israeli Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat said in the Gaza Strip
today that he will meet with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai Wednesday, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Arafat as saying that the meeting will
focus on means of implementing the signed accords with Israel,
particularly the Israeli army's redeployment in the West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
According to the interim accord, also known as Oslo 2 agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians, the Israeli army was
originally supposed to have pulled back from approximately 80
percent of Hebron by March 28.
</P>
<P>
However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel in February and March which left over 60 people dead
and more than 100 wounded, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
delayed the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In May, the former Israeli government announced that the
army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the
May 29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu
in the elections, said afterwards that he would leave the
decision of the redeployment to the new prime minister and
his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 40 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a
place of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike,
and tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and
their wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram
al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the
center of Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish
neighborhood after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over
the town from the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, more than 200,000
Palestinian residents are living in most other parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu said that he would
like Hebron to be part of the final status arrangements with the
Palestinians, but, at the same time, he also said he would stand
by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following his first ever
meeting with Arafat on September 4, Netanyahu declined to say
whether he would redeploy in Hebron in accordance with the
interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to discuss this issue (of redeployment) in the
steering committee," he told reporters at the press conference
following his meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior PNA source, the meeting between Arafat
and Mordechai Wednesday will be held at the Erez checkpoint
between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was originally scheduled for last Sunday, but was
later postponed due to Arafat's busy schedule last week, which
included a two-day official visit to Japan and the participation
in a meeting of the Arab League's foreign ministers in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the Wednesday's meeting will be the Israeli
army's redeployment in Hebron, the closure on the Palestinian
self-rule areas, combating terrorism, prisoner releases and a
security arrangement at the Gaza airport.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first meeting between Arafat and
Mordechai, a former retired army general who had spent over
30 years in the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, just prior to the meeting between
Arafat and Netanyahu, the Israeli defense minister said that
Israel's new leadership should have met with the Palestinians
much earlier.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Defense Minister Leaves S. Arabia for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Defense Minister
Sheikh Ahmed Al-Humoud Al-Sabah left Saudi western Red Sea coast
city of Jeddah today for the Bahraini Capital of Manama after
delivering a message from Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah to Saudi King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
The minister arrived in Jeddah Monday to explain to Saudi
government officials Kuwait's decision on acceptance of additional
U.S. troops in its territory, according to the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He is on a tour of the other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states to inform their leaders of the Kuwaiti position.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister conveyed the message during a meeting with
Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defense and Aviation
Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
This move came within the framework of consultation and
coordination between the leaderships of the two countries, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
It said the Saudi prince expressed Riyadh's support for
Kuwait's position on maintaining its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ahmed Al-Humoud's visit was ordered by the Kuwaiti Amir
to inform the Gulf leaders of Kuwait's stance toward what Kuwait
describes as the recent Iraqi threats to the allied troops and
Kuwait. He is also obliged to explain about the measures Kuwait
has adopted with the United States to cope with these developments.
</P>
<P>
In an emergency meeting chaired by the Amir of Kuwait Monday,
the cabinet and commanders of the Kuwait armed forces agreed to
the deployment of more U.S. troops in Kuwait as part of the
defense agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait now hosts 1,200 U.S. troops and some heavy armored
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ahmed Al-Humoud's Gulf tour will also take him to
other three GCC states, namely, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman and Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Britain Backs S. Africa's War Against Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The British government
has provided 12 million U.S. Dollars to Pretoria for combating
crime since Nelson Mandela was elected president in South
Africa's first democratic poll in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the British Embassy in the
capital Pretoria today, aid has been provided in South Africa's
law enforcement, and the customs and drugs controls.
</P>
<P>
"Good governance is a priority for the British assistance,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The law enforcement support was focused on community policing
in South Africa's provinces of Western Cape, Eastern Cape, the
Free State and North West where crimes are going rampant.
</P>
<P>
A British superintendent was sent to Western Cape, together
with some financial donation, to help set up 186 community
policing forums throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
The British government also funded a National Re-orientation
Training Program for the South African police, providing training
to the police officers around the country.
</P>
<P>
And a major Customs Enforcement Project was set up in South
Africa, allowing 11 British customs officers to help the South
African Revenue Service improve revenue collection and border
controls.
</P>
<P>
"Other priority areas included the development of small
enterprises, the private sector, health, education, natural
resources and the rural economy," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's government has been taking harsh measures to fight
against all sorts of crime in the country since the beginning of
the year.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: History is Mirror, Marking "September 18" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The bombardment of a railway
section in Shenyang, Liaoning province, by Japanese soldiers on
the night of September 18, 1931, heralded the start of Japan's
military invasion of China and its war of aggression against China.
</P>
<P>
In turn, this incident triggered China's 14-year heroic war
against fascist aggression.
</P>
<P>
From September 18, 1931 until August 15, 1945 when Japan
surrendered unconditionally, Japanese troops brought unprecedented
sufferings to the people of Asia through their military aggression
against China and other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
In China alone, 35 million people were killed or wounded by the
invading Japanese troops. The Japanese aggressors caused economic
losses of more than 600 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan's notorious crimes turned China and the rest of the world
against it. Its aggression was doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
This period in history provides an important lesson for the
world.
</P>
<P>
Today, when we commemorate the 65th anniversary of the
September 18 Incident, we should be on our guard against any
possible repeat of past tragedies.
</P>
<P>
Regretfully, since the end of World War II, Japanese right-wing
politicians have refused to admit Japan's history of aggression.
</P>
<P>
They have fabricated lies, distorted facts, whitewashed the war
of invasion, lavished praise on war criminals and denied the
barbarous crimes the Japanese troops committed during the war.
</P>
<P>
In textbooks, they referred to their "aggression" as "entry"
into other countries. They also denied the 1937
Nanjing Massacre, in which 300,000 Chinese were slaughtered, ever
took place.
</P>
<P>
They even spread the fallacy that Asia could not enjoy
independence without the "Great East Asian War," the name Japan
gave to its war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
On August 15 this year, the 51st anniversary of Japan's defeat
in World War II, several Japanese cabinet ministers and scores of
Diet (parliament) members, one on the coat tails of the other,
paid homage to so-called Japanese war heroes at the Yasukuni
Shrine where the memorial plaques of seven class-A war criminals,
including wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo, are enshrined.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-five years have passed since the September 18 Incident,
and more than half a century since Japan surrendered in
1945. People wonder why some Japanese politicians still insist on
indulging in the fantasy of reviving the old militarist dream of
building the so-called "Great East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere," a
region in east and south east Asia under Japanese rule.
</P>
<P>
After World War II, the Far East International Military
Tribunal sentenced some class-A Japanese war criminals, including
wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo, to death.
</P>
<P>
But the United States, to meet its own strategic needs, adopted
a special propping policy on the defeated country and failed to
implement a resolution of strictly punishing war criminals and
thoroughly investigate and criticize the towering crimes of
Japanese militarism.
</P>
<P>
This U.S. policy merely stored up trouble for the future. Under
the U.S. shield, many war criminals who should have been
prosecuted escaped punishment. Some of them returned to the
country's military, political and financial circles and even took
up important positions. They never missed an opportunity to
distort history and justify their invasion.
</P>
<P>
At present, Japan, which is not satisfied with being an
economic power, is quickening its pace toward becoming a
political and military powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
Flaunting the banner of "self-defense", Japan has re-armed and
reinforced its military strength. Japan has been upgrading
equipment in its Self-Defense Forces, some of which is on a par
with that of the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Japan's military expenditure was the second highest in
the world at 50 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan has expanded the objectives and range of the 1951
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty from safeguarding Japan's security to
safeguarding that of the whole Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese politicians trying to distort history and justify
their 1931 invasion have been encouraged by these actions.
</P>
<P>
It is a indisputable fact that the war launched by Japan half a
century ago has inflicted terrible suffering on the Chinese and
the people of other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
As the 21st century approaches, the people of Asia are watching
closely the policies Japan will adopt in the next millenium.
</P>
<P>
Adopting a policy of peaceful development or returning to the
old way of militarism will be a key dilemma facing Japanese
politicians.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan are close neighbors separated only by a narrow
stretch of water. Developing good-neighborly and friendly
bilateral cooperative relations is in the interests of the two
peoples and will benefit peace and development in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts made by some Chinese and Japanese
politicians, Sino-Japanese relations are on the whole healthy and
stable.
</P>
<P>
The two governments and peoples should treasure their
hard-earned friendly relations and strive to maintain peaceful,
friendly and cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
China, which has attached great importance to developing
Sino-Japanese relations, hopes the Japanese government will draw
lessons from history and win the trust of the Asian people
through actions rather than words.

<HEADLINE> EU Participates in US-Japan Auto Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
is to take part in car talks between the US and Japan in San
Fransisco this week, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first annual meeting, provided for by the
bilateral Automotive Framework Agreement signed by the United
States and Japan in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
The EC's participation follows intensive talks with both the
U.S. and Japanese governments. The EC wants tomake sure that
European automobile and auto part companies are not discriminated
against.
</P>
<P>
The talks, on September 18-19 will focus on implementing all
measures concerning access to the Japanese market of cars and car
parts and purchases of parts in the US by Japanese car
transplants established there.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the EC's participation, Sir Leon Brittan, EU
Trade Commissioner, said, "Our objective is to ensure that the
Agreement is being implemented on a most-favoured-nation basis and
that there is no discrimination against the commercial interests
of European automobile and auto part companies."
</P>
<P>
According to EU figures, Japan's imports of cars have been
increasing for more than 30 months and account for about 8.6
percent of the total passenger car market.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the largest exporter to Japan with 5.5 percent of the
market (compared to 5.3 percent in 1995 and 4.3 percent in 1994),
followed by the US with 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
A key issue in the talks will be the evolution of the
distribution system in Japan and the opening up of domestic
dealerships to sell foreign cars.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the EC has taken part directly in
the monitoring session of a US-Japan framework agreement. In other
bilateral agreements, the EC has had to rely on subsequent
meetings with the Japanese authorities to assess the impact of
US-Japanese agreements.

<HEADLINE> EC Rejects British Bid to Cut Mad Cow Cull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- European Commission (EC)
farming ministers today rejected a British bid to reduce the cull
of cattle most at risk from mad cow disease, an EC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said European Union (EU) Agriculture Commissioner
Franz Fischler was concerned about British plans to cut down on
the slaughter scheme, part of a package agreed by EU heads of
state at their June summit in Florence, Italy, aimed at gradually
lifting the ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
EC agriculture spokesman Gerard Kiely was speaking after British
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg had reported to EU farm ministers
on new scientific findings that mad cow disease is likely to die
out naturally in about five years.
</P>
<P>
Because of this report by Oxford University, the British
government wants to cut the number of cattle to be killed.
</P>
<P>
But Fischler argued that the study could not be used as an
excuse to reduce the size of the cull.
</P>
<P>
An Irish spokesman quoted Irish Farm Minister Ivan Yates as
saying that there was an EU procedure for reviewing scientific
data and that meanwhile the Florence agreement should be
implemented. Ireland currently holds the EU rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day EU Farm Minister Council Meeting which ended
here today, the Ministers agreed on the need to raise
intervention ceilings on beef as a short-term measure, but they
attacked EC proposals to pay grain farmers less so beef farmers
could get more money to help them cope with the mad cow crisis.

<HEADLINE> Japan Faces Serious Choice: People's Daily Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily will carry a
commentator's article tomorrow titled "Japan Faces Serious
Choice", to mark the 65th anniversary of the 'September 18th
Incident', in 1931.
</P>
<P>
The article says that on that day 65 years ago Japanese troops
began an invasion of three northeast China provinces, which was
the beginning of Japanese aggression in China.
</P>
<P>
The article says that to review this part of history and draw
lessons from it is significant in safeguarding and developing
Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
It points out that, since the Meiji Restoration, Japan was
involved in a series of wars of aggression against China.
</P>
<P>
For 14 years after the September 18th Incident, the Japanese
invaders caused incredible suffering and losses to the
Chinese. Some 35 million people were killed or wounded by the
Japanese troops, who caused 600 billion US dollars worth of losses
in China. The Japanese imperialists owed the Chinese people an
immense debt that they can never pay off, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
The article makes it clear that China's attitude toward this
part of history is well known: the Japanese aggression caused
grievous disasters to the Chinese people, and to the Japanese as
well.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Grants $3.6 Million Aid to Iraqi Refugees in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has allocated 3.6 million
U.S. dollars to assist some 40,000 Iraqi refugees who have fled to
Iran to escape the fighting between Kurdish factions in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The money was released from the UNHCR emergency fund and will
be used to provide relief supplies such as tents, blankets,
stoves, and plastic sheeting to the refugees, a UNHCR press
official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
She said the agency could not confirm reports of a massive
exodus from the eastern Afghan town of Jalalabad, saying UNHCR had
not seen a massive increase in arrivals in nearby Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Jalalabad is currently under the control of the rebel Taleban
militia and was bombed by Afghan government jets on Sunday. The UNHCR
press official said the situation in the city was now peaceful.
</P>
<P>
The press official also said the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) and UN international staff have left the town
with local staff remaining to manage camps for the internally
displaced persons (IDPs). She said new local authorities have
assured continued support for the UN IDP camps.

<HEADLINE> UK Urged to Drop Demands over Open Skies Deal with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain would have to drop its
insistence that foreign airlines be allowed to fly within the U.S.
if it wants to strike an open skies agreement with the United
States, according to Robert Crandall, chairman of the American
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Crandall, who is in London for talks with British Airways (BA)
and British government ministers, was quoted by local press
reports as saying that the U.S. government has already agreed
similar treaties with Germany and other European countries and
there was no prospect of a different deal with Britain.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government has signed these agreements with a
substantial number of European countries and it can not do a deal
with the UK government which is materially different," Crandall
said.
</P>
<P>
Crandall also threatened to pull out of the proposed alliance
between BA and the American Airlines if talks between London and
Washington failed to make any further progress, by saying that the
open skies agreement was essential before the planned alliance
went ahead.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the two countries broke down last month as
the British side resisted U.S. demands that its carriers be given
the right to fly to third countries from British airports, the
so-called "beyond rights".
</P>
<P>
British officials have previously made it clear that Britain
would not grant "beyond rights" for any American passenger
flights, which allow U.S. carriers to fly within the European
Union market, while foreign airlines do not have the right to fly
between two points in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Washington has demanded an open skies agreement with Britain
before it gives the green light to the proposed alliance between
BA and the American Airlines, which is expected to create the
world's most powerful aviation partnership.

<HEADLINE> Greek Universities Accept More Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Education Minister
George Papandreou said today that 3,302 high-school graduates who
failed to qualify for university places in the Summer examinations
would be allowed to enroll in certain departments from September 25
to October 11.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministry would pay universities some 400
million drachmas (about 170 million U.S. dollars) in subsidies for
the additional students.
</P>
<P>
He said by accepting these young people into the universities,
they will realize their dream to enter higher education and will
prevent them from going abroad to do so.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou at the same time promised that all candidates who
had got into university according to the original exam results
would keep their seats and, under certain circumstances, might
even get better places.
</P>
<P>
In Greece today, on average one out of four high-school
graduates have chances to go to the universities every year and
the competition is fierce.
</P>
<P>
Some 40,000 high-school graduates have entered universities
throughout the country this year.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that he intended to increase the number of
university and polytechnic students by 30 percent within the next
three years.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Holdings to Sponsor Stewart Grand Prix Team Ltd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- HSBC Holdings plc today
announced that it is to sponsor the Stewart-Ford Formula One Team
for five years. The total value of the sponsorship for the 1997
through 2001 seasons is 25 million pounds (37.5 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
This represents the first time that HSBC Holdings plc, one of
the world's leading international banking and financial services
organizations, has committed backing of this scale over such a
prolonged period to a Formula One sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
Making the announcement at a press conference here today, Sir
William Purves, HSBC Group Chairman, said: "This sponsorship is a
first for us and the international financial sector at large, in
terms of its magnitude and duration."
</P>
<P>
Stewart Ford will campaign two Ford Zetec-R Vl0 powered cars in
the 1997 FIA Formula One World Championship. The team will make
its debut at the opening round in Melbourne, Australia, in March,
according to the chairman.
</P>
<P>
"Jackie Stewart and Ford are recognized throughout the world
and, given the commitment of our organizations and our shared
pioneering approach, I am confident of the Team's prospects," Sir
Purves said.
</P>
<P>
Jackie Stewart won three Formula One world championships (1969,
1971 and 1973)on board Ford-powered cars, recording 27 Grand Prix
victories out of the 99 Grand Prix he contested, in a Formula One
career lasting nine years.
</P>
<P>
Since retiring in 1973, Jackie Stewart has become a successful
international businessman, with many prestigious multi-national
corporations. He has been under contract to Ford for almost 32
years.
</P>
<P>
The former triple world champion also said at the press
conference: "Formula One racing is one of the truly glamorous and
exciting sports and I am very pleased to have the support of such
a prestigious and innovative organizations as HSBC Holdings."

<HEADLINE> New Measures Taken to Improve Security at Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW PORT, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey, which is responsible for the administration
of airports, has taken new measures to improve security at all
three major airports in the region--Kennedy International Airport,
Newark Airport and Laguardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
Under the new measures, all airport security workers will be
required to obtain identification badges from the Port
Authority;there will be a 10 year employment history check for
anyone hired to operate baggage screening machines; outside
experts are being hired to review airport security on a regular
basis, both at areas controlled by the Port Authority and areas
under control of the airlines; teams of bomb-detecting dogs are
being established to patrol airport grounds and terminals.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive upgrade of all aspects of security at the
airports is in response to the repeated criticisms of security at
Kennedy International Airport after the crash of a Trans World
Airlines flight which exploded moments after taking off from
Kennedy Airport on July 17, this year.
</P>
<P>
While a cause of the explosion has not been officially
determined, investigators believe that the ill-fated Boeing 747
was brought down by a bomb hidden in the passenger cabin. So,
Airport security has been a subject of heightened national
concern. Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton asked Congress for
about 250 million u.s. dollars in new spending for a variety of
measures to improve security at airports nationwide.

<HEADLINE> 50th Session of General Assembly Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The 50th session of
the U.N. General Assembly was closed on Monday, with the outgoing
president of the General Assembly calling for support of the world
organization.
</P>
<P>
The 50th session of the General Assembly was marked by the
largest ever gathering of world leaders during a three-day special
commemorative meeting, at which member states pledged to give the
21st century a United Nations equipped, financed and structured to
serve its peoples.
</P>
<P>
However the session was also marked by the serious financial
crisis of the United Nations. With the United States, the largest
contributor, owing 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, the United Nations
has been experiencing financial crisis after financial crisis in
the year past.
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenge of the fund shortage, the organization
has undergone a series of reform to cut costs and improve
efficiency. In the past year, it achieved in cutting the staff by
10 per cent.
</P>
<P>
"Cost-cutting and productivity gains are thus welcome, but
should not be sought for their own sake," said General Assembly
President Freitas Do Amaral, referring the the current reform
underway to save money.
</P>
<P>
He said that comparatively speaking, the U.N.'s budget is
really quite small when compared to those of national governments.
</P>
<P>
"So any reforms in the administrative structure of the
organization must result in real advantage and no just seek to cut
the budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the current financial crisis, he said it was unprecedented
and had jeopardized the work of this organization and threatened
to bring it to a halt.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is not acceptable," he said. "It should be
remembered, and repeated again and again, that payment of assessed
contribution is a freely accepted responsibility and a duty of all
states, large or small, and they must be paid in full, on time and
without conditions."
</P>
<P>
In spite of the financial difficulties, the Untied Nations has
been working hard to adapt itself to the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Under my chairmanship or coordination, five Working Groups
have been vigorously tackling the vital questions which hold the
key to strengthening the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the adoption by a significant majority only
last week of the text of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Let us hope that it will be a true gift of our generation to
future generations and to a better world," he said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Blasts Syria for Pressuring Israel with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today accused Syria of applying psychological
pressure on Israel with troops movements in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, Netanyahu said Syria was evidently trying to
pressure Israel to accept the verbal commitments made by former
Labor government to withdraw troops from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
He blasted Damascus for setting conditions on resuming the
peace talks, which he said Israel would not accept.
</P>
<P>
He later told Israel Television that Syria's tactics would
not work as Israeli forces were kept on high alert. "We are
looking carefully what is happening on the Syria's side. We have
extended offers to Syria to resume negotiations, but Syrians
have not responded. And we remain vigilant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu confirmed that indirect contacts were
under way to ease the current tension between Israel and Syria
in a bid to restart the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel had sent messages to Damascus via the
United States and Egypt to the effect that its intentions were
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy also said that Israel would pass
on clear messages to Syria that it was interested in peace and
willing to resume peace talks at any time and in any place.
</P>
<P>
Former premier and now opposition leader Shimon Peres
demanded that the Netanyahu government make decisions to
pursue peace with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters whether a war with Syria was possible,
Peres replied: "Nobody knew ahead of wars." He said that the
government should stop guessing but make decisions to restart
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Former Chief of Staff and Foreign Minister Ehud Barak
expressed concern about a possible escalation of tension, saying
that Hezbollah in south Lebanon might take advantage of the
current tension to drag Israel into war with Syrian troops in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Israeli analysts said that Syrian troops movements were
sparked by the provocative statements of Israeli leaders, who
have warned that if Hezbollah renewed attacks against Israel,
they would also punish the people behind Hezbollah, namely,
Syria.
</P>
<P>
They said that Syria apparently tried to send a message that
lack of progress in the peace talks was a dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny echoed the
views, saying that Israeli leaders should refrain from
provoking Syrians and take real actions to resume peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The current tension between Israel and Syria resulted in
Syrian troops deployment on the Syrian side of Mt. Hermon on the
Golan Heights as well as the move of about 10,000 troops from
Beirut to the Bekka Valley.
</P>
<P>
Israel and U.S. military intelligence have been closely
monitoring the Syrian troops movements to determine Damascus'
real intentions. However, it remained unclear whether the Syrian
move was tied to internal developments in south Lebanon, or
represents a kind of political pressure to Israel.

<HEADLINE> US Rules out Military Confrontation Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A chief diplomat of the
United States in Lebanon ruled out here today a military
confrontation between Syria and Lebanon, and denied that he had
any information on a withdrawal or redeployment of Syrian
troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Richard Jones, U.S. ambassador in Beirut, expressed his
belief that there were "many people in the region," who were
observing from nearby the deployment or redeployment of the
Syrian troops in Lebanon and trying to find out the meaning.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that there was a "tension" in the region and
urged the two sides, Syria and Israel, to pay "special attention"
to the situation.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. diplomat categorically ruled out a war, or a
military confrontation, between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that more than 10,000 of Syria's
estimated 35,000 troops in Lebanon have redeployed "defensively"
near the Syrian border in recent weeks, and the eastward
movement was still underway on the weekend without any official
explanation.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's An-Nahar daily attributed the redeployment to
perceived threats of an Israeli attack.
</P>
<P>
It said that most of the redeployed troops had taken up
positions in the mountain range on the Syrian border, where the
Syrian army had SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles and anti-aircraft
gun batteries installed.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian troop movement began last month when they left a
number of positions in the central Lebanese mountains in what
Lebanese security sources called a "defensive redeployment" after
apparent Israeli threats to attack Syrian forces in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It became more visible in the past week with the Syrians
pulling out of several landmark positions they occupied for years
in and around Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Despite the pullouts, Syrian troops are still stationed
in the Lebanese capital and are highly visible in some areas,
including Shiite Moslem suburbs, which are a stronghold of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Slashes Private Radio, TV Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government
decided today to give licenses to 15 private radio and television
stations to broadcast and ordered other private stations to cease
transmission.
</P>
<P>
At its first meeting since the country's general election, in
which pro-government candidates scored an overwhelming victory,
the Council of Ministers made the decision, which was based on a
report prepared by a government-appointed special committee.
</P>
<P>
Four television stations licensed by the cabinet are Future
TV owned by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, NBN, which House
Speaker Nabih Berri is planed to set up, MTV owned by a brother
of Deputy Prime Minister Michel Al-Murr and LBCI, Lebanon's
major private station.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Radios, which received the licenses, were divided into
the first class, which was allowed to broadcast political news
and recreational programs, and the second class, which was
allowed to broadcast music and other non-political programs.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet banned other private radio and television
stations, whose applications were turned down, from broadcasting
political programs as from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, it allowed them to reclarify their qualifications to
the National Committee before the deadline of November 30.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through the state-run Lebanese National
News Agency this evening, the committee listed the 40 radio and
television stations whose applications were refused and specified
the reasons for the refusal.
</P>
<P>
The number of private televisions in Lebanon, a country with
a population of some 3,500,000, is estimated at about 40, in
addition to 150 radio stations.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Defense Minister Ends Visit to Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Defense Minister
Sheikh Ahmed Al-Humoud Al-Sabah left Manama this evening winding
up a brief visit to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from the Bahraini capital said that the
Kuwaiti minister, who arrived in Manama earlier today, handed over
a message to the Amir of Bahrain Sheikh Isa Bin Suleiman
al-Khalifa from Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The message reportedly deals with the existing fraternal
relations between the two Gulf Emirates, the latest developments
in the region in the light of the events in Iraq and preparations
taken by Kuwait with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister arrived in Jeddah Monday to explain to
Saudi government officials Kuwait's decision on acceptance of
additional U.S. troops in its territory. He is currently on a tour
of the other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states to inform their
leaders of the Kuwaiti position.
</P>
<P>
This move came within the framework of consultation and
coordination between the leaderships of the two countries, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ahmed Al-Humoud's visit was ordered by the Kuwaiti Amir
to inform the Gulf leaders of Kuwait's stance toward what Kuwait
describes as the recent Iraqi threats to the allied troops and
Kuwait. He is also obliged to explain about the measures Kuwait
has adopted with the United States to cope with these developments.
</P>
<P>
In an emergency meeting chaired by the Amir of Kuwait Monday,
the cabinet and commanders of the Kuwait armed forces agreed to
the deployment of more U.S. troops in Kuwait as part of the
defense agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait now hosts 1,200 U.S. troops and some heavy armored
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ahmed Al-Humoud's Gulf tour will also take him to
other three GCC states, namely, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman and Qatar.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Up in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production
rose by 0.5 percent in August following a small increase of 0.1
percent in July, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed said that output at the nation's factories, mines
and utilities was much stronger than the anemic growth in July.
</P>
<P>
It said that factory production increased 0.3 percent in
August, the same as the July advance, despite a 700,000 drop in
motor vehicle output to a 12.6 million unit annual rate. Excluding
motor vehicles, industrial production rose by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Output of durable goods, such as cars and other products
expected to last more than three years, also advanced by 0.3
percent for a second straight month. There were large increases in
production of computer and office equipment as well as aerospace
and miscellaneous transportation equipment.
</P>
<P>
But production of nondurable goods such as chemicals and
clothing slowed to a 0.2 percent gain from a 0.3 percent increase
in July. Nondurable output had been flat in June.
</P>
<P>
Production at the nation's mines shot up 2.4 percent in August,
more than erasing a 1 percent decline a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production in August was 3.4 percent higher than a
year earlier, the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production report contained little sign of
inflation pressures. It said the nation's industries were
operating at 83.5 percent of capacity, up from 83.3 percent in
July and matching June's rate.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economists are divided on whether the U.S. Fed would
increase the short-tern rates to cool down the economy. There have
been signs of a slowdown, leading some analysts to predict the Fed
will leave rates unchanged for now. But others believe the Fed
will raise rates at its Sept. 24 meeting as the U.S. economy is
not slowing down enough to keep prices under control.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Swiss President of Federal Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERNE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader said
here today that China's policy of reform and opening to the
outside world should not be changed and is unchangeable.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, said that the reform and open
policy has benefited the Chinese people and therefore won the
sincere support and endorsement from them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the policy has prospered China's economy, channeled
China's economic life into the world market in an overall way and
made it possible for China to draw on the useful experience from
other countries, said Li, who is on an official and good-will
visit to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Jean-Pascal Delamura, president of the
Federal Council of Switzerland, Li said that the Chinese
government has always respected the peaceful policy of neutrality
the Swiss government has been implementing and appreciated the
positive role Swiss has played in the international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and Switzerland have much in common and
similarities in many major international issues and share much
interest in maintaining world peace and promoting human
development.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China is willing to make concerted efforts together
with the Swiss government to establish a long-term bilateral
relationship of friendly cooperation based on mutual respects,
equality and mutual benefits, he added.
</P>
<P>
On domestic situation, Li said that China has made universally
acknowledged achievements since it started to implement the reform
and open policy 18 years ago, and it also came across some
problems and difficulties, which should by no means be ignored and
must be resolved in real earnest.
</P>
<P>
The problems and difficulties, emerged in the process of the
advancement, are unavoidable for such a country as China with 1.2
billion people to undertake such a profound social change, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the chairman said, such problems or difficulties
will never change China's choice or its orientation of reform and
opening to the outside.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese leadership with Jiang Zemin at its
core is united, firm and powerful, and it is determined to
implement Deng Xiaoping's theory of building the socialism with
the Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The leadership is totally capable of pushing forward China's
reform, opening to the outside and the modernization drive, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Delamura said that China's achievements in various fields
especially in economy has proved it is a right road Switzerland
has taken in developing its friendly cooperation with China for
years.
</P>
<P>
The road is becoming wider, while the cooperation becoming more
comprehensive, he said, and China has provided sound investment
climate for business people from foreign countries including
Switzerland, and this is also beneficial to China.
</P>
<P>
He said that Switzerland support China's access to the World
Trade Organization and it believes that the WTO would be
incomplete with China's involvement.
</P>
<P>
The development of China, which has one-fourth of the world
population, is just a major contribution to the world peace and
its balanced development, Delamura said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li also told Delamura that China is
awaiting his upcoming official visit to China next month.

BERNE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan met here today with Jean-Francois
Leuba, president of Swiss National Council, and Otto Schoch,
president of Swiss Council of States.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li said that China's friendship and
cooperation with Switzerland has been expanding and deepening over
recent years, and the understanding between the peoples of the two
countries has been promoted.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is on an official and good-will visit to Switzerland,
said that he hopes his current visit would further enhance
understanding between the two countries so as to jointly explore
new ways for furthering bilateral friendship and cooperation in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that more exchange channels and more contacts should be
established between countries in a bid to deepen their common
understanding.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC is willing to establish and develop ties with the
Swiss parliament and organizations in various circles, Li said,
such ties are not only part of the friendly exchanges between the
peoples of the two countries, but also beneficial to creating more
favorable conditions for the exchanges between the peoples.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes more Swiss parliament members and friends from
other circles to visit China so as to make joint efforts to push
forward the overall development of bilateral relations, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Denies US Pressures on Egypt to Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has denied that the United States applied pressures on
Egypt to hold a regional economic conference as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the London-based Arabic-language newspaper
Al-Hayat, Mubarak said that the United States understands Egypt's
stand that the convocation of the Middle East and North Africa
Economic Summit is linked to progress in the Middle East peace
process. The interview will be published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, however, reiterated that Egypt preferred not to
postpone the conference although the atmosphere of Arab-Israeli
cooperation is unfavorable at present. The conference is
scheduled to be held in Cairo on November 12-14.
</P>
<P>
He said in the interview, carried today by Egypt's news agency
MENA, that he does not want anybody to capitalize on the
postponement of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said last week that Egypt was determined to hold the
conference on schedule, but noted that Israel and the U.S. are
required to help in making the gathering successful.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with the newspaper, Mubarak again urged Israel
and the U.S. to assist in securing the success of the summit by
moving positively to change the present atmosphere and restore
"mutual confidence-building measures undermined by Israel's tough
rhetoric."
</P>
<P>
"In case the economic conference was held and did not succeed,
it would be of no value," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Jerusalem, he said that a formula acceptable to
all parties concerned should be reached because the issue is very
sensitive for followers of various religions.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue is believed to be the thorniest one in
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. Israel regards the city, which is
holy to Christians, Moslems and Jews, as its eternal and
indivisible capital, while the Palestinians want it to be the
capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi situation, the president said that he is against
partition of Iraq, "because this would extremely shake regional
balance and lead to wars."
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt has told the U.S. that strikes and
killings of innocent people do not lead to a result and a peaceful
solution is the only way out to solve the Iraqi problem.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched two missile attacks on Iraq earlier
this month and has not ruled out the possibility of a third
strike.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the assassination attempt on his life in Addis Ababa
last year, Mubarak said information obtained from terrorists
proved Iran's involvement in the incident.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Expresses Sorrow at Civil Clash Toll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A South African
government delegation to the Lesotho highlands water project
today expressed sorrow at the deaths caused by violence between
the Lesotho mountain police and workers at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Five people died and 13 were hospitalized when the police,
following a court order to evacuate protesting workers from a
work camp in northern Buthabuthe of Lesotho, opened fire on 2,000
striking workers, reported the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, the Department of Water
Affairs and Forestry said: "We express our condolences with the
the bereaved families who have lost their next of kin and wish
the injured a speedy and full recovery."
</P>
<P>
"We firmly support all efforts by the Lesotho Highlands
Development Authority to ensure that the rights and well-being of
the workers are protected," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The department also said it was well aware of the seriousness
of the delicate situation at present, and appealed to all parties
to resolve the issues in the orderly manner in which they were
being conducted before the violence began.
</P>
<P>
The weekend clashes in Buthabuthe started after a
confrontation between the armed forces and the water projected
workers who went to the work camp to collect their terminal pay
following their participation in an earlier wild-cat strike for
higher pay.
</P>
<P>
Those dismissed Lesotho highlands water project workers were
reportedly demanding to be paid the same hourly rates as
foreigners and protested against racial discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Deployment Order in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton said today that he has signed deployment orders sending
3,500 troops to Kuwait to reinforce the no-fly zone near Iraq and
carry out his plan to "keep Saddam Hussein in a box."
</P>
<P>
The president said he authorized the deployment last weekend
and the orders were signed Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"The response we gave was designed to improve the strategic
position of the United States and our allies to keep Saddam
Hussein in a box and limit his ability to threaten his neighbors,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton confirmed the deployment after meeting with
congressional leaders to explain the administration's actions
against Iraq as "entirely appropriate under the circumstances."
</P>
<P>
By announcing his signing of the deployment order, Clinton is
seeking to dispel criticism of his policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have complained they have not been consulted on
Iraq, and charged that Clinton has not held the international
alliance together as the former Bush administration did in the
Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 U.S. soldiers were at Fort Hood, Texas, waiting for
a departure order for Kuwait to stage a new round of desert
exercises. There are already 1,200 American troops there taking
part in a military exercise, called "Intrinsic Action."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait agreed Monday to permit several thousand U.S. troops to
deploy near the Iraqi border.

<HEADLINE> Credit Card Delinquencies in US Hit Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The American Bankers
Association (ABA) reported today that credit card delinquencies in
the U.S. reached a record 3.66 percent during the second quarter
of this year, up from 3.53 percent in the first three months.
</P>
<P>
The ratio was the highest since the ABA began tracking payments
overdue for 30 or more days in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The increase came despite U.S. banks are tightening loan
standards in recent months.
</P>
<P>
In addition to credit card delinquencies, an ABA survey found
that 2.32 percent of eight types of closed-end installment loans
were past due in the second quarter, up from 2.14 percent in the
January-March quarter.
</P>
<P>
The delinquencies of these loans, which include auto loans,
were also higher than the 1.95 delinquency rate in the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The ABA noted that consumer borrowing has been rising sharply
for three years because rising debt makes consumers more
vulnerable to economic downswings.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that borrowing would slow because of U.S. banks'
stricter lending standards.
</P>
<P>
But it said consumer spending -- about two-thirds of the U.S.
economic activity -- was not in danger.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also reported last
week that banks suffered 3.8 billion dollars in losses on credit
card and consumer loans in the second quarter, up by 36 percent
from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the heavy burden of debt on U.S. consumers
will result in a slowdown of U.S. economy in the second half of
this year and next year.

<P>
HARARE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing world solar
summit here this evening adopted the "Harare Declaration on Solar
Energy and Sustainable Development", calling for the commitments
of all countries to the wider use of renewable energy resources.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the summit recognizes the role of solar
and other sources of renewable energy such as wind, geothermal,
hydro, biomass and oceanic energies in the provision of energy
services and in the improvement of people's life.
</P>
<P>
It also recognizes that the increased use of solar energy and
other renewable energy sources can reduce environmental
degradation caused by adverse human activities, such as
industrial pollution and deforestation.
</P>
<P>
The declaration appeals to all the countries to attach
importance to the development and utilization of renewable energy
sources and integrate and specify them in their national energy
policies.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also invites the United Nations,
inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations, academic
and research institutions and the private sector to join in the
exploitation and use of the renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
The declaration reiterates its support for the principles and
actions for the promotion of energy systems for sustainable
development recommended by the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on
June 3-14, 1992.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Perot Should Not Be Invited to Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Reform Party presidential
candidate Ross Perot should be excluded from this fall's
presidential debates because he does not have a realistic chance
of winning the election, said the bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates today.
</P>
<P>
The panel voted unanimously to recommend that Perot and Reform
Party running mate Pat Choate should not be invited to the debates.
</P>
<P>
Perot's national coordinator, Russell Verney, called the
decision a "travesty" and threatened to challenge it in a federal
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
While the Dole campaign welcomed the decision as the only fair
outcome, the Clinton campaign called the ruling regrettable and
said it would continue to push for Perot's participation in talks
with Dole negotiators later today.
</P>
<P>
Former Republican Party chief Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., commission
co-chairman, said the decision was based on an "unvarnished" view
of Perot's chances -- given his current poll standings as well as
his showing as an independent candidate in 1992, when he won 19
percent of the popular vote but not a single electoral vote.
</P>
<P>
The commission admitted that public opinion polls find a clear
majority of Americans in favor of Perot's participation, and
Fahrenkopf said the panel could re-open the Perot question "if
circumstances change at any time after the first debate."
</P>
<P>
Verney said after the commission news conference, "We've
overcome enormous hurdles that the two-political-party system has
put in our way over the last year. We'll overcome this hurdle
also."
</P>
<P>
The commission, headed by two former party chairmen, has
recommended three debates between the presidential candidates and
one vice presidential forum.

<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo met here this evening with a delegation from the Tokyo
Junior Chamber Incorporation (TJC), led by its Chief of Directors
Etami Taro, as guests of the All-China Youth Federation.
</P>
<P>
Also present was Okuyama Tadashi, honorary president of TJC's
Japan-China Friendship Association and honorary adviser to the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Wu praised Okuyama Tadashi and other friends of the TJC for
their efforts at promoting friendship between the youth of the two
countries, saying, "we should face the existing problems in
bilateral relations from the perspective of maintaining
Sino-Japanese relations, and educate the younger generation of
both countries on how to view the war of aggression which was
launched by Japanese militarists and which caused great suffering
for both the Chinese and Japanese."
</P>
<P>
Only by bearing these lessons in mind to prevent a recurrence
of the tragedy, and through co-operation, peace, and development,
can the security and prosperity of China and Japan, and the
Asia-Pacific region be ensured, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Etami Taro said that the TJC will continue to make an effort to
increase exchanges between the youth of the two countries. He
noted that Japan's younger generation, who have no knowledge of
the Second World War, should study history and have a correct
understanding of it, adding that they must not forget the painful
historical lessons.
</P>
<P>
Wu also briefed the Japanese visitors on China's reforms and
opening-up drive, and China's economic development.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Expresses Satisfaction at Outcome of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi media today praised
the fruitful outcome of the Arab foreign ministers meeting
concluded in Cairo Sunday, especially the Arab consensus on
supporting Iraq against the attempt to partition Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi newspaper Al-Thawra today published an article, in
which it said that all Arabs voiced their support for Iraq and
rejected any interference in Iraqi internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that Iraq looks forward to further such Arab
stands, which are likely to bring inter-Arab relations to
normalcy.
</P>
<P>
Another Iraqi newspaper, Babel, also welcomed Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid's denunciation of the
U.S. aggression on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Though Iraq withdrew the question of U.S. aggression from the
agenda of the Arab foreign ministers meeting to preclude any
political maneuvers, the denunciation of the attempts to
partition Iraq and infringe its sovereignty and territorial
integrity was among the key resolutions of the meeting, Babel
said in an article today.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed Al-Sahaf, who just
returned from the session of the Arab foreign ministers, said
Tuesday that the final statement of the meeting stressed the need
for the preservation of Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
He said that the statement also expressed concern about the
recent development of events in Iraq as a result of foreign
intervention, which threatens Iraq's unity, security and
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Food and Human Rights Discussed At 96th IPU Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the 96th
Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union reached a consensus
when they decided that, with free trade and economic
globalization, every person on the earth should enjoy the right to
food and that this is an urgent task.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization show that 800 million people in the world suffer
from food shortages, more than 200 million of whom are
malnourished children below the age of five.
</P>
<P>
Lee Dong Bok, a delegate of the Republic of Korea, said that
the majority of these people live in developing countries, and
should be given priority in help given by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese legislator, He Kang, said that increasing
international co-operation in food and agriculture is one
effective means of solving the world's grain problem.
</P>
<P>
The international community, especially developed countries,
should make it their duty to offer agricultural technology and
funds to developing countries and increase food aid to them.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Armando Becerra, a parliamentarian from Argentina, said
that developing countries themselves should formulate policies for
increasing grain production, and should encourage people to use
advanced agricultural techniques to reduce the number of poor
people, using their own resources.
</P>
<P>
Conference members also worked on the draft of a resolution
entitled "Promoting Greater Respect and Protection of Human Rights
in General and in Particular for Women and Children".
</P>
<P>
A draft resolution on human rights, presented by the delegation
of China, became the basis of a resolution of the conference by
winning overwhelming majority votes.

<HEADLINE> Bird Colonies Hit By Sea Empress Oil Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The oil tanker disaster off
the coast of South Wales in February this year has led to a near
50 percent drop in the number of breeding seabirds in the area, a
report said today.
</P>
<P>
The Sea Empress tanker poured some 70,000 tons of oil into the
sea after running aground near Milford Haven in one of Britain's
worst oil disasters.
</P>
<P>
In and around the areas where oil slicks appeared, some small
colonies have declined by up to 58 percent while bigger colonies
have declined by up to 16 percent, according to surveys published
on Tuesday by the Countryside Council for Wales.
</P>
<P>
The size of bird colonies outside the affected areas have
continued to rise, indicating that the falls are linked to the
tanker disaster rather than bad weather, normal illnesses or a
decline in food reserves.
</P>
<P>
On St Margaret's Island there were 791 breeding guillemots in
1995 but the latest survey shows the number has dropped to 334.
</P>
<P>
At Skomer and Elegug Stacks, more than 2,600 birds have
disappeared, with some colonies down by 16 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bilharzia Swells in Zambia's Border Township </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of cases of
bilharzia in Chililabombwe in Zambia's Copperbelt Province has
swelled to 755 from 440 last week while 467 patients have so far
been treated.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency (ZANA) reported from Chililabombwe today
that an estimated 60 percent of the residents of Kawama, a town
with 700 households in the district, are infected with the
disease which broke out there last month.
</P>
<P>
The local residents contract the disease by coming into
getting water from a nearby stream and a mining dam which have
been found to be heavily infected with parasites that causes
bilharzia.
</P>
<P>
The township is suffering from a grave scarcity of supply of
clean water. "This is why the residents cannot stop going to the
stream and dam to fetch water and bath. These are the only
alternative of water supply and in the end contract bilharzia,"
Musonda Kucha, headmaster of the bilharzia hard-hit Kawama
Primary School which has been forced to close for some time.
</P>
<P>
The government has sent a medical team to combat the disease.
Team leader Mohammed Shehata said the exercise to combat
bilharzia in the area also includes an education campaign on the
danger of bilharzia and how people can avoid contracting it.

<HEADLINE> Spain, Italy Vow to Meet EU Monetary Union Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Spain and Italy vowed today to
meet the European Union (EU) requirements for a unified currency
in order to be among the first EU nations to join the EU Monetary
Union.
</P>
<P>
"Spain is going to do everything possible to be in the first
phase of the Monetary and Economic Union," said Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Aznar at the end of a two-day summit focusing on
European currency convergence.
</P>
<P>
Under the timetable of the Maastricht Treaty on European
unification, the Monetary Union in the 15-nation EU is to be
launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Italy have been viewed as two countries which have
more difficulty in meeting the budget deficit and inflation
requirements necessary to qualify for EU's single currency, to be
called Euro.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht requires that countries must lower their budget
deficits to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to be
qualified for the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Spain's budget deficit was estimated at 6.6 percent of GDP at
the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Aznar's government has taken a number of austerity measures to
cut Spain's public spending since it took in office in May. Those
included a 1.5 billion U.S. dollars cut in spending, a large
reduction of government officials and a wage freeze for all public
servants in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government said it was aiming to lower the deficit in the
1997 budget to three percent of GDP by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Italy at the same time is making similar efforts to catch up
with the Monetary Union deadline.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1997 budget of the government of Prime Minister
Romano Prodi, Italy's deficit is to be lowered from 6.1 percent of
the GDP in 1996 to 4.5 percent in 1997 and to 2.8 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is to be lowered from 3.9 percent in 1996 to 2.5
percent in 1997, and 4.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But both Spain and Italy face tough tasks to achieve the
goals. They further have the arduous job of fighting unemployment,
which is estimated at 22 percent in Spain, one of the highest in
the EU, and 12.2 percent in Italy.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also confronted with the pressures at
home.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll in Spain showed that only 6.3 percent of the
nation's people were interested in the Monetary Union while most
others were opposed to the austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
In Italy, a nation-wide debate argued about whether the country
should resolve its unemployment issue instead of joining in the
Monetary Union. Some suggested changing the the criteria and
timetable for the union.
</P>
<P>
But the EU Commission and the Council of Europe have recently
made it clear that the single currency process would go ahead as
scheduled.

and its status as an international financial center, saying
financial sectors in China's interior and Hong Kong should
increase co-operation and do more work for the smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
the State Council Lu Ping met the delegation.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the total financial reserve of Hong Kong has totaled
170 billion HK dollars, adding that by July 1, 1997, it is
expected to rise by 100 billion HK dollars and reach 270 billion.
</P>
<P>
That 100 billion HK dollars comes from Hong Kong's land fund,
which is managed by the Chinese representatives of the
Sino-British Land Commission entrusted by the Central People's
Government, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said in 1997, the fund will be handed over to the Hong Kong
SAR government so as to increase the stability of the exchange
rate of Hong Kong dollars and the financial strength of the SAR
government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Officials On Use of Overseas Investment in Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Wu Bangguo, vice-premier of
the State Council, sent a letter today to the 3rd National Working
Conference on the Chemical Industry's Opening to the Outside
World, encouraging the industry to open more to the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Wu praised the industry's achievements over the past five
years, while encouraging it to build more export bases and
export-oriented enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, minister of Chemical Industry, said at the
conference that by the end of last year, overseas funds amounted
to six billion US dollars, one-third of that in direct investment.
</P>
<P>
She said that 70 percent of the world's top 25 chemical
corporations have invested in China. In recent years, the country
has had 150 overseas-funded projects, each with an investment of
over 10 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has signed technology co-operation agreements with
eight countries, including the Netherlands, Mexico, Brazil, and
the US.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized that over the next five years the
industry should pay closer attention to the use of overseas
investment because the export-oriented economy is not being
developed just to attract overseas funds and earn foreign
exchange, but to raise domestic enterprises' technology level
through international competition as well.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that efforts should be made to further improve
investment environment in building chemical industry bases, fine
chemical industry cities, and chemical products export bases. The
ministry will help establishing 10 enterprise groups with export
value of 100 million US dollars each, 20 with 50 million US
dollars each, and 30 with 30 million by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Freed U.S. Aid Worker Left Somalia for Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 18 (Xinhua) - A United States aid worker,
freed by Somali gunmen one day after being kidnaped, left here
today for the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, U.S. Embassy officials
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Suther, who was working for the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID) and seized by at least
eight gunmen in North Mogadishu, was freed in the village of
El-Baraf, some 160 km north of the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers said Suther had been flied out of Somalia on a
United Nations World Food Program (WPF) plane to the Kenyan
capital of Nairobi this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, USAID spokeswoman Ann Kittlaus said on Tuesday
that Suther was on contract to USAID and was a member of a
three-person team sent to check on the food situation in North
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
She said the other two members of the team were released and
everyone was safe including Suther.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen disarmed Suther's two Somali guards on Tuesday and
drove off with him and his somali bodyguards towards the coastal
town of Uarsciek, 50 km northeast of the capital.
</P>
<P>
And Ali Mahdi Mohamed, whose Abgal clan alliance controls
North Mogadishu, ordered an Islamic court to seize the kidnapers
and also sent two four-wheel-drive battlewagons to Uarsciek to
recover the American, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Kidnaping and extortion, especially involving staff of foreign
aid agencies, are common in Mogadishu, where weapons are easily
available and unemployment is extremely high since the departure
of the U.N. peacekeeping operation in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, international aid agencies pulled all
foreign staff out of South Mogadishu which has been controlled by
forces loyal to faction leader Hussein Aideed, son of the former
warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of the city which has been under the control
of Ali Mahdi's forces who enforce the Islamic Sharia law, was
widely considered far less dangerous for foreigners than the
southern part.
</P>
<P>
Islamic courts have been increasing their scope of rule in
recent months. And earlier this month, they ordered that foreign
aid workers and journalists based in North Mogadishu could not be
escorted by their own armed guards as they claimed that the
sector of the capital was safe.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi supported U.S. military intervention in Somalia in
December 1992 in Operation Restore Hope to help end famine and
the subsequent U.N. peacekeeping operation in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Somali gunmen have abducted more than 20 aid workers in the
last three years in disputes over money. All were freed unharmed
after negotiations but several foreigners were killed in other
incidents.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has had no central government or authority since the
fall of late President Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The South Mogadishu-based faction led by Hussein Aideed said
last Friday it would free within days a 25-year-old Australian
pilot jailed for a term of 25 years for making a forced landing
in west Somalia in May this year.

BAGHDAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi newspaper
Al-Jomhouriya, mouthpiece of the ruling party, accused today the
U.S. of using the Kurdish issue as a card for putting political
pressure on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The paper blamed U.S. attempts to obstruct the return of the
autonomous region in northern Iraq to normal.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has got the Kurds involved in grave bloody conflicts
in order to fulfill its selfish strategic interests in the region
which is rich in oil," the paper said in an article published
today.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, both U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry reportedly
announced that oil was what the United States interested in the
region.

The Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party had sought the aid of the

<HEADLINE> Heath Revival Raises Hope for Rare Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A 200-year decline in
Britain's heaths has been reversed, raising hopes for the survival
of rare plant species, an environmental conference was told here
today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, the trend for areas of heath to be
lost to roads, houses and scrubland has been halted and up to 550
hectares of damaged heath have been restored.
</P>
<P>
Graham Wynne, director of conservation at the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds, said at the New Forest conference, "We
have lost 72 percent of heathlands since 1750 and the loss has
continued right up to the late 1980s. But we seem to have stopped
the rot."
</P>
<P>
Wynne said that preserving heaths, areas of land created by
Bronze Age farmers and settlers and their animals, would benefit
people as well as wildlife. A survey by English Nature, the
Government's wildlife advisory body, found that 90 percent of
those questioned thought that heaths should be preserved. Most
used heaths for walking and bird-watching.
</P>
<P>
Britain is committed to protecting 116 species and several
habitats, including heaths, under its recently announced
biodiversity strategy.
</P>
<P>
There are 45,000 hectares of heathland left in Britain, mostly
in England. The strategy calls for a 10 percent increase by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Parliamentarians Call For Food Aid For Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the 96th
conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union today agreed that
there is an urgent need for developed countries to increase food
aid to developing countries to reduce global poverty and
starvation.
</P>
<P>
There are 800 million people suffering from food shortages in
the world, more than 200 million of whom are malnourished children
under the age of five, according to data provided by the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
</P>
<P>
Lee Dong Bok, a delegate from the Republic of Korea, said that
the majority of people suffering from food shortages are in
developing countries, which, he said, should be given priority in
help given by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Armando Becerra, an Argentinean parliamentarian, said
that providing food-short developing countries with food aid is an
effective means of eradicating poverty worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Becerra noted, however, that food aid to developing countries
from developed countries has been declining in recent years,
something that is contrary to norms of the international community
and a humanitarian spirit.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguay Round of Talks, which was meant to eliminate trade
protectionism, in fact resulted in intervention, exacerbating the
disparity in global food supplies, Becerra pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian representative, Yanko Peric, said that the developed
countries are in a more favorable position in economic
globalization and trade liberalization, something which developing
countries can hardly follow, and the gap between rich and poor
countries is actually widening.
</P>
<P>
Increasing international co-operation in food and agriculture
is necessary and will in fact benefit the developing countries in
economic globalization, Peric said, pointing out that the market
plays an important role in food production and distribution, but
it can not solve all problems.
</P>
<P>
He Kang, a member of the China's National People's Congress
Standing Committee, said that giving priority to sustainable
agricultural development to solve global food problems is urgent.
</P>
<P>
All countries must increase financial input in agriculture,
raise the level of agricultural science and technology, make
better use of agricultural resources, and protect the ecology, he
said, and regional and global economic prosperity can be achieved
only when all countries have as great a supply of food as they
possibly can.

<HEADLINE> Israel Approves New Plan to Expand Jewish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai today approved the plan to build about 1,800
new homes in the Jewish settlements in West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The new houses would be built in the religious Jewish
communities in Metatyahu, near Bethlehem. The Housing Ministry
said that the construction plan was originally approved by the
previous Labor government, which froze it later in order to
conduct peace talks with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli peace organization Peace Now blasted the government
for approving the expansion plan, saying the homes would be built
on the lands that belong to Palestinians in two nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
Peace Now warned that the Palestinian owners of the lands
would not keep silence when the construction begins in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian senior negotiator Jamil Tarifi today
asked his Israeli counterpart in the civilian affairs committee
to put an immediate end to the construction activity. He said
that the homes would be built on the Palestinian lands, not on
the Jewish lands.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, several members of Palestinian Authority (PA) from
the Bethlehem area sent a letter to PA President Yasser Arafat
to protest Israel's plan to expand Jewish settlements in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The officials also warned that Palestinian residents in the
area might become agitated if Israel started building houses on
their lands.
</P>
<P>
Israel's new hardline government lifted in August a freeze,
imposed by the Labor government, on expanding Jewish settlements
in the Palestinian territories. This move has triggered strong
protests from Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian relations plunged into the greatest crisis
in two years late last month, when Arafat called on Palestinians
to stage a general strike and a protest prayer in east Jerusalem
to protest Israel's plans to expand Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was defused after the Israeli government agreed to
resume peace talks and hold a landmark first meeting between
Arafat and Israeli hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
However, the issue of expanding settlements remains a major
obstacle blocking progress in the peace talks. The Netanyahu
government maintains that Israel has the right to expand
settlements to meet the demand for housing generated by the
"natural growth" of Jewish population.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Three Somali factions
today declared their opposition to an appeal made by the Arab
League for a Somalis reconciliation conference.
</P>
<P>
The main faction led by Hussein Mohamed Aidid and two other
factions supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed have separately announced
their unwillingness to attend such a conference which the Arab
League proposed to be held in Sana, the capital of Yemen later
this year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hussein Aidid, Mohamed Qanyare Afrah, said,
''The future determination of the Somalis is up to us and no more
imported solution is acceptable inside the country.''
</P>
<P>
Qanyare confirmed that they have received a formal invitation
from the government of Yemen, adding ''They are dictating us to
drop down our constitution and use theirs instead.''
</P>
<P>
Also the chairman of the Somali Patriotic Movement of Ogfaden
clan, Aden Abdullahi Gabyow, and the press secretary of the
Somali National Front of Marehan clan, Mohamed Mohamud Jango'an,
today issued a joint statement denouncing the Arab League
proposal for a reconciliation conference for the Somalis in
Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The two factions allied with Ali Mahdi Mohamed said that such
a meeting should be held inside the country. The statement blamed
the Yemen Republic for supporting late Mohamed Farah Aidid during
the height of the Somali civil war.
</P>
<P>
The appeal by the Arab League was warmly welcomed by both Ali
Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Hassan Ali Atto. Osman Atto and Ali Mahdi
had visited Sana of Yemen last week where they responded to an
informal invitation made by Ali Abdalla Saleh, the president of
Yemen.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel, Syria Locked in Psychological </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Syria are
locked in a psychological war over Syria's troop movements,
trading accusations while exercising prudence to avoid sparking
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The current tension between Israel and Syria was caused by the
dubious troop redeployments in the past weeks in south Lebanon and
the Israeli-Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
Syria has reportedly redeployed about 10,000 troops from the
Lebanese capital of Beirut to the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon,
and built up military presence near the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian moves have aroused high concern among Israelis
about a possible military confrontation with Syria, which was
apparently angered by the stagnation of the peace talks that were
further dimmed by Israeli new government's tough stand.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been demanding Israel to resume the talks on the
basis of the verbal commitments made by Israeli former Labor
government on its willingness to withdraw from the Golan Heights
Israel seized from the Arab country in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli government led by the hardline Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to relinquish its self-claimed
sovereignty over the Heights, although agreeing to reopen peace
talks without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Netanyahu accused Damascus of trying to apply
"psychological pressure" on Israel to force it to accept the
withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"What Syria is trying to do is evidently to put psychological
pressures on Israel and its new government. It's not going to
work. We are not going to be pressured into making those
unilateral concessions with Syria to which it has become
habituated with the previous government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Damascus also stepped up rhetoric against Netanyahu, denouncing
him as "preparing for war."
</P>
<P>
A broadcast on Radio Damascus Tuesday said the gap between the
Arabs and the "extreme stance" of Netanyahu government was
impossible to bridge unless it changed its hardline position.
</P>
<P>
The broadcast added that from Syria's point of view,
Netanyahu's insistence on "peace for peace with security"
instead of land-for-peace principle was totally unacceptable.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, despite of the war of words, both sides seemed to have
exercised restraint in order to avoid causing misunderstandings
that could spark a unwanted military conflict which might lead to
disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu disclosed Tuesday that he had asked the United
States and Egypt to relay a peace message to Damascus that Israel
was not interested in military confrontation and was ready to
resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
To take precautions, Israeli military forces along the borders
have been put on high alert. A massive military exercise was also
staged on the Golan Heights in the past days to examine the level
of readiness and capabilities of the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Syria also tried to calm the situation by playing down its
troop movements.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Mohammad Salman told a London-based
newspaper Tuesday that the movements were not related to regional
situation, but a part of "continuous process which reflects
confidence in the increased ability of the Lebanese forces to
control the security situation."
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 35,000-strong troops in Lebanon, is the main
foreign power broker in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts said Syria was apparently trying to
send out a signal to Israel: the situation will be dangerous in
the absence of the peace talks. So the only way to solve the
crisis is to resume as soon as possible the talks that should
include the issue of the return of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli opposition blamed provocative remarks made
by senior Israeli government officials for the tension.
</P>
<P>
The government officials asserted if Lebanese fundamentalist
guerrilla group, Hezbollah, or Party of God, resumed attacking the
Jewish state from south Lebanon, Israel would punish "the people
behind them", namely the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Labor's former Foreign Minister Ehud Barak demanded Netanyahu
"to control his tongue and act responsibly."
</P>
<P>
Israeli former premier Shimon Peres, who met Netanyahu
Tuesday, said the current tension should be taken seriously,
urging him to stop guessing Syrian intentions and take decisions
to push forward the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Court to Try Nazi Collaborator for Crimes Against Humanity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A French court today decided to
put on trial former Gaullist minister Maurice Papon, one of four
notorious Nazi collaborators in World War Two, for crimes against
humanity in the deportation of 1,690 Jews from 1942 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the indicting chamber of the Bordeaux Appeals
Court was a victory for civil groups in France who have been
fighting to put Papon on trial for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer for the 86-year-old former budget minister, Jean-Marc
Varaut, immediately announced that his client would appeal to
France's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Papon, who was general secretary of the prefecture of Gironde
when the alleged crimes took place, did not appear in court in the
southwestern French city of Bordeaux today because of his recent
triple heart bypass operation.
</P>
<P>
Local press said the appeal could delay the case until autumn
1997 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Boulanger, one of the attorneys for the civil groups,
said Papon is accused of complicity in illegal arrests in
aggravating circumstances, as many children were among the
deportees sent to the death camps.
</P>
<P>
Papon is also accused of complicity in kidnapping and
assassination attempts, and attempted assassination, he said.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated the civil groups for having finally persuaded
the court decide to put Papon on trial.
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic decision... This is the first time in
France that such a senior French official has been pursued for
crimes against humanity. The civil groups should be congratulated
for the courage and self-abnegation that they have shown over the
last 15 years," said Boulanger.
</P>
<P>
Papon rose through the civil service after the war to become
Paris prefect of police in 1958 and became a member of the
National Assembly in 1968. He became budget minister in the
government of then prime minister Raymond Barre in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The decision to try Papon reflects the bitter struggle within
France to come to terms with its responsibility in the deportation
of thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
While commemorating the 53rd anniversary of the rounding up of
Jews in the Vel d'Hiv, Paris, by French police, President Jacques
Chirac said on July 16, 1995, that France was responsible for the
deportations.
</P>
<P>
Jean Leguay, the man responsible for the Vel d'Hiver
rounding up, became the first Frenchman to be jailed for crimes
against humanity on March 12, 1979. He died on July 2, 1989.
</P>
<P>
He was the assistant to Rene Bousquet, former general secretary
of the Vichy police in Paris. Bousquet was also indicted for war
crimes but was assassinated on June 8, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Paul Touvier, another Nazi collaborator and the chief of the
former Lyon militia, died in July after being jailed in 1994 for
several years for crimes against humanity.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In France last year, some 20,000 children reported that they
were abused physically and mentally, while 65,000 children claimed
they were at risk. The rise shows children are developing a better
sense of self-protection, but also a worsening of child abuse
which has been linked to poverty.
</P>
<P>
-- Gabonese President Oumar Bongo said that he is going to come
to an agreement with France on the exploitation of Gabon's
resources by French oil group Elf-Acquitaine. He also said he
will no longer welcome Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of the
far-right National Front.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- France will take a decisive step towards the realization of
European Monetary Union with the official presentation of its 1997
draft budget. The text is one of the key components of the
Maastricht Treaty, which obliges countries who want join the euro
currency to lower their public deficit to below three percent of
their gross national product.
</P>
<P>
Although France's deficit, which stands at 283 billion francs
(57 billion U.S. dollars), is slightly higher than previously
predicted, the government's commitment to bring public spending
under control seems to have been observed to the letter.
</P>
<P>
-- Former French prime minister Edouard Balladur said that the
future political debate in France will be focused on the
confrontation between ``the reformists'' led by President Jacques
Chirac, and the ``socialist conservatives'' who he said ``want to
defend relentlessly the status quo.''

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets with US Peace Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak met today with visiting U.S. Middle East peace coordinator
Dennis Ross for talks on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which took place in Egypt's Mediterranean port
city of Alexandria, also dealt with a regional economic conference
to be held in Cairo on November 12-14, Ross said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived in Egypt Tuesday on the first leg of his
current Middle East tour, also met with Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa in Cairo Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Although Mubarak has said recently that Egypt will go ahead
with the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit on schedule,
Moussa said following the two-hour meeting that Egypt had not yet
ruled out delaying or cancelling the summit.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had threatened to cancel or postpone the summit if there
is still no progress in the Arab-Israeli peace process. But
Mubarak later said that Egypt was determined to hold the
get-together as scheduled though the atmosphere of Arab-Israeli
cooperation is still unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also urged Israel and the U.S. to help make the
conference successful.
</P>
<P>
Ross said after meeting with Moussa that there should be no
link between progress in the peace march and the convocation of
the conference because the U.S. sees that there is no exact date
for achieving progress.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country would do its utmost to push forward
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he would meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher in New York next week to discuss ways to resume the
Mideast peace negotiations on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
To reactivate the peace process, Moussa said, everything was
contingent on the Israeli government's reaction.
</P>
<P>
Ross will leave for the Palestinian self-rule area of Gaza
later today. The tour will also take him to Israel.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Conduct Assessment on Land Reclamation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will conduct
for the first time macro environmental impact assessment (EIA) on
15 coastal reclamation projects in Melaka (Malacca), Science,
Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding said today.
</P>
<P>
The macro EIA will take into account the overall and
accumulative impacts of the 15 projects so that mitigating
measures would complement one another, he said here after a weekly
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 1,214 hectares in Melaka, some 150
kilometers southeast from here, have been marked for coastal
reclamation.
</P>
<P>
The projects involve land reclamation from the sea only through
the "island" concept and not reclamation along the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
One of the 15 developers was reported to have already started
to create two man-made islands linked by bridges to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Law did not say whether a stop-work order would be issued
against such developer pending the outcome of the macro EIA.

<HEADLINE> HK Leg Opener Match Crucial for U.S. Chance for GP Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Defending World Women's
Volleyball Grand Prix champions the United States go into the
three-day Hong Kong leg of the preliminary round of this year's
tournament here Thursday, needing a strong performance in the
defense of the title won last year.
</P>
<P>
The Americans face local crowd favorites China, Russia and the
Netherlands in the tournament, which, along with an event in
Taipei, forms the last week of the four-week preliminary series of
the 1.5 million U.S. dollars event.
</P>
<P>
The top three teams out of the series and hosts China qualify
for next week's Finals in Shanghai. The United States are
currently fourth in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
They are just one win ahead of the Russians. If the U.S. can
maintain their current position and second-placed China stay among
the top four, they will qualify for Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
To ensure their presence in Shanghai, the Americans, who have
five wins in nine matches, need at least two victories in Hong
Kong, including a win over Russia, who are fifth in the overall
standings, one win behind the U.S.
</P>
<P>
China, silver medalists in the Atlanta Olympic Games, are
second in the overall standings with seven wins from nine matches,
having won last week's GP tournament in Macao with an unbeaten
record.
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Nikolai Karpol was happy with his young team's
progress although they virtually have no chance of reaching
Shanghai. "They have improved throughout the competition. If
they do their best, that's all I can ask for," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, who have lost their chance of qualifying for
the Finals, are taking the Hong Kong leg as an opportunity to
reach as high as possible in the standings.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and Brazil can assure themselves of sealing their places
in Shanghai, as they now rank first and tie for the second with
China respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos here today called on all Filipinos to take strong measures
to protect the country's environment.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the call when meeting with the Earthsavers Movement
which pledged to craft a 30-year environmental program to sustain
the country's drive in rehabilitating and protecting its
environment.
</P>
<P>
The president asked the Earthsavers Movement to take the lead
in conducting a massive educational campaign on solid waste
management and recycling.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ramos exhorted the citizenry to be actively
involved in maintaining the cleanliness of the environment by
taking part in the government's various environmental protection
programs.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the private sector to initiate its own
"clean and green" programs such as the "adoption" of creeks and
waterways, especially in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
"Massive environment problems need to be attacked massively. We
can only do that if everybody is involved," Ramos said. "There is
a need to set up a mechanism on how these people -- housewives,
students and housemaids -- can be taught solid waste management."
</P>
<P>
According to the local press, environment problems have caused
the spread of dengue fever, cholera and other diseases that have
killed at least 30 people in the country this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Domestic Conflicts Trouble Jordanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government's
conflicts with opposition parties and the parliament still figure
high one month after the riots caused by a bread price hike.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Action Front (IAF), the largest opposition party
and parliamentary bloc, has been strongly criticizing the
government for its domestic policies, the bread price hike in
particular, and foreign policies especially its stands on Israel
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The IAF demanded that the government of Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti take the responsibility for the bread riots which
broke out last month in the southern cities of the country and
resign en masse.
</P>
<P>
Government sources revealed earlier this week that Kabariti had
told the Islamists that the door was open for them to join the
government if they promised to abide by the decisions of the
majority.
</P>
<P>
Leading IAF deputy Bassam Emoush had said participation in the
government was the aim of any political party, hinting that the
IAF could be more effective in pushing its agenda if it joined the
government.
</P>
<P>
However, the IAF leaders rejected Tuesday the idea of joining
the Kabariti government, saying their participation is impossible.
</P>
<P>
They said there had been no discussion of joining the
government in which the IAF, with 16 deputies in the Lower House
of the Parliament, withheld confidence after it was formed in
February.
</P>
<P>
"The talk about the government's offer to us to join it is a
balloon test by which the government aims to focus debate away
from its problems," said IAF parliamentary bloc spokesman Hamzeh
Mansour, quoted by today's English-language daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
"How can we join the government, in which we have withheld
confidence, and which is convincingly unable to lead us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdul Majeed Thuneibat, leader of the Moslem
Brotherhood, which is the power base of the IAF, said joining the
government was not an option.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Islamists insist on the resignation of
the Kabariti government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Draft Resolution on Human Rights Deemed Acceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A draft resolution on human
rights, presented by the Chinese Inter-Parliamentary Group
attending the on-going 96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference, has
become the basis of a resolution of the conference by winning
overwhelming majority votes.
</P>
<P>
Human rights are one of the major topics that drew attention
from participants to the conference, which is expected to work out
a resolution titled Promoting Greater Respect and Protection of
Human Rights in General and in Particular for Women and Children.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary groups from 21 countries presented draft
resolutions to the conference, and the one submitted by the group
of China's National People's Congress was made a basic version for
the resolution. Every article of the draft will be examined and
revised, and then a revised version will be submitted to the
conference for approval.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Chinese group said that the draft resolution
is formulated in strict accordance with the spirit of the Charter
of the United Nations and related international conventions, and
it tries to reflect the stand and opinion of developing countries
including China.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from other groups said the draft resolution
presented by China is very comprehensive. Such a successful draft
resolution shows that China pays great attention to protecting
human rights, especially the rights of women and children.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms,
China's draft resolution calls on all governments to strengthen
international cooperation, to promote mutual understanding through
dialogue, and to promote protection of human rights on the basis of
equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
It calls on all countries to settle disputes and differences
peacefully through negotiations, make concerted efforts to promote
economic and social development and create a sound environment for
women's and children's full enjoyment of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution made a statement that "the current
international economic order is still unjust, which hinders the
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms." The
statement was approved following heated discussions.
</P>
<P>
In the course of discussions, some parliamentarians said the
draft resolution should contain wording that big countries should
not overuse economic sanctions to infringe upon the human rights
of peoples in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi group put forward a similar view in its draft
resolution, which drew attention from the parliamentarians.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Domestic Conflicts Trouble Jordanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a related development, a government official said this week
that the cabinet would agree to hold early parliamentary elections
so as to defuse the confrontation between the government and the
judiciary body.
</P>
<P>
Opposition members of the Lower House welcomed the holding of
early polls if they were to be held under a new election law.
</P>
<P>
But, the IAF, said Mansour, does not welcome the holding of
early elections under the present law, which the Islamic leaders
described as "backward and unfair."
</P>
<P>
Deputies demand that the electoral law be amended to cancel the
"one-person, one-vote" formula and to redefine constituencies in
accordance with population concentration.
</P>
<P>
The 12th Parliament was the first to be elected under the
"one-person, one-vote" formula that replaced the bloc-voting
procedures stipulated by the previous law.
</P>
<P>
The convocation of early elections would entail dissolving the
parliament before it finishes its term in November next year.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian House Speaker Saad Hail el-Sorour Monday ruled out
the possibility of holding early parliamentary elections, saying
that there was no reason for dissolving the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government is not in the position to call
for early elections, noting that only King Hussein has the
right to do so.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, informed sources here said there might be a
cabinet reshuffle or a complete resignation of Kabariti government
in the near future because of the "bread riots" and the ensuing
confrontations between the government and the parliament, the
government and the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The sources said an option is that former Prime Minister
Abdul Salem Majali, who has signed the historic peace treaty with
Israel and sealed the Jordanian-Israeli peace talks, will
replace the current Prime Minister Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
But the sources added that the cards are in the hands of King
Hussein, who has expressed full support for Kabariti government
so far.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Backtracks on Ceasefire Agreement with MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today backtracked on an earlier official announcement that
the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will
sign a ceasefire agreement tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"We are still in the preliminaries," Ramos said when asked if
the scheduled signing of the agreement, as announced by Executive
Secretary Ruben Torres, will push through.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly press conference this afternoon, Ramos said that he
was "not aware of any plans" for the government to sign a
comprehensive agreement with the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Torres told reporters that he had already met with
MILF Vice Chairman Ghadzali Jaafar and the two sides agreed to
sign a ceasefire agreement in Cagayan de Oro city, the southern
Philippines, tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Torres also said that formal talks between the two sides will
begin within ten days after the signing of the ceasefire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos said that the ongoing talks with the MILF were just
"preliminary talks through the back channel, nothing official."
</P>
<P>
"The differentiation between formal talks and negotiating talks
must be made. Because right now, we are not at the stage yet," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the presence of three battalions of
government troops near MILF camps in central Mindanao has hampered
the scheduled signing of the ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
But the ceasefire agreement would be signed later, the sources
said.

<HEADLINE> Somali Fruit Officials Killed in Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 18 (Xinhua) -- About 20 Unidentified
gunmen ambushed a convoy belonging to the banana exporting
company of Somali Fruit at k-60 along the road to the southern
port of Merca Tuesday, killing two.
</P>
<P>
The deceased, Mr Mohamud Dirshe, the head of the logistics of
Somali Fruit and a Mr Assalle, its financial manager were
travelling to Merca to supervise banana loading on the first
vessel docked at Merca's natural port after three months of high
seas monsoon winds prevented the export.
</P>
<P>
Another senior official from the company was wounded during
the ambush and he is being treated in a hospital in Merca, 100 km
south of capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness among the convoy told reporters that the assailants
had erected a checkpoint at k-60 road. The reason for the attack
is not yet made clear and no group has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
K-60 road is the way to the largest banana producing farms
which stretch from Afgoe, 30 km south of Mogadishu to more than
300 km south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The banana exporting companies are a focal point for the
gunmen since they are the major employers and gunmen suspect them
of having a large sum of money along with them all the time.
</P>
<P>
The banana and animal meat exporters had just begun exporting
their stocks after suspension of their activities owing to the
high tide monsoon at all the natural ports of southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The two banana companies, Somali Fruit and Sombana had been
using Merca port since October last year when Mogadishu's main
seaport was closed amid factional fightings.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Monitor Foreign Workers' Health Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will set up an
agency to monitor the health status of foreign workers in the
country in its efforts to curb the spread of communicable diseases
by them, Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said today.
</P>
<P>
The agency, to be jointly run by the Malaysian Doctors
Cooperative and a private firm, will maintain a computerized
medical record of the foreign workers, he said at a news
conference here.
</P>
<P>
It will also conduct medical checkups through clinics
registered with the agency on the foreign workers for the purpose
of renewal of their temporary work permits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign workers would be required to undergo medical checkups
in hospitals and clinics appointed by the Health Ministry in their
countries of origin before leaving for Malaysia, he said.
</P>
<P>
All foreign workers would be required to register with the
agency and to undergo medical checkups with clinics under the
agency to obtain medical reports to apply for or renew temporary
work permits from the Immigration Department.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry had already appointed seven clinics in
Bangladesh, 11 in the Philippines and 15 in Indonesia, and a team
of officials from the ministry would visit Pakistan and Thailand
soon to identify clinics to be appointed for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is very concerned over the health status of
foreign workers in the country as there have been cases where the
workers had been traced to be the carriers of communicable
diseases, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, about 30 percent of leprosy cases, 11.5 percent of
tuberculosis cases, 13 percent of malaria cases and 9.8 percent of
filiariasis cases involved foreign workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign workers in Malaysia are estimated to number 1.2
million, accounting for 15 percent of Malaysia's labor force. They
are mainly from Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand,
Pakistan and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Immediate action including deportation would be taken when
cases of communicable diseases were detected, the health minister
said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urged to Draw on Historical Lessons: Chinese FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Only by seriously drawing on
historical lessons and following the road of peace and
development, can Japan win the understanding and trust of Asian
countries and the world community and the re-occurrence of the
tragedy in history be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang made the
statement in response to questions on the 65th anniversary of the
September 18 Incident.
</P>
<P>
Exactly 65 years ago, the Japanese militarists launched a
long-premediated war of aggression against China, which brought an
unprecedented catastrophe and losses to the Chinese people and
left the human society a profound historical lesson, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always held that this period of
history should be approached in the spirit of an old Chinese
saying "Past experience, if not forgotten, will be a guide for the
future," Shen said. "We are convinced that vast majority of the
Japanese people will neither hope nor allow the re-occurrence of
this war of tragedy,"
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, "it must be pointed out that there is still
a force in Japan attempting to renew the old dream of militarism,
even within its political circles. They time and again spread
absurdities for denial of the aggression and distortion of the
history, and even prostrate themselves in worship before the soul
of deceased militarists, he added.
</P>
<P>
This can not but lead to stern denunciations by the people of
Asian countries, including the Chinese people, and arouse their
high vigilance, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government has been developing the
Sino-Japanese relations in accordance with the principles and
guidelines of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration and the
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
"Only by drawing on historical lessons seriously and following
the road of peace and development, can Japan win the understanding
and trust of Asian countries and the world community and
re-occurrence of the tragedy in history be avoided," the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> IPC Participants Praise China's Human Rights Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Participants to the ongoing
96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference (IPC) said that China has set
an example in human rights protection for developing nations.
</P>
<P>
A.B.M. Abul Qasem, a parliamentarian from Bangladesh, praised
China's "great achievement" in improving human rights, saying that
China's reform and opening up policies have brought about rapid
economic growth and guaranteed people's right to subsistence by
solving the problem of feeding and clothing its 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Qasem said, "China's success is great encouragement to people
in Asia, and it will enable China to offer more support and
assistance to developing countries in Asia."
</P>
<P>
The fundamental human right is the right to food, said Oleg
Korolev, deputy speaker of the Federation Council -- the upper
house of the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is an amazing achievement of the Chinese government to have
solved the problem of people's feeding and clothing, said Korolev,
and he believes the Chinese government will conquer all the
difficulties in the course of development.
</P>
<P>
Yap Pian Hon, a member of the Malaysian parliament, said China
has already achieved great success in helping its people to
eliminate poverty, improving people's living standards and
guaranteeing people's fundamental human rights, when many people
in the world are still suffering from hunger.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out it is improper to blame China on the human
rights issue, and his country always maintains that no country
should impose its own wills and system upon others because this is
utterly wrong and is an expression of power politics.
</P>
<P>
Abdallah El Maaroufi, director of the European Office of the
World Bank, noted that to guarantee people's right to food is to
guarantee the fundamental human right. He said China has done a
good job in this respect, and he believed it will continue to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
Maaroufi confirmed that the World Bank will continue to provide
assistance to China to this end.
</P>
<P>
The right to subsistence is the fundamental human right, said
A. Raymond, the head of the inter-parliamentary group of Benin. He
said that he was amazed that China has successfully solved the
problem, and China's rapid and harmonious development sets an good
example for developing nations, especially those in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Yeo Toon Chia, a member of the Singapore parliament, said
China's reform and opening up policies have brought much benefit
for its social, political and economic development, which was duly
reflected by the improved living standards of the people.
</P>
<P>
The conference enables parliamentarians around the world to
come to Beijing and see for themselves the progress China has
made, which is beneficial to changing the wrong concepts held by
some of them, Yeo added.

<HEADLINE> State Farms Use More Overseas Investment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A seed commercialization
project aided by 36.5 million US dollars in World Bank loans will
be carried out in nine Chinese state farms in October.
</P>
<P>
"This is only one of a series of overseas-funded projects to be
carried out in the coming few years," said Zeng Yuzhuang, director
of the State Farm Bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that the use of overseas investment by state farms
indicate that the formerly closed sector is gradually opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Set up in remote areas, with the help of the demobilized troops
of the People's Liberation Army and young intellectuals, the state
farms have long been viewed as state-owned agricultural companies.
</P>
<P>
While farmers throughout the country farm independently, the
state farms are operated as companies with employees engaging in
farming.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, the state farms have contributed a great
deal to the country's agricultural sector and economy as a whole,
Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Occupying 4.8 percent of farmland of the country, the state
farms are producing 80 percent of the country's natural rubber, 12
percent of its cotton and 10 percent of its commodity grain.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Greater International Cooperation in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate to the
current 96th conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union today
urged the developed countries to increase their aid to developing
countries both in farming technology and funding.
</P>
<P>
He Kang, member of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee and former minister of agriculture, said
at a theme discussion of the meeting that consolidating
international cooperation in agriculture is an effective channel
to solving world food problem.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to call upon the international community,
particularly developed countries, to attach great importance to
international cooperation in food production," He said.
</P>
<P>
As food shortage has become ever acute in the third world, the
developed countries should undertake the international obligation
to ensure that world food aid is maintained on a relatively
rational level and to strengthen financial and technological
cooperation with the low income and food deficit countries in the
field of agriculture, he urged.
</P>
<P>
Global agricultural resources are on the decline along with
accelerating industrialization, population expansion and
urbanization, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged all countries to pursue sustainable agricultural
development by taking measures to protect and make still better
use of agro-resources, protect the ecology, readjust the
agricultural structure, enhance management and increase financial
input.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreement has produced
an adverse effect on food security in developing countries and
resulted in a reduction of export subsidies and a rise in grain
prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the food problem of 1.2 billion people in China
has to be solved by the Chinese themselves, noting that the
Chinese government has always attached great importance to
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China feeds 22 percent of the world's population with merely
seven percent of its arable land.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that his country is still confronted with
problems in food supply, ranging from a rise in population and
reduction in arable land to relatively backward farming techniques
and inadequate funding.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we wish to increase international cooperation in
the fields of food and agriculture," He Kang said.

<P>
Since the opening up policy was firstly adopted by the country
in 1979, the state farms have been profitable, while at the same
time, state-owned industrial companies experienced difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Zeng attributed the achievements to the internal reforms, as
well as a gradual process of opening up in the sector.
</P>
<P>
In the past 17 years, these farms introduced in a total of 2.7
billion US dollars of overseas funds, accounting for 30 percent of
the investments in fixed assets of the farms and including two
billion US dollars in direct overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1,500 overseas-funded enterprises have been set up
in the farms.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds helped promote the economic development and
technical upgrading of the farms, Zeng noted.
</P>
<P>
To help tap the potential of the state farms, Zeng said, the
country will draw more overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will encourage the flow of overseas funds into
sectors such as agricultural comprehensive development projects,
construction of agricultural infrastructure, transforming of
medium and low-yielding farmland and introducing of advanced
farming techniques and seeds.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the gross national product of the state farms
is expected to increase to 60 billion yuan from current 37 billion
yuan, a plan of the State Farm Bureau revealed. That means an
annual economic growth rate of ten percent.
</P>
<P>
"To fulfill the target, the state farms need to use more
overseas investment," Zeng said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China will absorb large
amounts of overseas investment in the next 15 years, a senior
foreign trade official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Direct investment will be the principal form, with foreign
loans and other forms of investment as supplements, said Liu
Xiangdong, assistant minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, at a seminar on foreign trade held in
Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
He called on overseas investors to build more hi-tech and
basic industrial projects in future.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 74 percent of the approved overseas-funded projects were
in the industrial sector, attracting 52.8 percent of the
contractual investment.
</P>
<P>
Energy, infrastructures, electronics and machinery projects
took the lion's share of investment in industry.
</P>
<P>
Though the overall investment structure is rational, investment
in technologically-advanced and export-oriented projects was
inadequate, while investment in real estate, and luxury and office
buildings increased rapidly in some areas, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
China will set forth a number of industrial policies to guide
overseas investment to the state-designated sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country encourages overseas companies to invest
heavily in the 18 provinces and autonomous regions in the central
and western parts of China, which abound in rich natural
resources, the assistant minister said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in agriculture, animal husbandry, energy and raw
material industries will enjoy preferential treatment granted by
governments in those areas.
</P>
<P>
Management of foreign-funded firms will be strengthened, with
the emphasis placed on taxation and labor in order to protect the
lawful rights and interests of workers, he said.

<HEADLINE> Censure Debate Against Banharn Starts in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai parliament today
opened a censure debate on Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa with
the opposition rapping him for mismanaging the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
During the debate this morning, democratic party leader Chuan
Leekpai and Chart Pattana (national development) Party leader
Chatichai Choonhavan accused Banharn of failing in administration
and causing huge losses to the country.
</P>
<P>
The two main opposition party leaders pointed out that people
have lost confidence in Banharn.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day debate, allegations against Banharn
reportedly will number 13, an unlucky figure for the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The allegations included Banharn's failure in administration
and abuse of power, economic slowdown, bribery involving some
members of the Banharn-led Chart Thai (Thai nation) party, his
true nationality, plagiarism of a research paper for his master's
degree, and his family's involvement of land deals.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the country's economic problems, like the slowdown of
economic growth, dropping exports, high current account deficit
and troubled monetary market, will be the main reasons used by the
opposition to attack the prime minister.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Curbs Shrinking of Cultivated Land Areas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China has halted the
continuous shrinking of cultivated land areas in response to the
government's tightened control over this problem, said a top land
official today.
</P>
<P>
Zou Yuchuan, director of the State Land Administration (SLA),
said that so far this year, the space of cultivated land occupied
by construction projects continued to decrease, and more barren or
idle land has been brought into cultivation.
</P>
<P>
But, the cultivated land in the country has still kept
shrinking for a few years. The government has called for opening
up or reclamation of wasteland to offset the decreased figure.
</P>
<P>
This year, the area of cultivated land used for
non-agricultural construction is less than the newly-increased
amount of cultivated land. And less cultivated land was encroached
upon than in 1995, Zou told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the first half of the year,
construction projects claimed more than 21,800 hectares of
cultivated land, 560 hectares less than the same period of last
year. Meanwhile, the country made available more than 60,000
hectares, 1,000 hectares above the amount for the same period of
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
One reason for the increase of cultivated land areas is China's
major crackdown on land cases in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year, under the leadership of the State Council, China's
highest governing body, the government dealt with more than
220,000 land misuse cases across the country.
</P>
<P>
Zou said that over the past ten years or more, China has paid
great attention to the protection of cultivated land. The
administration places it as a central task, he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, China conducted a nationwide check on the land taken
over by non-agricultural construction projects; the following
year, the State Land Administration was set up to strengthen land
management. China also passed Land Management Law in 1986 to
provide legal guarantee for cultivated land protection.
</P>
<P>
However, rampant encroachment upon or destruction of the
cultivated land is still a widespread phenomenon, Zou said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The official has suggested the National People's Congress,
China's top legislature, should amend the Land Management Law and
add a "land destruction clause" to strengthen punishment on land
cases.
</P>
<P>
The SLA also suggested that land officials at the city level
should be appointed by land management departments at the
provincial level, instead of by city governments. By doing so,
city land officials will be able to better watch over illegal
activities in the local land sector.
</P>
<P>
The administration is also considering raising land prices so
that developers will not feel free to occupy cultivated land, as
the current land prices are inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
The pressure caused by over-population on scarce land resources
is one of China's national problems. The space of cultivated land
has direct bearing of the feeding of 1.2 billion Chinese people,
Zou said.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities value the protection of cultivated
land. Chinese President Jiang Zemin said that "to protect
cultivated land is to safeguard our lifelines." Premier Li Peng
has also called for legal protection and rational, economic use of
land resources.
</P>
<P>
Zou, also vice-minister of construction, said that China will
make better use of vacant lots in towns or cities, rather than
occupying new land in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The state will also tighten management over collectively-owned
land in the rural areas by strictly controlling the land for
building residences and township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, China is scheduled to increase cultivated land areas
by about 6.7 million hectares by opening up wasteland or
reclaiming idle land, and adopting a series of measures to
maintain a constant balance between the shrinkage and growth of
cultivated land areas, or even lead to more cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
"It is still an arduous task to achieve the goal," Zou said.

<P>
HEFEI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The world's first archives
repair system was invented recently in east China's Anhui
Province, and is the culmination of two years' research by the
province's archivists.
</P>
<P>
The system is particularly effective for repairing damaged
archives.
</P>
<P>
With 131 archives at various levels, Anhui Province now boasts
over 100,000 full-time and part-time archivists and 4.18 million
volumes of archives.
</P>
<P>
In addition, "The Outline of Archives on Anhui's History," which
serves as a guidebook for the research of the province's history,
geography, and other fields of science, will be published soon.
</P>
<P>
And an archives education system comprised of an undergraduate
course, a two-year education course, a technical secondary school,
and in-service training, has been established in the province.

<HEADLINE> Elephants Attack Rural Settlement in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A herd of elephants attacked
a human settlement in Mariana village, Musi Manyasin district of
South Sumatra in Indonesia, early this week, damaging several
hectares of local residents' farmland, said reports reaching here
today from the area.
</P>
<P>
Sutrisna Wartapura, a spokesman of the local nature and
wildlife protection agency, Tuesday confirmed the local residents'
reports which put at 20 the number of elephants involved.
</P>
<P>
There was no mention of any human casualty but the agency had
sent a team to the village to investigate the incident and find
out what had caused the elephants to attack and the extent of
damage, Wartapura said.
</P>
<P>
The animals appeared at the settlement suddenly and immediately
ran amuck, destroying crops and other objects.
</P>
<P>
The village had a similar experience in 1983, according to
Wartapura.
</P>
<P>
The most plausible reason for the elephants' behavior was
increasing difficulty for them to find food in their habitat,
Wartapura said.

AMMAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified flying objects
(UFOs) were reportedly sighted over the skies of Amman last
Thursday evening, the English daily Jordan Times quoted Arabic
daily Al Dustour as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
"Strange but seemingly real objects with glaring lights of
different colors moved in the skies of Amman Thursday night and
were seen by a number of citizens," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Information Marwan Muasher, in reply to
an inquiry through Internet, said: "On my way home from a dinner,
I saw such strange objects Thursday night. I cannot explain what I
have seen or find an explanation for this phenomenon."

</P>
<P>
Jordan's Meteorology Department said it had no clues to the
incident.
</P>
<P>
"It was reported in various places at various times, but our

"Even if monitored, such a phenomenon could not be explained
scientifically," the source was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Denies Holding up Signing of ASEAN Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam denied that it tried to
delay the signing of the ASEAN Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM),
according to the latest issue of the "Vietnam Investment Review."
</P>
<P>
"There is no deliberateness to hold up at all," an official of
the Trade Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In August this year, senior officials of ASEAN countries had
completed drafting a protocol on dispute settlement, aimed at
resolving economic disputes in a legal approach.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Vietnamese delegation to the ASEAN meeting in
Jakarta said it lacked a cabinet mandate to sign the DSM but that
was described by foreign press reports as an attempt to delay the
signing.
</P>
<P>
These press reports "misunderstand and are exaggerating
things," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He explained, "before we sign any documents as important as
this one, we need to report to the Prime Minister's office for
approval."
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper added that "Vietnam's caution in signing
is understandable as it has the tradition of settling domestic
disputes by directives and decisions from various ministries rather
than the more legalistic approach of court rulings."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN economic ministers have felt a need to have a formal
mechanism for dispute settlement, in addition to their traditional
consultation methods.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN was hoping that the agreement could be signed before
November ahead of an informal summit.

<P>
TOKYO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade
surplus in August dropped by 31 percent from that of a year
earlier to 3.695 billion U.S. dollars, a Finance Ministry report
said today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the downward trend in trade surplus is
expected to remain for the time being, reflecting structural
changes in Japan's industrial and trade behavior.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose by 8.7 percent to 34.717 billion dollars while
imports advanced by 16.6 percent to 31.023 billion dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus with the United States dropped by 16.9 percent
to 2.223 billion dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that shipment of semiconductors and
electric home appliances will be sluggish, but exports as a whole
are expected to show a moderate increase later this year, aided by
recovery in shipments of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Imports will continue to show large growth amid strong imports
of computers, integrated circuits, clothing and other products, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The continued rise in imports results from moves by Japanese
companies to increase production abroad and more purchase of
foreign goods by Japanese consumers.

<HEADLINE> Intermediate Agencies Prosperous in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Intermediate Agencies in
Shanghai have been playing an increasingly important role in
serving the government, enterprises and institutions.
</P>
<P>
A new survey conducted by the Shanghai Commission on Composition
of Government Organizations and the Shanghai Science and
Technology Commission indicates that Shanghai currently has 8,600
such agencies employing a total of 150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The agencies include offices of accountants, auditors,
attorneys, notary and arbitration, information and consulting, and
assets evaluation, and their vast majority are information and
consultancy agencies, whose number has risen to 7,703.
</P>
<P>
The agencies assist the government in the indirect management
of enterprises. Last year, 10 auditors' offices conducted a market
survey for the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and
Commerce on the operation of the 2,400 advertising companies.
</P>
<P>
Intermediate agencies also serve enterprises and
institutions. Every year the Market Institute of the Shanghai
Academy of Social Sciences conducts market surveys for 100
enterprises, most of which are foreign-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
Property rights of 50 companies were traded on the Shanghai
Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange in the first four months
after the exchange was set up.
</P>
<P>
A municipal government official cited the establishment of
intermediate agencies as having paved the way for the introduction
of a modern enterprise system in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
For example, nine asset assessing offices have evaluated the
state-owned assets of 100 enterprises over the past two years,
enabling them to introduce the corporate system, set up joint
ventures with foreign companies or be merged with other Chinese
firms.

Swiss Federal Council President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz told a
visiting Chinese senior official here today.
</P>

with one fourth of the world's population, is being improved
increasingly, Delemuraz said in a meeting with Li Ruihuan,
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

On Switzerland's bilateral relations with China, Delemuraz said
China's extraordinary development especially in the economic field
has shown that the path Switzerland has taken for many years to
develop friendly cooperation with China is correct.
</P>
<P>
The path has now become broader and broader, he said.

briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Central Bank of Egypt says it has sold 861.8
million pounds (253.4 million U.S. dollars) worth of short-term
treasury bills to 137 private and institutional investors, the
English-language newspaper the Egyptian Gazette reported today.

182-day T-bills, which were issued on September 17 and will mature
on March 8, 1997.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government is studying reducing customs
on computers, which are currently standing at 40 percent, the
Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English-language newspaper quoted Minister of Trade and

ANKARA -- Turkey's domestic vehicle makers have expressed
strong opposition to government plans to permit, for a limited
period, the import of duty-free used cars by expatriate workers
who deposit 50,000 Deutsch Marks ( 33,000 dollars) with the
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a package announced in early July to raise
new revenues to reduce the budget deficit and offset additional
spending, according to the latest issue of the Middle East
Business Digest (MEED), a business weekly published in London.

MEED said the Turkish cabinet finalized a draft decree on
September 9, which still has to be approved by President Suleyman
Demirel,
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, expatriate workers can import cars up
to four years old if they open a 50,000 Deutsch-Mark account with
the Central Bank by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
There is no limit on the number of accounts an individual can
open. Before the decree, expatriate workers could only import new
cars.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Arab Bank, Jordan's largest financial institution,

officially-recognized political parties, the United Development
Party (PPP), the ruling Functional Group (Golkar) and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), have formally submitted their
respective lists of parliamentary candidates to the General
Election Institute (LPU).
</P>
<P>
Both PPP and Golkar submitted lists of 850 names, while PDI
submitted a list of 903 candidates to Home Affairs Minister Yogie

All of the candidates' lists would soon be vested by the
election body in accordance with an existing ruling and the final
lists would be announced early next year, Yogie said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the LPU authorities on Monday rejected a list of
candidates submitted by former leader Megawati Sukarnoputri-led
PDI for next year's general elections.
</P>

<P>
The PPP, PDI and Golkar will compete in the elections for 425
seats in the parliament. Seventy-five other seats are to be filled
by members of the Indonesian armed forces appointed by the
president. The armed forces do not cast votes in the polling.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Over 1.4 million people in
Kenya's Eastern Province need food aid owing to the failure of
the long rains between March and July this year, a U.S. monthly
report says.
</P>
<P>
The monthly report of Famine Early Warning System, published
by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional
Economic Development Services Office, says the famine Kenyans are
mostly living in the marginal agricultural districts of the
province.
</P>
<P>
It says its harvest assessment in Machakos, Makueni, Kitui,
Mwingi and Mbeere districts had revealed a food production level
well below 1995 production.
</P>
<P>
"During the previous October-January short rains season, only
50 percent of the amount of maize production was realized,
compounding the problem of current harvest," it says.
</P>
<P>
The report says in the pastoral districts of Wajir, Mandera,
Isiolo and Garissa, sedentary members of pastoralist households
are facing worsening conditions.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Be Top Regional Petrochemical Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will overtake
Singapore as the leading petrochemical producer in Southeast Asia
within the next five years, according to a report of the Thai
Board of Investment (BOI).
</P>
<P>
Liberalization in many areas of Thailand's petrochemical
industry have resulted in significant expansion of the country's
petrochemical production capacity, BOI Secretary-General Staporn
Kavitanon said.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the country's ethylene production capacity will reach
2.35 billion tons a year and propylene production capacity 1.33
billion tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Singapore's ethylene and propylene production
capacity is forecast at 965 million and 569 million tons
respectively by 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's capacity of producing polyethylene is also expected
to reach 2.03 billion tons, compared with the forecast 730 million
tons in Singapore, Staporn said.
</P>
<P>
The future of the Thai petrochemical industry is bright as the
government has cut import tariffs on some petrochemical products
and lifted a ban on the establishment of new petrochemical plants
in the country, he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM), the country's monopoly copper conglomerate, has
lost over one billion Kwacha (about 800,000 US Dallars) in a
dubious contract offered to an unregistered oil supplier.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today that links of the case have
been made to some managers who are allegedly behind the scum.
</P>
<P>
Some senior management officials at ZCCM allegedly ignored an
internal audit report, which identified that oil purchases from a
company that was not registered as a supplier with the mining
conglomerate were dubiously obtained and should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
The report said that oil supplied to ZCCM by the company has
been discovered unsuitable for machinery and has placed the
expensive equipment at extreme risk but management which has
admitted the shortfall of the contract has not acted.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM is a state-owned conglomerate which earns 80 percent of
the country's foreign exchange. Its production has not been run
well in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The zambian government has made a plan to privatize it to
improve its management and collect funds in order to revitalize
the country's copper industry.

BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Personal computers
manufactured by large state-owned enterprises are found to have
the same high quality as famous foreign brands, a nationwide
survey conducted by the State Technological Supervision Bureau has
shown.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered 26 models of personal computers made by 26
enterprises across China, which accounts for about 70 percent of
the total computer production of the country.
</P>
<P>
Products surveyed in a number of large state-owned enterprises,
such as the Beijing Legend Group, the China Great Wall Computer
Group, and the Shanghai Electronical Computer Group, have passed
quality assurance tests. The Beijing Legend Group and China Great
Wall Computer Group have passed the tests three times.
</P>
<P>
Problems were also found in the survey. Some enterprises
manufacture computers without production licenses and quality
control measures. These products do not carry Chinese
identification.
</P>
<P>
The survey also covered products of six famous foreign
brands. Although all of the products surveyed meet the quality
standard, most of the foreign producers such as AST and Compaq
have not received Chinese production licenses, and their products
do not have the proper Chinese identification.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Turn 150 State Firms Into Share-Holding Entities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
decided to "equitize" 150 state-owned enterprises and turn them
into multiple share-holding entities by the end of 1997, the
Vietnam Investment Review said in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The review reported that a newly-created committee will guide
the process of equitization.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 state-owned businesses in Ho Chi Minh city and
four others in the northern port city of Hai Phong have registered
for the process.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, only five state-owned enterprises had been
turned into joint-stock companies since the process was launched
four years before.
</P>
<P>
A joint-stock company can enjoy a 50 percent cut of profit tax
for the first two years if its profit is not paid out as dividends
but rather used for reinvestment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislator Disapproves Worldwide Ban on Anti-personnel Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegation
disapproves of a worldwide ban on anti-personnel mines, a senior
Chinese legislator said here today at the ongoing 96th conference
of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).
</P>
<P>
"The efforts to solve the problem of land mines should take
into consideration humanitarian concerns and the justifiable
military need for self-defense in sovereign states," said Peng
Qingyuan, a member of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress (NPC) and vice-chairman of the Committee for
Internal and Judicial Affairs of NPC.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that an appropriate balance should be sought
between the two factors.
</P>
<P>
The IPU conference carried out the debate today on Worldwide
Ban on Anti-personal Mines and the Need for Mine Clearance for
Humanitarian Purposes.
</P>
<P>
Peng said the Chinese delegation to the IPU is concerned about
the suffering and casualties among civilians that result from the
indiscriminate and irresponsible use of anti-personnel land-mines,
and has approved and supported the humanitarian efforts of the
international community to seek ways of preventing civilians from
mine killings.
</P>
<P>
China took an active part in a conference of signatory states
to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which was aimed
at revising the convention's mine protocol, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, "we hold the view that anti-personnel
mines are a kind of 'passive' explosive device, as well as a
justifiable means for self-defense in many countries, particularly
in those with long land boundaries."
</P>
<P>
In this sense, China hopes that various sides involved can
reach agreement on revising the mine protocol, he noted. The new
guidelines have made important, reasonable and significant
restrictions on mines, particularly anti-personnel mines, and can
solve the humanitarian issue of mine overuse.
</P>
<P>
"With a conscientious and responsible attitude, China will
re-examine in all-round way the new version of the protocol and
consider the appropriate time to rectify it," Peng said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Good News, Bad News for Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- If news could really be
divided into two categories -- good news and bad news, then the
scheduled signing of a ceasefire agreement between the Philippine
government and a main Muslim rebel group tomorrow could be
described as good news.
</P>
<P>
It could be called good news because the government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) would stop their decades of
fighting in Mindanao after they sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
It could be called good news as the two warring parties agreed
to come to the negotiation table within 10 days after the
agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
It could be called good news since the negotiations would pave
the way for removing the MILF's threat to the implementation of
the Mindanao peace accord signed by the government and the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF, a breakaway group of the MNLF, became
the largest anti-government forces in the country after the Ramos
administration and the MNLF formally signed the Mindanao peace
agreement on September 2.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has posed a major threat to the implementation of the
Mindanao peace deal as it rejected the accord and vowed to
continue its fighting for an independent Islamic state in southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Though the pending peace talks between the government and the
MILF are unlikely to bear fruits soon, the rebel group's
willingness to talk with the government has brightened the hope of
its final participation in the Mindanao peace process, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that despite the Mindanao peace accord the
region could hardly enjoy lasting peace and stability before the
MILF comes to the negotiation table. And that is why the signing
of the ceasefire agreement and the pending peace talks should be
described as good news for Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But for Mindanao, the MILF's possible participation in the
peace process is not the only good news in recent days. The
successful election in the autonomous region of the Muslim
Mindanao on September 9 is an encouraging sign that peace has
begun to prevail in the region following the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The gubernatorial election was the most peaceful one the region
had ever seen because of the MNLF's participation. In the past,
elections in the region used to turn into bloodbath after attacks
and sabotages by the MNLF, which had fought for autonomy of
Mindanao for nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
during the September 2 elections, hundreds of MNLF members cast
their votes and their leader Nur Misuari was elected governor of
the region as a candidate of the ruling-party Lukas-National Union
for Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The successful elections was regarded by analysts here as the
testimony of peace in the region following the peace agreement
between the MNLF and the government. And possibly, the peaceful
and orderly election encouraged the MILF, which showed its doubts
about the success of the poll, to agree on a ceasefire with the
government.
</P>
<P>
While more and more good news are spreading in Mindanao, bad
news also comes. A new armed group formed by former "top generals"
of the MNLF has risen to challenge Misuari and will carry on the
fight for a "Islamic Mindanao."
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-member group, which is led by Mampait Alam, Misuari's
former chief of staff, is reportedly negotiating with Christian
vigilantes in Mindanao for a common fight against Misuari.
</P>
<P>
In the Christian-dominated Mindanao, opposition to the peace
accord remains strong. Christians, who account for 85 percent of
the region's population, formed vigilante groups against the
establishment of a Southern Philippines Council for Peace and
Development led by Misuari.
</P>
<P>
They said that as the MNLF-led council will oversee peace and
development in 14 provinces and 10 cities in Mindanao, it is going
to impose Muslim rule on them.
</P>
<P>
During the past two weeks, the government ordered vigilante
groups in Zamboanga city, Mindanao, to hand out their 3,000
high-powered rifles, but the Christians refused to surrender their
weapons. In other Mindanao provinces, there are similar armed
groups against the establishment of the MNLF-led council, the
plank of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is other bad news for Mindanao. The National
Democratic Front said Monday that it is ready to forge long-term
links with the MILF and other rebel forces in Mindanao against the
"common enemy" -- the government.
</P>
<P>
Al these good news and bad news show that the Mindanao peace
process has made much progress but obstacles to a lasting peace on
the island remain formidable.

<HEADLINE> Reducing Glaciers Threaten Environment of Central Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Scientists of Kazakhstan
warn that glaciers in their country and other regions of central
Asia are reducing, and becoming a threat to the environment of
this region.,
</P>
<P>
The reducing glaciers might result in a shortage of water and
even the shrinking of oases in some areas of this region in 20 or
30 years, newspaper reports quoted scientists of Academy of
Science of Kazakhstan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Scientists pointed out that glaciers were one of the major
fresh water resources, and central Asia was rich in glaciers.
</P>
<P>
Along the Tien Shan mountains shared by Kazakhstan, Kirghizia
and China, there were more than 16,490 glaciers with a total area
of 16,500 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The glaciers there played an important role in the changes of
climate, growth of plants and animals and activities of human
beings.
</P>
<P>
According to the research of the Kazakh scientists, glaciers in
the Iliysk Alatau Mountains of the Tien Shan range, inside
Kazakhstan, had reduced by 25 percent in recent years and the ice
level was becoming thinner.
</P>
<P>
They asked the government to pay more attention to research on
glaciers and to work out measures for restrictions on business
activities had helped undermine glaciers in the mountainous
regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- About 6,800 persons are
suspected to be AIDS carriers at present in Sri Lanka, according
to Health Authority sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the first AIDS case in Sri Lanka was
confirmed in 1986. The victim was found to have been infected
during his stay in London.
</P>
<P>
Since then the disease has spread prolifically. A study
commissioned by the United Nations Development Program on HIV/AIDS
in Sri Lanka estimates that by the year 2005 the number of HIV
infected patients in Sri Lanka will increase to over 80,000.
</P>
<P>
Although Sri Lanka has a low prevalence rate in comparison to
other Asian countries, the sources cautioned that there was no
reason to be complacent.
</P>
<P>
The sources warned that the economic impact of AIDS would be
staggering. The sum of direct and indirect cost per AIDS case
would be 19,000 US dollars which is well in excess of the per
capita income in Sri Lanka, which is only 700 US dollars.

SAN JOSE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch coupled kidnapped
from a Dutch company in northern Costa Rica was freed today and
they were in fair conditions, judicial police director Manuel
Alvarado said today.
</P>
<P>
Huite Sierd Zijlstra and Jetty Cuors, both 50, who had been
held by their captors for 23 days, were kidnapped by a Nicaraguan
group who demanded a 1.5-million-U.S.-dollar ransom.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican press quoted judicial sources as saying that
600,000 dollars were paid in return for the release of the Dutch
couple who are employees of the Altamira Hacienda company, a Dutch
enterprise exploiting forestry resources in the north of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the kidnappers were members of the former
Nicaraguan counter-revolutionary forces "Contras" who fought
against the Sandinista government in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations were held near the Altamira Hacienda company
located in a mountainous area near the Nicaraguan border.
</P>
<P>
Two intermediaries, a priest and a Nicaraguan, had had to move
along the roads in a vehicle to contact the kidnappers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Moves to Curb Greenhouse Gases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will cooperate with
the developed countries in local projects to curb greenhouse
gases, which are blamed for causing global warming, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on Tuesday when the National Committee on
Climate Change met to consider Thailand's involvement in a joint
implementation scheme under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
Siksit Tridech, secretary of the committee, noted that the
decision to join the scheme will not affect Thailand's development
because it is a pilot program with a grace period up to the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, called "activities implemented jointly scheme," is
a revised follow-up program after the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro in 1992, during which 155 countries signed the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme agreed upon at the first conference of related
parties last year, the developing countries are urged to reduce
their greenhouse gas emission, while the developed countries
should render financial, technological and managerial support to
the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Thailand ratified the UN convention in December 1994.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Reconsiders North-East Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
reconsidering the formation of a Coordinating Committee appointed
last week for the war-torn North and East provinces as a stepping
stone to a future civil administration, according to official
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Coordinating Committee was to be headed by
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader and Shipping Minister Mohamed H.
M. Ashroff and was to comprise 31 members of the Tamil Parliament
from the two provinces.
</P>
<P>
Following the appointment of the committee, the Tamil parties
and the majority of the parliament members expressed opposition to
the committee, particularly stating that they did not want to
serve on a committee headed by Minister Ashroff.
</P>
<P>
The government has the support of only seven members of the
Tamil Parliament so far.
</P>
<P>
Nine members of the Eelam People's Democratic Party, three
members of the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam and
five members of the Tamil United Liberation Front have announced
that they will not participate in the committee, the sources
stated.
</P>
<P>
Consequently President Chandrika Kumaratunga has to reconsider
the formation of the committee.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Top Swiss Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERNE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese leader Li
Ruihuan said here today that the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is ready to establish and
strengthen relations with the Swiss parliament.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, made the remark
during talks with Jean-Francois Leuba, president of the Swiss
National Council, and Otto Schoch, president of the Council of
States.
</P>
<P>
The friendly cooperation had been expanded and deepened in
various fields in the last few years, and mutual understanding
between the two peoples had been promoted, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Developing ties between the CPPCC and the two Swiss councils
constitutes an important part of and creates more favorable
conditions for friendly contact between the two peoples, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader welcomed more Swiss legislators and friends
from all walks of life to visit China. He hailed the China visit
last year by a Swiss parliamentary delegation as a complete
success.
</P>
<P>
Leuba and Schoch said the frequent high-level exchanges between
the two governments and the two parliaments indicated that
bilateral links had been further developed.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for cooperation had great potential, Schoch said.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland and China had identical or similar views on many
issues, while their differences over some problems could be solved
through dialogue on an equal footing, Leuba said.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Zurich Monday for the four-day visit, the fourth
leg of his European trip which has already taken him to Poland,
the Netherlands and Austria. His next stop is Russia.

<HEADLINE> Visitors from HK, Macao on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- As the return of Hong Kong
and Macao to the Chinese motherland is approaching, a growing
number of visitors from the two regions have come to visit China's
interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that some 20.6 million trips made by
residents from Hong Kong and Macao came to the inland areas in the
first half of this year, a rise of 10.81 percent over the same
period last year, and up 13.5 over the corresponding period in
1994.
</P>
<P>
He Guangwei, director general of China's National Tourism
Administration, said Guangdong Province has received the largest
number of Hong Kong and Macao visitors, followed by Beijing,
Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Hainan provinces.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the number of travelers from Hong Kong and
Macao to the inland will increase sharply by the end of this year,
as a result of improved tourism facilities.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, with the simplification of procedures
necessary to go to the inland areas, the Beijing-Kowloon Railway
opened to traffic and the Macao airport went into operation,
making it more convenient for Hong Kong and Macao compatriots to
travel in China's interior regions, the director general said.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of China's transportation systems has
also given an impetus to the tourist industry, he added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, China's civil aviation departments owned
nearly 1,000 planes and more than 130 airports, and listed some
800 air routes, including 80 international routes. And 39 cities
in China's inland areas had extended direct airline service with
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, railway, highway and water transportation is
expanding rapidly. Fifty trains are now routed between the major
tourist cities, and there are more than 80 pleasure boats in the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, tourist lodging facilities have made remarkable
development, he said, adding that by the end of 1995, 3,720
hotels, with a total of 486,000 rooms, were built in the inland
areas. Among them were more than 1,900 star hotels.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the service for the tourists and guarantee
their interests, departments to supervise tourist services were
set up around the nation beginning in July of last year, he
said. So far, about 1,300 complaints have been handled, with
settlements reaching 1.7 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Contacts between tourist departments of China's inland areas,
Hong Kong and Macao have been enhanced, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tourist departments in the country's interior areas hosted the
International Travel Exposition in Hong Kong with their Hong Kong
counterparts, and also jointly explored a tourism project in the
Pearl River Delta, which has attracted many visitors from China
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Hong Kong's return to the motherland next year
coincides with China's Tourism Year, he expressed the hope that
tourist departments in the country's inland regions and Hong Kong
will increase cooperation, and encourage more Hong Kong visitors
to travel in these places.
</P>
<P>
"It's our obligation to provide high-quality service to the
Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and offer them a more pleasant and
colorful tour in the inland areas," He said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Party Boycotts By-poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has decided to boycott the parliamentary
by-election to the Habiganj-2 constituency as its leaders believe
the outcome of the voting is a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
On September 5, the country held by-elections for 15
parliamentary seats vacated by leaders of different political
parties who had won more than a seat during the 7th general
elections on June 12 this year. But the by-poll in Habiganj-2
constituency in the country's northeast had to be postponed
because of some incidents occurred in the by-election.
</P>
<P>
At a standing committee meeting of the party last night, the
BNP decided that it is meaningless to join the poll in Habiganj-2
because it cannot be free and fair.
</P>
<P>
"How BNP can participate in the by-election where result is
already prepared and right to free franchise is not guaranteed.
The BNP cannot participate in the stage-managed and blueprint
election," a BNP leader told newsmen after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting maintained that the nation had witnessed the
September 5 by-elections in the 15 constituencies where the
results were "prepared before the polls," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BNP Standing Committee also announced a program
of holding procession, demonstration and meeting in the capital,
divisional and district headquarters to press home their demands.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party has earlier given an ultimatum to the
authorities, demanding the resignation of chief election
commissioner Abu Hena, cancellation of the results of the by-polls
in two constituencies and introduction of voter identity cards
before future elections.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Eager to Ratify Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is eagerly waiting
to see the ratification of a border river development treaty with
India while efforts for its parliamentary approval are underway,
the country's official news agency RSS said today.
</P>
<P>
In a rare commentary on the controversial Mahakali treaty, the
RSS said that the Nepal-India treaty is a must in order to attract
foreign investment for water resources development projects in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Mahakali treaty, which was worked out by Nepali and Indian
diplomats and water resources experts after years of hard work, is
based on mutual understanding, goodwill and cooperation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is a watershed in the Nepali history in terms of
exercise of sovereignty by the people through their elected
representatives, the RSS commentary added.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India signed the treaty on integrated development of
the Mahakali river, Nepal's western border river with India, in
New Delhi in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the treaty has laid down principles of
benefit sharing for future hydro projects on the border river
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mahakali treaty has met strong opposition in Nepal
as opponents claimed that it provides fewer benefits for Nepal
than that for India.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali parliament is in the process of ratifying the treaty
which needs at least a two-third majority support of the 265 MPs
in the upper and lower houses.
</P>
<P>
The voting on the treaty has been postponed three times since
last Thursday as the ruling and opposition parties failed time and
again to reach compromise on the ratification of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
While the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist and Leninist, CPN-UML), which holds the key to the fate of
the treaty, argued that it could be ratified only after some
necessary corrections, the government side maintained that the
corrections could be made only after ratification.
</P>
<P>
According to the RSS, Lower House Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel
has expressed the belief that the process on the treaty's
ratification will be completed at the next joint meeting of both
houses scheduled for Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-eight reservoirs of
various sizes have been completed in Myanmar since the State Law
and Order Restoration Council took over state power in 1988,
according to an article in today's official newspaper the New
Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The completed reservoirs are able to irrigate nearly 392,850
hectares of land, it said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six more irrigation projects are under construction at
present and will benefit 640,000 hectares in extra, the paper
said, adding that 39 new projects have been planned for different
states and divisions in the country.
</P>
<P>
All these new projects including the completed ones will help
prevent floods and provide irrigation to a total of 1.54 million
hectares of land in the country, extending irrigated areas to 25
percent of total sown areas in the 1996-97 fiscal year from 19
percent at present, the paper estimated.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar State Law and Order Restoration Council is
endeavoring for speedy completion of new dams and reservoirs in
an effort to develop agriculture and the national economy as a
whole and increase farmers' income.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Becomes Major Equipment Supplier to Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUNMING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province, southwest
China, has become a major equipment supplier to its bordering
country of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China (BOC) has signed two new agreements worth
600 million Renminbi yuan (about 72 million US dollars) with two
companies in the province to expand economic and trade cooperation
with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The bank will extend credit loans to the Yunnan Provincial
Machinery Imports and Exports Corporation, and Provincial
Machinery Equipment Imports and Exports Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The two companies are expected to use the loans to export
equipment for ocean-going vessels, power stations, earth-dredging
ships and railways to Myanmar, and to help the country renovate a
ship-building plant and construct container wharves.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the bank's Yunnan branch has extended 1.34 billion
yuan (some 161 million US dollars) of loans to fund the two
companies' exports of power, railway and river navigation
equipment to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan Provincial Machinery Equipment Imports and Exports
Corporation has agreed to send the complete sets of
power-generating equipment to 16 small or medium-sized power
stations in Myanmar. So far, 14 have gone into operation.
</P>
<P>
The company has become China's largest exporter to Myanmar,
with exports volume exceeding over 100 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Yunnan Province Machinery Imports and
Exports Company's exports volume to Myanmar has also topped 100 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
BOC official Gao Dezhu said the export credit transactions of
the bank's Yunnan branch rank the first in the country, which has
contributed to the promotion of Yunnan's trade with Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Delta to Have Expressway Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has begun construction on two more roadways in a vast
transportation network project that is expected to alleviate
traffic problems in the region and promote passenger and cargo
transport.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the new roads are the Xicheng
Expressway, starting from Wuxi City and ending at Jiangyin City,
and the Guangjing Expressway, which begins in Guanling Town,
Jingjiang City and ends at another new bridge across the Yangtze,
at Jiangyin.
</P>
<P>
The Guangjing Expressway will connect with the Xicheng
Expressway, which will be 35 km long, and extend through the
Jiangyin Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Like the recently-completed Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway, the
two new roadways will be located within the economically-developed
Yangtze River Delta.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, greater economic improvements will be
evident in Jiangsu, where rural and township industry is
highly developed, with the completion of 1,200 km of expressways,
including the 154-km Jiangdu-Huaiyin Expressway and the
Jingjiang-Yancheng Expressway.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shanghai and Zhejiang Province have invested heavily
in building more modern traffic routes. In Shanghai, following the
completion of the Shanghai-Jiading, Xinzhuang-Songjiang and
Shanghai-Nanjing expressways, the construction of the expressway
between Shanghai and Hangzhou is gaining momentum and will go into
operation next year.
</P>
<P>
Work is progressing swiftly on the Hangzhou-Ningbo route, and
another expressway from Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senators Reject Bill on Free-Mail </HEADLINE>

<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine senators rejected a
bill passed by the House of Representatives that would grant
free-mail privileges to citizens who wish to write to the congress
on proposed constitutional amendments, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers said they rejected the bill because it was
against the constitution by trying to tamper with the charter to
allow President Fidel Ramos and his allies in the ruling
Lakas-NUCD party to stay in power beyond 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos has reiterated before the passage of the bill
that he will not seek a second term of office.
</P>
<P>
Last week the House Committee of Transportation and
Communications unanimously endorsed the bill, which will grant
franking or free-mail privilege for a whole year to all Filipinos,
to encourage people to send to the congress their views on
proposed amendments to the 1987 constitution.
</P>
<P>
Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago, chairman of the Senate
Committee on Constitutional Amendments, warned that it is
"unconstitutional" to do so to promote a people's initiative in
amending the charter.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A latest appraisal drilling
has confirmed the presence of natural gas in the Thai-Malaysian
continental shelves, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
An appraisal well in the Suriya field, about 260 kilometers
east of Songkhla, Thailand, and 140 kilometers northeast of Kota
Bharu, Malaysia, recently yielded a combined gas flow of 56
million cubic feet (about 2.07 million cubic meters) and 268
barrels of condensate per day.
</P>
<P>
The test drilling beginning on July 20 was conducted by the
Malaysian-U.S. group of Petronas Carigali and Trion Energy on
behalf of the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority, a bilateral
government body authorized to exploit petroleum resources in the
offshore area within the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area.
</P>
<P>
Gas was also found in Cakerawala and Bulan fields in the
7,250-square-kilometer development area, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Prospectors Rush Mineral-Rich Land in Ontario </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Canadian and U.S.
prospectors today rushed to the Temagami region of the Canadian
province of Ontario to claim the potentially mineral-rich land.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 square kilometers of wilderness in the region was
opened to prospectors early today after being off limits for 23
years.
</P>
<P>
Over 600 prospectors, from professionals hired by big mining
firms to independent stakers, were lured by the prospects of
finding gold, silver, zinc, copper and other minerals.
</P>
<P>
While the prospectors have 24 hours to stake claims, the rush
was over in hotly-contested areas in less than an hour, local
media reported.
</P>
<P>
Each claim must be at least 1.6 square kilometers and
prospectors have to drive in stakes at each corner and mark the
lines connecting the four stakes.
</P>
<P>
A good claim can earn the prospector nearly 100,000
U.S. dollars through selling the rights to a mining company.
</P>
<P>
Today's event is the biggest mining claim rush in Canada in
decades and maybe the last one in the province of Ontario,
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Metro Line due to Open Next July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A metro line is due to open
in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, next
July, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Metro Line is to open the day China resumes its
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong next year, said subway
officials.
</P>
<P>
From suburban Guanggang in the southwest to Huangsha in the
western part of the city proper, five stations will go into
operation in time to celebrate the return of Hong Kong, according
to Cai Zhenyuan of the Guangzhou Metro Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Along the 18.48-km-long Metro Line 1, another 11 stations are
also being built, which is scheduled to be completed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The subway requires a total investment of 13 billion yuan (1.6
billion US dollars) for the most-costly civil works project in
Guangzhou's history.
</P>
<P>
Cai said, foreign soft loans and income through leasing land
along the metro line would cover about two thirds of the spending.
</P>
<P>
The German Government has pledged 700 million German marks (466
million US dollars) in soft loans to help German companies sell
signal systems, subways cars and related equipment to the project.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government decided to develop properties along
the metro line and finance the project with taxes collected in
selling the lease rights to strips of land involved.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 27 parcels were to be put up for sale, with a
projected revenue of 3.8 billion Hong Kong dollars (780 million US
dollars), Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Leasing contracts have been signed on 19 parcels, he added,
raising a total fund of 2.47 billion HK dollars (506 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Relocation of local residents, plants and other facilities on
14 of the contracted strips of land had been finished and property
development has started on eight strips of land, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cai said, the local government deliberately postponed the
leasing of the remaining eight strips of land in mid-town areas in
hopes that prices will rebound in the future.
</P>
<P>
The remaining one-third of the project budget will be covered

he said. Floating metro bonds to the tune of 300-500 million yuan
(36-60 million US dollars) a year is a further option.

<HEADLINE> First Additional U.S. Troops to Fly to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- An advance contingent of
75 troops of the United States First Cavalry Division will fly to
Kuwait today prior to the deployment of 3,500 additional troops in
the Gulf country, the U.S. Army said today.
</P>
<P>
The cavalrymen will be airlifted from their Fort Hood base in
Texas with a load of communications equipment, Army spokesman
Steven Moore said.
</P>
<P>
"It will probably take two to three days to move all the troops
out of here," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the additional troops, to join 1,200 troops
already in Kuwait on maneuvers, was announced by the Pentagon on
Friday. It is part of the U.S. military buildup in the Gulf
region to counter what the United States called a threat from
Iraqi forces to its Gulf neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The United States was embarrassed by a postponement until
Monday of approval from the Kuwaiti government which implicitly
expressed discontent over the U.S. move without obtaining its
permission in the first place.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait did not confirm approval of the size of the new troop
deployment when it finally agreed on Monday to allow additional
American troops to be stationed on its territory.
</P>
<P>
The airlift, combined with a second aircraft carrier task force
already enroute to the Gulf, will raise the U.S. presence in the
region to about 32,000 troops.

<HEADLINE> Incentives Lure Foreign Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors will be
given incentives to develop agriculture, animal husbandry, natural
resources, and power and raw material industrial projects located
in the mid-western regions of China, China Daily reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
The central and western regions are rich in mineral resources
and covered by farmland, but economic growth and foreign
investment lag far behind the east coastal region.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiangdong, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, urged speeding up efforts to attract foreign
investment to the less developed central and western region.
</P>
<P>
"Economic progress and foreign investment in the hinterland
should include combining development of resources, agriculture and
animal husbandry and poverty relief, as well as setting up an
export-oriented economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the speech at the 15th anniversary ceremony of China
Association of International Trade, a national society on
international trade.
</P>
<P>
He said China will consider drafting preferential industrial
policies in the hinterland to stimulate foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"China plans to offer more loans to domestic enterprises in
cooperation with overseas investors in the central and western
regions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded firms in the region will also be allowed to sell
most of their products to domestic markets. And the local
enterprises would also welcome the introduction of new technology.
</P>
<P>
Liu also said that foreign investors are encouraged to
establish export-oriented enterprises, while authorities in the
central and western regions have been given more rights to approve
the use of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
At present, the economic growth and use of foreign funds in the
eastern coastal region outstrips that of the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
But the hinterland accounts for a large proportion of the area
and population in the country.
</P>
<P>
"To ignore economic growth and the use of foreign capital in
the region will affect the national economy by the end of this
century," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Owning to limited resources and rising labor costs in the east,
some foreign-funded enterprises find difficulties in expanding
their production and are exploring the possibility of investing in
the mid-western regions, which have abundant natural resources and
cheap labor forces.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Peru to Sign Tourism Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai and Peruvian officials
are putting finishing touches to agreements on tourism and air
transport that are to be signed when Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori visits Thailand in November.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Maurtua de Romana, Peru's ambassador to Thailand,
confirmed the plan when he presided over the first of a series of
seminars on "tourism in Peru" here last Tuesday, according to the
local daily Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have Peru back on track, the potential
profitability in the tourism sector has shot up. For investors
looking to buy cheaply into a rapid-growth market, Peruvian
tourism offers a ready-to-go opportunity," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the country's tourism business projected to grow by 20
percent a year, opportunities are particularly strong in lodging,
catering and other travel-related services, Maurtua said. Tourism
services in Peru are already were worth more than 500 million U.S.
dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is among 94 countries whose nationals are exempted
from visa requirements for a maximum of 90 days.
</P>
<P>
Trade cooperation between Peru and Thailand has been helped by
the establishment of the Thai-Peruvian Business Council.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries grew by almost 200 percent in
the first five months of this year, compared with the same period
of last year, to reach 40 million dollars, Maurtua said.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Change Strategy to Develop Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia's scientific circles
should change strategy to seek self-development with the
relatively stable economic situation, Deputy Prime Minister
Vladimir Fortov said here today.
</P>
<P>
Fortov, who is in charge of science and technology, said at a
press conference that under the present economic situation with
positive factors such as the drop of inflation, Russian scientific
circles should not be merely satisfied with "existing for
survival", but exploit potentials and actively go in for
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Russian science and technology has been undergoing an
"unprecedented" suffering during the past five years, Fortov added.
</P>
<P>
The national investment in the scientific and technological
field has been decreased ten to thirty times, from 2.5-3 percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP) before 1990 to 0.7 percent of
the GDP in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Russia took some reform measures during the past few years to
give support to the promising projects in this field by financing
them with government funds, the deputy prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
As for the time for the recovery of Russia's science and
technology, Fortov said that it depended on the country's economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Macedonian Official Praises U.N. Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Macedonian official
today praised the United Nations peacekeeping mission along the
Macedonian border for its success in keeping the peace.
</P>
<P>
"Under conditions of war in Bosnia and instability in the whole
region of south-eastern Europe, these forces ... have played a
very useful role in preserving the peace and security of
independent Republic of Macedonia, and also of the wider region,"
said Abil Tuntev, advisor to Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov.
</P>
<P>
His remarks are in a written reply to a Xinhua correspondent's
questions.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the peacekeeping force, known as UNPREDEP, is to
expire by the end of November this year. Macedonia has requested
an extension of the UNPREDEP's mission for another six to twelve
months.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia maintains that despite the normalization of relations
with its neighbors, the situation in the region remains unsettled,
which "brings dangers of new conflicts."
</P>
<P>
"Under such conditions, and due to the fact that the defense
capability of the Republic of Macedonia is still not such that it
can inhibit an external threat, the presence of the peacekeeping
forces still remains a necessity for a certain period of time,"
Tuntev said.
</P>
<P>
On May 30, the U.N. Security Council voted 14-0, with Russia
abstaining, to extend the mission for six months. Moscow said the
operation was too large and too expensive and should be extended
only for four months at its current strength.
</P>
<P>
The force, deployed to prevent the spread of the Balkan war,
has 1,050 troops, 35 military observers and 168 civilian
police. The United States has the largest contingent of troops,
with 550 soldiers, followed by Finland with 362.

Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa when he visits Thailand in
November, according to a government source.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. presidential elections and Thai political uncertainty
have made it difficult to set an exact date for the visit.

He would not elaborate on the draft, saying only that it
follows the framework of double taxation treaties Thailand has
with 26 other countries.

He said the treaty would ease the tax burdens of investors from

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The chief executive of the
organising body (SOCOG) for the Sydney Olympics said Wednesday the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) would be prepared to be
flexible when considering who would open the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
Dr Mal Hemmerling said under current Ioc rules, the Queen, as
head of state, retained the right to officiate at the Opening
Ceremony, but said the IOC was acutely aware of the sensitive
nature of the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The International Olympic charter says it is the head of
state, the Queen, (who opens the games) and until the charter
changes then that's the way it sits," Hemmerling told the
Australian Broadcasting Commission.
</P>
<P>
"However, debate has started and obviously the IOC is aware
that there is considerable interest in this subject in Australia,
so I have no doubt it will be discussed between now and the start
of the Games."
</P>
<P>
Hemmerling said it was unlikely SOCOG would raise the issue
with the IOC but the Australian government, which he said was a
key player in the organisation and backing of the games, would
almost certainly bring it up as the games draw closer.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson, world super
heavyweight champion, began his latest fight in a courtroom
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Rooney, Tyson's former trainer, is suing the heavyweight
for 10 million U.S. dollars, alleging breach of contract. The
suit was filed eight years ago, but jury selection began Tuesday
in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
Tyson showed up for jury selection, but it was unclear whether
he would stay in the area as the case is litigated. Tyson is
scheduled to fight Evander Holyfield in Las Vegas on November 9.
</P>
<P>
Rooney claims Tyson's late mentor, Cus D'Amato, promised him 10
percent of the fighter's winnings for as long as he fought.
D'Amato ran the gym in Catskill, New York that is now operated by
Rooney.
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether D'Amato did indeed make that promise to
Rooney in 1982 and, if so, whether it was binding on Tyson, who
was under age 18 at the time.
</P>
<P>
Tyson has claimed in a deposition that he was unaware of any
such promise.
</P>
<P>
D'Amato died in 1985. Tyson and Rooney had a falling out a few
years after that, when Tyson was the undisputed heavyweight
champion.

his negotiations with Chechen rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov
at the Chechen village of Novye Atagi.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations, the two sides also reached agreement
on the exchange of prisoners of war and the establishment of a
joint provisional administration in the region.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace deal signed by Lebed and Maskhadov on August
31, Russian troops were to be pulled out of Chechnya and prisoners
exchanged by both sides.
</P>
<P>
However, Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, commander of the Russian troops
in Chechnya, halted the pullout almost as soon as it started last
week, claiming that the rebels were breaking the agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the negotiations, Maskhadov said that he had reached
consensus with Lebed on all the problems discussed and there had
been no major differences between them.
</P>
<P>
Before his talks with Maskhadov, Lebed met with Chechen
separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, who told reporters later
that he and other Chechen leaders were making compromises in order
to achieve a complete independence for Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed issues relating to the establishment of a
coalition between the rebels and the pro-Moscow Chechen
authorities led by Doku Zavgayev.
</P>
<P>
Zavgayev told Itar-Tass new agency in Moscow that it was too
early to talk about a coalition, repeating his complaint that
Russia had yet to properly define the new administration's tasks.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Chechen separatist leaders, Lebed went to
the Russian military base on the outskirt of Grozny to meet with
commanders of the Russian troops in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Lebed arrived in Chechnya this morning for talks with Russian
army commanders and separatist leaders to iron out problems in
implementing the peace agreement signed last month. He is expected
to return to Moscow later tonight.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Posts Record-High BOP Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines posted an
all-time high balance of payments (bop) surplus of 3.95 billion
U.S. dollars in the first eight months of this year, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This represented a 300-percent increase over the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
BOP is regarded by economic managers as an important indicator
of whether a country lives within its earnings from trading and
investments.
</P>
<P>
Diwa Gunigundo, director for research of the Philippine Central
Bank, said the BOP surplus reflected an increase in the country's
net international reserves.
</P>
<P>
Net international reserves is a macro-economic indicator that
represents a country's foreign exchange assets less its short-term
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Gunigundo said that as of the end of August, the Philippines'
net international reserves reached 9.27 billion dollars as against
the 5.632 billion dollars recorded a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the improvement of the BOP level to more foreign
investments and strong foreign exchange remittances.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Croatia have
identical views on the future of the Balkan region, believing that
the Dayton Agreement on the settlement of the Bosnia crisis must
be strictly implemented, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said here today.
</P>
<P>
It will benefit all parties in the region to settle the Bosnian
crisis, which has threatened the security of the entire Europe,
said Primakov at a joint press conference with his Croatian
counterpart Mate Granic after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister praised the Croatian parliament
for granting a general amnesty for Bosnian Serbs soon and
approving an agreement on the normalization of the relations
between Croatia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Such moves will play an active role in solving the Bosnia
crisis, said Primakov.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister also expressed satisfaction over Granic's
visit to Russia, which was done only four days after the Bosnian
elections. He said it is an indication that Russia has played a
decisive role in settling the Bosnian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Granic, who came for an official visit last night, told the
press conference that his talks with the Russian foreign minister
were "frank and beneficial".
</P>
<P>
The Croatian minister said his country highly appreciates
Russia's "balanced attitude" toward Croatia and Yugoslavia, which
he said would be helpful for the normalization of the relations
between Croatia and Yugoslavia and for the process of the
re-integration of the region.

<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Senior machinery industry
officials yesterday urged the China Mechanical Engineering Society
(CMES), the country's largest engineers' organization, to help
invigorate the industry by promoting science and technology.
</P>
<P>
At a Beijing ceremony to mark CMES's 60th birthday, Shao Qihui,
executive vice-minister of the Machine-Building Industry, pointed
out that the industry is growing, but mainly in scale instead of
efficiency and profitability.
</P>
<P>
CMES, which has organized scientific and technical exchanges at
home and abroad, can contribute to the industry's major campaigns
for technological development, product quality and a better
industrial mix, he said.
</P>
<P>
Machinery industry experts and scholars, who constitute the
majority of 170,000 CMES members, have acted as a think-tank and
elite source of information for the growth of the industry, he
added. The industry is China's largest industrial sector and
employs 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
With 40 representatives of governments, scientific and
technical organizations and enterprises from overseas, CMES
yesterday opened its two-day seventh national congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
CMES, which is sponsored by the Ministry of Machinery Industry,
annually organizes at least 500 activities for technical exchanges
and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, CMES has organized 280 international conferences
and dispatched 290 groups for meetings abroad.

Each university will administer separate tests in political
economics.
</P>
<P>
Application requirements for undergraduates, who previously

<HEADLINE> Indonesian FM Leaves Chile to Visit Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas left Chile today for Brazil with a parting reflection
on the past.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We are very aware of the Chilean history but I'm not
so sure that the Chilean people are aware of what the Indonesian
people have undergone."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned his compatriots' struggle "to free ourselves from
300 years of colonialism, and then our fight for independence,
until we also achieved that".
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister arrived in Chile on Sunday for the two-day
official visit. He met with Chilean President Eduardo Frei and
held a working meeting with his Chilean counterpart, Jose Miguel
Insulza, to review bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Alatas also met representatives from the Chilean private sector
to prepare for the coming visit of an Indonesian business
delegation.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Indonesia was closely following Chile's
association with the South American Common Market (Mercosur), a
trade forum that can serve as a bridge between Latin America and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which
Indonesian is a member state.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Chile and Indonesia has been on the rise in
recent years but is still relatively small, totalling 397.7
million U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, Chilean exports and imports were 291.3 million
and 104.4 million dollars respectively.

SAN JOSE -- Costa Rica is estimated to have to pay 6.3 billion
colones (30 million U.S. dollars) annually for delays in the

Limon, the largest distribution hub of the country.
</P>
<P>
But the Chamber of Exporters of Costa Rica and the Chambers

<P>
Former Dutch national coach and UEFA representative Rinus
Michels agreed with his German counterpart, saying that the
greater number of clubs in the Champions League and the
multiplication of fixtures, including friendlies, reduced the
preparation time for internationals and left coaches with injured
players.
</P>
<P>
For his part, UEFA technical director Andy Roxborough agreed
international teams needed protecting.
</P>
<P>
He also backed the wish of coaches to announce their official
selection five days before a competitive match and three days in
advance of a friendly.
</P>
<P>
UEFA President Lennart Johansson said he would address the
problems facing international coaches.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Leads First Round in Chess Olympiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian team fielded its
leader Judit Polgar and routed Moldova 4-0 on Tuesday, taking the
lead in the World Chess Olympiad with 7.5 points in Yerevan,
Armenia on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 14 rounds of play began with the strongest national teams
playing the lowest-rated teams, so many teams played without their
best players to save them for more important games.
</P>
<P>
Garry Kasparov, the world's highest-ranked player, has been
saved by his coaches for Russia's more decisive games ahead.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov, the world's highest-ranked player, heads a Russian
team that won the last Olympiad in Moscow two years ago and will
contend for top honors again this time.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian team's strongest asset, Polgar, is a 20-year-old
woman who is No. 9 in the men's rankings and plays exclusively
against men in international tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Russia, China, Argentina, France and Germany stood behind
Hungary with 7 points each after Tuesday's games.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Armenia,
Ukraine, Georgia, Israel and the Netherlands are expected to
challenge Russia in the men's division.
</P>
<P>
Georgia, China and Hungary, who finished 1-2-3 in the women's
competition two years ago, again are expected to contend for that
title.
</P>
<P>
In women's games, China rushed ahead Tuesday, defeating Croatia
3-0 and getting 6 out of 6 possible points in two days. Russia
held the second place with 5.5 points and Romania came third with
5 points.
</P>
<P>
Play runs through Oct. 2.

<HEADLINE> Zulle Takes Yellow Jersey as Rominger Wins Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Tony Rominger of Switzerland
notched up the 10th stage honours by winning a 46.5km time trial
between El Tiemblo and Avila in the Tour of Spain on Tuesaday.
</P>
<P>
Alex Zulle of Spain took the leader's yellow jersey in the
overall standings after the stage.
</P>
<P>
Spanish veteran Miguel Indurain moved into the second place in
the overall standings after a battling performance on a day when
the riders were constantly buffeted by icy winds, a far cry from
the balmy conditions of previous stages in Andalusia.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like that at all, and on arriving at Avila I couldn't
even see the road," complained Indurain, referring to the groups
of wildly excited fans who lined the route leading up to the
finish.
</P>
<P>
The riders were none too happy at having to battle with a
treacherous, bumpy surface, which cost several riders, including
Frenchman Laurent Jalabert, vital seconds owing to punctures.
</P>
<P>
Jalabert eventually recovered enough ground to come in fifth
and stay third overall.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's 11th stage comprises a 188km stretch through the
Sierra de Gredos mountains to Salamanca and includes two third
category climbs early on -- the Alto del Parador de Gredos
(1620m) and the 1570m Menga ascent.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Retreat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street began
to retreat today after two consecutive record setting sessions.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.37 to 5888.83,
rebounding from a nearly 40-point slide. The Dow had surged 117
points higher Friday and Monday, reaching new heights each day for
the first time since spring.
</P>
<P>
Most broader measures also retreated as bonds fell and
long-term interest rates climbed back above 7.02 percent. But the
technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose, prompted by an
encouraging report from chipmaker Intel.
</P>
<P>
Bonds fell after a news report indicated that a majority of
Federal Reserve officials favor an increase in the central bank's
lending rates to slow the economy. Bond traders also were troubled
by a report that industrial production rose slightly more than
expected in August.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 3-to-2
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 442.59
million shares, up slightly from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 1.04 to 682.94, and
the NYSE composite index fell 0.99 to 364.43. Both had closed at
record highs Monday. The American Stock Exchange's market value
index fell 3.78 to 567.16.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq composite index rose 9.35 to 1,203.31.

<HEADLINE> Christopher to Visit Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher will make a five-nation tour of Africa in early
October, the State Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
Between October 7 and 15, Christopher will visit Mali,
Ethiopia, Tanzania, Angola and South Africa, State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We have broad interests (in Africa). And I think we've
conveyed a sense of interest and commitment to improving our
relations with African countries," he said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States should be active in Africa,
diplomatically, "an active agent for national reconciliation, for
mediation in disputes among states."
</P>
<P>
The first stop on the secretary's itinerary will be Bamako,
Mali, where he will discuss with President Oumar Konare on "the
country's efforts to strengthen democracy," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, there will be a variety of bilateral
issues between the two countries for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Arusha, Tanzania, will be his third stop, where problems on
Burundi and Rwanda might be on the agenda for talks, as well as
economic integration and development of that country.
</P>
<P>
Following the visit in Arusha, Christopher will travel on to
Luanda, Angola, which Burns said is a very important stop as it is
meant to stimulate further movement toward full national
reconciliation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Christopher will spend two days in South Africa, the last stop
of his visit, to meet with President Nelson Mandela and other
South African leaders, Burns said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General
Assembly opened its 51st session this afternoon amid uncertainties
over its finances and reforms in the international organization.
</P>
<P>
New President Razali Ismail from Malaysia, who just succeeded
the outgoing president of the 50th session, gave an overall review
of the issues the 51st General Assembly faces.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations faces a financial crisis that
threatens to cripple it.
</P>
<P>
"The cries for reform not only originate from member states but
are voiced in equal measure by the world public opinion," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. cannot be the vessel of power politics; neither can it
be sustained by noble interest and lofty principles alone, the new
president said.
</P>
<P>
He touched upon issues such as selecting a secretary-general,
without indicating any candidates.
</P>
<P>
Razali urged the member states to continue their hard work,
dedication and commitment to lead the 51st session to more
effective and professional manners.
</P>
<P>
The session opened without celebration, except a marking of the
International Day of Peace by striking a Bell of Peace by
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali outside the U.N. building
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
During the first plenary meeting, 21 vice-chairmen of the 51st
annual session and chairmen of the six U.N. committees were
also elected.

<HEADLINE> World Solar Summit Concludes in Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Solar Summit
concluded here this evening after examining and approving the
"Harare declaration on solar energy and sustainable development"
and the "program on solar energy 1996-2005".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony of the summit, Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe, who is also the chairman of the World
Solar Commission, the summit organizer, said the summit is an
ample demonstration of the deep concern of the world leaders over
environmental pollution, ozone depletion, desertification and
other crises in the planet and of their determination to redress
their past "self-destructive policies and actions".
</P>
<P>
On the program on solar energy adopted, Mogabe said it has the
potential to change the course of the lives of millions of people
in the world.
</P>
<P>
He added, the implementation of the program will contribute
immensely to bringing the majority of the people who live in
remote and isolated areas without electricity into the mainstream
of development.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 government delegates and energy experts from
121 countries and international organizations attended the
closing ceremony. Among them were heads of state and government
from 18 countries.
</P>
<P>
The world solar summit, sponsored by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, was opened
yesterday here by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, chairman of
the World Solar Commission.
</P>
<P>
The World Solar Commission was set up in September last year
to boost the wider use of solar and other renewable energy
sources in the world. It consists of 17 heads of state and
government.

<HEADLINE> Perry Says Coalition Still Exists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry said today that he found the Western-Arab gulf
coalition "alive and well" during his weekend travel to Gulf
states, Turkey and Europe to seek support for U.S. actions against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary was deliberately forgetting the rupture
between the United States and its allies caused by its recent
missile trikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line ... is that the coalition is alive and
well," he told a briefing of his visit to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Turkey and Britain. "They offered complete agreement on
the (U.S.) containment policy, which I describe to them."
</P>
<P>
He said the leaders he conferred with in the Gulf states and
in Britain "offered support to Operation Southern Watch and said
they will continue to support Operation Southern Watch in its
expanded form."
</P>
<P>
Southern Watch is the code name for U.S., British and French
air patrols designed to exclude Iraqi aircraft from flying over
the southern part of their sovereign territory.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that French Defense Minister Charles
Millon did not support the geographic expansion of the no-fly
zone in southern Iraq. Millon attended a London meeting with his
U.S. and British counterparts during Perry's stay there.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention the coolness received in Turkey as the only
member state of NATO in the Middle East that declined to provide
its air base for U.S. attacks at Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Perry was sent by President Bill Clinton on a whirlwind tour of
key Gulf states as well as Turkey and Britain in an attempt to
regroup the Gulf coalition, apparently torn apart by disagreement
over U.S. military strikes against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Britain Might Send Troops to Kuwait: Rifkind </HEADLINE>

LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind said here this evening that the British government
would be willing to send troops to Kuwait if necessary in an
effort to deter Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind made the announcement after meeting with his Kuwaiti
counterpart, al-Ahmad al-Jaber, who stopped in London for a brief
visit on his way to New York.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary told reporters after the talks,
"The United Kingdom stands foursquare with Kuwait in the defense
of its independence and its territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Asked if Britain was ready to despatch troops to Kuwait,
Rifkind said, "If there was a need for that, if there was
perceived to be a threat to Kuwait required international action,
then the United Kingdom would always be prepared to play its full
part."
</P>
<P>
"We've shown in the past the willingness if necessary for
troops to be sent. If it became necessary in the future we would
also respond in a positive way," he added.

<HEADLINE> Izetbegovic Likely to Win Bosnian Presidency Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent Bosnian President
Alija Izetbegovic is likely to win the chairmanship of the
country's new presidency, according to preliminary results
released by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The latest OSCE figures show that with 85 percent of votes in
the Bosnian Federation and 79 percent in the Republika Srpska
counted, Izetbegovic, a Muslim, won 629,439 as against 508,026 for
Momcilo Krajsnik, a Serb. Kresimir Zubak, a Croat, won less than
200,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Dayton agreement, the new Bosnian
presidency will consist of three members, with each from one
ethnic group and the top vote-getter will be the chairman of the
new presidency for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
All three men have won around 80 percent of votes counted so
far, and since Muslims are the largest ethnic group in the
country, Izetbegovic's chance as the chairman is brighter than his
main rival Krajsnik.
</P>
<P>
The major portion of the uncounted Serb votes is in the Banja
Luka area, which has seen strong resentment in the past few months
against Krajsnik's Serb Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
Robert Frowick, head of the OSCE mission in Bosnia, said that
the prospect of Izetbegovic's victory looks "increasingly
compelling" to him.

<HEADLINE> US Sends Fresh Warning to Iraq on No-Fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has sent
to Iraq a fresh threat, demanding that it should never interfere
with U.S.-imposed no-fly zones over its own territory, the State
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"This demarche... put the Iraqi government on notice that they
were not to take actions that either threatened the safety of the
coalition pilots or our ability to enforce the no-fly zones," said
spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
He said the warning was faxed Monday evening to the Iraqi
mission at the United Nations in New York. It was the second such
warning since the Iraq crisis erupted at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
"The message that we conveyed to the Iraqis will remain in
effect indefinitely. It has no expiration date. The United States
will watch very closely to see whether President Saddam Hussein
backs up his words with actions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its Western allies imposed no-fly zones
in northern and southern Iraq to inhibit Iraqi aircraft from
flying over its sovereign territory.
</P>
<P>
Right after the United States fired cruise missiles on Iraqi
air defense sites early this month, the Clinton administration
unilaterally announced expansion of the no-fly zone in southern
Iraq from the 32nd to the 33rd parallel, almost to the suburbs of
Baghdad, which in effect stripped Iraqi aircraft of flying in
their own country.

<HEADLINE> Solar Program Adopted at Harare Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing solar summit here
this evening adopted a program on the development and utilization
of solar and other renewable energy sources in the 10 years to
come.
</P>
<P>
According to the "program on solar energy 1996-2005", 253
projects will be launched in various countries during the 10-year
period to demonstrate the technical feasibility, economic viability
and social and political acceptability of solar enrgy.
</P>
<P>
These projects are divided into five categories, namely, the
rural electrification program, the global education and training
program, the water desalination and purification program, the
information and communication program, as well as the industrial
policy, market penetration and technology transfer program.
</P>
<P>
Of these projects, some are identified as high-priority
national projects and the others are high-priority regional
projects and global projects of universal value.
</P>
<P>
The program says the World Solar Commission, which drew up the
program, will accomplish these projects through mobilizing a
concerted global effort with the continued cooperation and
commitment of various governments, international organizations,
bilateral and multilateral funding institutions, non-governmental
organizations, the private sector, research organizations and
universities.
</P>
<P>
These projets were all put forward by various governments at
the request of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization in the past three years and decided by the
World Solar Commission.
</P>
<P>
Chinese energy experts attending the summit said the program
on solar energy is the most important document in the development
and use of renewable energy sources in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
They said the energetic implementation of the program will greatly
increase the level of developing and using the renewable energy
sources and actively promote the preservation of the environment and
the development of economy.

<HEADLINE> FAA to Buy New Computers to Control Air Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration has decided to buy a new generation of computers
and software to modernize hundreds of civilian and military air
traffic control offices, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
A contract to this effect was signed Monday between the
administration and the Raytheon Company which has introduced
computer programs including about 900,000 lines of code for air
traffic operations in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The new system will use off-the-shelf computers, unlike
existing systems that use custom-designed machines. When the
system is in operation, consumers will see fewer delays, the
system will be safer and more reliable.
</P>
<P>
The first installation will be made in Boston by the end of
1998. If all goes well with the initial part of the contract, the
government will extend the contract to cover 172 civilian offices
and 192 military ones by 2007 at a cost of nearly 1 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The contract signed Monday is the aviation agency's second big
effort to modernize. The agency has set out to replace all its
equipment in the early 1980s. But its procurement program was so
big and complicated that it ground to a halt by the early 1990s.

LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
all reversed their early gains and closed lower today, on fresh
fears of a rise in U.S. interest rates and a negative Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Shares in both London and Frankfurt had opened the session
strongly and climbed to new highs today, supported by Monday's
record close, before reversing their gains and finishing in the
negative ground.
</P>
<P>
Fresh worries over U.S. interest rates took its hold as a
senior central bank Federal Reserve official indicated that
interest rates might be raised.
</P>
<P>
But slightly-higher-than-expected August Pubic Sector Borrowing

<P>
The FTSE 100 index had hit a peak of 3,986.7 points in early
trading before ending 4.9 points down at 3,972.3.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt DAX-30 index also finished in negative territory,
down 1.79 points at 2,628.08, after a lack of investor demand made
for a dull market.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse followed London and Frankfurt's suit and

<HEADLINE> Britain to Announce New Strategy on Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- British government ministers
are planning a new strategy to achieve an early lifting of the ban
on British beef products exports after the European Union (EU)
Commission rejected the British proposal for a reduced cattle
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg failed to persuade
his EU partners at today's meeting in Brussels to accept the
British proposal that the slaughter of up to 147,000 cattle should
be cut after new scientific findings suggest that the BSE or mad
cow disease would be over by 2001 without the planned slaughter.
</P>
<P>
EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fishler has reportedly stressed that
the extra British cull was an essential part of the Florence
agreement for a staged lifting of the global ban on British beef
products exports.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the EU attitude on the issue, a spokesman in
Prime Minister John Major's office said that the government would
"announce its intentions shortly" on whether the slaughter program
would go ahead under the current circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made it clear that the government realized that
farmers needed to be relieved of uncertainty about their future as
quickly as possible and the government would therefore announce
soon what it planned to do next.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that the British government is likely to
tear up its agreement with the EU on tackling the beef crisis and
