STATE A LEADER IN MINE WASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
One complex of Arizona copper mines produces more waste than 47 of
the nation's 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Another Arizona mine produces more waste than Oregon, Iowa and
Oklahoma combined.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, because of hardrock mine waste, Arizona has had more
toxic releases than any state but Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, recently released by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, suggest that the decades of prosperity generated
by hardrock mining in Arizona have come at a price. How big a price
is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The data were released by the agency as part of its annual Toxic
Release Inventory. The newest numbers are from 1998, and show the
hardrock mining industry _ copper, silver, gold, etc. _ as the
nation's leading producer of toxic materials.
</P>
<P>
   But each side is wielding the numbers for its own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   An environmental group has taken those numbers and claimed it is
time for change, that the hardrock mining industry needs to clean
up. The industry says that it released the numbers last year and
that the substances, for the most part, are naturally occurring.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA, which compiles the numbers, is careful to say that
factors other than the number of pounds of hazardous materials
released need to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   `The question is, `Are they harmful or aren't they?` said Jim
Kuypers, consulting engineer for the Center for Science and Public
Participation in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   `Here in Montana, we have 10 of 13 mines that will require
water-quality treatments in perpetuity. Forever. We don't know what
mines' impact in Arizona will be.`
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, most of the toxic material is in waste rock,
excavated rock with such low concentrations of copper that it isn't
viable to extract it. Instead, the mining companies grind it up and
leave it in piles on their property.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, those piles are toxic: They contain naturally
occurring copper, antimony, barium, cadmium, cobalt and lead.
</P>
<P>
   But mining officials say: So what?
</P>
<P>
   `They're reportable because they're on the EPA's list. But in
the way they're handled and stored, they're pretty safe,` said Clay
Allen of Phelps-Dodge, whose Morenci mine released 142 million
pounds of toxic materials last year.
</P>
<P>
   But to industry watchdog Alan Septoff, the very fact that the
material is coming out of the ground is an issue.
</P>
<P>
   `It directly points to the problem of toxics in the
environment,` said Septoff, of the Washington D.C.-based Mineral
Policy Center. `If they weren't taking the materials out of the
ground, they wouldn't be exposed to the environment.`
</P>
<P>
   Some of those toxic substances would naturally leach into the
ground, critics say, but taking them out and exposing them to the
elements hastens the process.
</P>
<P>
   `A lot of waste rock will generate acid,` Kuypers said. ``Acid,
in turn, causes materials to leach.`
</P>
<P>
   That process, known as acid mine drainage, has been associated
with environmental problems in the gold-mining industry in the
northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   But Edward Hollop, a former official with the U.S. Bureau of
Mines and an industry consultant, thinks that responsible
reclamation is the key.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm not going to say there might not be problems where minute
amounts of copper could move around,` he said. `But if it's handled
correctly, there should be no problem.`
</P>
<P>
   Still, the EPA numbers are dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Asarco's Mission Complex in Sahuarita alone reported 336 million
pounds of releases in 1998, more than the total toxic releases in
all states but Nevada, Arizona and Utah. The Cyprus Amax Sierrita
mine in Green Valley reported 123 million pounds of toxic stuff,
about 4 million pounds less than the entire reported releases in
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But what does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   Even the EPA, which fought a long war with industry to get the
releases reported at all, is struggling to put the numbers in
context.
</P>
<P>
   `A pound of toxic materials does not equal a pound of risk,`
said Patricia Monahan, the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory
coordinator for the West.
</P>
<P>
   `For people to make a determination, they have to look at what
the chemical is, at how it was released. People really need to look
at all the factors.` &QL;

EVERETT NOT SHY ABOUT TAKING HIS RIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Carl Everett walked into Veterans Stadium
Saturday afternoon, said hello to Bret Saberhagen, shared a joke
with Nomar Garciaparra, briefly watched a big-screen TV showing two
boxers punishing each other, jokingly told 53-year-old bullpen
coach John Cumberland that he was going to knock him out and,
finally, stepped to his own locker for a shocking announcement:
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he said, ``I suck.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett said that before the Red Sox took the gruesome carpet in
this stadium, a place that is so 1970s that the ragged turf could
be replaced with shag carpeting and few would complain. Everett
spoke before the Sox lost to the Phillies, a team that frequently
plays tag with the Astros for the worst record in the National
League. Everett also got it wrong. He's terrible? I don't think so.
Some of his teammates should be willing to make the same bold
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have already had a bad weekend. They lost Saturday
night's game, 9-3, which ensures them of losing this series.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday night, the Sox thought Pedro Martinez would be the
pitcher who would oppose the Phillies' Randy Wolf. Now, if anyone
wants to argue whether a pitcher should be an MVP, tell them this:
Martinez has given up nine runs all season; the men who pitched in
his slot _ Tim Wakefield, Dan Smith, and Rob Stanifer _ helped the
Phillies score nine runs.
</P>
<P>
   So, no Carl, you are not the problem. Neither is Garciaparra,
whose average is .377. Neither is John Wasdin, who was strangely
optioned to Triple A Pawtucket and replaced by Stanifer. I have
never confused Wasdin with Sandy Koufax, but is there really a
difference between Wasdin and Stanifer? Phillies catcher Mike
Lieberthal probably doesn't think so. He hit two home runs, one of
them a shot to left off Stanifer.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the Sox are in the throes of something that
is preventing them from being themselves. They are a socialistic
baseball team, with everyone contributing his share of something.
But the only thing they have been able to do collectively lately is
catch colds. They are 4-9 in their last 13 games. This is not
necessarily a crisis. It is more shame than crisis because they are
wasting good opportunities. They have wasted a chance to separate
from the Yankees, who lost Saturday. They have also wasted some
amazing efforts by the man who _ incorrectly _ says he is no good.
</P>
<P>
   Everett has 10 RBIs in his last five games and 23 in his last
17. He has 18 home runs, including four in the previous five games.
He is on pace for a ridiculous 58-homer season. He had 11 RBIs last
week. If he keeps all this up, he will certainly be an All-Star.
He's not impressed with anything, particularly the homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what? That's one hit,'' he said. ``I haven't done anything
else. What else have I done? Guys have been on first and third and
I'll punch out. Or ground out. I normally make solid contact. Right
now, I'm rolling out to the infield and hitting soft fly balls to
the shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett is batting .327. He had a run-scoring single in the
fourth that scored Garciaparra. He was up with the bases loaded in
the eighth, but sent a sacrifice fly to right to drive in another
run. He cursed himself after that, thinking he should have had
more. But at least he got the RBI, a run that made it 6-3 with one
out and a man on third. Jason Varitek was up next, but the catcher
couldn't bring in another run.
</P>
<P>
   A man stranded on third with fewer than two outs. When you are
playing in a power era and are not known for your power, you have
to find a way to score there. These are the things the Sox are
struggling with lately. They need to get back to their socialistic
roots.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend like this, fans will be calling for Dan Duquette
to trade for Juan Gonzalez or Jose Canseco. Everett won't be one of
those fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, nobody would be
thinking about home runs like they are right now,'' he said. ``When
you see a highlight, all they think about is a home run. Mark
McGwire doesn't hit three-run homers because other guys hit homers,
too. He hits them because those other guys got base hits. I'm all
about the base hit.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The Sox don't necessarily need someone else capable
of hitting 430-foot homers. They have in-house solutions. For
example, Troy O'Leary is a .283 career hitter. He was on the bench,
nursing a .221 average. Jose Offerman is hurt. In a lot of ways.
He's on the disabled list with a .231 average. Both of their slumps
are much more obvious than Everett's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the Scottie Pippen of baseball,'' Everett said. ``I'll do
whatever you want me to do. If you want me to take a guy out, I'll
take him out. Want me to hit, I'll hit. Want me to catch, I'll
catch.'' Everett added that he will even take his friends out on
the basepaths because, ``Hell, we can be buddies after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox needed more than that. Everett, Garciaparra, and
Mike Stanley were the only starters to hit the ball out of the
infield. That's a problem that is even out of Everett's reach.

IT'S CURTAINS FOR SOMEONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The giant distiller that is the NBA playoffs has
reduced a magnificent Los Angeles Lakers season to a singular event
that could be as cruel as it is enticing, as unforgiving as it is
promising, with equal potential for devastation or elation.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight games later, all their winning streaks and records
and accolades have been boiled down to a simple proposition: Win
today and meet the Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals, lose and
render all those nifty achievements meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the last six days, the Lakers failed to finish off the
Portland Trail Blazers, and let control of the Western Conference
finals slip away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet among the many emotions that flashed in the aftermath of
Friday's Game 6 loss - anger, frustration, bewilderment - the most
striking came from the man hired to end the Lakers' long string of
postseason disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   From coach Phil Jackson: defiance.
</P>
<P>
   He was also calm and reflective and upbeat, and quick with the
one-liners Saturday, prior to a workout at Staples Center. But with
regard to Portland, which won two straight to tie this series,
Jackson was resolute: the greatest challenge still belongs to the
Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Because to win the series would mean beating the Lakers three
straight times. And of the many hallmarks of this season, among the
most impressive is the Lakers never lost three consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of meaning to it. It says a lot about our
team,'' Jackson said. ``And as I told the team last night, it's
tough to beat a team three times in a row, on their home court.
Well, guess what, Portland's gotta beat us three times in a row on
our home court. It's going to be a damn tough game for them to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet so far, the Blazers have overcome every hurdle in this
series.
</P>
<P>
   They have bounced back from a 3-1 deficit. Won twice on the
road. And in the biggest game of the year, held Shaquille O'Neal to
17 points - his lowest output in 10 meetings with Portland this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Blazers have chipped away at the feeling of
invincibility that Jackson said his team had created after sweeping
Games 3 and 4 at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Lakers regrouped Saturday, regret was one emotion
they didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just watched film, our normal routine,'' Derek Fisher said.
``There was no cutting off of heads or anything like that going on
in there. Just taking care of the business at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   They have no doubt kicked themselves for not putting away the
Blazers in Game 5, when they were at home, or in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do that now,'' said Kobe Bryant. ``After we win the
game, we'll think about it a little bit. We'll be like, `damn!' We
love putting ourselves in these types of situations, but right now,
you can't think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let yourself get too down. For what? You can't kill
yourself over it. This is our situation, and now we've got to deal
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The time for major adjustments is long past, so the Lakers - who
won 67 games behind O'Neal - will lean hard on the league MVP once
more. With, they hope, better results than in Friday's loss, when
O'Neal went 7 for 17 from the field and 3 for 10 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers have won, O'Neal has beaten the Blazers' quick
double- teams or exploited them with deft passing. Friday, he was
shuttered in and shut out, and - according to the Lakers - also
chopped and hacked without officials blowing the whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy, though,'' mused Robert Horry. ``When he does that,
the next night he's in another world. So hopefully everything will
stay true to form and he'll come out and carry us like he has all
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know him, he's going to get hacked and not get calls. ...
He's MVP, they claim he should be able to handle all that stuff.
But stuff like that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neal: ``I don't make excuses. We just have to come back.
We'll be at home. Hopefully, those shots will fall for myself and
some of my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who has maintained all season that he can't read his
team, said he had no clue what to expect from them today - fast
start or slow, high energy or low, defensive-minded or offensively
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   But he reflected the general mood of the team in viewing today's
event as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Blazers circled each other all season, finished
with the two best records in the NBA and have evenly split their 10
meetings. It is, perhaps, only appropriate that it all comes down
to one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all anxious, there's no doubt about our anxiety
level is high,'' Jackson said. ``And it should be. We're all
pointing towards (this) game with a lot of anticipation. We're all
wanting everybody to step up and play well, and supportive. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that this is all queued in to be a seven-game series
at the beginning,'' he said, then added with a smile, ``and I think
the NBA and NBC got exactly what they wanted.''

SHAQ'S LEGACY DEPENDS ON THIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Somebody asked Shaquille O'Neal's opinion Saturday
on Arvydas Sabonis' play against him in these Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   The look O'Neal shot his inquisitor was what you'd expect if
Diana Ross was asked how it was sharing a stage with the Supremes.
</P>
<P>
   A less frosty mug got Portland forward Rasheed Wallace thrown
out of Game 1 of this best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding Game 7 is today at the Staples Center. A good
thing, too, because what started as a confluence of the two teams
with the NBA's best regular-season records has deteriorated into a
toxic tributary.
</P>
<P>
   Any further games after this one and they'd have to dispense
with the three officials and bring in Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   We were worried O'Neal was going to go one-on-one with the
reporter who had Sabonis on the brain. His was a fair line of
questioning inasmuch as Friday marked the first game in this series
where the 7-foot-3 center stayed out of foul trouble long enough to
be effective against a player who long has owned him.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal saw it differently, of course, which is what happens when
you're blinded by pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done anything,'' O'Neal said curtly. ``He has three
players helping him. I don't give him any credit at all. None.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me about a one-on-one matchup. No one will ever play
me one-on-one. I've got four players on me. I'm angry because you
ask me about (bleeping) Sabonis. He can't (bleeping) play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen of the media, meet ``The Big Combustible.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's explosion wasn't all bad. It was a relief to see him
breathe some fire, however misdirected his fury.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-year center was strangely subdued in the 10-point
loss at the Rose Garden that forced today's winner-take-all grudge
match. Sabonis, Brian Grant and Rasheed Wallace used a triangle
defense on O'Neal that had the same effect on him as would 48
minutes in a sauna.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal moved lethargically on defense, doing little to clog the
lanes that the Trail Blazers used as express routes to the basket.
He was sluggish in the paint, shooting as though he first required
permission. And his free-throw shooting was an affront to charity.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal proved in Game 4 he can be a fabulous foul shooter when
he puts his mind to it; he made all nine free throws he tried in
that game and was a decent 7 for 12 in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing O'Neal has to do today, besides bend his knees
when shooting free throws, is come out and play from the opening
tip as though his legacy depends on it.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, 28, won his first league MVP title this season by
elevating his individual game to heights not seen since Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain patrolled the paint.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a terrific year in a resplendent career.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ...
</P>
<P>
   Fair or foul, the fact is this: O'Neal won't gain entry into the
circle of basketball's all-time greats until he succeeds in
exerting his individual will on the collective body otherwise known
as his supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   We're not saying he has to take 30 shots or score 61 points.
We're not suggesting he lead the search party trying to find Robert
Horry's jumper or help Glen Rice get his mojo back.
</P>
<P>
   All O'Neal has to do is lead by example. If he plays with
abandon and asserts himself early, his teammates will follow him
all the way to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, O'Neal suffers from the same persecution complex
that plagued Abdul-Jabbar and Chamberlain. It is the curse of the
big man, this feeling of being picked on by a world thrown a bit
off its axis by one's size.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, for one, thinks that what O'Neal feels is real.
The Lakers' first-year coach sees the bruises that cover O'Neal's
body like tattoos. He knows they are the marks of a warrior.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal largely keeps quiet because nobody likes to see a big man
cry. On Saturday, Jackson wondered anew if that's the right
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel that he should be more demonstrative about
what he's going through out there,'' Jackson said. ``He stays so
compliant at times that I think it takes away from the energy level
of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a former NBA forward for whom emotion was his primary
fuel, could appreciate O'Neal's acquiescence on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on a visiting court and you make an issue and
you're a pariah like he is in a town like Portland, it's going to
draw more and more animosity from the fans,'' Jackson said. ``And
we're trying to keep the crowd out of it. So that's part of Shaq's
game that I admire. (His compliance) is more than I could have done
as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Today is different.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are playing at Staples Center, where O'Neal isn't a
pariah but a prince. He can count on having 19,000 fans in his
entourage. They all will have his back. Where he leads, they will
follow.
</P>
<P>
   The stage belongs to O'Neal. The setting couldn't be more
perfect. Ready or not, it's time for his close-up.

UNSKILLED VALLEY JOBS PAY ABOVE MINIMUM

(PHOENIX) - In this economy, even baby-sitting is lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Baby-sitters are asking, and getting, $8 an hour, nearly $3
above the national minimum wage. And they're not the only ones
drawing higher-than-ever wages in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pay for most entry-level positions, such as customer
service representatives, nurses assistants and office clerks, is
$10 an hour, according to area companies.
</P>
<P>
   That's well above the national minimum wage of $5.15 an hour,
even well above the higher minimum wage of $6.15 an hour being
proposed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten so that ``nobody pays the minimum wage` anymore,
said Tom Silverman, co-owner of the Chaparral Suites Hotel in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman, chairman of the Arizona Department of Tourism, said
the service industry already is paying more than minimum wage for
beginning employees, competing in the marketplace against
restaurants and stores.
</P>
<P>
   At Avnet, a Phoenix-based computer components distributor, the
lowest paying, entry-level, non-skilled job _ that of custodian _
pays $7 an hour, said Jan Jurcy, a spokeswoman for Avnet.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is considering pushing that to $9 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Avnet and other companies are finding that they have to pay more
to get and keep workers. The Phoenix area's unemployment rate is
2.6 percent, well below the national 30-year low of 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fuddruckers starts its hamburger restaurant employees at $5.50
anhour.
</P>
<P>
   `That's just to get a higher caliber person in the door,` said
Glen Lewis, general manager of the chain's eatery at Superstition
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies still pay minimum wage, but to a smaller
percentage of their workers. Or, they pay minimum wage plus tips.
</P>

   Tosco, owner of Circle K convenience stores, hires its shelf
stockers at the minimum wage. But only a small percentage of the
firm's more than 3,500 Phoenix area employees are paid that, Tosco
spokeswoman Julie Igo said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Arizona Baseball Club, a private restaurant
at Bank One Ballpark, was looking for part-time food runners and
busers at $6 and $5.25 an hour, respectively. However, those
workers also get tips.
</P>
<P>
   Although minimum-wage boosts typically draw opposition from
businesses worried about profits, Clinton's proposed increase
wouldn't have drastic consequences, most local business owners say.
</P>
<P>
   Fuddruckers, for example, would not have to lay off any of its
workers as a result of an increase, Lewis said. But he may have to
cut employees' hours slightly to maintain profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Stallman is marketing director for the 130 stores at
Superstition Springs Center. He said that with the robust economy,
a $1-per-hour minimum-wage bump likely won't force stores to cut
staff.
</P>
<P>
   `I don't see them hiring fewer workers,` he said. `If they don't
have the sales people, they lose income.`
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Circle K may raise some prices to offset the
wage increase, Igo said. `It is always a possibility that if the
cost of labor goes up, so do prices.` &QL;

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - A young mother, much like the young mother of Elian
Gonzalez, gave up her life last week during a brave but foolish
attempt to bring her child into this country, and from the
politicians we hear nothing.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing from Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who issued a congressional
subpoena to block Elian's father from tak ing him back to Cuba
until the matter could be resolved in American courts.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing from Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who said he was `ashamed of
my government` for not trying to keep Elian in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing from Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., who called on
congressional leaders `to immediately bring up legislation to give
Elian permanent residency status.`
</P>
<P>
   Nothing from Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore or
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, each of whom has
said he wants a `family court` to decide whether Elian should stay
or return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   All of these statesmen, and many more, have spoken with misty
affection about how Elian's mother sacrificed her life to provide a
better future for her child.
</P>
<P>
   It's exactly what this other mother did. Still, they say
nothing, because she didn't come from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   She came from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. and Mex ican officials, 19-year-old Yo landa
Gonzalez of Oaxaca died last Monday in the Ari zona desert after
walking for days in 100-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   The whole time she carried her 18-month-old daughter, Elizama.
Others on the trip told investigators the mother only had 2 gallons
of water and drank little so her child would have enough.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda supposedly was entering the United States to search for
her baby's father. Young Elian's mother had a similar story. She
was on her way to America with her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians ignore such mo tives, however. To them, it's never
about displaced people seeking lost love or fleeing poverty. It's
only about Com munism.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keat ing, who once worked for the FBI and
the Justice Depart ment, said recently of Elian's case, `If a
mother had been shot by an East Berlin border guard and tossed the
child over the wall just before she died, we would never send the
child back.`
</P>
<P>
   Yet, we have no trouble chucking a kid back across the Mexican
border.
</P>
<P>
   Elizama was handed over to the Mexican Consulate and is expected
to be returned to her mother's home in Mexico within a few weeks.
No sub poena. No hearings. No court challenges. No speeches. No
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   We are told the little girl has curly hair and was badly
sunburned, though she is re covering.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Border Patrol said it doesn't provide
personal information in cases like this. And for the time being,
the Mexican Con sulate in Tucson doesn't have much to add.
</P>
<P>
   Why should they?
</P>
<P>
   There's been no outcry. Most of the newspapers and TV networks
that spent months covering the little Cuban boy's dilemma have
ignored the plight of the little Mexican girl.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to care about Elizama or her dead mother.
There's nothing polit ical to gain from their trag edy. There's no
point in being warm-hearted when you're still fighting a Cold War. &QL;

LAPD CHIEF'S GRANDDAUGHTER MOURNED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The day before her what would have been her 21st
birthday, more than 1,000 friends, family and public officials
mourned Lori Gonzalez on Saturday, decrying the out-of-control
urban violence that many, including her grandfather, Los Angeles
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, said her slaying represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lori is a symbol of all the victims who have lost their blood
to the violence in our society,'' Bishop Charles E. Blake, said in
his eulogy at the Crenshaw Christian Center funeral service in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed police officers and a gospel singer stood behind the
beige-and-pink coffin draped with pink-and-white roses and sang
``The Wind Beneath My Wings,'' and ``I Believe I Can Fly'' for her.
Ministers of several faiths praised her and a U.S. senator and the
president sent their condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after laying his 20-year-old granddaughter to rest on a
hilltop overlooking Westchester and the Pacific Ocean, the police
chief recalled the last thing his granddaughter said to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I love you, Poppy,' and then she got off the phone.
I will always remember that,'' Parks said while surrounded by
members of his family and the family of Joe Gonzalez, Lori's
father.
</P>
<P>
   That conversation took place on May 27, the day before the
Saddleback College student was shot to death in her Chevrolet
Caprice as she pulled out of a fast-food restaurant at La Brea
Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard in the Jefferson Park neighborhood
of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the intended target was a longtime
acquaintance sitting across from her who ducked out of the path of
the bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Police have named no suspects in the killing, but Parks would
say only that investigators have ``pretty good leads. The issue is
how do we put a case together?''
</P>
<P>
   The chief said that while he has been detached from his job
since the killing, the department has ``some of the best
investigators'' working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that they will solve this crime,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he has maintained his composure during the ordeal,
Parks briefly let go of the stoic countenance he had worn most of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Bobbie Parks, I could not make it,'' the
chief said of his wife as his voice quavered and he wiped away
tears.
</P>
<P>
   In statements from the slain woman's eulogy to a letter from
President Clinton to Parks' own comments, the death was
characterized as another example of how violence in American cities
- particularly gun violence - has victimized young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People across America have been shocked and saddened that yet
another one of our young people has lost her life to gun
violence,'' said Clinton in a message read by Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan during the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Blake, in his eulogy, empathized with the grieving family
members by recalling the pain he felt when he learned his son,
Lawrence, had been shot while attending college in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   His son survived, he said, and Gonzalez, too, would live on in
the things she had done and the people she had touched in her
nearly 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   She had helped build homes in Mexico with scrap material she and
members of her Orange County church brought across the border. She
taught Sunday school and when she was in beautician school, helped
convince a young man with scars on his head that he was still
good-looking.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of the Saddleback College student was printed on
the cover of the funeral service program, and inside was a collage
of more photos, including Gonzalez as a baby, a little girl in a
bunny costume and a graduate in a white cap and gown holding up a
red-bound diploma from Redondo Union High School.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said Gonzalez would live on as a symbol of the destruction
brought by urban violence, which he traced to factors that include
poverty, a lack of education and pervasive violent images on
television, movies and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Parks echoed that sentiment, and said the killing of his
granddaughter reminded him of how much needs to be done to control
and prevent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times we celebrate the reduction of crime, but we
still fail thousands of times a year,'' the police chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks' wife, Bobbie Parks, said she had a message for her
granddaughter's killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping and praying that you find it in your heart to
never do this again,'' she said.

THIS OPPONENT SEEMS TO BE A DIFFERENT BREED OF DEVIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Little by disarming little, we are getting to know the
New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Stars fans would be wise to heed the storm warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, teams have skated into Reunion Arena before, shrugged at the
Slurpee conditions, and slipped away with a one-goal victory over
the Stars. Those hockey teams, fans might smugly point out, were
eventually dispatched. The Stars were always on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   But this visitor is different. The Devils seem both patient and
purposeful. For the defending champs, they are 60 minutes of
matchup problems.
</P>
<P>
   With the Devils' 2-1 triumph last night, they snatched the
home-ice advantage back in their favor in these Stanley Cup Finals.
But that looms as just a subplot.
</P>
<P>
   They are beating the Stars at their own game, and then some.
Game 3 looked a lot like Game 2, which in some ways could have
looked like Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for Stars goaltender Ed Belfour, in other words, the
Devils could have won all three.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are on a mission, all right _ mission survival.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ken Hitchcock will be criticized for his decision last
night not to match his Mike Modano line against the visitors' line
of Petr Sykora, Patrik Elias and Jason Arnott. But Hitch's
explanation rang with an ominous truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed better advantage,'' Hitchcock said. ``There is no
point in only breaking even.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, breaking even at this stage would almost seem to be a
bold assumption. Arnott and Company continue to generate trouble
with their speed and stickwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been doing this for us all year,'' New Jersey's Scott
Niedermayer said. ``They're a big part of this team's offense, and
they did it again for us tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   After Arnott's goal gave the Devils a 1-all knot and denied the
Stars a chance to break things open early, Sykora's one-timer in
the second period proved to be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking even? The Modano line's best chances to level the score
were all stopped cold by goalie Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   As palpably unsensational as Brodeur was in the first two games,
he was solid in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what playoff hockey is all about,'' Brodeur said.
``There is no room to breathe out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a few good chances, but not overly. I saw most of the
pucks in that third period, and that makes a big difference when
you're late in the game. If you're able to see the puck, most of
the time you will stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   For eight months, that has been Belfour's credo as well. In his
cold-medicated fog Eddie was awful in Game 1. But he has given his
team a chance to win both of these last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Eddie played great tonight,'' the Devils' Randy
McKay said. ``I thought we had some phenomenal scoring chances that
he took away.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, however, was every bit his match, and then some. He was
helped along by the Devils' three penalty kills.
</P>
<P>
   But as coach Larry Robinson said, ``A lot of times your best
penalty killer is the guy between the pipes, and he made huge stops
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Modano matched against the Devils' Scott Gomez line,
the Stars were never able to cash an opportunity. Which made
Hitchcock's strategy seem for naught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was some change from Game 2 but, you know, we
are put out there,'' Modano said. ``The key to our success is our
depth, and if we are scoring one or two goals a game, we still need
that support.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it was last year. We always got key goals from
everybody throughout our lineup, and it made life a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, that was last year. These guys are the Devil.

STARS GET HOME-SCHOOLED BY DEVILS

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals had to look like a
big, fat juicy fastball to the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   They had stolen a game and home ice from the New Jersey Devils
in Game 2. They were three victories away from repeating as Cup
champions. And the next two games were at Reunion Arena, where they
had lost only once in this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say the Stars whiffed on the high, hard one, losing
2-1 in Game 3 last night at Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointed,'' Stars forward Joe Nieuwendyk said, summing up
the mood of the room. ``We had an opportunity with a couple of home
games to really do some damage. You really want to win, and,
obviously, we failed in that effort.''
</P>
<P>
   With a national television audience watching in prime time on
ABC, the Stars and Devils provided a surprisingly exciting,
chance-filled game. Unfortunately for the Stars, the Devils No. 1
line of Petr Sykora, Jason Arnott and Patrik Elias were the ones
with most of them.
</P>
<P>
   The line was on the ice for both of their goals. Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock had been playing No. 1 against No. 1, Mike Modano's line
vs. Elias' line, but decided to go away with it because he thought
they ``needed a better advantage. There is no point in only
breaking even.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano didn't seem to understand the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt after Game 2 that that would be a definitive
matchup,'' Modano said. ``Obviously, it was some change from Game
2, but you know, we are put out there. We play against who they
want us to play against.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' top line helped generate both New Jersey goals, the
first by Arnott to tie the game with 1:54 remaining in the first
period, the second a power-play goal by Sykora at 12:27 of the
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Patrik Elias after the game I was very proud of them,''
New Jersey coach Larry Robinson said. ``I talked to them before,
and I think nobody feels worse than they do that they didn't come
out and have a good game in Game 2.''
</P>
<P>
   They more than made up for it. All the Devils did. Without the
play of Stars goalie Ed Belfour, the score could've been a whole
lot worse. He stopped 29 of the 31 shots he faced, including a
number of point-blank chances to keep Jersey's lead 2-1. But the
Devils' first goal, the one that changed the momentum of the game,
bothered him after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wish I could have that one back,'' Belfour said.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils called it the turning point. Exactly one minute and
four seconds had passed since the Stars had failed to score on a
power play, including 49 seconds of five-on-three.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott, despite having company in the form of Derian Hatcher and
Dave Manson on both sides of him, managed to get a shot on Belfour.
The puck squeaked through between Belfour's legs. The Stars had
been caught on a change, Manson coming on for Richard Matvichuk,
who lost his stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that late goal there deflated us a little bit,''
Hatcher said. ``And we really weren't able to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, the Stars looked to be in firm control of it.
Thanks in part to a power-play goal by Stars defenseman Sylvain
Cote at 13:08 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey captain Scott Stevens tried to clear a rebound of a
Jere Lehtinen shot, but his attempt landed on Cote's stick. With
Devils goalie Martin Brodeur out of position and flat on his face,
the goal was open, and Cote took advantage scoring a power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have only allowed four power-play goals on 57 chances
all playoffs, best in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   But what the power play giveth, the power play also taketh away.
</P>
<P>
   With Cote in the box for what he thought was a questionable
elbowing call, the Devils took their first lead since Game 1 when
Sykora scored at 12:27 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a weird play,'' Cote said. ``I kind of got the
gloves in the face, an elbow. Even the referee was kind of yelling
at him to keep his elbow down. ... Sometimes, they're too slow to
see the first infraction, but they don't miss the second I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Devils got the lead, they never relinquished it.
They're a lot like the Stars in that respect. When they carry a
lead into the third period, they don't allow much offensively. They
literally choke the offense right out of a team, which they did to
the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' best chance was a power play in the first minutes, but
the Stars could only muster two shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it negates everything,'' Hatcher said.
``Obviously, we're disappointed we lost, disappointed to be down in
the series. But we'll talk about it \Rtoday\S and bounce back for
Game 4. We have a choice. It's fight on or quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have said it so many times now that they have to be
sick of their own lack of explanation for why they don't seem to
play really good until their backs are against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Which is good news for Game 4 tomorrow night. Their backs are
definitely up against it now. If they lose, they go down 3-1 with
Game 5 in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the home team looks to be having trouble holding
serve in this series.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe the whole home-ice advantage thing isn't that big
of a deal anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right back where we were,'' Devils forward John Madden
said. ``I would sum it up this way: It's like we won two games in
our building, and they won one in theirs. They have to win another
game now.'' nn

CALL 9-1-1: DEVILS IN TEXAS LOOKING FOR A CUP TO STEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ There's trouble in Cup City. A better team showed up
last night. It was the other team. This must be the work of the
devil, or Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the results of Game 3, which was all about New Jersey
being much more dominant than a 2-1 victory would indicate, the
Stanley Cup Finals has reached its first crisis point.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are now in a 9-1-1 emergency for tomorrow night.
Either win Game 4 or the Stanley Cup is leaving this town for a
toxic waste dump in East Rutherford. Next question. How do the
Stars win Game 4, based on what was seen last night at Reunion
Arena and has basically been seen through the first three games?
</P>
<P>
   In a very unpleasant surprise for local puck lovers, the Devils
have simply been better in all areas, including for Game 3 that
small piece of real estate between the pipes.
</P>
<P>
   You know the Stars are up against it when Eddie Belfour is
outplayed twice in three games, and it wasn't that Eddie had an
awful evening last night. In fact, the Devils had at least a dozen
prime scoring chances on Belfour, and converted, well, none.
</P>
<P>
   The two goals New Jersey did score were both of a questionable
nature _ in other words, Eddie has been handling those kind of
threats throughout the postseason. To call them ``soft'' goals
would be wrong, however. Then again, ``soft'' is the proper way to
describe the support Belfour got from his skaters.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back with home ice and the series tied was expected to
create a motivational frenzy for the Stars, and through most of the
first period that appeared to be the story. But once a 5-on-3 power
play came up empty late in the period, when there was a chance to
expand a 1-0 lead, the Devils put a pin in that balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our penalty killers won the game for us,'' New
Jersey coach Larry Robinson said. Larry is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was Arnott's \RJason\S goal that caused us to
lose concentration,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. Hitch is
right.
</P>
<P>
   Both those factors late in the first period turned the game to
the Devils. Or actually, the Devils simply took over the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first period,'' added Hitchcock, ``Jersey controlled
the level of play. We're the team that is going to have to pick up
the pace. Yes, there's concern. Our inability to outwork them in
their zone is where we are right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of that is a credit to the way Jersey is playing, but it
still comes down to us not being able to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The shock, of course, is that the Stars didn't use Game 3 as the
jumping off point to take control of the series _ actually, the
Devils did, and their 2-1 series lead looks bigger if you are
willing to admit New Jersey has won all nine periods thus far. OK,
go ahead and call a couple of the periods a draw over the course of
the three games. But it still says the Stars haven't come out and
dominated a period.
</P>
<P>
   Last night appeared to start that way. Scott Stevens' wayward
clearing pass on a Stars' power play was like room service for
Sylvain Cote. He easily beat goalie Martin Brodeur and the Stars
were off and winging. It seemed to get better a minute later when
the Stars went back on the power play, which would become a 5-on-3
for 49 seconds after Claude Lemieux took a stupid penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars didn't have a major threat with the two-man
advantage, then couldn't connect on the 5-on-4 portion of the
Lemieux penalty.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Reunion masses with an uneasy feeling, and sure
enough, Arnott made the Stars pay with a great play in the final
two minutes of the period. Coming right up Broadway at Belfour,
Arnott fought through a sandwich of Derian Hatcher and Dave Manson,
caught up with a slow-rolling puck, then tucked it between
Belfour's legs. The ol' 5-hole trick tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had played a great first period, then we lost energy on
that goal,'' said Hitchcock. ``I thought \RArnott's\S goal set us
back a little bit. I don't think we played with a sense of
desperation until halfway through the third period that we did in
the first period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils did thoroughly dominate the second period, and after
Belfour had some massive saves on one power play, New Jersey got a
second shot at him with the man advantage. Belfour was under siege
on this one, and his penalty killers couldn't clear the puck, so
they were on the ice too long. But what became the game-winning
goal was an innocent looking blast by Petr Sykora from the point
that Belfour got a glove on, but not enough glove. The puck went
whizzing through his mitt for the 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was mainly a case of Brodeur being up to every
challenge, including a 6-on-5 bomb from Brett Hull in the final
minute. That one bounced off Brodeur's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the victory belonged to the team that deserved it.
And now the crisis in this series belongs to the Stars.

CURTIS FILLS IN NICELY FOR INJURY-PLAGUED RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The trade was made right at the end of the
winter meetings, almost as an afterthought after the Rangers failed
to sign Todd Zeile or make any progress toward signing the
free-agent pitchers still on the market.
</P>
<P>
   On the baseball Richter Scale it barely registered a blip, no
more than one or two lines and a listing in transactions among the
national press. But, from a Rangers standpoint, Chad Curtis from
the Yankees for minor-league pitchers Sam Marsonek and Brandon
Knight is looking pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of many games without center fielder Ruben Mateo,
Curtis ripped a two-run home run last night that proved to be the
biggest blow in the Rangers' 4-3 victory over the Arizona
Diamondbacks at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers pitched six innings to get the victory, raising his
record to 5-5 with a 4.00 earned-run average. His back stiffened up
in the sixth inning, but Tim Crabtree, Jeff Zimmerman and John
Wetteland pitched three innings of effective relief in steady rain
to hold off the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland has 11 saves in his past 11 appearances, although last
night's was helped considerably by left fielder Rusty Greer, who
ended the game with a diving catch of Bernard Gilkey's high pop in
left-center field to keep speedy Tony Womack from scoring from
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of power,'' Greer said. ``When the ball went
up, I broke back. After that, I was pretty much sold out. With
Womack on first, as fast as he is, he's probably going to score.
When you dive for a ball, it's ... stick your glove out and hope it
goes in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took a 1-0 lead in the third inning on doubles
by Hanley Frias and Jay Bell. But David Segui's run-scoring single
off Diamondbacks starter Nelson Figueroa tied it in the fourth, and
Curtis followed with a 408-foot homer over the center-field fence
to put the Rangers ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I had a good rhythm up there,'' Curtis
said. ``I was trying to simplify things, then I got to 3-1, a good
hitter's count, and he laid it in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, who has started 19 of the Rangers' past 21 games and 37
of 54 overall, has seven home runs and 27 runs batted through
exactly one-third the season. He had five home runs and 24 RBI all
last year for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought he would have played as many innings
and had as many at-bats and done what he has done,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``Since day one of spring training he
has been a good fit for us. You feel good when the game is on the
line and he's up there. He knows how the game is supposed to be
played, and he has a good idea of what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis was acquired as a fourth outfielder and a part-time
designated hitter. But the DH part went out when David Segui was
acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays, and the outfield part looked
extremely limited when Greer, Gabe Kapler and Mateo all had
excellent springs.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before all the injuries, the latest being the
broken leg suffered by Mateo on Friday, putting him out for the
season. With the Rangers planning to move Kapler to center field
when he comes off the disabled list later this week, Curtis is the
everyday right fielder for the foreseeable future barring a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it before, you just stay patient because something
is going to happen,'' Curtis said. ``Each of the guys who were
slated to start have gone on the DL. You don't wish that on anyone,
but it's given me an opportunity.''

SHEFFIELD SHOTS SINK ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Dodgers are the road team this
weekend, but for two consecutive games, Edison Field has been
infested with Dodger Blue.
</P>
<P>
   The 34,589 sun-splashed customers Saturday afternoon looked and
sounded like they were split down the middle supporting the
hometown Anaheim Angels and the 5 Freeway caravan from the north.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers faithful had little to celebrate the previous night
in a loss. They waited six at-bats to cheer the first recorded out
of an Angels hitter in a forgettable bottom of the first.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Orange County contingent was forced into the
silent treatment Saturday and didn't have much to holler about in
the Dodgers' 8-3 win to even the interleague series at a game each.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield was the Dodgers' major noise maker, hitting a
three-run homer in the first and a solo shot in third to put the
Angels in a 5-0 deficit that was never overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels made the Dodgers' day - specifically pitcher Chan Ho
Park's day - much easier with errors in each of the first two
innings that scored two unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely man ... I love that,'' Park said of the five early
runs his team scored. That two of the five were unearned made Park
feel even more secure since it affected his counterpart, Angels
starter Brian Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make a lot of runs early and they make it an easy
outing.''
</P>
<P>
   Park's 5 innings weren't as cozy as he hinted. But Sheffield's
home runs permitted Park (6-4) to get away with allowing eight
hits, walking four, hitting one and throwing two wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just hitting that home run and putting us up 3-0 really helps
Chan Ho. He didn't have to go up there and think, `I have to hold
them down,' '' Sheffield said. ``(The Angels) are a good offensive
team and it was big to get those three runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Park's struggles were also alleviated by an Angels lineup that
couldn't capitalize on its opportunities. Anaheim stranded 13
runners, eight in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Park and relievers Terry Adams, Onan Masaoka and Antonio Osuna
limited the Angels to just three hits in 15 at-bats with runners in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoring runs hasn't been our problem. Just inconsistency with
pitching,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Ho did a good job and I hope it's contagious. Chan Ho had
good stuff. He made a lot of quality pitches and he had a couple of
lapses.''
</P>
<P>
   Park threw 114 pitches, 63 for strikes, a factor in his shortest
outing since he lasted just 3 and was shelled for eight runs by
Arizona five starts ago. When he was giving the Angels chances to
beat him with the walks and wild pitches, he was bouncing back to
get the big outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can have fun on one pitch.'' said Park, who had seven
strikeouts. ``I can make one perfect pitch, but I can not make one
perfect game. Now I'm really learning to make one pitch at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper (2-1), the rookie from USC, is quickly absorbing the
finer points of pitching. He's made just eight major-league starts
spanning the last two seasons. But he's gotten through at least six
innings in all three of his outings in 2000 since being recalled
from Triple-A Edmonton on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his failure to keep Sheffield in the park and that early
5-0 hole he dug, Cooper went deeper into the game than the more
established Park, allowing four earned runs, one walk and eight
hits with five strikeouts in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at his poise, this guy goes and pitches seven
innings after the start he had,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia
said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems Sheffield caused Cooper isn't something National
League pitchers have solved all season. Despite playing with
various injuries, most recently a sprained right ankle, Sheffield
went 3 for 4 with four RBI and three runs scored and has 17 home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at how selective he is as a hitter, look at how he
uses the whole field, how quick he is with his bat speed,''
Scioscia said. ``He's one of the top five hitters in the National
League, certainly. And out of the teams that we've seen, he'd be
hitting in the middle of the lineup if you put an all-star team
together.''

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ There were former Los Angeles Galaxy players
partying all over their old turf, making the acquisition that
brought Mexican striker Luis Hernandez to the Galaxy look like the
bad deal Galaxy management knew it was - but doesn't talk about
much these days.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, the young American striker lost in the dispersal draft,
and Roy Myers, gone because of salary cap issues - were sent to New
York so Los Angeles could make room for Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you know it, both came back to haunt their former team.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis scored in the 48th minute and Roy Myers assisted on
Adolfo Valencia's goal in the 60th minute, leading to a 2-0 victory
Saturday night over the Galaxy before a measly 16,876 at the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy is 6-2-6 after starting the season 5-0-2. They're
1-2-4 during this recent seven-game skid, with only five goals
during that span.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New York won for the third straight match since the
Hernandez allocation, improving to 6-6 under former Galaxy coach
Octavio Zambrano, who was forced to watch the game from a luxury
suite after getting tossed last week against the Chicago Fire.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said the Hernandez trade has disrupted
his team's ability to play good soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to forget it about and move on,'' Schmid said. ``Our
team is using that as an excuse right now. That the league took
these players away and because they're gone we can't play right
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have players that can play, and they need to step
up and play. We need to forget about what the league did to us; I
think everyone can see what the league did to us. If we can put it
behind, we'll be successful, if we live in the past, we won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was without striker Cobi Jones and defender Greg
Vanney, who were both with the U.S. National team for the U.S. Cup.
Jones, who hasn't scored since April 15 with the Galaxy, had his
best game as a professional Saturday, scoring two left-footed
strikes from long range to go with two assists in a 4-0 rout over
the Republic of South Africa in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Defender Robin Fraser would have been with the U.S. team, but an
injured ankle forced him to the sideline. L.A. was also without
midfield/forward Sebastian Vorbe, who is with Haiti's national team
for a World Cup qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   New York started pressuring in the second half as Mathis burned
his old friends, getting a fortunate bounce off the head of Galaxy
defender Paul Caligiuri. A long cross was sent in the middle for
Mathis, standing at the top of the penalty area. Caligiuri beat
Mathis to the ball, but his header bounced up and behind, leaving
Mathis all alone in front of Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis finished with a hard-low shot to the left-corner, then
ran around in celebration, lifting his MetroStars jersey, rubbing
it in with a T-shirt underneath that read: ``I love New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That (shirt) was not to disrespect L.A., I'm just trying to
make fans in New York,'' Mathis said.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis gave his impressions of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affected L.A. a lot,'' he said. ``You can bring in the best
player in the world, and I'm not trying to take anything away from
Hernandez, because he's a great player. But to take away three guys
from the starting lineup, that's tough to do for any team. It was
sad how it turned out, I was happy in L.A., but this is just part
of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid left another partying shot for the MLS after he was asked
about the trade again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe somebody's happy, maybe New York will make it to the
finals, and everyone will be happy,'' he said. ``We'll all have a
party when it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy had its chances in the first half. In the 24th
minute, Hernandez turned on Metros defender Mike Petke, then fired
a left-footed shot from 18 yards straight-away that narrowly missed
the right post.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis blew a good chance to score in the 28th minute. The
sneaky striker slipped between two Galaxy defenders, gathering a
cross from Adolfo Valencia, but he pushed his first touch wide,
allowing Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman to slide in and kick it
away.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez turned on Petke again from the left side, getting a
good look at the Metros goal. He tried bending his shot to the far
netting, but goalkeeper Mike Ammann made a nice one-handed tip
save, leaving the game scoreless at the half.

INJURY PLAGUE WILL NOT ABATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The gray cloud that seems to be hovering over
the Los Angeles Dodgers' clubhouse got a little darker Saturday
afternoon when another important contributor limped off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Todd Hollandsworth strained his right hamstring
while making a tough catch on a fly ball by Tim Salmon with two
outs in the ninth inning. He will be re-evaluated today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a pretty good pull,'' manager Davey Johnson
said. ``We're already short-handed up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth had been playing center field and batting leadoff
in place of Devon White, out since May 3 with a partial
rotator-cuff tear. Third baseman Adrian Beltre (strained right
hamstring) and catcher Todd Hundley (strained right oblique muscle)
are also on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth suffered the same injury last year in an April
exhibition game against the Angels. On Saturday, he chased Salmon's
fly ball into left-center at full speed and felt the pull on his
final stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just full extension and everybody could see when it
happened,'' Hollandsworth said. ``All I can say is that it wasn't
as bad as last year, but it's still pretty sore.''
</P>
<P>
   More moves: The Dodgers made roster moves for the third time in
four days. The team placed reserve outfielder Geronimo Berroa (bone
bruise on left foot) on the 15-day disabled list and designated
reliever Trever Miller for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Onan Masaoka and utility player Shawn Gilbert joined
the Dodgers from Triple-A Albuquerque less than an hour before
Saturday's game, and both played.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka, who pitched one inning for Albuquerque on Friday night,
got the first two outs of the ninth inning but then gave up two
singles and was pulled in favor of Antonio Osuna.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers recalled Masaoka for the third time this season.
They sent him to Albuquerque on May 22, when Miller joined the team
after being claimed off waivers from the Philadelphia Phillies.
Miller made just two appearances with the Dodgers and allowed six
runs in 2 innings. Miller will be sent to Albuqerque if he clears
waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert entered as a defensive replacement in left field after
Hollandsworth's injury. Gilbert, a 35-year-old right-handed hitter
who can play several infield and outfield positions, was hitting
.319 for Albuquerque this year with one home run, 14 RBI and five
stolen bases. He also made one appearance on the mound and earned a
save for the Dukes.
</P>
<P>
   Coach returns: Pitching coach Claude Osteen arrived at Edison
Field in the sixth inning after being hospitalized overnight in
Irvine for treatment of a kidney stone. Osteen was taken to UCI
Medical Center before Friday's game after complaining of abdominal
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Infield shuffle: Kevin Elster played third base for the second
consecutive game but only the third time in his 13-year career.
</P>
<P>
   With Beltre on the disabled list, the Dodgers will try Elster, a
natural shortstop, at third base, and Cora, recalled Wednesday from
Albuquerque, at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Elster caught a line drive off the bat of
Darin Erstad on his only defensive opportunity of the game. Cora
had five assists and started a double play in the fourth inning,
when the Angels had runners on first and second with one out.

Devils want sweep in Dallas, not a split 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When the Stars faced the Avalanche in the Western
Conference Finals, Colorado players and coaches, not trying to get
too ahead of themselves, admitted their goal in Dallas was to get a
split, thus taking home-ice advantage. They said they would worry
about sweeps at home.
</P>
<P>
   But Devils coach Larry Robinson is more optimistic. Even though
a split would give the Devils home-ice advantage again, Robinson
said yesterday that wasn't his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Robinson said. ``We are coming here to win both games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils are halfway to their goal after winning Game 3.
\Nsubheds:Still going Many have tried to explain the New Jersey
Devils' playoff success on the road.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the explanation, it's obvious the Devils have a thing
about sticking it to the opposition in that opponent's arena.
</P>
<P>
   With last night's 2-1 victory at Reunion Arena, the Devils are
an NHL-best 8-2 on the road during the playoffs. Their last road
loss came on May 16, in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals at
Philadelphia. Since that loss, New Jersey has won three consecutive
road games, including Games 5 and 7 of the conference finals at
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Road success is nothing new to a winning Devils team. When New
Jersey won the 1995 Stanley Cup, it went 10-1 in other team's
arenas _ the most road playoff victories by any team in NHL
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you explain it,'' Devils coach Larry Robinson
said. ``Maybe our team tries to keep the game a little bit more
simple. We don't maybe try to do fancy things we do at home. Maybe
we feed off the other team's crowd. I don't really have an
answer.''
\Nsubheds:Still not important New Jersey rookie Scott Gomez had no
interest in the statistic about the success of Game 1 winners in
the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   After the Stars' Game 2 victory, he was similarly unfazed to
hear that teams winning Game 2 have taken 25 of the past 28 Stanley
Cups.
</P>
<P>
   And most likely he will not care that Game 3 victors have won
the Cup in 44 of 51 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things you pay attention to when you're not playing
in the series,'' Gomez said.
\Nsubheds:The other guy Everybody knows about the ability of Devils
defenseman and team captain Scott Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   But his defensive mate, Brian Rafalski, isn't too bad either.
New Jersey coach Larry Robinson talked earlier this week about how
well Rafalski was playing in spite of all the attention given to
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Rafalski might not go unnoticed much longer after last night. He
threaded a pass to Jason Arnott on the Devils' first goal to get
the assist, then added another assist on the game-winner, a
power-play goal by Petr Sykora.
\Nsubheds:Can't keep a good team down If you think you've got New
Jersey in a hole at any time, you better think again.
</P>
<P>
   The much publicized comeback from a 3-1 deficit against
Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference Finals is only part of the
story when it comes to the Devils' unwillingness to be eliminated.
During the playoffs, New Jersey is 4-2 in games after a loss _
those two defeats occurring during its three consecutive losses to
the Flyers.

PACERS' BEST SETS SIGHTS ON LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was only one problem when Travis Best was asked
about the upcoming NBA Finals and started talking about boyhood
memories of Larry Bird against the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers aren't facing Bird's Indiana Pacers just yet.
</P>
<P>
   While most of his Pacers teammates were measured in their
predictions Friday after winning the Eastern Conference title over
the New York Knicks, Best said he had no doubt they will face the
Lakers in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the thought reminded him of his youth in
Springfield, Mass., watching the NBA's top two teams, Bird's Boston
Celtics and the Lakers of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way Shaq is playing, with the way Kobe is playing and
the guys around them, that is the challenge,'' said Best, Indiana's
point guard. ``Not taking anything away from Portland. But if
you're going to win the championship, why not go through the best
team.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the league's best regular-season record, the Lakers
lost their Game 6 to the Trail Blazers and have blown a
three-games-to-one lead in the Western Conference finals. Game 7 is
this afternoon at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   For now, only the Pacers can celebrate. The postgame lockerroom
after Friday's 93-80 victory over the Knicks was bedlam. Indiana
never has been to the Finals, falling short several times despite
often-heroic efforts by veteran Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit has been given to Bird, who says he will step
down as coach despite a 147-67 record in three seasons on the job.
Bird won three NBA titles as a player and was the league's MVP for
three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But after a quiet series against the Knicks, Miller took over
the spotlight Friday night, scoring 17 of his game-high 34 points
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who refused to bite on the thought of a Pacers/Lakers
final despite growing up in Southern California and attending UCLA,
has played some of his greatest games in Madison Square Garden. But
his best work Friday might have been a pregame pep talk to his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell by the look in his eyes before the game and
what he said, that he was going to be on,'' teammate Dale Davis
said. ``I definitely thought that he wasn't going to be denied.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lakers-Pacers?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time to reflect on what we've done,'' Davis said.
``We'll have plenty of time to think about that in the days ahead.
There are a lot of guys who have been here a long time and known a
lot of pain. This is a proud moment for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   A Lakers/Indiana matchup also would be of interest because
former Laker Sam Perkins now plays for the Pacers. Mark Jackson
also played one season in Los Angeles, although he did it with the
Clippers and left after demanding a trade.
</P>
<P>
   But Lakers-Pacers?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a difference,'' Jackson said. ``Either way it
is going to be a war.''
</P>
<P>
   That left Best to lend a Bird/Lakers showdown some historical
perspective and show that players can be fans, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember those games like they were yesterday,'' said Best,
who is in his fifth season from Georgia Tech. ``Those games were
intense. Everyone would get on the couch, and you couldn't help but
keep a ball in your hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celtics were huge in Springfield, but they were only my
third favorite team. Larry was everything, but my favorite teams
were Philly and the Lakers. James Worthy? That was my guy. And
Magic? Every game was so hard. Larry has brought that to this team.
It is going to be an incredible series.''

JACKSON: LAKERS TO PLAY HARDBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Lakers didn't like the way they
finished Game 6 on Friday, and neither did the Portland Trail
Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Blazers could walk off with the victory, they had to
absorb a few hard fouls (mostly from Shaquille O'Neal and Rick Fox)
and some harsher words (exchanged between Fox and Portland coach
Mike Dunleavy.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether a sign of Lakers frustration or a bit of tone-setting
for today's finale, it didn't sit well with the Blazers. Pippen
accused the Lakers of ``taking cheap shots at guys and trying to
start altercations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't see that in watching the tape,'' said Jackson,
who also argued that O'Neal's third-quarter knockdown of Pippen
should not have been called a flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has been poking at Pippen, his former player with the
Chicago Bulls, since the series began, mostly light-heartedly. But
he issued a warning heading into today's decisive Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Scottie's going to come harder to us, we're going to come
harder to him,'' Jackson said. ``And same with Bonzi Wells and the
rest of them. If they're going to come hard to the basket, we've
got to stop penetration.''
</P>
<P>
   More gamesmanship from Jackson?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's just basketball,'' he said. ``That's what basketball
is about, creating lanes to the basket. We started out with Kobe
(Bryant) being soft on Damon (Stoudamire), and he got five layups
in the first quarter, and I started hammering the point home that
you just can't give up layups. ... You've got to make them shoot
the ball. Eventually, we got the idea, but it wasn't until the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's scuffles with Pippen and debate with Dunleavy were left
unexplained. Fox declined to speak to reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Agony of the foot: After playing 48 minutes Friday night, Bryant
said his sprained right foot was ``a little tender'' Saturday but
no worse. But his schedule again called for therapy in lieu of
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just try to get the swelling out, try to get it close to 100
percent for tomorrow,'' he said. ``We have some good trainers here.
They're going to take care of me and get me ready for tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was limited on defense, Bryant was spectacular on
offense, scoring a game-high 33 points, including four 3-pointers
in the last three minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, things like that happen sometimes when you have an
injury. You tend to find your rhythm,'' he said. ``Your mental
aspect starts to pick up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bring it on: The Lakers didn't want the series to get this far,
but Bryant sounded enthusiastic about playing an all-or-nothing
Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``If you look in the past and look at
all the great teams, everybody's been pushed to the limit before.
Everybody's been pushed to the seventh game. As a kid, watching
those types of games, I used to love them. And being in this type
of situation, even though we'd much rather be preparing for
Indiana, it's kind of cool. We've just got to gut it out, that's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe at home: The Lakers practiced at Staples Center, instead of
at their El Segundo training facility, for the first time in
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've really shot poorly. That's why we're here,''
Jackson said. ``We've only shot once well here in three home games.
We have to come down here and shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have shot 38.5 percent (57 of 148) in their last two
home games, and 24 percent (12 of 50) from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're giving us those 3-point shots that we made (Friday)
night. ... We'd have loved to take them in game number five and
have that kind of success,'' Jackson said.

 &HT;    Split or shorted. Flat or fitted. Mitered or moire. There's more
than thread count to sheets
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Would the princess have felt the pea if she had
been sleeping on a 732-thread count Egyptian cotton Pratesi king
sheet set for a whopping $2,240, or 183-thread count Ultra Touch
set from Target for a mere $38? From California King to jersey
knit, bed linens have come a long way from sober white to sultry
black satin. The array of fabrics and finishes in today's bedsheets
is mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   Bed linens tell a bedtime story.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1800s, the bedroom was open to guests and was often the
site of a sumptuous sweets tray or coffee urn. The choice of linens
gracing the bed was as important and public a selection as the
fabric on the parlor couch.
</P>
<P>
   Today, purchasing new sheets is a relatively inexpensive way to
redecorate a bedroom, quickly make curtains or create a toga. Most
colleges now furnish extra-long twin beds in dorms, requiring a
fall scramble to purchase extra-long twin sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Need help negotiating the trenches of the linen department? Ever
wonder why one makes a bed? Curious about what Wallis and the Duke
slept on? Want to wow your friends with the difference between Pima
and Supima cotton? This edition of the Greig Files cannot guarantee
you a good night's sleep, but it will answer all these questions
and more _ much, much more. WHY DID CAESAR SMELL LIKE A BARN?
</P>
<P>
   Because he slept on a straw mattress. Every evening, Roman
citizens constructed a bed by placing straw in a crude cloth sack.
Every day, the sacks were emptied so the straw could dry.
Therefore, ``new'' beds had to be made every night. This practice,
according to the New York Library's ``Book of Answers,'' continued
until the15th century.
</P>
<P>
   CRUDE CLOTH SACKS TO DESIGNER DENIM SHEETS _ WHAT HAPPENED?
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century _ the last century, that is _ bed
linen fabric was sold from a roll, cut and finished to the
specifications of each user. Then along came World War I and the
need for standardized cot sheets and mass production of uniforms.
Rapid urbanization combined with these factors. Bingo! A market and
method to create uniform bed sheets appeared, reports Bob Hamilton,
spokesman for bedding giant PillowTex.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements such as no-iron fabrics (late 1930s) and fitted
sheets (late 1940s) made bed linens more household friendly. In the
mid-1960s, Cannon branded sheets, bringing prints and colors to the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who moved bed linens upstairs from department store
basements is Yves Saint Laurent, who created the first line of
designer linens. A designer name added cachet, drama and a higher
price tag to the bedsheet.
</P>
<P>
   WHY DO SHEET PRICES VARY SO MUCH?
</P>
<P>
   Fabric, thread count, finish and embellishments determine price.
</P>
<P>
   Linen costs more than muslin, for example. Thread count
indicates the quality and strength of the fabric. Finishes such as
Sanforizing (pre-shrinking) and mercerizing (treating with alkalis
for a characteristic sheen) contribute to the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, embellishments such as embroidery, eyelet trim or
piping chip in to the final price tag. Some of the most interesting
handwork on finer linens today comes from the nimble fingers of
Vietnamese nuns, claims one linen expert. Trained by the French
nuns who established these convents, today these artists work
wonders on fabrics imported from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS THREAD COUNT ANYWAY?
</P>
<P>
   The amount of threads woven per square inch. The finer the
threads, the higher the count will be. The higher the thread count,
the lighter and more breathable the fabric becomes and the smoother
it is to the touch. Luxury thread counts begin at approximately 300
per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   WANT TO SLEEP LIKE, WELL . . . A DUCHESS?
</P>
<P>
   Then buy the sheets that Wallis Simpson and the Duke of Windsor
snored on _ Porthault.
</P>
<P>
   This Frenchman and his wife (Daniel and Madeleine) gave the
world the biggest innovation in bedding since the first goose lost
its down: colored and printed sheets. In 1925, the production of
Porthault's signature patterns, violet bouquet and four-leaf
clover, were astonishing to a world awash in all-white linens.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for the high-end linen market comes from the Italian
firm of Frette, founded in 1860. This company is famous for weaving
crests (family, royal and otherwise) into bed linens. A Frette
queen sheet set (350 thread count, 60 percent Egyptian cotton, 40
percent silk) begins at $745.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the Tuscan hills, the house of Pratesi has been
manufacturing beautiful, embroidered linens since founder Remigio
Pratesi first sold his wares to royal patrons. It is common for
these sheet sets to be more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS THE BEST VALUE IN AN ALL-COTTON SHEET?
</P>
<P>
   Many purveyors of luxury linens recommend Charisma by
Fieldcrest/Cannon, the runaway leader in the 300-plus thread count
all-cotton market. The extra long Supima cotton fibers used in this
sheet are fabricated in a twill weave and finished with softeners
that enhance the feel and life of this sheet. Introduced in 1987,
Charisma was the only 310-thread count in a 180-thread count world,
reports PillowTex Vice President Stacie Cronin.
</P>
<P>
   WANT TO DRESS YOUR BED IN LUXURY WITHOUT MORTGAGING THE RANCH?
</P>
<P>
   Contact the new kids on the luxury linen block, John Stoddart
and his wife, Laurie Dusek of Madison Linens. Formerly employed by
New York's chichi linen store, Leron, Stoddart has tapped into the
burgeoning retail market for bedding (more than $8 million in 1998)
with low prices and high service (25 percent to 50 percent less
than other stores vying for the discretionary linen dollar).
</P>
<P>
   Ever need to replicate a painted tile on bath towels or bed
sheets? Match your china pattern on a place mat? Want your coat of
arms on a pillowcase? Madison Linens can make it happen. Traveling
the country by appointment, Madison Linens relies on word of mouth
to bring society mavens to their exquisite wares. Know what you
want _ a hand-hemstitched Frette pillow sham? Need your cipher on a
linen sheet at the ranch? Want to hide your children's initials in
the holiday tablecloth? Just call Madison and order at (888)
420-0668. While the first purchase may be modest (averaging say
$500), satisfied customers usually return with a larger order _
into several thousand dollars, notes Dusek. The first order is a
test.
</P>
<P>
   CAN I CHANGE THE SHEETS ONCE A MONTH, WHETHER THEY NEED THEM OR
NOT?
</P>
<P>
   If the fabric industry has its way, you can.
</P>
<P>
   Think the cotton gin and the Jacquard loom were noted
innovations in the fabric industry? Francital, a French company
specializing in explorer garb, has developed a fabric to absorb
perspiration and odors. The miracle fabric will be tested by North
Pole trekkers who will wear the same pair of underwear and T-shirt
for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, fabrics that kill dust mites on contact are in the
works, as well as fabrics for bedding and clothing that protect
against fungi and bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S WITH THESE LITTLE PILL BALLS ALL OVER MY BEDSHEETS?
</P>
<P>
   When the fibers of a fabric break or short fibers become tangled
on the surface, those annoying little pills occur. Choose bed
linens with long fibers whenever possible to reduce pill-ness. Turn
pillowcases inside out and select the cycle with the least amount
of agitation when laundering.
</P>
<P>
   WHY DO MY SHEETS MAKE ME SNEEZE?
</P>
<P>
   It is not the sheets, it is the dust mite _ and the little dust
mite droppings they leave in pillows and mattresses. Smaller than a
period, dust mites cannot be seen, and it has been estimated that
nearly 40,000 of these are in a speck of dust (hence the name).
</P>
<P>
   Control mites by cleaning bedding regularly (yes, this means
changing the sheets), washing them in hot water or vacuuming them.
Exposure to direct sunlight (well, airing mattresses on the front
lawn is frowned upon in most neighborhoods) also cuts down on dust
mite problems.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most popular means of control is encasing mattresses
and pillows in an impermeable fabric. Pick up a tightly woven case
made with tricot polyester or pristine (75 percent poly, 25 percent
cotton) fabric.
</P>
<P>
   LINEN LEXICON
</P>
<P>
   _ Combed cotton: Cotton in which the long and short fibers have
been combed or sorted. The longer fibers produce a more uniform,
fine and strong cotton.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cotton: A natural fiber that grows in the seed pod of the
cotton plant. Fibers are typically 1/2 inch to 2 inches long. The
longest staple fibers, longer than 1 1/2 inch, including the Pima
and Egyptian varieties, produce the highest quality fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Damask: A Jacquard woven pattern fabric made of cotton, linen,
silk or blends. Patterns are reversible and flat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Egyptian cotton: Fabric made from cotton grown on the banks of
the Nile River, generally acknowledged as the finest in the world
because of the large percentage of long fibers in the cotton.
</P>
<P>
   _ Linen: A natural fiber made from the woody stem of a flax
plant. One of the oldest textiles, linen fibers are stronger and
more lustrous than cotton fibers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flannel: A medium-weight, plain or twill weave fabric that is
typically made from cotton, a cotton blend or wool. The fabric is
very soft, brushed on both sides to lift the fiber ends out of the
base fabric and create a soft, fuzzy surface.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jacquard: Woven fabric using a Jacquard attachment on the
loom, which allows for intricate patterns. The Jacquard loom was
invented in 1801 by Joseph-Marie Jacquard.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jersey knit: A fabric with the feel of all cotton without all
the wrinkles. This fabric is smooth but more textured because it is
knitted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Muslin: A plain weave fabric with a thread count usually
between 128 and 180 threads per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Percale: A medium-weight, plain weave, low-to-medium count
(usually 180 to 250 threads per square inch) cottonlike fabric.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pima cotton: A superior medium- to long-staple cotton commonly
grown in the Southwest, named for Pima County, Ariz. Pima cotton is
also grown abroad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sateen: A fabric made from yarns with low luster, such as
cotton or other staple length fibers. The fabric has a soft, smooth
feel and a gentle, subtle luster.
</P>
<P>
   _ Silk: A natural fiber made from the filaments silkworms use to
make cocoons. Most silk is collected from cultivated worms; Tussah
silk, or wild silk, is a thicker, shorter fiber produced by worms
in their natural habitat. Silk was believed to be discovered by a
Chinese princess.
</P>
<P>
   _ Supima cotton: Long fiber fabric made entirely from Pima
cotton grown in the United States.

 &HT;    Will we FALL for this?
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ New and different? Nope. More like tried and
true, right down to a crowd of well-known stars.
</P>
<P>
   When the new fall TV season arrives, we'll see more adult dramas
_ a welcome trend that sprang up last season as a backlash to all
the idiotic teen and twentysomething shows.
</P>
<P>
   We'll also see a few more minority faces, a tiny step forward in
the diversity wars. And we'll have two whole nights without
newsmagazines, thanks to cutbacks by ``Dateline NBC'' and ABC's
``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think the picture is entirely too rosy, we'll get a
fourth night of ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' _ with the threat
of more if ABC's other series stumble out of the starting gate. All
Regis, all the time seems like creative bankruptcy. What happens to
the No. 1 network when people get tired of ``final answers''? We
may find out sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year critics love most. The networks have
announced their fall schedules, but pilots are just beginning to
trickle in (most of which are incomplete and not for review). That
means knee-jerk assessments are the order of the day. Based on
sketchy plot descriptions, casting information and old-fashioned
hunches, astute conclusions are drawn that could be meaningless by
the time the Olympics-delayed fall season rolls around in October.
</P>
<P>
   But hastily drawn conclusions are fun, so why not play the game?
And most things probably won't change all that much.
</P>
<P>
   Even with some last-minute tinkering, 34 new series, along with
three canceled-then-relocated series, will debut on the six
broadcast networks. With the exception of a half-dozen sci-fi shows
(including a rare anthology, Fox's ``Night Visions'') and a
half-hour sketch comedy (WB's ``Hype''), the newcomers are
overwhelmingly traditional. At least they sound traditional at this
stage of the game.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, there will be more new dramas (18)
than sitcoms (16) on the prime-time schedule. And most of the
dramas star adults. From the sublime (``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'') to the
ridiculous (``Cold Feet''), youth dramas were rejected last year in
favor of mature shows such as ``The West Wing'' and ``Family Law,''
and network programmers paid attention this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown stars were rejected, too. Among the drama stars this
fall are Andre Braugher in the medical series ``Gideon's
Crossing,'' Tim Daly in a remake of ``The Fugitive,'' Ellen Burstyn
in the family drama ``That's Life,'' Craig T. Nelson in the
capital-set cop show ``The District,'' Victoria Principal and
Yasmine Bleeth in the Aaron Spelling sudser ``Titans'' and Fyvush
Finkel in the high school-set (but teacher-focused) drama ``Boston
Public.''
</P>
<P>
   The new comedies have even more famous folks, including the
already heavily promoted Bette Midler as a character closely
resembling herself in CBS's ``The Bette Show,'' Geena Davis and
Peter Horton as a married couple in ``Geena,'' Gabriel Byrne as a
divorced father in ``Madigan Men,'' Christine Baranski as a morning
talk-show host in ``Welcome to New York,'' John Goodman as a gay
dad in ``Don't Ask,'' Katey Sagal as (what else?) an edgy but
matronly aunt in ``Tucker,'' David Alan Grier and Delta Burke as a
Secret Service agent and the First Lady respectively in ``DAG,''
Michael Richards as a Kramer-style, bumbling detective in a
still-untitled comedy for NBC and Steven Weber as a cursed bachelor
in another untitled NBC sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   The old adage that TV shows don't need big stars to succeed
because they make their own stars apparently is out the window.
With the audience splintered by cable and other home entertainment
alternatives, new series have to hit quick to stay on, and
producers feel they have a better shot with a familiar face or two
in the cast.
</P>
<P>
   With producers now casting bankable stars, the networks are
doing the same thing tracking down proven producer-stars. These
power brokers have strong track records, although even the likes of
David E. Kelley can fall flat. (Remember last fall's ``Snoops''?
Neither does anyone else.)
</P>
<P>
   But big wigs like Kelley, who's responsible for ``The Practice''
and ``Ally McBeal,'' attract good actors and the best writers to
new projects. That's why the buzz is already positive for Kelley's
new Fox drama ``Boston Public.'' And that's why this fall's lineup
features even more series from hit makers. Dick Wolf (``Law &AMP;
Order'') has ``Deadline''; Darren Star (``Sex and the City,''
``Beverly Hills, 90210'') has ``The $treet,'' about rich young
turks on Wall Street, and ``Grosse Pointe,'' a spoof of his own
youth melodramas; Paul Attanasio (``Homicide: Life on the Street'')
has ``Gideon's Crossing''; and Aaron Spelling (``Dynasty,''
``Melrose Place'') has ``Titans.''
</P>
<P>
   Howls of protests followed by promises of change headlined last
season's diversity story. A coalition of minority leaders
threatened a boycott when the new series arrived last September
with overwhelmingly white casts. Not to split hairs, but those
leaders failed to notice that NBC's ``Third Watch'' was populated
by the definitive rainbow coalition. Nevertheless, network
executives agreed they could and should do better.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Emmy winner Andre Braugher stars as a crusading
doctor/medical professor in ``Gideon's Crossing,'' with Ruben
Blades among the supporting players. David Alan Grier got his own
sitcom (``DAG'') named with his own initials, Mykelti Williamson
(Bubba from ``Forrest Gump'') plays Lt. Gerard on ``The Fugitive,''
and Rocky Carroll (late of ``Chicago Hope'') co-stars in ``Welcome
to New York.'' Minority players also have substantial roles in
``The District'' (although the chief of police in this primarily
African American city is white), ``Boston Public,'' ``Fearsum,''
``Girlfriends'' and ``Hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics, woefully underrepresented on network TV, were
understandably miffed that CBS passed on ``American Family,'' a
drama created by filmmaker Gregory Nava and starring Edward James
Olmos. There's a chance CBS will pick it up for midseason _ or ship
it to another network.
</P>
<P>
   After tanking with edgy new series such as ``Action!'' and
``Wonderland'' last year, it's clear the networks are not in the
mood to experiment. The message went out loud and clear when the
only breakaway hit of the season was a representative of a
retro-genre (game shows) from the '50s. Better to be safe, and
possibly bland, than sorry.
</P>
<P>
   OUT ON A LIMB (AND HOLDING A SAW)
</P>
<P>
   Sight unseen, these newcomers have potential. OK, I know I may
look ridiculous if that opinion does an about-face in reviews I
write after seeing the pilots, but that's a risk worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   DRAMAS
</P>
<P>
   ``Gideon's Crossing'' _ I'd watch Andre Braugher read the Yellow
Pages, but here he'll have juicy material from Paul Attanasio, who
wrote many of the actor's best ``Homicide'' episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fugitive'' _ The original series was great; so was the
Harrison Ford movie. With Tim Daly in the lead, this could be a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deadline'' _ Dick Wolf takes on New York newspapers as a
dramatic milieu with Oliver Platt as a hard-charging reporter.
What's not to like?
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston Public'' _ David E. Kelley always surprises, and the
life of teachers in a public high school gives him a rich, fresh
venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Night Visions'' _ A scary anthology? If it's handled right,
this will give a new twist to the plethora of TV dramas. Aidan
Quinn stars in the first installment. That's a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   COMEDIES
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bette Show'' _ The Divine Miss M pokes fun at herself and
takes us all on a wild ride. I've seen a rough cut of the pilot,
and it's fabulous, dahlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grosse Pointe'' _ This will either sink or soar, but the
notion of Darren Star satirizing the teen-pout genre he created on
``Beverly Hills, 90210'' is tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``DAG'' _ Unless the writers totally botch this one, it's a slam
dunk. David Alan Grier as a Secret Service agent guarding First
Lady Delta Burke just sounds hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Richards Project'' _ Kramer was often the best
character on ``Seinfeld,'' and Inspector Clouseau was a classic.
This sitcom supposedly combines the two. Chuckle city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven Weber Project'' _ Funny on ``Wings,'' he'll be funny on
this.
</P>
<P>
   CHANGE OF ADDRESS
</P>
<P>
   ``The P.J.s,'' Eddie Murphy's clay animation comedy about life
in the projects, was axed by Fox but picked up by the WB.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughleys'' bit the dust when ABC dismantled its TGIF
lineup, so UPN nabbed the family sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch,'' another refugee from ABC's TGIF
comedies, moves to the WB.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FI SEASON
</P>
<P>
   Little green men with pitch-black eyes? Nope. Futuristic
creepiness and tales of the para-
</P>
<P>
   normal will seep into prime time, and Fox looks to be the
biggest creep of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Angel'' (FOX) _ From Oscar-winner James Cameron
(``Titanic'') comes a future thriller set in post-apocalyptic
America and featuring a genetically-enhanced human prototype and
her cyber-journalist sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fearsum'' (FOX) _ Tales of the supernatural via the Internet,
from the producer of ``The Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Night Visions'' (FOX) _ An anthology series with stories
ranging from horror to supernatural to psychological, a la ``The
Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lone Gunmen'' (FOX) _ A spinoff from ``The X-Files''
featuring the nerdy trio of computer-hacking conspiracy theorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom'' (UPN) _ Joel Silver, executive producer of ``The
Matrix'' and ``Lethal Weapon,'' created this futuristic war series
that promises to be riddled with violence and special effects.

 &HT;    Massage therapist's fine-tuned fingers land him in prestigious
Van Cliburn competition for amateur pianists
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Joey Freeman, an Athens, Ga. massage therapist who
sometimes works with University of Georgia athletes, sure has his
hands full today. He's trying to coax a personal best from the
curvaceously buffed giant in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeman's 9-foot wonder isn't some bulked-up Bulldog jock.
It's a shiny black Steinway concert grand piano. And it's Freeman _
who holds two master's degrees in music from the university _ who's
playing to win. Just a year after earning a certificate from the
Atlanta School of Massage and performing his first public recital
in 15 years (both in the same month), this spritely 49-year-old has
earned a slot in the Van Cliburn International Competition for
Outstanding Amateurs, running today through Saturday in Fort Worth,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a feel-good story.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, it was Australian pianist David Helfgott making
a comeback after the film ``Shine.'' Now it's Freeman, who's found
that his piano-playing is a natural lubricant for his job as a
moonlighting masseur. Seems the more he tickles the ivories, the
better he gets at turning his clients' muscles into butter. Don't
laugh: This guy not only has two 10-digit careers, but he's also
found what may be the ultimate niche market.
</P>
<P>
   Even at his 9-to-5 job, as a clerk at the university's school of
music, he's been known to give a neck rub to a stressed-out player
in a pinch. ``You have to be somewhat discerning about raking in
money on the side while you are supposedly working,'' jokes the
virtuoso about his newfound vocation. ``I don't abuse my position
here in any way whatsoever,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   An effervescent and excitable man who seemingly can do anything
he sets his mind to, Freeman has been a familiar campus figure on
and off since 1968, when he arrived as an eager freshman from
Toomsboro, Ga. But after getting master's degrees in both piano
performance and musicology, he burned out on concertizing and
became equally turned off with searching for teaching positions in
the highly competitive university world. After getting an MBA in
human resources, he became a nationally published author and expert
in career planning and college placement. Thus he's taught piano
here in Georgia, career strategy to a Tibetan community in
Dharmsala, India, and been an internal auditor with the University
System of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until a series of strokes left his mother unable
to move or feed herself that he began to value physical wellness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe psychologically that's why I'm into massage
therapy,'' he says over lunch at a vegetarian restaurant, between
practicing for the Cliburn competition and dashing off to give a
massage to a friend. ``It made me really focus on the importance of
the body in your life _ just seeing her paralyzed every day for
eight years was pretty tough.'' His mother died in 1996. Three
years later, Freeman got his credentials from the Atlanta school
and became a nationally certified massage therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``His bio probably took the longest to boil down into four or
five sentences,'' says Maria Guralnik, general manager of the Van
Cliburn Foundation. ``At first glance, you think, `Oh, the guy
can't hold a job.' But what's really true is that he has a profound
mission in life of figuring out how to free people of inhibition.
He doesn't go through life saying, `Well, now I'm going to be a
massage therapist,' and `Now I'm going to be a great pianist.' He
has the deeper quest of figuring out how to help people achieve
what they really want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's competitors are Gainesville, Ga., homemaker
Judy Thomas; a British astrologer; a Montreal dentist; and a Fox
news anchor and a midwife, both from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always looking for ways to integrate all this stuff I
have done,'' Freeman says. ``I have worked in career planning. I
have worked in educational administration. I have worked in
teaching piano and performing piano.''
</P>
<P>
   As a seasoned performer, Freeman knows very well the stress and
anxiety that go hand in glove with the art. ``As I began to read
about massage therapy, I began to see how some of the stuff my
piano teacher told me over the years really made a whole lot of
sense. Tight muscles do constitute blockages to creativity.'' It is
such insight that makes him particularly well equipped to work with
actors, musicians and athletes. Last year, he traveled with the UGA
Gym Dogs to their national championship meet with the University of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   While many a massage therapist will make house calls, Freeman
brings Schubert impromptus and Chopin nocturnes to the table, as
well as the rubbing, rolling and stroking of the conventional
masseur's repertoire. Invite him by for one of his two-part
performances and he'll pack sheet music along with clean sheets for
his massage table. Since much of his music is committed to memory,
he is never Liszt-less _ though his clients generally are when he
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only thing he won't do is take requests. No ``My
Funny Valentine'' or ``The Girl From Ipanema'' for him. ``I'm not a
cocktail lounge pianist,'' he says, laughing. ``I'm not knocking
that. But that's not me. That's not what I do the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman won't disclose his fees for either service but says they
are competitive. He keeps his massage chair in the back of his car
and was planning to ship his massage table to Fort Worth, though he
didn't expect any of his fellow competitors would let him work on
their hands. When he found out it would cost $95 to send the table,
he took that as an omen to concentrate on his playing.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, he will play Chopin's Scherzo in B-Flat
Minor in the first round of competition; and if he makes it to this
weekend's finals, he'll play Liszt's Concert Etude in D-Flat Major
(``Un Sospiro``) and ``Vallee d'Obermann'' in the second round and
Liszt's ``Sonata in B Minor,'' one of the most difficult pieces in
the literature, for the finish. The winner gets $2,000 and two
tickets to next year's Van Cliburn International Piano Competition,
the foundation's signature event for professionals, which has been
held every four years in Fort Worth since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good pianist, and I think he's going to impress a
lot of people down there,'' says Richard M. Graham, director of the
UGA School of Music. ``He's a natural. He learns things quickly
that many people take years to learn. He has that sort of muscular
coordination that I think transfers very well into his massage
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Freeman says a reporter from the Fort Worth paper
called to ask him what his strategy is for the competition. He
didn't know quite how to respond. ``I consider myself a winner
already, just being selected. My strategy is just to do the best I
can possibly do. If I do that, I'll be a winner one way or another.

 &HT;    Fighting spirit puts `Gimp' in league of its own
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The title is your first clue that this is not just
another handicapped-hero story _ that it relies less on sentiment
than a shocking self-awareness to move anyone who watches this
extraordinary documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Gimp'' has you at hello _ from the moment Dan Keplinger,
a 27-year-old artist born with cerebral palsy, spits and concusses
and convulses his opening, subtitled words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think `gimp' means someone with a lame walk. But
`gimp' also means a `fighting spirit.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That spirit shines in small, often poetic ways during the
45-minute film, winner of this year's best documentary short at the
Academy Awards, where Keplinger provided the night's most memorable
moment when he flung himself from his wheelchair and flailed
joyously around the auditorium floor when the Oscar was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The film had a brief, single-screen run to qualify for an Oscar,
so tonight's airing on HBO, which helped produce it, is virtually
its premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers Susan Hadary and William Whiteford documented
Keplinger's life in Maryland for 13 years, beginning when he was
12. But Keplinger wrote _ or head-butted _ the text, using a head
stick to type on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   So we watch Keplinger as he changes T-shirts; watch as he
removes one shirt and then pulls on another, the whole while
kneeling on the floor, trying to get his arms and head to
cooperate, looking as if he's in a fearsome, minutes-long wrestling
match with . . . himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another day,'' Keplinger writes, ``of crap.''
</P>
<P>
   But Keplinger is largely undaunted by all the crap, and it's his
mother who never lets him fall victim to it. She gave birth to Dan
when she was 18, and her husband left six years later, unable to
cope when she refused to institutionalize their son. She's a saint,
but not a martyr: What she went through to mainstream her son she
did as naturally as she would for any child. The unspoken love
between the two here will kill ya.
</P>
<P>
   There are also teachers _ in high school, then college _ who
accept and help Keplinger when others would rather he go away, and
they remind us of the power of selflessness.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff of it all is Keplinger, now a young man who is often
lonely, often feels scorned, yet whose ``gimp'' spirit keeps him
painting and struggling to be fully human inside a body that makes
many people turn away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a handicap,'' he says proudly at the end, ``but
only a few are a `true gimp.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss this one. ``King Gimp'' is just the reality check all
of us smug, boom-economy lightweights need to bring us back to
earth.

 &HT;    Trail of discovery leads 'Holmes' sleuths to remarkable audience
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Occasionally we hear about youngsters who get
pulled down the rabbit hole of fantasy through computers or
role-playing games. Down, down, down they go. The same happens with
the Internet. An interest becomes a fixation that becomes
asphyxiation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand there are youngsters who, given the
opportunity, go deep, deep, deep into things that elevate.
</P>
<P>
   When Nancy Nixon and Amanda Coody began digging, the channel
they dug delivered them to a wonderland. An academic exercise
became more than pass-fail, A or B or C. It became a Technicolor
ride to always color their lives.
</P>
<P>
   That's the best we can do for young people when we advertise
something called education.
</P>
<P>
   The graduating Waco High seniors were in Phyllis Strother's
independent study humanities class. They chose as a British
literature project Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creation: Sherlock
Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   When all was said and done, they'd constructed and reconstructed
a crime before a jury. They'd done so before a most unusual jury, a
roomful of strangers who know Sherlock Holmes like nobody else. And
after they made their case to this group, expecting maybe to be
shown the door as impostors, they were made honorary members of _
surely you've heard of it _ the Crew of the Lone Star Barque.
</P>
<P>
   It was an example of how when you have a good notion and you
keep asking around, you can find people who will help make a good
thing better.
</P>
<P>
   After the girls read lots of Sherlock Holmes _ eight books _
they set out to write and present a Holmes-style plot, a mystery
with players from the community. They came to learn one of the
lessons that all students should learn as they search for things
that matter: It never hurts to ask.
</P>
<P>
   That's why when they asked, District Judge Ralph Strother
consented to be in their crime (yes, he's married to the teacher,
but he's also a major Holmes freak). That's why, when they needed
another player and asked, Superintendent Rosanne Stripling put down
what she was doing and picked up a script.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why, to their delight and amazement, when they got on
the Internet and punched in ``Sherlock Holmes,'' they found a North
Texas chapter of the Diogenes Club, an intellectual bunch that eats
and breathes Sherlock Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   After an exchange by e-mail, the club invited the girls to its
lair in Flower Mound to show what they learned.
</P>
<P>
   What they brought was the play: ``The Keys of Truth.'' They had
a crime: the theft of family jewels. They had a culprit, and clues
to test the audience.
</P>
<P>
   HANDCUFFING THE JUDGE
</P>
<P>
   Amanda played Holmes and Nancy played Dr. Watson in this, one of
two performances. The other was before an audience in Waco. In the
Waco performance, Judge Strother, who presides over the county's
juvenile court, played Buff Pemberly, a man who turns out to have
sticky hands.
</P>
<P>
   Long plot cut short, the high schoolers ended up putting Buff in
cuffs. In between, audiences were asked to solve the crime. (Clue:
Follow the cigar ashes.)
</P>
<P>
   So, how did the jury of strangers, devout Sherlockians, react?
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very genuine, very honest,'' said Amanda. And
apparently very approving, bestowing their honorary title. They
were not alone in approval.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor University professor Susan Johnsen, who saw the play in
Waco, invited them to write an article for ``Gifted Child Today''
about their eye-opening experience.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they study from here on _ Nancy is going to Shriner
College in Kerrville, Amanda to Hollins University in Roanoke, Va.,
_ what they've learned in an exercise like this will benefit them
for life.
</P>
<P>
   You see, beyond the academic skills we all need and subjects we
want to master, what serves you in life is not so much subject
matter in a vacuum. It's what you learn about yourself in applying
what you know to the world around you.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt an appreciation for Sherlock Holmes will make their
lives richer, but that will be a sidelight. To them the real lesson
from this pursuit will be the same as that which rewards a sleuth
for posing the right questions. It's the power of asking.

 &HT;    Battle over the bones rages on
 &HT;    By Lori Cumpston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ The contents of dozens of unmarked
cardboard boxes sitting in a giant warehouse in southwestern
Colorado are at the center of a controversial debate that has
captured the attention of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The non-descript boxes, some stacked two and three high, contain
Native American remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one of the largest collections of human remains in the
National Park Service,'' says Linda Towle, head of research and
resource management for Mesa Verde National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
passed in 1990 requires that all Native American remains along with
sacred or cultural objects unearthed on federal lands be returned
to tribes for reburial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribes want these remains reburied close to where they
came from,'' says Towle. ``The park is more than willing to do
that. But there are some issues within the law ... that require
that we identify cultural affiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some disagreement among the tribes as to who is
identified as culturally affiliated. We are investigating on how
best to deal with that because the parks want these individuals
reburied and the Native Americans want them reburied. But we have
some legal issues to straighten out in order to make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The remains, excavated at Mesa Verde during the late 1950s and
early 1960s, have been segregated from the rest of the collection
and are available for reburial once the legal issues are resolved.
The mass burial will not be made public.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over reburial surged to the forefront in the summer
of 1996 after two hydroplane racers stumbled across a
9,000-year-old skeleton near Columbia Park in Kennewick, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton, dubbed ``Kennewick Man,'' was discolored and had
soil stuck to it, leading investigators to believe it was not the
body of someone recently deceased.
</P>
<P>
   The Graves Protection Act requires the government to notify
Indian tribes likely to be culturally affiliated with the remains.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, several tribes were notified, including the
Umatilla Tribe, which wanted the remains reburied immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government refused.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that represents the first legal challenge of the
Graves Protection Act, scientists sued, claiming they had a right
to study the remains since there was a question as to the origin.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the federal government, based on the age of
the skeleton, ruled that the remains were Native American.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a stunning decision one month later, the United
States Department of Interior announced it would conduct DNA tests
on the bones.
</P>
<P>
   The decision outraged Armand Minthorn, a religious leader and
trustee of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian
Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about respect,'' wrote Minthorn, in an editorial
posted on the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian
Reservation Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at issue in this case is not just our desire to
protect one ancestor, but how this case will be applied to every
other Native American skeleton found in the United States. If (the
Graves Protection Act) was intended to return tribes the right to
protect our ancestors from unconsented excavation, removal,
analysis and destruction, then this case has made it painfully
clear that a small group of scientists, with the assistance of the
(Department of Interior), can abrogate that right.''
</P>
<P>
   As the battle over the bones rages on, museum curators like
Carolyn Landes feared the legislation would have another unintended
effect _ empty display cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really afraid that the best stock was going to go away,
even though I knew my culture had done wrong for a very long
time,'' says Landes. ``I am happy to say that is not the way it is
going. A lot of material is going back to where it belongs but
there is still an amazing amount of material that didn't come from
the burial context and doesn't fall under the ... law that can tell
us as much as the grave.''

 &HT;    Priceless artifacts linger in warehouse awaiting funds for
cultural center
 &HT;    By Lori Cumpston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ A piece of tin roof flaps in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   A spiderweb of silver duct tape does little to camouflage cracks
in the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The walls lack insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Weeds poke their heads through crevices in the concrete floor.
</P>
<P>
   Mouse traps stand at attention, poised to snap at furry
intruders who dare cross the line.
</P>
<P>
   And in the center of it all sits a priceless collection of 2
million Native American artifacts, some dating back as far as 400
A.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't meet legal requirements for maintaining a federal
museum collection,'' says curator Carolyn Landes. ``We are not
alone in that. You go to any underfunded park and you will find the
same situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The warehouse, which is the size of an airplane hangar, is
hidden among yucca plants, juniper shrubs and pinyon pines in
southwestern Colorado. As a security precaution, the exact location
is kept secret, and a Daily Sentinel reporter and photographer were
allowed in recently with the stipulation that the location would
not be published.
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewels stored inside, many excavated from the
Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project in Mesa Verde National Park
during the late 1950s, tell a story of generations gone by and are
the only records left detailing the history and habits of a lost
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The Wetherill Brothers, Richard and Al, along with the their
brother-in-law, Charles Mason, are credited with discovering the
cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde while searching for stray cattle in
the winter of 1888.
</P>
<P>
   The find marked the beginning of archaeology in the American
West.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``Anasazi'' is no longer used to describe the ancient
people of the Southwest. The Navajo word means 'ancient enemy.' Out
of respect to the direct descendents of the Anasazi, they are now
referred to as Ancestral Puebloans.
</P>
<P>
   Early Ancestral Puebloans were known as Basketmakers. The
nomadic clan settled in pithouses clustered in small villages built
on mesa tops overlooking the Montezuma Valley sometime around 400
A.D.
</P>
<P>
   As the population grew and the people became more sophisticated,
pithouses were eventually replaced with skillful stone masonry
structures built inside protective cliff alcoves that once
sheltered their ancestors centuries before.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of craftsmanship that went into the cliff
dwellings also carried through to tool-making, weaving, jewelry and
pottery, where dull gray was replaced by snappy black designs
painted on a white background.
</P>
<P>
   By 1300 A.D., the Ancestral Puebloans disappeared, with only the
belongings on their backs, leaving behind a legacy waiting to be
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The last major archaeological dig at Mesa Verde took place on
Wetherill Mesa in 1959 and unearthed more than a million Native
American artifacts, now stored in sub-standard conditions and
maintained by the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Landes punches in a secret security code to gain access to the
main storage area, where the majority of the collection is housed.
A warning sign on the door reads, ``Restricted Access: Area Closed
By Order Of Superintendent.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy metal door swings back and inside are rows and rows of
gun-metal gray cabinets with numbers posted on the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Landes walks to one somewhere in the middle labeled 435 Site No.
1200, takes off the cover, letting it clank to the floor and pulls
out a tray.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are palettes ... what we would call a paint palette,
where they mixed paint,'' says Landes, pointing to a large rock.
``This one has hematite on it, a mineral they would grind and
that's what made the red paint in the tower at Cliff Palace and any
of the remnants down at Spruce Tree House.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tray reveals blobs of organic material like corn and
yucca leaves that have been chewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are called quids,'' says Landes. ``It's a term
associated with tobacco chewing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the exact purpose of the quids isn't known, possible
theories are that quids were chewed to keep from getting thirsty in
the bone-dry climate, or they were used to get a buzz similar to a
narcotic.
</P>
<P>
   Drawer after drawer yield treasures and trinkets: sandals styled
from yucca, broken sherds of pottery, a drinking mug with a tiny
pair of black feet painted on the bottom, pieces of woven cotton
clothing, bits of blanket fashioned from turkey feathers and yucca,
farming implements, tools made from bone and intricate beads
crafted out of stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have much of the collection in fairly good storage
conditions,'' says Linda Towle, head of research and resource
management for Mesa Verde National Park, ``but those bowls stacked
on top of each other ... every time we open the drawer there is
that much more opportunity for them to break. They're heavy and
those drawers are not meant to hold that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the material we have is organic and very sensitive
to changes in humidity and temperature. In a facility like we have
right now where in the winter it gets cold and in the summer it
gets very hot, these materials shrink and contract and they are
going to deteriorate that much faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't even mention the word fire.
</P>
<P>
   Although protected by a sprinkler system, a wildfire near the
Four Corners area in the mid '80s threatened to scorch the
priceless collection, but it was miraculously spared when the wind
shifted.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of fire still looms, however, until the highly
combustible nitrate negatives of the Gustaf Nordenskiold collection
of old photographs can be transferred onto safety film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a couple of refrigerators in the back where we store
the nitrate,'' says Landes. ``You need to keep them cool. It will
melt down and actually combust.''
</P>
<P>
   Nordenskiold, a young Swede stricken with tuberculosis, heard
about the Wetherill brothers and hired the pair to accompany him to
the cliff dwellings to began photographing the sites and excavating
artifacts, which was legal prior to the Antiquities Act of 1906.
</P>
<P>
   ``His telegrams back and forth to his father are pretty
interesting,'' says Landes. ``They said, 'Lots of trouble but I
think I am going to be OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Nordenskiold collection is in the National Museum in
Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the pottery, enough to make a black market
collector salivate.
</P>
<P>
   Graywares, whitewares, redwares: Some sit in neat rows on
makeshift tables while the larger pieces, like ``ollas'' or water
jars, are hidden underneath sheets of protective plastic to shield
them from water damage if the roof leaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things are every day use,'' says Landes. ``You can see
the soot or the blackening on the grayware. The fact that they
would take the time to make beautiful things when they were just
existing ... their life was so hard and short. It's just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, parts of the collection have overflowed
outside of the restricted access area, which is a violation of the
standards set forth to maintain a federal museum collection.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeological finds still sit in brown paper bags, including
one bearing the date of Oct. 23, 1925. The handwriting scrawled on
the front reads, ``From the ruin opposite CT Tower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have boxes and boxes of this stuff,'' says Towle, referring
to the bags of unprocessed artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our only record and paper bags disintegrate. We really
need to get those artifacts into other containers with that
information transferred onto a permanent record soon because when
they fall apart and everything gets mixed, we have no way to
retrieve the original information.''
</P>
<P>
   More crates of unopened artifacts are warehoused at the
Smithsonian Institution, waiting to be retrieved if a bid for a new
cultural center is successful.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed center will be built on a plot of land next to the
entrance at Mesa Verde National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Famed New York architect Murry Gelberg is designing the center,
which calls for a campus-type facility or a single unit, possibly
modeled after the floorplan of Long House, which is the second
largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we have that in mind, we'll be able to define the square
footage, which will tell us what parts might be for the museum
association, book sales, office space, curation space, research
components, education, exhibits and where we'll do presentations
for programs, whether it's live, slide or video,'' says Larry
Wiese, superintendent of Mesa Verde National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The new cultural center also means Native Americans will have a
more active role in telling the story of their people.
</P>
<P>
   W. Richard West, the founding director of the Smithsonian
Institution's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington,
D.C., has visited Mesa Verde several times to begin training Native
Americans to take part in the interactive exhibits at the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once each tribe has developed the exhibits, we would be able
to put them on display at the center for a month at a time,'' says
Wiese. ``We have 24 affiliated tribes. They'll be able to tell
their story, the past, present and future, however they choose
through storytelling, exhibits, dance or a combination.''
</P>
<P>
   The targeted completion date for the cultural center is 2006 to
coincide with the 100-year anniversary of Mesa Verde National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated price tag is between $20 million and $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Verde got a much needed boost in May of 1999 when First
Lady Hillary Clinton, armed with a $3.2 million dollar grant,
visited the park in conjunction with the Save America's Treasures
Program. However, much of that money has already been earmarked for
archaeologists to re-evaluate the cliff dwelling sites to determine
whether stabilization is needed to lengthen the life expectancy of
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   That means funding for the cultural center will have to come
from another source, namely big-hearted folks with a desire to see
the past preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try and do it through philanthropic means,'' says Wiese.
``We're not going to rely on the federal government. We don't think
the dollars are there. They may be and that would be a pleasant
surprise, but we're anticipating we're going to have to raise that
money outside of the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very expensive proposition,'' adds Towle. ``We have to
have outside support. A dollar here, a dollar there ... it all adds
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Towle says they have been in contact with Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell's office and he is aware of the project. But the
Republican, who holds the distinction of being the only American
Indian in Congress, has shown little interest.
</P>
<P>
   That's a claim Campbell's staff disputes. ``It's ludicrous if
anyone is making the claim that he is not sensitive to the plight
of the Anasazi,'' says James Doyle, communications director for
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get flooded with requests every year and we grant those
that are deserving. If they are serious about getting money, they
need to make a request.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the money comes from government appropriations or
private donations, one thing is certain: Precious artifacts that
have weathered centuries of time may vanish, just as the Ancestral
Puebloans did more than 700 years ago.

   DATA-INTERNET (Washington) _ On one side are the Chamber of
Commerce, Consumers Union, research librarians and Charles Schwab.
On the other side are the New York Stock Exchange, real estate
agents and the American Medical Association. These odd alliances of
lobbyists have formed over the question of whether databases _
collections of facts like telephone directories, weather reports,

<P>
   (Coded p)
</P>
<P>
   SOFT-MONEY-ADS (Washington) _ Two and a half months ago, flush
with victory in the primaries and eager to be seen as taking the
high road, Vice President Al Gore sent an e-mail message to Gov.
George W. Bush, proposing a ban on ``issue ads'' paid for with
unregulated soft money. Bush, who raised a staggering $70 million
in his primary campaign, dismissed the challenge as a ploy. But
now, with the Democrats dropping hints that they may soon begin a
television advertising campaign on behalf of Gore, Republicans are
eager to hoist the vice president on his own petard. Asserting that
Mr. Gore's message amounted to a solemn promise not to use soft
money, the Republicans are trying to paint Gore as a hypocrite even
before the Democrats' first commercial hits the airwaves. By Peter
Marks.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGES-POLITICS (Undated) _ With touchstone issues like death
penalty challenges, school financing and tort reform hanging in the
balance, contests for state judgeships around the country have
become bruising multimillion dollar political affairs that critics
say are threatening the independence of the nation's state courts
as never before. Millions of dollars in campaign contributions are
flowing into races for top state judgeships this year, while
candidates are testing the limits of rules that forbid them from
signaling how they might vote on cases. By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   DEFIANT-JUDGE (Childersburg, Ala.) _ Three years ago, Judge Roy
S. Moore became an icon of the Christian conservative movement by
defying the order of another Alabama judge that he remove the Ten
Commandments from the wall behind his bench and stop opening court
sessions with a prayer. Today, proudly unrepentant, Moore of the
Circuit Court in Gallant is trading on his renown to run for chief
justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, the top judicial post in the
state. By Kevin Sack.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Independent booksellers are a famously fractious group, as the
name suggests. In their two-decades war against chain stores and,
more recently, online booksellers, they have shared little beyond
common enemies _ Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders, Amazon, the price clubs _
and a will to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated from one another in neighborhoods across America, they
have fought a guerrilla war with discouraging results. Nearly half
the independent booksellers have disappeared since 1994, according
to the American Booksellers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internet, the site of so much recent loss for the
independents, will take on greater importance as a battleground in
the next two months. Set to debut are two large-scale Web sites
that seek to promote the independents. But many wonder whether the
sites are jumping in too late and can compete with the customer
service of the online giants Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, the booksellers association will begin to unveil
Booksense.com, a site turning the independents into ``local store
dot-com, closed but open 24 hours a day,'' says Michael Hoynes, the
program's marketing officer. Next to come, in early July, is
Contentville, a site produced by Steven T. Brill, which will,
according to its senior vice president and e-publisher, Annik
LaFarge, make some 40 of the most respected booksellers in the
country the ``heart and soul'' of its book retailing area. The
sites hope to showcase the independents as stores run by
booksellers with personalities as unique and marketable as their
books.
</P>
<P>
   But they are built on very different business models.
Booksense.com is a ``hub site'' for hundreds of individual Web
sites created and maintained by local stores. Each will have its
own Web address and set its own prices.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual about Contentville's relationship with the
independent booksellers it has recruited _ Glenn Goldman of Book
Soup in Los Angeles, Neal Sofman of A Clean Well Lighted Place in
San Francisco and a former ABA president, Ed Morrow of Northshire
Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vt., among others _ is that the
independents will not actually be selling books on Contentville.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will provide editorial content for a fee and will
get an equity stake in the company should Contentville go public.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Farley, an e-commerce analyst at PaineWebber, believes the
biggest issue for the new sites lies in customer service, exactly
the territory the independents in Booksense.com, in particular,
will have the least control over. ``The trick,'' she says, ``is
providing a great customer experience. Amazon has spent five years
developing a complicated and hopefully very robust distribution and
fulfillment network. They didn't snap their fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet the challenge, the sites have established alliances with
Baker &AMP; Taylor and Ingram, wholesalers that have traditionally
dealt in bulk orders to booksellers and now face the challenge of
shipping smaller orders directly to consumers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, for example, has worked over the last two years to
improve its ability to ship smaller orders to more customers, and
over the last year has developed this operation in earnest
delivering books for Barnesandnoble.com and Buy.com, the two
largest of 20 such clients it works with.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram has a cash investment in Contentville, which ``gives us
reassurance they'll do it right,'' said Brill. Booksense.com has
reached similar distribution agreements with Baker &AMP; Taylor and
other wholesalers. The wholesalers' ability to deliver on their
promises is crucial, says Lorraine Shanley, a publishing consultant
at Market Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online component of bookselling is difficult for people
without the resources and organizational savvy of Amazon,'' she
said. ``ABA is a trade organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstacle, she says, is the same as it was for Barnes &AMP; Noble
when it went online. ``They are trying to jerry-rig entrenched
systems, as opposed to building a Web-based transactional business,
which is what Amazon did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Len Vlahos, director of Booksense.com, says customer service
will be the strength of the program. ``The local store itself will
be point of customer contact,'' he said. ``There's an actual person
in the store, which has many more years of customer service
experience than Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question still remains whether the Internet plays to the
independents' strengths as retailers. Online booksellers can't
replicate the experience of browsing and buying books in a store,
says Jeffrey Fieler, consumer Internet analyst at Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Though he acknowledges that ``the independents have to do
something or they will be marginalized'' even further, he is
skeptical that a niche retailer can develop a significant market
share in a category already well-served on the Web. Last year,
according to Fieler, people visited an average of 15 sites a month.
This year, he says, the number has shrunk to 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finding the places that meet their needs,'' he
says. ``The larger sites in each area are adding functionality so
that people don't need to go to other sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Booksense.com, which has been delayed since the fall by
technical problems, grows out of Booksense, a ``national marketing
umbrella'' launched by the booksellers association for its
beleaguered members in February 1999. In the last 16 months,
Booksense has attracted 1,154 stores across the country to its
offline program. It offers, among other features, a bestseller list
drawn from members' stores, gift certificates redeemable at any
affiliated store (allowing direct competition with the ubiquity of
the chains) and national advertising promoting independents'
reading recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Booksense.com charges participants a set-up fee, a monthly
maintenance fee and takes 4.5 percent in commissions on orders
shipped from wholesale partners.
</P>
<P>
   The association has earmarked more than $2 million for
promotion. Farley said Amazon had spent $40.6 million in
advertising, promotion and public relations in the last quarter
alone, though Amazon sells more than books.
</P>
<P>
   Local marketing by the independents themselves, together with
significant in-store promotion of the individual Web sites, is seen
as key to Booksense's viability.
</P>
<P>
   Fieler also sees risks in this limited approach. ``Partnerships
with other sites that command large shares'' of Internet traffic,
such as Barnes and Noble's relationship with AOL, or Amazon's
relationship with Yahoo, will be crucial for the venture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Research from the American Booksellers Association shows, Hoynes
says, that the typical customer of an independent bookstore buys an
average of 20 books a year, but only eight of those at an
independent store. Booksense's goal is to build the independents'
share to 10 or 11.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Contentville has significantly more marketing clout and will
sell more than books: content from newspapers and magazines, as
well as e-books, dissertations and other material. It will spend
$75 million in advertising over the next two years, according to
Brill, who estimates that books will account for 25 to 30 percent
of the site's total revenue. Both NBC and CBS have invested in
Contentville, and the site will be advertised on the networks
beginning in July in some markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Contentville independents will create a variety of editorial
features, including recommended ``libraries'' of essential books in
various categories, ``If You Ask Me'' endorsements of books they
love and new books they are enthusiastic about. There will also be
store bestseller lists and ``Buzz on the Floor'' notes on local
happenings that have helped sales of certain titles. But Shanley
questions whether the local flavor will help on the Web, where
``virtual communities are more important than land-based ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The new sites are complementary _ Contentville will have pages
that point back to Web sites that may be part of Booksense.
</P>
<P>
   This may be an advantage for the booksellers involved in the
programs. Roxanne Coady of R.J. Julia Books in Madison, Conn., who
is participating in both sites, said: ``Booksense as a branding
campaign, Booksense.com and Contentville can all act to remind
consumers that independent booksellers have a valuable voice. That
alone is a big deal.''

IBM AND SALESFORCE.COM PLAN SMALL-BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ IBM and the start-up company Salesforce.com plan
to announce a partnership on Monday aimed at helping small
businesses transform themselves into e-businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Salesforce.com, founded last year by Marc Benioff, a former
senior vice president with the Oracle Corp., offers software for
managing sales information like contacts, leads and follow-ups, as
a subscription service from its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, International Business Machines will make
the Salesforce service available to customers of IBM's Small
Business WebConnections, a monthly subscription service that
provides shared Internet access for up to 100 users. IBM and
Salesforce also plan to jointly develop new applications, the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal with IBM was a strong endorsement for
Salesforce.com, particularly because IBM already had a partnership
with Siebel Systems, the leading supplier of traditional sales
management software, commonly known as customer relationship
management. Siebel has a Web offering called Sales.com that
competes with Salesforce.com.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Salesforce.com benefited from a business model
designed to be profitable with only a modest monthly fee, while
Siebel's cost structure was based on traditional enterprise
software pricing of thousands of dollars a user.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``highlights one of the essential differences between
an enterprise software company selling licenses and the software
services model,'' said Vernon Keenan, an analyst with Keenan
Vision, a San Francisco research firm. Software services,
``basically free the user from the need to hire and staff an I.T.
department,'' said Keenan. ``I.T. staff is a critical issue and
Salesforce.com eliminates that.''
</P>
<P>
   For $99 a month, subscribers to IBM's Small Business
WebConnections, get a local server computer _ the toaster-size
Interjet from IBM's Whistle Communications unit _ 24-hour,
seven-day-a-week technical support, and an Internet connection for
up to 100 users. IBM is offering two free months of WebConnections
as part of the partnership agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the WebConnections subscription, Salesforce.com users
would pay nothing for the first five users, then $50 for each
additional user.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really we're on a mission to make every business an
e-business,'' said Mike Braun, general manager of IBM Global Small
Business. ``Salesforce.com just has an outstanding application that
is right in the sweet spot of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Salesforce.com will be the first application offered for the
WebConnections service. While small businesses have in the past
made do with simple contact manager software for keeping track of
sales information, Salesforce.com offers a program with the power
of corporate applications like Siebel, but with a simple
Web-browser interface that requires no user training.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the IBM partnership, Salesforce.com said, it had
signed 5,000 customers and was enrolling on average 200 new ones
each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we are now the fastest-growing CRM,'' said Benioff,
Salesforce.com's chairman, using industry shorthand for customer
relationship management. ``For a lot of our customers, who are
small businesses, we can move them into this modern age. IBM will
create a whole host of applications with a single sign-on, and an
appliance to give them access to a full service network,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Braun said the deal did not reflect any weakening of IBM's
relationship with Siebel. ``We have an excellent partnership with
Siebel,'' he said. ``Siebel's offerings are really focused on the
large enterprise. Marc's solution is really focused on the Web for
small businesses.''

`IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY': SAY, MATE, WHAT IS IT ABOUT
AUSTRALIANS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bill Bryson arrives in Sydney to begin the touristy
Australian walkabout that is the basis for ``In a Sunburned
Country,'' he is there to write a magazine article for a London
Sunday newspaper. He is also being written about by a reporter for
The Sydney Morning Herald who, for the sake of local color, takes
him boogie boarding at a nearby beach.
</P>
<P>
   Modest as it is, this watery adventure is then immortalized from
three different perspectives. There is a friendly Australian
newspaper report, from which the author quotes a paragraph about
himself. There are pictures taken by a newspaper photographer.
There are a couple of mild, rambling pages at the book's start
about an escapade that is of interest strictly because of Bryson's
status as a visiting celebrity. There is not much other explanation
for why, in a book with a whole continent to cover, this struck him
as a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   In his earlier travel writings, like the enormously winning
``Notes From a Small Island,'' about his rambles through Britain,
Bryson presented himself as a sharp-eyed and hilariously
self-deprecating observer, a traveler who was wry, eager and
endlessly game. Newly in danger of ossifying into a professional
wag and curmudgeon, he is someone who often makes asides about book
tours or speaking engagements and takes a three-day first-class
train trip while recoiling at the horrors of traveling less
comfortably. ``I am almost certain that if we had not had the train
manager as an escort, they would have eaten us,'' he writes about
being walked past the road-weary unfortunates riding in coach.
</P>
<P>
   In a book whose marketing raisons d'etre are very clear (as a
follow-up to the very popular ``A Walk in the Woods,'' it is being
``published just in time for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney,'' says to
its flap copy), Bryson coasts too much but can still make most
gratifying company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gently I explained that it was not actually a condition of
citizenship that I eat the food of my nation,'' he writes from
Canberra, after having been directed by six teen-agers in
backward-facing baseball caps to the nearest McDonald's. As a
native of Des Moines who can comfortably use phrases like ``jolly
nice time'' thanks to two decades spent in England, he finds
congenial reminders of both those countries in Australia and can
ramble on about them as if chatting with a friend over a beer.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, actually chatting with a friend over a beer is
also something to which he devotes considerable space, only seldom
with amusing results. (``Because if I open them I'm afraid I'll
bleed to death,'' replies a hung-over Bryson to a friend who asks
why his eyes are shut.) He also returns far too frequently to the
ideas that Australia is big, empty, hot, perilous, mysterious and
pretty darn wonderful. ``I nodded and reflected, not for the first
time, what a strange, small, distant country Australia is,'' he
tells us. ``The monumental emptiness of Australia is not easy to
convey,'' he also notes. And in a book that also finds time for
observations about houseflies and the biting ants that have
infested Brisbane:
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about Australia, you see. It teems with
interesting stuff, but at the same time it's so vast and empty and
forbidding that it generally takes a remarkable stroke of luck to
find it.'' For ``In a Sunburned Country,'' those strokes of luck
are too few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson has always written most endearingly about the oddball
small-town encounter or kitschy tourist detail (about a giant model
of a lobster: `` `Big, isn't it?''' I remarked at last, for very
little escapes me in the world of fiberglass crustaceans.'') But
much of this book is devoted to more tedious matters, and not all
of it is even firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond describing many drowsiness-inducing trips to museums and
lengthy walks (``It took about three hours, I suppose, to do the
complete circuit of the parks''), he also relies on recycling
books, articles and television documentary material into
research-heavy passages. Bryson's efforts to create a bit of drama
around such interludes can lead to the reader's', in effect,
watching him read: ``As I pulled out my second purchase, `Crocodile
Attack in Australia,' by Hugh Edwards, and waded chest-deep into
its 240 pages of gruesome, violent attacks by this most cunning and
unsporting of creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a Sunburned Country'' comes to life most fully when Bryson
gets the homework out of the way, drops the boosterism (``I
couldn't wait to see more'') and opens his eyes and ears, just as
he did in his coach days. Many of the book's most interesting
passages concern the natural wonders of Australia and the great
difficulty of traveling through the country's loneliest regions.
</P>
<P>
   He also makes a fine comic fetish out of flinching at the
various dangers to be found there. Admiring a particularly noxious
spider in a museum display, he observes: ``According to the label,
you can identify a funnel web by `the mating organ on the male
palp, deeply curved fovea, shiny carapace and lower labium studded
with short blunt spines.' Alternatively, of course, you can just
let it sting you.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it covers many of the expected bases, the book is notably
sketchy in its discussion of Australia's Aborigines. Bryson writes
stingingly about racism but acknowledges that, like most white
Australians, he has had virtually no contact with the Aborigine
population.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a surprising obliviousness to the wild-eyed
popular culture behind such eccentric creations as ``Mad Max,''
``Muriel's Wedding,'' ``Crocodile Dundee,'' with no glimpse of what
it is about Australians that is reflected in such idiosyncratic
hits. The rowdy, bone-dry Australian sense of humor, which the
reader might expect to find celebrated here, is only occasionally
heard above the more subdued Brysoniana. But when the author
expresses surprise to learn that a cricket match is being held in
Adelaide, a bystander does say to him: ``Well, either that or
thirty thousand people have made one pretty amazing bloody mistake,
wouldn't you say?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Several years ago, with tongue only
partially planted in cheek, Intel's chairman, Andrew Grove, made an
observation: Unlike the chip industry, where processing speeds
double every 18 months or so, the moribund telecommunications world
seemed to double its speed only about once a century.
</P>
<P>
   But here on a test bench at Agilent Technologies is clear
evidence that may give lie to Grove's Law _ evidence that the
nation's communications networks could be poised for sweeping
improvements in speed and efficiency that could rival the breakneck
pace of breakthroughs in the chip industry.
</P>
<P>
   Using inexpensive high-speed semiconductor components, lasers
and mirrors, a small group of Agilent researchers have fashioned a
palm-size device capable of shuttling data at 10 billion bits _ or
10 gigabits _ a second.
</P>
<P>
   And the Agilent device, known as a transceiver, does not rely on
the costly, complex optical-network formats that telephone
companies and Internet backbone carriers typically require to
achieve such transmission speeds. Instead, the device uses a new
souped-up version of the homely Ethernet format that has been the
simple, reliable mainstay of office computer networks for nearly
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not your father's Ethernet; it is Ethernet 3,000
thousand times as fast as the original versions. At the rate the
technology is evolving, some analysts expect office desktop
computers to soon have access to data networks with speed and power
formerly available only in the nation's best research laboratories
_ but at prices no higher than today's standard business-office
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has caught the world by surprise,'' said Waguih Ishak,
director of Agilent's communications and optical research
laboratory. ``Three years ago, very few people were talking about
one-gigabit Ethernet. And people were laughing at us when we talked
about 10-gigabit optical networking.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is laughing at Agilent now, or at the other companies
developing new Ethernet technologies. A mad dash is under way as
dozens of start-ups and established giants race to put the
27-year-old Ethernet networking standard on an ever faster
price-performance improvement curve.
</P>
<P>
   While 10-gigabit Ethernet transceivers remain mainly at the
testing stage, one-gigabit transceivers are already becoming the
preferred way to link the new optical switches that are becoming
the standard way to route information over the Internet. (Optical
components use flashes of laser light, rather than electronic
pulses, to convey the on-off semaphore of digital information.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of our one-gigabit transceivers will fall below $5 by
2004,'' said Brian E. Lemoff, an Agilent designer. That number is
significant because $5 is roughly the current price of a
100-megabit Ethernet transceiver _ one capable of moving data at
only 100 million bits a second.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts and executives say the rapid improvements in
Ethernet _ and the resulting increase in bandwidth, or transmission
speeds, of fiber optic networks _ could bring a frenzied pace of
change to the telecommunications world similar to the
microprocessor chip's revolutionary impact on the computer industry
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of all of this is the cost of optical components is
now following the same declining cost curve that drove the
semiconductor industry,'' said Geoff Baehr, chief network officer
of Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   As prices plunge for the new high-speed Ethernet, it could
become what economists call a disruptive technology _ one that
forces established data communications companies to alter their
business models, while creating lucrative new opportunities for
fast-moving start-up companies. And the victims of the disruptive
technology, according to the data-networking upstarts, will be the
nation's giant telephone companies, which have large investments to
protect in more costly and complex telecommunications and voice
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Ethernet engineers now routinely cite Clayton M. Christensen's
thesis about the power of so-called disruptive technologies in his
book ``The Innovator's Dilemma'' (Harvard Business School Press,
1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``Gigabit Ethernet is a totally disruptive technology that until
recently looked like a toy'' to the telephone companies, said David
Isenberg, an industry consultant and a former AT&AMP;T engineer. ``Now
it's going to eat their lunch before they have time to turn
around.''
</P>
<P>
   That role reversal has not escaped Robert Metcalfe, a
co-inventor of the original three-megabit Ethernet standard at
Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys at the telephone companies have all read
Christensen's book by now,'' Metcalfe said, ``but they're like deer
caught in the headlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications executives, of course, take a dim view of
such hyperbole. They note that established network companies have
ready access to Ethernet technology, and will not hesitate to use
it. They also contend that many of the keys to better networks have
less to do with pushing technical boundaries in the laboratory than
with mundane issues like obtaining rights of way for fiber optic
cables and cellular towers.
</P>
<P>
   And the big companies may not be as beholden to their installed
network equipment as the upstarts may assume, according to David C.
Nagle, AT&AMP;T's chief technology officer and president of AT&AMP;T Labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``New players do have an advantage,'' Nagle said. ``But
increasingly, we and everyone else are learning how to respond
quickly to these disruptive technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The new players include aggressive start-ups like Yipes
Communications of San Francisco, which is building a nationwide
data-networking service based on a gigabit Ethernet optical
network. Users, primarily business customers, could use it for any
number of current and future high-speed applications, possibly
including combined voice and data communications and TV-quality
video.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Yipes has raised almost $91 million from venture capitalists and
partners and plans to sell Internet connection services in more
than 20 metropolitan regions in the United States by the end of the
year. The company has moved quickly by leasing unused fibers from
other companies and assembling networks in the nation's largest
metropolitan areas. Early customers include the Silicon Valley law
firm of Fenwick &AMP; West, the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and Front
Range Internet, a Colorado Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it can give customers connections over optical
fiber networks at data speeds from one megabit to one gigabit using
Ethernet _ and can do so while significantly underpricing its
traditional telecommunications industry competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To compete, they are going to have to cannibalize their
existing customer base,'' said Jerry Parrick, chief executive of
Yipes and a former telecommunications industry executive who has
run data networking businesses at the regional telephone companies
Pacific Bell and U S West.
</P>
<P>
   According to an estimate by the Del'Orro Group, a
telecommunications market research firm in Portola Valley, Calif.,
the hardware cost for conventional networking equipment at the
OC-192 standard _ the optical network format used by phone
companies _ was $6,783 for each gigabit. That compares with $350
for a 10-gigabit optical Ethernet connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes so much sense because we are able to avoid the
multiple layers of what is in effect scar tissue'' in telephone
companies' networks, said Eric Benamou, chairman and chief
executive of the 3Com Corp. 3Com was the company Metcalfe founded
to commercialize the Ethernet standard in in the 1970s; he left in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Ethernet was a simple data standard for
letting groups of computers communicate within a single office
building, or at most an office-park campus, at a top speed of 10
million bits a second. But improvements in the technology now allow
for Ethernet networks of speeds of 10 billion bits a second,
reaching some 30 miles. As a result, Ethernet has become
competitive with the main network techniques now used by the big
telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those techniques include asynchronous transfer mode, which
supports speeds from 1.5 megabits to the gigabit range. Another is
a format known as synchronous optical network, or Sonet (pronounced
like the short-verse form), which supports data rates ranging from
51 megabits up to nearly 2.5 gigabits.
</P>
<P>
   The main advantage that asynchronous transfer and Sonet hold
over Ethernet is that they offer rich network management _ software
that enables engineers to carefully control and monitor
communications traffic, be it voice or data. Ethernet provides for
only skimpy network management, although many companies are working
on more robust management software packages for use with Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, Ethernet is much more flexible than
asynchronous transfer or Sonet. Executives at Yipes, for example,
say they will have a significant advantage over the data services
offered by traditional telecommunications companies because the
Yipes network administrators will be able to dial the amount of
bandwidth a customer receives, up or down, quickly on demand.
</P>
<P>
   This flexibility might permit a small Web site, for example, to
add capacity quickly and temporarily for a special event, or make
it possible for an individual in an office to set up a high-quality
teleconferencing connection for a short period.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of flexibility, the biggest advantage of the new
gigabit Ethernet services like Yipes could be the ability to add
each new customer to the network with an industry-standard Ethernet
connector _ similar to the small circuit boards or plug-in devices
that already enable a new PC to be quickly added to an office
network or allow a consumer's home computer to be attached to the
local cable television system. Telephone companies typically have a
much more complicated task in determining how best to connect each
new data customer to the local network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes it a seamless interconnection,'' said Michael
Kleeman, chief technology officer of Aerie Networks, a broadband
network start-up in Denver, which plans to use Ethernet technology.
``There are no additional boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The most bitter struggle between the new Ethernet data
networking upstarts and the traditional data networks may involve
voice traffic, currently the revenue backbone of the telephone
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone industry technologies have been designed to ensure
that data packets carrying voice telephone calls have priority
passage through the network, even during peak traffic periods. That
capability adds to the complexity and cost of conventional
telecommunications data networks, but it also gives voice
conversations a reliable sound quality that Ethernet or standard
Internet formats cannot yet match.
</P>
<P>
   But service providers like Yipes intend to plunge in to the
lucrative voice market by guaranteeing customers a minimum quality
of service _ whether for voice or data _ that the companies say
they will be able to meet by designing their networks to handle
bursts of high-data traffic.
</P>
<P>
   For Metcalfe, the Ethernet inventor, the venerable technology's
new ascent offers a lesson that transcends cost savings. In the
current era, where approaches to technical standards in computing
range from Microsoft's proprietary control to the free-software
approach represented by the Linux operating system, Metcalfe says
that Ethernet illustrates a third way.
</P>
<P>
   Ethernet became a universal standard, he said, because of the
licensing practices Xerox adopted in the 1970s. Xerox licensed its
Ethernet patents at modest terms, ensuring that it won the
standards battle with competing technologies at the time, promoted
by companies like IBM.
</P>
<P>
   With licenses easily obtained, companies were free to devise the
best ways to develop commercial Ethernet-based products.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Ethernet is today is a business model based on open
standards and individually owned implementations,'' he said. ``It
has created a world where there is rapid innovation and fierce
competition.''

A MAGAZINE GIANT WEIGHS IN ON INTERNET BUSINESS

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Huey is a magazine editor known for his Southern
charm and pit-bull mentality: when he has an idea between his
teeth, he might be pleasant about it, but he will never let go.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Huey, managing editor of Fortune magazine,
decided that Time Inc. ought to start or purchase a magazine about
Internet business. He flew to San Francisco and met with editors
and publishers at The Industry Standard, Red Herring and Business
2.0, deciding who or what or whether to buy. No luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to see if there was a way that we each could satisfy
the other's goals, and we basically decided we could not,'' Huey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he could not buy 'em, he joined 'em. The result is
E-Company Now, a new monthly magazine from Time Inc. that Huey said
cost less to start ``than it would have ever cost to pay the
Internet multiples everyone was asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   With the first issue, released three weeks ago, Huey and his
editors jumped, some would say belatedly, into a fray of magazines
that besides The Standard and Red Herring includes titles like
Upside, Fast Company and _ take a deep breath _ the newly
rechristened Ziff-Davis Smart Business for the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the dot-com advertising boom to last forever.
What's more, Huey must keep E-Company Now from leeching content
from Fortune, its inspirational parent.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this daunts Huey. ``I'm relatively confident this is
going to work,'' he said in an interview last week from his home in
Atlanta. (Huey prefers to commute to work from Georgia most weeks
than to live in New York City.) ``We figured out about two years
ago that the whole Internet story was moving out of the realm of
being a tech story alone. But we never wanted Fortune to drill down
so deep into the subject that it became a magazine just about the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Company Now may soon have something else going for it that the
other magazines do not, words that would make any Internet-magazine
mogul's heart go pitter-pat: America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other magazines in the field do not have the benefit
of Time Inc.'s expertise in consumer magazines or the marketing
clout of AOL, which has given the magazine special placement on
choice CompuServe, AOL and Netscape sites. So far, those sites have
generated more than 30,000 subscriptions, said Ned Desmond, editor
in chief of E-Company Now.
</P>
<P>
   Huey said the advantages of Time Inc.'s backing were obvious.
``We are not running around trying to raise a new round of
financing or preparing an IPO,'' he said. ``We're running around
trying to get the best editors and writers we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, most of the magazines about Internet business _ even
those that are still raising financing and preparing initial public
offerings _ are thriving and expanding. Business 2.0, which is
published by Imagine Media in San Francisco, shifted from a monthly
to a twice-a-month publication three issues ago.
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring, published by Red Herring Communications, will do
the same in November; its June issue is 628 pages. Ad pages for The
Industry Standard, the weekly from IDG, are up almost 500 percent
against last year and have almost surpassed those of People
magazine. Its issues often reach 360 pages, including both
advertising and editorial material.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the magazines have been buoyed by the fact that the
market for advertising pages promoting dot-com companies has grown
exponentially the last three years. In 1997, online, Internet and
e-commerce companies spent $113.2 million in advertising in
American magazines, according to Competitive Media Reporting.
Spending climbed to $153.6 million in 1998 and then surged to
$687.3 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide has shifted in recent months, as some of the
speculative excess in technology and Internet stocks has subsided;
many of those advertisers can no longer afford to spend so freely
and no longer need to reach the venture capitalists who thumb
through the Internet magazines. Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the
Internet Advertising Bureau, said the flow of dot-com advertising
would soon abate and probably fall steeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shift is toward more moderated spending and more effective
spending,'' LeFurgy said. ``You were getting to absurd lengths with
some of these magazines as it was. They were getting out of control
in terms of the number of ad pages relative to editorial. That will
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Huey said he had already thought of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not naive about advertising,'' he said. ``We have along
with the dot-com advertising, consumer advertising and business
advertising, liquor, cars, fashion. Yes, we will take every dot-com
ad that can pay for it, but our business plan is not built on
soaking up an ever-growing pool of dot-com advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The real battle among the Internet magazines may play out not in
terms of advertising pages, but in the more mundane sphere of
old-fashioned circulation. While some of the Internet business
magazines have significant circulations, most remain fairly small.
Ziff-Davis Smart Business for the New Economy has a circulation of
1,048,941, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, but that
was all gained when the magazine was still known as PC Computing.
(Ziff-Davis repositioned the magazine to a business-strategy
magazine with the May issue.) Fast Company's circulation is
402,603, according to the circulation bureau.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the magazines have circulations closer to that
of Model Railroader, and many give away the bulk of their
subscriptions free.
</P>
<P>
   Upside, which is not audited by the Audit Bureau of
Circulations, reports circulation of 257,000, of which 15,000 are
paid. Gini Talmadge, president of Upside Media, said that the
subscriptions were given away to qualified readers, meaning readers
who have filled out a survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``So our subscriber list reads like a Who's Who of the
Internet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard, which also is not audited by the Audit
Bureau of Circulations, gives away half of its weekly 150,000
circulation to qualified subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Huey said that competition like The Industry Standard, Business
2.0 or Red Herring was not a threat to his new magazine, which has
guaranteed advertisers a circulation of 200,000 readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Industry Standard says they are a must-read for anybody
doing business on the Internet,'' Huey said. ``If that's true, why
does it have a circulation of 150,000 and half of it they give
away? They are the hot trade book. And that's a very good position
to have. But look at us. We want to be a national business magazine
that is informed by the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Weber, editor in chief of The Industry Standard, does
not dispute the circulation figures. But he said paid circulation
was growing ``at a healthy pace'' and that ``substantial
increases'' would be announced soon. He dismissed Huey's other
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   There are potential pitfalls for Huey's and Desmond's magazine.
Editors of competing magazines are quick to criticize Time Inc. for
coming late to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two years late to the party,'' said James Daly,
editor in chief of Business 2.0. ``They have to do something that
other magazines are not doing, and there's not a lot of space
left.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem is that E-Company Now is a monthly
title in a field that is now almost exclusively on weekly or
twice-a-month schedules.. But Huey said the magazine's Web site,
with its daily columnists and a business-to-business component,
would help keep readers plugged in. He suggested that the shift to
twice-a-month publication by Business 2.0 and Red Herring was part
of a strategy to get more advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems pretty obvious to me what that's about,'' he said.
``Our argument is that they are not doing the frequency thing for
the reader.''
</P>
<P>
   About Huey's theory, Ted Gramkow, publisher of Red Herring,
said, ``I don't think so.'' He countered, ``This is John Huey's
way, and Fortune and Time Warner's way, of attracting dollars that
have been beyond their high price in Fortune. This is a pure
advertising play.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it would be hard for any publisher to argue that
readers want even more Internet magazines. But the titles continue
to proliferate. Business 2.0 is introducing an as-yet-unnamed
offshoot in October, a business lifestyle magazine whose editor in
chief is a former editor of Harper's Bazaar and In Style.
</P>
<P>
   The former publisher of Office Products International is
introducing line56, an Internet-business magazine whose title was
inspired by the famous soliloquy in Act III of Shakespeare's
``Hamlet,'' that begins with the words ``To be or not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   IDG, The Industry Standard's parent company, has just introduced
Darwin: Business Evolving in the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to be way too much for me,'' LeFurgy of the
Internet Advertising Bureau said. ``I have total information
anxiety. The magazines just stack up and stack up in my office
now.''

INVENTORS DREAM OF A WORLD WHERE EVERY SOCK HAS A MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The common sock hardly seems in need of taming. Its basic design
has remained unchanged for generations, serving to protect and warm
the foot, and provide a liner between skin and shoe.
</P>
<P>
   As with all clothing, socks are subject to the whims of fashion
and the improvements possible with modern materials. But in the
end, most people own socks that are essentially similar to the
socks their ancestors wore, and just like the socks their friends
and neighbors own.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the nation's patent database proves that there is
always someone who believes the sock can be improved. Inventors
continue to tinker with the sock and to come up with sock
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, historical trends are apparent. In the 1970s, for
example, there were several attempts to create the dress tube sock,
a dark-colored sock with no defined heel.
</P>
<P>
   More mechanically-minded inventors tend to devote their time to
making the sock perform double duty. In the last 20 years, patents
have been awarded for socks with pockets, heated socks, cushioned
socks, inflatable socks, open-toe socks, half-socks, sock dickies,
socks with hidden shoe horns, tap dance socks, moisturizing socks,
exercise socks, medicated socks and socks with simulated jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Patents for athletic socks and support socks are so numerous
that many are barely distinguishable from one another, except for
their varying promises to improve performance and strengthen and
support feet, ankles and legs.
</P>
<P>
   After sock enhancements, two fields appear to captivate footwear
inventors: the act of donning socks, and the challenge of keeping
pairs of socks together in the laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassment seems to motivate the inventors of sock sorters.
In their patents, they cite the challenges of owning multiple,
one-size-fits-all socks knitted in similar yarns and colors, or of
living in a household where several people own lots of socks. These
inventors are alarmed by how easy it is to wind up with mismatched
pairs of socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, the mismatch is discovered when the wearer is in
situations that can cause great embarrassment,'' Wayne Reichle
wrote in his patent for what he called a ``device for sorting
socks.'' Reichle recently won patent 6,067,659 for an invention
that clamps sock mates together. The clamp is color-coordinated to
the sock, with each side bearing an identifying symbol. The clamps
can be attached anywhere on the sock, but Reichle recommends
attaching them to the top edge of the sock so they will be covered
by pant legs.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma might have just tied socks together before tossing them
into the wash, but even in her day, inventors were hoping to add
technology to the process. In 1957, a patent was awarded for a
washable strip of fabric to which pairs of socks could be fastened.
</P>
<P>
   Other inventors have tried to solve the matching problem by
knitting a word or icon into the sock during weaving _ usually in a
place that would be covered by a shoe. One invention added
identifying labels to socks. In 1988, Bruce Anderson won patent
4,734,938 for simply writing the color name on the sock. Rodney
Mazzoli won patent 4,965,902 for a method of joining two socks by
wrapping or tying them together with a strip of material that is
impregnated with fabric softener or anti-cling compound.
</P>
<P>
   In a more recent attempt to solve multiple-sock challenges,
Jonathan Hartzell won patent 5,467,510 for a method of tagging
socks with a four-part, color-coded disc. The color of the disc
indicates the ``fundamental color category to which its sock
belongs,'' he writes in his patent. Another part of the disc
identifies the person who owns the sock. And ``by noticing whether
a sock features a protruding dome-shaped cap or a flat tack disc,
an observer is immediately aware of the inside-out, right side-out
status of that sock.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the sock sorters that use clamps, snaps, tags,
pins, or clasps to hold pairs together in the wash. Joel Hicks won
patent 5,926,925 for magnets that pair socks. Other patents require
holes in the socks to accommodate the pins and tags; others fit
tags over the sock's top edge. The tags often come in pairs bearing
matching colors, letters or numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are not the only ones interested in tracking their
socks. Louise Christy and Frank Saffioti live in New South Wales,
Australia, and won patent 5,579,541 for sock tabs fastened with
hook-and-loop patches like Velcro.

   Other inventors have focused on making it easier to put socks
on, since elderly people, handicapped individuals, arthritis
sufferers and pregnant women may all find it difficult to bend over
and pull on socks. Eugene Santamaria, who lives in Crescent City,
Fla., won patent 6,056,171 last month for a long, curved handle
with flexible side wings that expand to stretch the ``opening of a
sock for aiding the insertion of a user's foot into the sock.''
Santamaria writes in his patent that his design is intended for
``users having limited mobility or flexibility to don their socks
on their own and without the aid of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Other devices include frames, handles, shoe horns and
telescoping arms designed to help people put on socks. Ignace
Willemin won patent 5,924,610 for a pair of tongs with jaws. ``The
first gripping jaw keeps the sock open wide enough so that the tip
of the foot can be slipped in and then the heel,'' Willemin writes
in his patent. ``It is then possible to put on the sock and to pull
it up along the calf of the leg without the user having to bend
over. One of the gripping jaws also has a catch element enabling
socks to be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other devices are made of horseshoe-shaped plastic over which a
sock is draped or stretched. Often they come with string or rope to
assist in pulling up the sock. Some can be inserted into an empty
shoe, so a person could slip his or her foot into a sock and shoe
at the same time. John and Frank Pettit use a pair of hinged posts
with two attached arms in their patent 4,756,453. An inverted sock
is placed over both arms. ``The user then spreads the posts apart
to stretch the sock open and pushes a foot into the open sock,''
the Pettits' patent says, ``the sock unfolding as it is mounted on
the foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Frank Krack's design for a sock that is inherently
easy to pull on. Krack, who won patent 5,575,013, designed a sock
with a pleat down the length of its front. When the pleat is open,
the sock is easy to pull on ``without the pulling, squeezing and
rubbing associated with conventional socks,'' he says. Once the
sock is on, the pleat is closed with a hook-and-loop fastener.
</P>
<P>
   Pleated socks are probably very easy to identify in the wash.

ENOUGH WAGNERIAN CONFLICT FOR AN OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Passions are not often stirred in Germany, a country
that has learned to mistrust the giddier emotions, but a
long-simmering battle for control of the annual Wagner Festival at
Bayreuth is now coming to a head with an unusual clamor.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the directorship of the festival, a position held
for the past 49 years by Wolfgang Wagner, 80-year-old grandson of
the composer Richard Wagner. Because Bayreuth, where Richard Wagner
introduced his ``Ring of the Nibelung'' in 1876, occupies such a
central, if contested, place in German culture, the fight is bitter
and widely watched.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner sits Nike Wagner, the niece of the current
director, and his bitter foe, who recently published a stinging
election manifesto in the Frankfurter Allgemeine, calling the
festival old-fashioned, promising a ``trend-setting, contemporary
Wagner'' and blasting a style ``enslaved to 19th-century Wagnerian
mysticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposing her is Gudrun Wagner, the second wife of Wolfgang
Wagner and ``the woman he intends to put in his place,'' in the
words of Daniel Barenboim, the director of the Staatsoper in Berlin
and a man who worked for 18 years at Bayreuth. Gudrun Wagner has
been fiercely loyal to her husband through a wave of recent
criticism that has included comparisons of the ``late Wolfgang
era'' to the stagnation of late Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
   Between them stands a third candidate and a third woman, Eva
Wagner-Pasquier, who is Wolfgang Wagner's daughter by his first
marriage and has worked as an opera manager in Paris and the United
States as well as playing a leading organizational role at the
music festival in Aix-en-Provence, France.
</P>
<P>
   No love is lost among these relatives, who now await the word of
the 24-member board of the Richard Wagner Foundation in Bayreuth.
``The board agreed on May 12 that its decision on a new director
would be taken on June 5,'' said Joachim Oppold, a board spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch worthy of Joseph Heller's more twisted
ruminations. While agreeing, at least in principal, that it would
be salutary to find a successor, Wolfgang Wagner has taken the view
that the vote should not constitute any sort of ultimatum, or even
encouragement, for him to step down.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued recently Wolfgang Wagner said, ``The
election of a successor does not mean that the present festival
director is put under pressure to announce a specific point of time
for resigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Because his contract is for life, this position seems legally
solid, if infuriating to Wolfgang Wagner's critics, who have grown
impatient with a festival that remains hugely popular _ demand for
tickets always swamps supply _ but has been described by the
Sueddeutsche Zeitung as treading ``the narrow path between
nostalgia and decay.''
</P>
<P>
   Udo Bernbach, a Wagner scholar, said: ``The legal position is
that Wolfgang Wagner retains his position as long as he wants. He
thought that perhaps he could indicate a successor. But if the
person chosen is not his wife, he will take the view that he is
there for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he can defend that position is another matter. Pressure
has been growing on Wolfgang Wagner to move on, and the board's
determination to vote on a successor suggests that he may be
vulnerable. The board includes representatives of the German
government, the state of Bavaria, the town of Bayreuth and the
family.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors _ apart from his tenure of almost a half-century _
have accentuated the pressure on Wolfgang Wagner. The first is
musical. Many critics and musicians take the view that the
innovative drive that characterized the festival in the immediate
postwar decades has dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang's brother, Wieland, who died in 1966 after running the
festival for 15 years, was the more artistic of the siblings. If
innovation survived his passing _ the postmodern centennial
``Ring'' of 1976 directed by Patrice Chereau and conducted by
Pierre Boulez is widely remembered _ it was generally less evident
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The second pressure is political. The cult of Bayreuth, and it
is intense, retains ties to the German right. Wolfgang Wagner is
generally seen as having been reluctant to encourage open debate on
the family's links to Hitler, the central role of Wagner's music
under the Third Reich, and the composer's own often scathing
attitude toward the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bayreuth is Germany's largest single contribution to musical
culture at this moment, but it is unhealthy to have the family in
charge,'' said Karen Painter, an assistant professor of music at
Harvard. ``What has generally been encouraged is the fetish around
the festival and a whitewash on anti-Semitism.''
</P>
<P>
   Because some of the funds for the festival come from the state,
the center-left coalition of Gerhard Schroeder is in a position to
wield some influence. It seems likely that it would push to see the
result of any vote respected quickly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wolfgang Wagner declined to be interviewed, as did the three
candidates to succeed him. Bavaria is a place of conservative
instincts, and the passions aroused by the succession have already
caused unease. But the long manifesto from Nike Wagner suggested
that she scents blood. Co-signed by Elmar Weingarten, general
manager of the Berlin Philharmonic, it amounted to an unprecedented
reach for power.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no dramaturgy behind the program as it stands
today,'' Nike Wagner said. She called for the repertory to be
extended because ``nothing decreed by Wagner's widow is
sacrosanct.'' So performances of ``Rienzi,'' ``Die Feen'' (``The
Fairies'') and ``Das Liebesverbot'' (``The Love Ban'') should be
added to the ``Ring'' and ``Parsifal.'' The directorship should be
restricted to a 10-year term, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Strong words. But as Barenboim said: ``There is a lot of
pressure to decide what happens when Mr. Wagner goes. But who
defines when he goes? He has a contract for life, and God, as far
as I know, is not on the Richard Wagner Foundation board.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will cover much of the East through Tuesday as
a series of low-pressure areas moves from the Midwest to the
northeast coast. Thundershowers surrounding one low-pressure center
will move off the Carolina coast early Monday. The northeast coast
will be mainly dry, but clouds will thicken as onshore breezes
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, showers will occur north of another low as it
moves from the Ohio Valley to the central Appalachians. Over an
inch of rain will be common by Tuesday, especially near the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Thundershowers will linger Monday in the warm, moist air across
the interior Southeast. Some sunshine will bathe the Gulf Coast,
where scattered thunder will erupt later Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will keep the Plains dry and mild. The interior
West will be very warm with scattered afternoon thunder in the
southern Rockies
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TORNADO TALLY
</P>
<P>
   Since records began in 1950, the United States has averaged
about 800 tornadoes annually. During the 1990s, the average was
more than 1,200 twisters a year. A large part of the significant
increase in the number of tornadoes recorded recently can be
attributed to better observation. The building of a national
network of Doppler radar that senses rotating winds in the clouds
has led to the detection of many tornadoes that in the past would
have been unnoticed. Also there are more people in more places with
more cameras watching for twisters.

BRITISH CABLE COMPANY SAID TO BE NEAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Telewest Communications PLC, Britain's second-largest
cable television company, is expected to announce as early as this
week that it will acquire a stake of about 10 percent in Chello
Broadband NV, executives close to the talks said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chello, which provides high-speed access to the Internet across
Europe, is a unit of United Pan-Europe Communications NV, the
European cable television company.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how much Telewest would pay for the Chello
stake. Executives close to the talks also said United Pan-Europe
could take a big stake in Telewest as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   If the acquisition of the Chello stake proceeds, Telewest, whose
biggest shareholders include Microsoft and Liberty Media Group, a
unit of AT&AMP;T, would be taking a stake in the European equivalent of
At Home Corp., the high-speed Internet service provider in which
AT&AMP;T holds a controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   It would also give Chello access to Telewest's cable customers
in Britain. Chello's high-speed Internet service is available in
nine countries served by the United Pan-Europe Communications cable
network.
</P>
<P>
   Chello, which had been planning to offer shares to the public on
May 31 on the Nasdaq and Amsterdam stock exchanges, postponed its
offering. Executives close to the companies said they were working
to reach a deal by the end of this week so they could proceed with
the initial offering. They cautioned, however, that as with any
deal, they could both still decide to abandon the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks said it had been difficult to put
a value on Chello, because of the recent gyrations among technology
stocks. Before Chello's initial offering was first pulled, it had
planned to sell 27 million shares _ 10 percent of the company _ for
13 to 17 euros, or $12.30 to $16.08, each.

`KING GIMP': A PAINTER HAPPILY EMERGES FROM A DETERMINED BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time and channel
are for New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of those embarrassing, exhilarating spectacles people
hope for when they watch the Oscars. In March, when ``King Gimp''
won the award for best documentary short, the film's writer and
subject sprang out of his wheelchair in a burst of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night HBO is showing the documentary, which is
exhilarating in its way but far from embarrassing in any way. It
tells the story leading up to that Oscar moment, and how Daniel
Keplinger, the flailing man in the wheelchair, tries to force the
world to see only the man.
</P>
<P>
   His job is not easy because cerebral palsy has set his various
body parts moving to separate rhythms. It is painful to watch him
change shirts. He rolls like a toddler on the floor, struggling to
coerce his uncooperative self into elusive arm and neck holes. So
when he first appears on screen, it is hard to grasp what is going
on with him because this young man with dark shaggy hair does not
stop moving and sputtering. Then subtitles appear to translate
those bursts of noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think `gimp' means someone with a lame walk,''
says Keplinger. ``But gimp also means a fighting spirit.'' Suddenly
he comes into focus. Keplinger the documentary subject was
discovered at age 12 when Susan Hannah Hadary and William Whiteford
began investigating the lives of children with physical
disabilities. For the next 13 years they periodically checked in
with him.
</P>
<P>
   His progress surprised everyone except perhaps his mother. She
appears to be a calm woman who refused to put her son in an
institution as her husband wanted. He left the family when Dan was
6 and she continued her child-rearing plan. ``I treated him the way
I would have treated any normal baby,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In family photographs he looks normal. The freeze frame of the
still camera stops his perpetual motion, at least for the photo
albums.
</P>
<P>
   After spending a few years at a school for disabled children,
Keplinger was ``mainstreamed.'' His social life was negligible, but
he found solace. Like the cerebral-palsy-stricken Irish writer and
painter Christy Brown (memorialized by Daniel Day-Lewis' bravura
performance in ``My Left Foot''), Keplinger turned to art. Using a
specially designed headpiece to hold a brush, he began to paint and
draw under the guidance of an understanding teacher. Somehow the
contact of the brush and canvas seems to steady him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Parkville High, an artist was born and the artist was me,''
says Keplinger.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile he did what teen-age boys do: he grew a mustache and a
ponytail and asserted his independence. Before he graduated, he
moved into his own apartment.
</P>
<P>
   At 20 he enrolled in Towson State University in Maryland, where
two teachers would not speak to him and another told him he would
never be an artist. Keplinger thought he might never paint again,
until another teacher took him seriously. So he could make
reasonable suggestions to his student, this teacher tried on
Keplinger's head contraption and tried painting with it.
</P>
<P>
   Keplinger's paintings are fierce, almost defiant, but also
strangely beautiful: or maybe it's impossible not to read them like
this after watching his struggle.
</P>
<P>
   His work can be seen at the Phyllis Kind Gallery in SoHo through
June 30. HBO is simultaneously mounting a virtual exhibit on the
Internet, at hbo.com.

 &HT;    Russian Media Jab Putin, Clinton to Make Point on Free Speech
 &HT;    By Margaret Coker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW - Fed up with the stiff and somber meetings between
President Bill Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a
popular and controversial Russian television show tried to loose up
the summit atmosphere with a bit of lampooning Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's most popular entertainment show, called Kukly, which
means ``puppets'' in Russian and is best described as a mix between
``Saturday Night Live'' and ``The Simpsons,'' featured Clinton as a
special guest to make a point about the importance of free speech
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The show and its network, the independent NTV television
station, have come under fire in the past for its irreverence as it
pokes fun at the country's leading politicians. It has repeatedly
skewered Putin, showing skits where his puppet likeness is a pimp
or even God.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has increased pressure on the television station to
``retire'' the Putin puppet - a threat NTV says it won't bow to.
</P>
<P>
   Russian journalists and intellectuals have been highly critical
of Putin's treatment of the media, and fear the former KGB chief
will reinstate Soviet-era restrictions on the press.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's Kukly program stressed the importance that a free
press and open style of government can play for a country.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for Clinton to arrive, the puppet Putin discusses
the possibility of recruiting Clinton as a spy. In a dream
sequence, he practices his pitch to ``Friend Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill,'' says puppet Putin. ``I want us to work together''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, yes,'' replied puppet Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand. I want you to work for us,'' Putin says
ominously, as he shows Clinton a thick KGB file filled with the
American's misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   As Putin starts to tick off a list of blackmailable offenses,
including draft dodging and womanizing, Clinton cuts him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the American people know all this, who I've been with,
what I've done,'' the Bill puppet says.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can that be?'' asks a perplexed Putin, dismayed because
his tactic appears to have backfired.
</P>
<P>
   The show's irreverence was not one-sided however. It took a
couple of jabs at Clinton, and the shallowness Russians often
perceive in Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get me to agree'' to become a KGB spy, the Bill puppet says
later. ``All you have to do is offer money, lots of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was featured in a Kukly episode two years ago,
speculating about what might have happened if the U.S. president
found himself in Russia at the time of bloody Communist purges of
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent part of Sunday evening in a scheduled event on
Russia's airwaves, fielding questions in an unprecedented hour-long
radio evening phone-in program on the independent radio station
Ekho Moskvy, owned by the same company that runs NTV.

 &HT;    Putin Rejects U.S. Anti-Missile Plan
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW President Clinton was unable to overcome Russian leader
Vladimir Putin's objections Sunday to a controversial U.S.
anti-missile program designed to defend America from attacks by a
rogue state or terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned Putin, though, that continued Russian opposition
to the missile defense shield would make it difficult for the
United States to agree to mutual nuclear weapons reductions Moscow
seeks.
</P>
<P>
   Those cuts, Clinton said, would require a change in top secret
Pentagon plans for responding to a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be much better, if we were going to do that, if we
could also know that we were defending ourselves against a new
threat, which we believe is real,'' said Clinton, referring to the
risk of a missile attack from a rogue state such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Putin acknowledged the growing risk of such an attack, but he
told Clinton that the United States has exaggerated the threat. He
argued that the missile defense system Clinton is considering could
do more harm than good, by upsetting the strategic balance of
weaponry between the two nuclear powers, perhaps even sparking a
21st Century arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of problems there,'' Putin said through an
interpreter. ``We're against having a cure which is worse than the
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders made their remarks during a 25-minute press
conference following a day of intensive talks focused on missile
defense and nuclear arms reductions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton is scheduled to become the first U.S.
president ever to address the Russian Duma, or parliament. After
that, he flies aboard Air Force One to the Ukrainian capital of
Kiev for a half-day meeting with President Leonid Kuchma, returning
to Washington late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the open tension over high stakes issues that rekindled
memories of U.S.-Soviet rivalry during the Cold War, both Clinton
and Putin insisted that they had set the stage for working out
their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really cherish this,'' said Putin. ``We observed not only a
desire to speak, but also to find joint and mutually beneficial
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back over darker days in U.S.-Russian ties, Putin, a
former KGB officer, said ``One would hope that the very worst in
our relations is far, far behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   In their first summit since Putin was elected president in
March, the two men met for about four hours Sunday in the Kremlin,
roughly the same amount of time as they met the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The two appeared to establish a rapport that was businesslike
and respectful, if not nearly as chummy as the sort of personal
relationship Clinton built over seven years with former President
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone behaves the way President Clinton has behaved, not
trying to find dead ends and problems, but to seek ways of moving
ahead,'' said Putin, ``I think, between us, in the future our
relations really will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond congenial atmospherics, the summit bore substantial fruit
on the central goal of reducing the danger of a nuclear exchange
between two countries that together possess more than 80 percent of
the world's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders committed their countries to disposing of 34 tons,
each, of nuclear weapons fuel plutonium over the next 20 years,
under an agreement that provides for extensive U.S. and
international assistance to help Russia do its part. If it were not
destroyed, the fuel could be used to build thousands of nuclear
warheads or possibly fall into the hands of terrorist groups or
rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed also to set up a joint office, in Moscow, where U.S.
and Russian military officers could sit side by side at computer
screens and share information on any missile firing that might
appear to threaten either country.
</P>
<P>
   That program, the first permanent military operation ever
between the former Cold War foes, is designed to reduce the risk of
a mistaken alarm that could trigger a counterattack against either
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a milestone in enhancing strategic stability,'' said
Clinton, ``and I welcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   And they agreed to a set of 16 principles to guide them in
continuing negotiations over the core strategic issues of missile
defense and nuclear arms reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Each side cast the principles in different terms, however, and
neither side reported progress on the substance of their
fundamental dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we haven't eliminated the differences between us,'' on
the subject of missile defense, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott told reporters traveling with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the objective case that the United States has
made is very compelling,'' said Talbott. ``But for it to become the
basis of an agreement with the Russians, they need to see that,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have stressed for weeks that they had no
expectation of resolving the missile defense and arms reductions
differences during this summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin have ordered senior aides to conduct technical
talks on both issues in the weeks ahead, with an eye toward a
second meeting of the two presidents on the margins of the annual
Group of Eight, or G-8, summit in Japan at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Time, though, is not on Clinton's side.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from leaving office in January, Clinton is expected to
decide this fall on whether to deploy a proposed national missile
defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
   The NMD system under consideration would consist of a
sophisticated radar station in Alaska and a bevy of 100 missile
launchers, also in Alaska. It's aim would be to detect an incoming
missile fired from across the Pacific Ocean toward the United
States and destroy it en route with defense missiles called
interceptors.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system is not permitted under the Anti Ballistic Missile
(ABM) treaty reached 28 years ago between the United States and the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed amending the ABM treaty to allow for an NMD
system. He contends that such an amendment has been made necessary
by the ability of North Korea, presumed by the U.S. intelligence
community to have several nuclear weapons, to deploy a long-range
ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Putin rejects that argument.
</P>
<P>
   Putin fears, also, that a limited NMD system would be the first
step toward a far more sophisticated missile shield that, over
time, would undercut the strategic balance of power between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia believes that NMD will undermine strategic stability,
threaten Russia's strategic deterrent and provoke a new arms
race,'' said Talbott, the administration's long term point man on
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton claims that the NMD system would pose no threat to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries are in the initial stages, moreover, of
negotiating further reductions in their nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   The countries, combined, have more than 14,000 nuclear warheads
deployed on long range bombers and missiles. They have agreed to
try to reduce that total to 5,000 under a third Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START), now in the early stages of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, though, is seeking further reductions, down to a
combined total of 3,000. Russia's nuclear arsenal is rapidly
deteriorating and economic woes are making it increasingly
difficult for the country to safely maintain a large nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Sunday that both sets of negotiations must proceed
in tandem, and he made clear that progress in one area would be
largely pegged to progress in another.

SITTING DOWN A NOVELIST, GETTING UP A PLAYWRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Ward Just is the author, most recently, of a novel, ``A
Dangerous Priena'' (Mariner Books) and the reissued Vietnam memoir
``To What End'' (PublicAffairs Press). ``Lowell Limpett'' opens
Wednesday at the Cherry Lane Alternative Theater.)

 By WARD JUST   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have never thought writing novels was hard work. Hard work was
commercial fishing out of New Bedford or Gloucester or driving a
16-wheel truck. Novels have more to do with desire _ translating
desire into prose _ and a temperament that accepts concentration
over the long haul, meaning the ability to sit alone in one place
day by day.
</P>
<P>
   Writing novels bears some modest (very modest) comparison to
grinding on the higher slopes of the PGA tour, magical afternoons
bunkered by afternoons of routine or appalling play and reminding
yourself every minute to trust your swing.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged golfers watching the Houston Open on television last
month turned their faces to the wall when the 46-year-old Craig
Stadler, playing beautifully from tee to green, missed short putts
on four consecutive playoff holes to lose the match to Robert
Allenby, not yet 30. Allenby was not playing well, except on the
green, where it counted.
</P>
<P>
   My heart went out to Stadler, gray-haired, red-faced, so weary
and impatient, so eager to get it over with. During the four-day
run of the tournament he had used up his ration of concentration.
He needed a distraction, something droll or alarming, anything that
would divide him from the task at hand and cause him to reflect.
His 5-foot putts had become a kind of tyranny. (And the 5-foot putt
is the golfer's equivalent of the true sentence that completes the
chapter.)
</P>
<P>
   I hoped for a monstrous rainstorm so Stadler could go away, get
a good night's sleep and return the following morning. Allenby was
as steady as a metronome, completing his chapters with the
authority and _ it has to be said _ the slow motion of Henry James
in his late period.
</P>
<P>
   For many years I have tried to find an agreeable distraction,
something more sideline than hobby, some avocation that was not too
difficult or tyrannical or long-term. When the sentences began to
fall apart, there would be this other thing to do, my equivalent of
a good night's sleep: except the sleep might last for weeks. Of
course there would be money in it, whatever it was.
</P>
<P>
   I was willing to try almost anything. The truth is, I thought of
this activity as a day at the racetrack. If you forgot about
hunches, if you studied the form and bet every race, the odds were
good that you would cash at least one ticket. Perhaps, if you were
clever enough, a win ticket or even the daily double.
</P>
<P>
   My children described this as dad's search for a get-rich-quick
scheme. But I only wanted to get out of the office.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time I thought I could do voice-overs, the sort of
thing that David McCullough does so well for ``The American
Experience.'' I have what I have always believed was a nicely
modulated baritone, perhaps riddled a little around the edges by
tobacco and Scotch, but inviting nonetheless. That voice, I
imagined people saying, that voice has been around. I asked a
friend where I might take this undiscovered talent, and after
listening to a tape, she said commercials. An arthritis remedy or
something to do with heartburn or anxiety. McCullough is safe, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings me to Paris, February 1991. A long, gray winter,
the dollar falling. My wife and I had moved from one overpriced
apartment to another. I had completed the novel I was working on
and was unwilling to begin another right away.
</P>
<P>
   The worm of avocation had begun to crawl yet again, to no
positive result. I spent my time watching the Persian Gulf war on
television and visiting museums, never neglecting a nourishing meal
at the end of the day. It was at one of these that two German
friends, a diplomat and a historian, suggested we go together to
see Patrick Suskind's play ``La Contrebasse,'' at the Theatre des
Arts-Hebertot. The author was a friend of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   I very much admired his novel ``Perfume,'' and under normal
circumstances I would have agreed at once. It's always interesting
when writers change hats: poets to novelists, novelists to
playwrights. But circumstances were not normal. ``La Contrebasse''
was in French, and I did not speak French. My wife spoke French.
She dealt with the plumbers, electricians, doctors, dentists and Le
Monde. I was the one who sat in cafes and listened to
conversations, inventing my own translations.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, the diplomat said. We'll translate for you.
</P>
<P>
   The historian seconded the motion.
</P>
<P>
   My wife insisted that I knew more French than I thought I did,
and, en tout cas, everyone would chip in with key words and
phrases.
</P>
<P>
   What a pleasure for those sitting around us, I thought but did
not say.
</P>
<P>
   So we attended ``La Contrebasse'' by Patrick Suskind at the
Theatre des Arts-Hebertot. It turned out to be a one-character play
involving a musician and his double bass. I had matters pretty well
in hand until about the fifth minute, when the narrative collapsed.
I had no idea what the actor, Jacques Villeret, was saying.
</P>
<P>
   I inferred that he and his double bass had an extremely
complicated relationship, and that things were not going well
between them. The action transpired in the musician's apartment
somewhere in bohemian Paris, the Marais, perhaps, or Montparnasse.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was laughing; my wife and our German friends were
enthralled. So any idea of assistance with the salient words and
phrases was forgotten. For me these were minutes of oceanic boredom
until my mind suddenly slipped into another realm altogether. As I
did in cafes, I began to supply my own translation. Just as
suddenly, the musician and his double bass vanished. In their
places appeared a newspaper reporter and his typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reporter was middle-aged, as was the musician; and
the typewriter was well worn and talismanic, as was the double
bass. The reporter seemed to have an affectionate relationship with
the machine; it was his career that was going to hell.
</P>
<P>
   The set remained the same: a couch, a desk, two tables, chairs
here and there, a bookcase. But Paris had become Cincinnati because
in my mind's eye I saw the poster that hung on my office wall in
the Rue des Saints-Peres: Edward Hopper's ``Street Scene,
Gloucester,'' Cincinnati Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   My newspaperman was 55. He was a soloist, a little scornful of
the ensemble. Along the way he managed to win a Pulitzer Prize, a
badge he thought was not entirely deserved. When the curtain rose,
Act I, Scene 1, he erupted on the stage in a fury, as Jacques
Villeret had done.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea of the cause of the musician's agitation, but the
newspaperman was returning from the funeral of a colleague, with
the justified suspicion that his editor wanted to fire him. If my
newsman had thought of himself as a musician, he would have chosen
Bach, for the measured cadence and formality of expression. But
since he thought of himself as an artist, he believed that on his
best days he captured something of Hopper. His editor preferred Roy
Lichtenstein, so my man was headed for the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   How did it go? My wife asked when ``La Contrebasse'' was over.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful, I said.
</P>
<P>
   She looked at me with astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   You understood it?
</P>
<P>
   Everything, I said. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lowell Limpett'' took four days to write. Really, all I had to
do was transcribe what I had written in my head during the
90-minute reverie in the Theatre des Arts-Hebertot. I had been
given a free bet at the track, so the writing was a lark, as if I
had decided to compose a long letter to a friend or a bedtime story
for my grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   I put into it all I had ever known or heard about newspaper
reporters reaching the end of their one-way street, all seen
through the lens of my own newspaper experience of decades before;
alternative histories, as someone called it. My character was more
restrained than Patrick Suskind's, at least as Jacques Villeret
played him. But his double bass and my typewriter were brothers,
and I can remember now the unfathomable rapid-fire French mutating
into measured American idiom, and my surprise when the curtain fell
and the audience broke into applause.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote the play, had a good laugh and thought that I had found
my sideline, except that I had no expectation that anyone would
want to risk a production. So it was a pro bono sideline, with some
vanity thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lowell Limpett'' had its debut in Paris in March 1991: a
living room full of invited guests; many, many drinks before the
curtain rose; Alan Riding, a reporter for The New York Times, in
the title role. Somewhere a videotape survives, but owing to
inattention or too much Bordeaux or mechanical failure, the tape is
without sound. Since virtually everyone in attendance was connected
to the news business, there was high hilarity. Everyone thought it
had commercial possibilities. What a vehicle! And so funny!
</P>
<P>
   That summer I sent it around, first to friends in the theater
business, then to friends of the friends, finally to theater
companies. But you know this story. This is an old story without
possibilities, because all unhappy theater stories are alike. Each
happy theater story is happy in its own way. I put ``Lowell
Limpett'' into the discard file and forgot about it, reminded only
when I glanced at Hopper's picture on my office wall.
</P>
<P>
   And there matters stood for eight years. We returned to New
England. I published four novels, did a voice-over, continued my
struggles with golf, searching always for an agreeable sideline.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago I got a call from the playwright Michael
Weller. He had seen the manuscript of ``Lowell Limpett'' in 1991
and liked it, and he now proposed that I sign up with the mentor
program for emerging playwrights at the Cherry Lane Alternative
Theater in Manhattan. You get a mentor to smooth the rough edges
and the promise of a 10-day run at the Cherry Lane Alternative.
</P>
<P>
   If I had any doubts _ and what doubts were there to have? _ they
were forgotten when I learned the identity of my mentor. Wendy
Wasserstein owns a Pulitzer Prize, just like Lowell Limpett. Unlike
Lowell Limpett, she's young enough to be my daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Mentee, she said, and began to cackle.
</P>
<P>
   What can I expect? I asked.
</P>
<P>
   This is a get-rich-quick scheme, she said, and laughed and
laughed.

<P>
   Ever since the term ``clicks and mortar'' first made the rounds
last year, traditional retailers have repeated the phrase with
mind-numbing regularity, vowing to anyone within earshot that by
integrating their Web operations into their physical stores they
would eventually bury the Internet-only merchants.
</P>
<P>
   So one might forgive the tax lawyers of some of these
traditional retailers for being slightly confused. Even as these
companies preach the gospel of Internet integration to the public,
some of the best-known merchants are telling government regulators
that their Internet and physical-world operations are distinct and
separate businesses _ and therefore should enjoy the tax advantages
of maintaining separate operations.
</P>
<P>
   Those advantages are sizeable. Like catalog companies,
Internet-only businesses can sell to customers in any state but are
required to collect sales tax only in the states where they have a
physical presence _ a company headquarters, for instance, or
warehouse. For Web merchants, the rules regarding physical presence
_ or nexus, in tax parlance _ can also be set in motion in states
where the merchants operate Internet server computers, or even
backup servers.
</P>
<P>
   But traditional retailers have a problem. If they integrate
their physical stores and their Internet operations, they run the
risk of causing a nexus in every state where they have a store and
must then collect a sales tax in that state _ even for sales on the
Internet. And the more their stores act as agents for the Web sites
_ by accepting merchandise returns in their stores for purchases
made on the Web, for example, or promoting their Internet sites
within the bricks-and-mortar stores _ the greater the chances that
states will require them to collect sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   When these merchants do charge sales tax, not only do they often
lose price battles against pure e-tailers; they must also invest in
high-price tax software, so they can calculate, collect and then
disburse sales taxes for nearly every purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Bricks-and-mortar retailers, of course, are fighting the tax
codes with every nickel of lobbying money they can scrape together,
saying that tax laws unfairly favor Internet retailers. And despite
the fact that the House recently voted to extend a moratorium on
new Internet taxes, the earthbound retailers are hopeful that the
Senate will modify the legislation so that all Web merchants could
be required to collect state sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers are approaching Internet sales taxes in
widely varying ways. Some, like Wal-Mart and the bookseller
Borders, are being particularly aggressive. In both cases, the Web
sites charge sales tax only in the few states where the companies
have actual Internet operations _ even though they allow goods
bought on the Web to be returned to all of their stores and even
though they promote their sites within the stores.
</P>
<P>
   Some tax analysts say such an approach is pushing the boundaries
of tax law in some states, even if a separate corporate division is
handling the dot-com side of the business. But according to Rich
Fahle, a Borders spokesman, ``Every lawyer we've spoken to said
we're legally in the clear. And our competitors aren't charging tax
online either, so that would put us at a serious competitive
disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Borders' big competitor, Barnes &AMP; Noble, has spun off
its dot-com operations into a separate company,
Barnesandnoble.com's sales tax practices are similar to
Amazon.com's and other pure Internet retailers.
</P>
<P>
   One industry executive said Wal-Mart might be inviting a court
case _ something he said he would welcome, ``so we could all get
some clarity on this issue and maybe level the playing field'' for
non-Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Les Copeland, a Wal-Mart spokesman, declined to ``speak to
someone else's theory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we approached this,'' Copeland said, ``we just looked at
how other dot-com companies were structured, and we set up
Wal-Mart.com similar to the other dot-com companies.'' He said that
to keep things at arm's length, Wal-Mart stores serve as a
contractor to Wal-Mart.com, when it comes to accepting product
returns from the Web site's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Other retailers that have set up separate companies for their
online stores are taking a more conservative approach. Kmart,
which, in league with Softbank Venture Partners, founded
Bluelight.com as a separate business, is one example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we charging taxes? Absolutely,'' said Mark H. Goldstein,
Bluelight's chief executive. ``Did we buy an expensive software
package to do that? Absolutely. Do we think it's right? Absolutely
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said the company might become more aggressive about
taxes later this year, ``when we can focus on this issue more
clearly and directly.'' But for now, ``there are municipalities
that are counting on this money,'' he said. ``We don't want to be
the lightening rod for holding back revenues. We don't want to do
anything that's illegal. And we don't want to alienate communities
where Kmart has stores.''
</P>
<P>
   And although charging sales tax can put his company at a pricing
disadvantage, Goldstein said that gap was narrowing because
Internet-only retailers have been slowly raising their prices in an
effort to make a profit. ``It was a larger issue when the dot-coms
were being subsidized'' by venture capitalists, he said. ``That's
disappearing quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For other traditional retailers, the advantages of integrating
business units far outweigh the sales tax hit. ``Spinning off a
piece of the company just detracts from the overall business,''
said Ken Weil, vice president of new media for Victoria's Secret, a
unit of the Limited Inc. ``I recently talked to one company that
separated the businesses,'' Weil said. ``They put their URL on the
shopping bag in stores, and the stores division wanted to charge
the Internet division. They got bogged down in a channel
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret charges sales tax on its Web site in any state
that has a sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, Weil said, there is no evidence that Victoria's
Secret is rankling consumers who might have expected tax-free
Internet shopping. ``We get hundreds of customer service contacts a
week,'' he said, ``and taxation never comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Weil acknowledged that because his site sells only goods bearing
the Victoria's Secret brand, customers are essentially unable to
engage in price-comparison shopping, as happens with many other
kinds of retailing sites. But according to a recent report by
Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm, even among goods
that consumers can buy from multiple retailers, sales tax is less
an issue than many retailers may believe.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 1,600 online shoppers, Jupiter found that when
shopping for goods priced $50 or less, only 29 percent of
respondents said they would consider rejecting the purchase if the
retailer charged sales tax. That number climbed to 41 percent for
goods over $100.
</P>
<P>
   So from a tax standpoint, companies should avoid integrating
their Internet and existing retail operations ``only if they're
selling high-priced, commodity products, like computers,'' said Ken
Cassar, a Jupiter analyst. ``Otherwise, the opportunities for
serving customers and promoting the site are big enough that even
if you do have to charge tax, they're well worth it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassar noted that 42 percent of those surveyed said that, if
given the option, they would want to return products purchased
online to the Web site's affiliated store _ an option that, for
most retailers, includes charging a sales tax to Internet
customers.
</P>
<P>
   That logic is not lost on Kent Anderson, president of
Macy's.com, which tightly integrates the Web site and physical
stores, in areas like inventory management and marketing. And it
charges sales tax in any state with Web operations or Macy stores,
which are owned by Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just completed some research which told us that the ability
to take merchandise back to the store is a key element for our
customers,'' he said. ``It came out as No. 1 or 2 in almost every
customer feedback session.''
</P>
<P>
   And sales tax? ``It was not an issue,'' Anderson said.

FROM THE HEADLINES, A NOMINEE FACES HER MEDIA CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
 BY JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``An American Daughter,'' Christine Lahti plays Lyssa Dent
Hughes, a prominent Washington doctor who has been nominated to be
surgeon general. During what is supposed to be a friendly
television interview, Lyssa's husband mentions the time his busy
wife failed to respond to a jury summons. The interview transforms
Lyssa into a celebrity of sorts, a media target. Everything about
her _ her hair, her manner, the things she has said about her
mother _ become ammunition to be used against her.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Wasserstein, who wrote the script, based on her Broadway
play, was inspired by real events: the failure of Zoe Baird's
nomination for attorney general, because she didn't pay taxes on
her nanny's salary; Kimba M. Wood's stymied nomination for the job,
also because of nanny problems; even Lani Guinier, whose nomination
for assistant attorney general was beset by politics, not personal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested in what happens to the best and brightest
people in this country and why they don't go into public office,''
Wasserstein said in a publicity handout. ``What's more important:
that they're good at public relations or that they're good at their
jobs?''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds meaty. So it is curious, at least in this Lifetime
production, which will be broadcast Monday night at 9, that Lyssa
appears almost entirely as mother, wife, friend _ oh, yes, and
beleaguered nominee. She is always taking something out of the
refrigerator or putting something in or cleaning up or shopping at
Safeway. She doesn't even seem to have domestic help, though she
and her family live in a huge Georgetown home that is unnaturally
tidy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a relief, near the end, when she finally shows up at the
hospital she is supposed to be running and dons a white doctor's
coat (or maybe it's a relief because the setting recalls better
television moments for Lahti, when she was a regular on ``Chicago
Hope.'')
</P>
<P>
   The characters are cartoonish. Lyssa's nemesis is Quincy Quince
(Blake Lindsley), a sleek young postfeminist writer of the Naomi
Wolf school. Lyssa's best friend is Dr. Judith Kaufman (Lynne
Thigpen), a Jewish oncologist (and, it seems, Wasserstein's alter
ego, except for being black): Judith is always dieting, feeling
like a failure despite her success, a single woman in her 40s
pursuing fertility options. Lyssa's husband (Tom Skerritt) is a
sociology professor who has given many private tutorials to his
female students (including slinky Quincy).
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Wasserstein knows how to write a funny scene, but the
speechifying overwhelms the satire. ``You think my wife is one of
those 1970s good girls who came into prominence in the 1990s and
schedules a half-hour a day for spontaneity?'' asks husband Walter,
thematically.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a subtle, feminist gesture Wasserstein has handed the
philandering husband more than his share of doozies. ``We're really
smart people, Lyssa,'' he says. ``We deserve to get everything out
of life the really smart ones get.'' But Lyssa doesn't have the
sense to look at him and say: ``Do any of us deserve anything,
Walter?'' She doesn't say this _ or anything like it _ because
Wasserstein seems to believe that privilege should beget privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Lahti rises to the occasion when she is given one. Though
Wasserstein wants us to empathize with Lyssa's plight, she does not
really seem to like her own creation very much. When Lyssa finally
decides to defend herself on television, she ends up whining.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman from good schools and a good family,'' Lyssa tells the
women of America archly. ``That woman has to be made to publicly
suffer so we know she's real.'' She continues, ``If she refuses to
compensate for her achievements, then she deserves to be hung out
to dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a talk-back-to-the-television moment. ``Clam up,
Lyssa,'' you might feel compelled to say. It isn't that poor little
rich girls can't be sympathetic. But they can't be self-righteous
at the same time.

CISCO, FOX TRANSMIT DIGITAL FILM ACROSS INTERNET TO THEATER IN
ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Tuesday, for the first time, a Hollywood movie
will be digitally transmitted across the country over the Internet
and then digitally projected to a cinema audience, going from the
studio in Hollywood to a theater in Atlanta without ever touching
film, officials at 20th Century Fox Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc.
said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to demonstrate the potential of digital
distribution, which many believe will one day supplant traditional
canisters of celluloid, and to allow Fox to have the world premiere
of its new animated feature, ``Titan A.E.,'' at Atlanta's Supercomm
trade show on Tuesday. The film, a space adventure that combines
three-dimensional, computer-generated images with traditional
animation, is scheduled to open in theaters on June 16. Cisco makes
networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Digital projectors have been used sporadically in the last year
to exhibit a few films in a handful of theaters around the country
_ Disney's ``Dinosaur'' is one _ and video images have been
streaming across the Internet, with varying success, for a long
time. But, Fox and Cisco officials said, this will be the first
time the two processes have been combined in a demonstration of the
kind of digital distribution network that may replace film in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such cutting-edge applications using the Internet not only
revolutionize movie creation and distribution, but will drive
innovation in myriad other industries as well,'' said Larry Lang,
vice president for service provider marketing at Cisco. ``Just as
the Internet has enabled industries of all kinds to increase
flexibility, decrease costs, and explore new opportunities, digital
cinema has the potential to bring great benefits to the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Cisco's latest technology, ``Titan A.E.'' will be
electronically hurled from Qwest Communication Inc.'s CyberCenter
in Burbank to the Woodruff Arts Center in Atlanta, where it will be
projected on a Barco/Texas Instruments DLP Cinema digital
projector.
</P>
<P>
   How long it might be before such digital distribution is common
is an open question. Two major issues have been slowing the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the price. Cinema owners are reluctant to pay an
estimated $100,000 per projector when the bulk of the savings will
go to the movie studios, which will be freed from the costs of
making thousands of prints and shipping them around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue is the fear among many in Hollywood that once
their films are loosed upon the Internet, they will be subject to
the same kinds of piracy that have plagued the music industry in
recent months. As a result, both Fox and Cisco stressed the
security precautions they would be using with the Cisco 7140
Virtual Private Network, a method for isolating and protecting data
traveling across the internet, including fire walls, security
routers and encryption devices.

THE QUEEN BREAKS THE ICE WITH CAMILLA PARKER BOWLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a noteworthy and unexpected warming of the coldest
shoulder in the realm, Queen Elizabeth II this past weekend met
Camilla Parker Bowles, mistress to her son Charles, the prince of
Wales, for the first time since their affair began.
</P>
<P>
   The get-together was at a 60th birthday party on Saturday for
the exiled King Constantine of Greece at Charles' Highgrove estate
in Gloucestershire. It ended an extended royal snub that had
irritated and dismayed the prince and complicated the choreographed
efforts by his staff to gain gradual public acceptance of Parker
Bowles as his consort and possible queen.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Bowles, who last saw the queen two decades ago, was
reported by other diners to have made a low, formal curtsy. The two
women then chatted briefly before the 100 guests tucked into a
barbecue lunch. They were seated at different tables.
</P>
<P>
   For years the queen had let it be known that she disapproved of
the liaison between the 51-year-old heir to the throne and the
52-year-old divorcee whom Diana, princess of Wales, blamed for
wrecking her marriage to Charles. The prince's staff had made
gaining the queen's tolerance of the relationship their No. 1
public relations priority.
</P>
<P>
   For royal watchers, birthday-party attendance has become an
important measure of whether the sovereign's thumb is up or down.
Parker Bowles was not invited to a grand party planned this summer
for Queen Elizabeth the queen mother, who turns 100 on Aug. 4. In
November 1998 the queen pointedly did not attend the Highgrove
party marking Charles' 50th birthday, because the hostess was
Parker Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the guest-list scrutinizers is the 18th birthday of
Prince William next month.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham Palace let it be known that the queen accepted the
invitation for Saturday's party knowing full well who had been
invited. A palace spokesman commented tersely Saturday night, ``The
queen attended a birthday party for King Constantine given by the
prince of Wales at Highgrove this lunchtime, and Mrs. Parker Bowles
was among the guests.''
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional expert, Lord St. John of Fawsley, said the
meeting was a necessary healing of a long-running quarrel but did
not mean that a marriage between the prince and Parker Bowles was
likely. ``It is essentially a private meeting, but the queen is
very well aware of the significance which will be attached to it,''
he told The Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The queen is cool in her judgment and she would have assessed
the whole issue,'' said Lord St. John, whose name, following
British tradition, is pronounced ``SIN-jun.'' ``She has clearly
concluded that the time has come for them to end what has been a
point of contention.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I welcome the fact that it has happened. There are
so many problems which afflict families today that it is a very
good thing that this potential rift between her majesty and the
prince of Wales has been healed.'' But he went on, ``It is a long
step from that to concluding that a marriage will take place
between Mrs. Parker Bowles and the prince _ but that is really a
matter for them.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is plenty of evidence that Charles wants to step out
in public with Parker Bowles, there is little to suggest that he
wants to walk her down the aisle. Members of his staff point to his
statement at the time of his divorce that he would not remarry.
They also assert that Parker Bowles, to whom they refer privately
as ``Mrs. P.B.,'' has no interest in becoming queen.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage,
said he believed there would be a royal wedding and speculated that
the Church of England would soon change its rules to allow
remarriage for divorced men or women whose former spouses are still
alive. This is the barrier blocking Parker Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   There is little likelihood that she will be able to assume any
official functions, but there may now be a place for her at private
family occasions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charles and Camilla Shand, as she was then, first met at a
London nightclub in 1972, where she is said to have told the prince
that her great-grandmother was his great-great-grandfather's
mistress, and then said, ``So how about it?'' She was referring to
Alice Keppel, who had been the lover of King Edward VII.
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship bloomed into what he later described as a
``blissful, peaceful, and mutually happy relationship.'' Then he
went to sea as a junior officer in the Royal Navy and she married
Maj. Andrew Parker Bowles, a cavalry officer. During the 1980s,
they resumed a sexual relationship, and Diana famously complained
in a television interview that ``there were three of us in this
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the public emergence of Charles and Camilla were well
under way when Diana's death in a car crash in Paris in August 1997
put an end to any thought of it.
</P>
<P>
   The effort resumed on a night in January 1999, when
photographers were alerted that Charles and Camilla would be
emerging together from the Ritz Hotel after a 50th birthday party
for her sister Annabel Elliott. The burst of flashbulbs turned
Piccadilly into daylight during their 20-second passage from
doorway to limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Parker Bowles' meetings with William and Harry, his
younger brother, now 15, were leaked to improve her image among
people who were unforgiving of her role during Charles' marriage to
the boys' mother. The couple were filmed together on a Greek island
cruise last summer, and Parker Bowles made a highly publicized trip
to New York, where she was photographed with society figures.
</P>
<P>
   In the days in which she was accused of sinking the royal
marriage, buns were thrown at her by angry shoppers in a food store
and her looks were compared unfavorably with those of a horse on
the front page of a tabloid newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But opinion polls now indicate that most Britons are not opposed
to the relationship, or even to their marriage, though there
remains general opposition to the notion of her becoming queen. And
now the most difficult convert has yielded.

   Contentville has significantly more marketing clout and will
sell more than books: content from newspapers and magazines, as
well as e-books, dissertations and other material. It will spend
$75 million in advertising over the next two years, according to
Brill, who estimates that books will account for 25 to 30 percent
of the site's total revenue. Both NBC and CBS have invested in
Contentville, and the site will be advertised on the networks
beginning in July in some markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Contentville independents will create a variety of editorial
features, including recommended ``libraries'' of essential books in
various categories, ``If You Ask Me'' endorsements of books they
love and new books they are enthusiastic about. There will also be
store bestseller lists and ``Buzz on the Floor'' notes on local
happenings that have helped sales of certain titles. But Shanley
questions whether the local flavor will help on the Web, where
``virtual communities are more important than land-based ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The new sites are complementary _ Contentville will have pages
that point back to Web sites that may be part of Booksense.
</P>
<P>
   This may be an advantage for the booksellers involved in the
programs. Roxanne Coady of R.J. Julia Books in Madison, Conn., who
is participating in both sites, said: ``Booksense as a branding
campaign, Booksense.com and Contentville can all act to remind
consumers that independent booksellers have a valuable voice. That
alone is a big deal.''

   Amid renewed pressure in the airline industry to consolidate,
British Airways has had informal merger talks with KLM Royal Dutch

   Many traditional retailers have vowed that by integrating their
Web operations into their physical stores, they will eventually
bury Internet-only merchants. But even as these companies preach
the gospel of Internet integration to the public, some of the
best-known merchants are telling government regulators that their
Internet and physical-world operations are distinct and separate
businesses _ and therefore should enjoy the tax advantages of
maintaining separate operations.

   On Tuesday, for the first time ever, a movie will be digitally
transmitted across the country over the Internet and then digitally
projected to a cinema audience, going from the studio in Hollywood
to a theater in Atlanta without ever touching film. The idea is to
demonstrate the potential of digital distribution _ which many
think will one day supplant traditional canisters of celluloid.

BRITISH AIR AND KLM SAID TO BE IN EARLY MERGER DISCUSSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Amid renewed pressure in the airline industry to
consolidate, British Airways has held informal merger discussions
with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, executives close to both companies
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While the executives emphasized that the discussions are in the
most preliminary stage _ one executive called them talks about
talks _ it underscores a sense of urgency among airline operators
to seek partners, in the hope of increasing profit in an industry
where many companies, particularly in Europe, have seen margins
erode.
</P>
<P>
   The informal discussions take place amid the proposed
acquisition of US Airways by UAL, parent of United Airlines, for
$4.3 billion and overtures from AMR, American Airlines' parent, to
Northwest Airlines about combining their businesses. Those talks
have adjourned, executives said. Northwest has made it clear that
it would expect a high price, with the value of the UAL-US Airways
deal as a starting point. The initial offer by AMR, which is said
to be considering its next move, was considered too low.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the state of discussions, the airline industry is on
the verge of more consolidation, analysts say, as a few big
carriers move to get still bigger, carving out big chunks of the
flight routes.
</P>
<P>
   Already, airlines in the United States and Europe have entered
into a hodgepodge of alliances that allow passengers to book
flights on member airlines and share frequent-flier programs. In
fact, if British Airways were to merge with KLM, it would put
several alliances into question. British Airways is a member of the
Oneworld alliance with American, and KLM has an alliance with
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways tried to merge many of its functions with
American in 1996, but regulators have blocked the proposed deal.
KLM broke off its alliance with Alitalia in April. If British
Airways were to merge with KLM, it might also take on KLM's
alliance with Northwest. However, some analysts think that the
combined company's relationship with Northwest would have to be
severed to gain regulatory approval because the group would control
too many trans-Atlantic flights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts think that a deal between British Airways
and KLM would gain approval from regulators. British Airways has
reported poor financial results in recent periods, with its 1999
earnings the worst since the airline was privatized. ``We believe
British Airlines accepts that its European operations will destroy
shareholder value until, and unless, European consolidation
happens,'' Peter Hyde, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston,
wrote in a note to investors.
</P>
<P>
   European airlines that rely on traffic on the Continent have
been especially hard hit. Low-cost carriers, mimicking the success
of Southwest Airlines in the United States, have forced down profit
margins, undercutting intercity prices by the big carriers that
have run markedly higher than on similar-length routes in the
United States. Hoping to avoid being left out of the low-cost
segment, British Airways and KLM have created their own low-cost
carriers. British Air spawned an airline called Go, and KLM created
a discount carrier called Buzz.

AT CROSSROADS, CNN RETHINKS ITS APPROACH TO THE NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CNN celebrated its 20th anniversary in Atlanta on Thursday night
with fireworks and video clips of the news organization's proudest
moments: the Persian Gulf War, the Space Shuttle Challenger
disaster, the Olympic Park bombing in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But another scene perhaps better reflected the current mood at
the CNN Center: reporters chasing the network's founder, Ted
Turner, through hallways, up escalators and even into a public
bathroom as he tried to avoid their questions.
</P>
<P>
   That Turner was avoiding journalists on one of his proudest
days, the celebration of a major milestone for his news network,
underscored the many uncertainties facing CNN as it reaches young
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its accomplishments, CNN is currently garnering its
lowest monthly ratings in nine years, a fact that has prompted its
top executives to reevaluate the way the network approaches news.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, CNN is expected to come under the ownership of
a new company this fall, when its parent corporation, Time Warner,
is scheduled to merge officially with America Online. Anticipation
of that merger is creating both anxiety and hope among CNN
executives.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it is believed that AOL, the largest Internet
service provider, with 22 million subscribers, can help bring CNN
back to a dominant position among news organizations. On the other,
the new company will have a new management structure and, possibly,
new ideas about how to do things, especially when ratings are low.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite all declarations of harmony at the anniversary
celebration, one fact is inescapable: Under the new company's flow
chart, Turner, CNN's most ardent protector and champion, will still
hold the title of vice chairman and senior adviser _ but he will no
longer have direct operating control of the cable properties he
amassed over three decades. That role would go to AOL's president,
Robert W. Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before the festivities in Atlanta began, The Los
Angeles Times reported that Turner, Time Warner's largest
individual stock holder _ who will own 4 percent of AOL-Time Warner
_ was displeased about his new role and associates were warning
that he could disrupt the merger. That threat was emerging just as
the companies were sending voting materials to their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Executives within the two companies confirmed last week that
Turner was angry, but not necessarily so much about his new role.
Rather, they said, he felt he was not properly consulted as the
flow chart was drafted and was caught off guard upon its release a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   With all of this in mind, Steve Case, the AOL chairman, and
Gerald M. Levin, the Time Warner chairman, went out of their way to
declare publicly last week that Turner would play a large role in
the new company and in CNN.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, Turner had apparently changed his tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy _ I'm happy!,'' he told a reporter. He added, ``You can
be unhappy one week and happy another one, right?'' Then three
public relations executives approached and the conversation ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given these apparent corporate mood swings, it should
come as no surprise that top executives at CNN are an uneasy lot
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there is change, there is uncertainty and anxiety,''
said Tom Johnson, the CNN chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said his most fundamental concern was whether AOL would
try to meddle with the network's journalism. He said CNN executives
had similar concerns in 1996, when Time Warner merged with Turner
Broadcasting. Time Warner, however, took the same hands-off
approach that Turner did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very, very smooth transition because journalism is at
the core of Time Warner,'' Johnson said, referring to its
publications like Time. ``And up until this most recent
announcement, we have really felt quite confident about the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he and others have received reassurances on two key
issues from Case and Pittman: that AOL will not pressure CNN to
pursue racier, tabloid stories and production values that might do
better in the ratings than the standard international and political
news, and that it will allow CNN to cover the news impartially
regardless of its affiliation to AOL. On the bright side, CNN is
hoping for the exposure that AOL can give it.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the wake of the recent ratings declines, Johnson said
there had even been discussions inside CNN about changing editorial
direction.
</P>
<P>
   CNN has been consistently dogged by one major problem that is
almost inherent to its mission: Viewers will go to it in droves
when major news breaks, but tend to go elsewhere when the news
cycle is slow. With an average of 225,000 households tuning in each
day in May, CNN's ratings are down 33 percent compared with those
of May 1999 and are at their lowest monthly level since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The network also is facing new competition from cable news
competitors like the Fox News Channel, which is growing
considerably, and NBC's offerings, MSNBC and CNBC.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The ratings situation is said to be, at times, of pressing
concern to Turner. Johnson said that Turner was extremely concerned
in midwinter, when CNBC's early evening business show, ``Business
Center,'' for the first time beat CNN's ``Moneyline'' in the
monthly ratings. Turner then began conversations with Lou Dobbs,
the former ``Moneyline'' anchor and CNNfn president who is well
respected by Wall Street but left CNN last year in a messy public
scene when Time Warner executives tried to limit his ownership of
space.com, the space Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted was disappointed,'' Johnson said. ``Ted wanted to bring
Lou back and he initiated conversations with Lou, first by phone
and then in person.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs left CNN last June amid boiling tensions with CNN's U.S.
president, Rick Kaplan, that made any collaboration between the two
difficult, if not impossible, and it was believed within the
organization that his return would bring those tensions to the
surface once again. Johnson said that he vehemently opposed the
move, but that he did so on the grounds that Dobbs would still have
an ownership stake in space.com, hindering his impartiality as a
journalist. The idea was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Of that move, Turner would only say in an interview, ``That was
a long time ago.'' And, he said of the current ratings situation:
``I'm not the kind to panic. It's not so precarious as when we
started,'' a reference to the earliest days at CNN when on-air
personalities had to contend with dropping ceiling panels, low-rent
equipment and absolutely negligible ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reassurances he has received from AOL, Johnson said
concern was high enough within CNN that debate continued about
whether to produce sexier programming. But, Johnson said, he and
other executives concluded that the organization should resist such
temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Case said he agreed, and that he was not concerned by the
current ratings. ``I think some of these things are cyclical,'' he
said. He and Levin said that Johnson and Kaplan would continue to
have their full support in their positions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, CNN executives said that the strategy was to bolster
the news network's international coverage with more foreign
bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   But, most important, they said, they hope to strengthen CNN's
overall presence by promoting it well on the AOL Internet and
interactive TV services and by making it more available on wireless
devices. Specific plans, they said, are in embryonic stages, but,
ultimately it is their intention to make CNN's headlines available
anywhere at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said he believes that sort of ubiquity in distribution
would make the current concerns about ratings seem quaint. In
anticipation, Turner advertising sales executives have held
discussions with Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings
service, about broadening the way it will measure CNN's audience to
account for viewers who may get its headlines on their cellular
phones and computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to have a broader view at AOL-Time Warner
about what advertising really means,'' Levin said, adding that
CNN's advertising revenues are up considerably despite ratings
declines.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of broad advertising sales approach is a main reason
why, executives said, Turner's operational duties are being taken
over by Pittman, the AOL executive who is to oversee all pay
services of AOL-Time Warner. The task will demand close attention
to the merging of old and new media, two areas where Pittman, a
founder of Viacom's MTV, has considerable experience.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that Turner would exert as much influence as ever.
``It doesn't make any difference what our prosaic reporting lines
are,'' he said. ``What really matters is that he is there and that
he is a transcendent figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with the merger pending, and Turner's prior
displeasure now out in the open, it is in the interest of top AOL
and Time Warner executives to avoid controversy and keep Turner's
spirits up.
</P>
<P>
   That could explain why, in the minutes leading up to their big
celebration on Thursday night in Turner's Philips Arena, CNN
assigned a publicity executive to each reporter covering the event
for other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out that they really did not have much to fear.
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter approached him at one point, Turner grabbed Case
by the neck and pulled him close. ``See: I'm happy!'' he said.

cracks in the ceiling. The walls lack insulation. Weeds poke their

attention, poised to snap at furry intruders who dare cross the
line. And in the center of it all sits a priceless collection of 2
million Native American artifacts, some dating back as far as 400
A.D.''We don't meet legal requirements for maintaining a federal
museum collection,'' says curator Carolyn Landes. ``We are not
alone in that. You go to any underfunded park and you will find the
same situation.'' The warehouse, which is the size of an airplane
hangar, is hidden among yucca plants, juniper shrubs and pinyon
pines in southwestern Colorado. As a security precaution, the exact

   NEW YORK _ Sometimes the most engrossing television is also the
hardest to watch, and that is certainly the case with
``Well-Founded Fear,'' which opens a new season of the ``POV''
series on PBS Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour documentary by Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini
takes an amazingly unflinching look at the process for seeking
political asylum in the United States. The viewer who sticks with
it ends up rewarded but deeply rattled, on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers managed to get permission from the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to record the secretive hearings at
which the fates of asylum seekers are decided, and they have
fleshed out those vignettes with interviews of both the applicants
and the hearing officers. The mix of emotions at play is dramatic.
The strength of this film is that it is largely left to speak for
itself, and that requires work on the viewer's part.
</P>
<P>
   From a sheer technical standpoint the film is not one that can
be watched casually, while paying the bills or whatever. It jumps
abruptly from case to case, and when the asylum seekers talk, there
are subtitles (to show the often alarming contrast between what
they said and what the translators tell the hearing officers they
said).
</P>
<P>
   But what truly makes this a difficult film is the discomfort and
dismay it makes the viewer feel. Hearing the asylum seekers' tales
of woe is only one part of this, though a big part. Throw a dart at
a map of the world, it seems, and there is an excellent chance of
hitting a spot where people are arrested, persecuted, abused for
scant reason: Algeria, Romania, China, Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans take everything for granted,'' one asylum seeker
says. ``They have no clue what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   This is wrong, of course; Americans know full well the beauty of
the freedoms they enjoy. But even the most attuned American will be
distressed anew at this stark reminder of how so many others live.
</P>
<P>
   The most gripping part of ``Well-Founded Fear,'' though, is not
the tales of the applicants but the portraits of those who have to
decide whether those stories are true and whether they merit
asylum. The hearing officers here speak with rare candor. They know
how imperfect, almost random, the process is, and how their own
prejudices affect it.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about how they are more likely to approve an applicant
who is well educated, about how they sometimes have to resist the
impulse to hug the person across the table. They talk about how
when they started on the job all of the stories sounded true, but
now none do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well-Founded Fear'' leaves us wanting to know more about these
heroic and, it sometimes seems, heartless people: How are they
recruited and trained? How do they adjust to drab domestic life
after such a wrenching day? It also leaves us wondering about the
asylum process: what finally lands applicants in the hearing
office, when some have been living comfortably in this country for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, this film leaves us sighing at the great
disconnect that we see so often between high ideals and one-on-one
reality. The ideal of dignified care for the terminally ill comes
down to finding people willing to change bedpans. The ideal of
feeding the hungry comes down to people willing to work soup lines.
The ideal of having the United States be a place of refuge comes
down to a snap judgment in a hearing room, based on fuzzy stories
told across a language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stay fuzzy forever,'' one hearing officer says, ``and we
still have to make a decision based on fuzziness.''

   &UR; WHAT BABA WAWA LEARNED FROM THE LINDBERGH CASE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The tricks of TV journalists, soulfully gazing into the cameras
whether they're questioning heads of state or flattering megawatt
celebrities, are based on lessons 70 years old, says a new
documentary, ``Legacy of a Kidnapping: Lindbergh and the Triumph of
the Tabloids.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, written and narrated by Harper's editor  &UR; Lewis &LR; 
 &UR; Lapham &LR; , will be broadcast on a PBS station in Long Island on
Monday. The New York Observer describes its claims that ``squeamish
and sensitive anchorpersons''  &UR; Peter Jennings &LR; ,  &UR; Diane &LR; 
 &UR; Sawyer &LR;  and  &UR; Barbara Walters &LR;  are ``the well-groomed stepchildren
of tabloid journalism godfather  &UR; William Randolph Hearst &LR; ,'' the
heirs of  &UR; Damon Runyon &LR; ,  &UR; Walter Winchell &LR;  and  &UR; Adela Rogers St. &LR; 
 &UR; John &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The voices of the people covering the kidnapping trial of
 &UR; Bruno Hauptmann &LR;  were ``not unlike'' those of Jennings and Walters
after the death of  &UR; Princess Diana &LR; , says Lapham, ``who
periodically interrupted their sucking on the bones of wonderful,
wonderful Diana to rebuke with an air of condescension and disgust
those awful paparazzi.'' The ``Sob Sisters'' Hearst assigned to
follow Hauptmann's wife during his trial were ``as skilled as Diane
Sawyer in the application of false sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapham decided to focus on ABC's stars after watching the Di
coverage. ``They were really unctuous to a degree that's hard to
imagine. ... I could have just as easily used  &UR; Dan Rather &LR;  or  &UR; Tom &LR; 
 &UR; Brokaw &LR;  or someone from CNN. I think the networks are all the
same.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Old clothes should now only be worn by young people, and young
clothes (skinny trousers, bat sleeves, boyish suits, slinky
dresses) will look best on the not-so-young. ... It means not
dressing your age _ unless you happen to be 35. ... It's this
obsession with median adulthood, with possessing the glamour and
power of a woman with a past and a future, that drives the new
bourgeois chic (among the young) and, conversely, the new
spunkiness (among the older crowd).''
</P>
<P>
   -  &LR;   &LR; Got that? Vogue recommends trying to be young if you're
old, and old if you're young. And if you're 35, just sit there.

<P>
   `MILLIONAIRE' WILL FACE `SURVIVOR,' AGAIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There will be a Round 2, after all.
</P>
<P>
   After uncertainty about the possible consequences, ABC will
again pit the hottest show of the television season, ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire,'' against CBS's much discussed and highly
promising newcomer ``Survivor'' on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Against all expectations, CBS scored a coup last week when
``Survivor,'' its summer series about social interaction and
survival skills on a remote island, did some real damage to
``Millionaire,'' ABC's most valuable property. In a stealth move,
ABC had scheduled ``Millionaire'' on that Wednesday night just to
derail the new series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' did remarkably well with young viewers, the
audience ABC usually courts. ``Millionaire,'' which was already
being denigrated by some competitors for starting to skew old in
its appeal, looked extremely top-heavy with older viewers when
matched against ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly not the message ABC wants to send this summer
just before it moves from a three night-a-week to a four-night
schedule of ``Millionaire'' in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   If ABC had wanted to avoid making a decision about a second
showdown with ``Survivor,'' it got no help from the New Jersey
Devils. Only a sweep in the Stanley Cup hockey finals, being
carried by ABC in prime time, would have eliminated the need for
ABC to think about having Regis Philbin square off again against
those folks dodging rats and snakes on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils lost Game 2 to the Dallas Stars, and ABC knew the
hockey series would last at least five games, pre-empting this
Thursday's showing of ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   With an extra ``Millionaire'' on its hands, ABC could have
chosen to play it on Wednesday at 8 to challenge the second episode
of ``Survivor'' _ or it could have slid it to the safety of, say,
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But after weighing the risks involved if ``Millionaire'' fared
even worse this week against ``Survivor,'' ABC still opted to meet
the new enemy head on again.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago it was CBS that was most concerned about the outcome;
now the pressure has shifted to ABC. As an executive at a competing
network noted, any drop in the powerhouse status of ``Millionaire''
could have serious financial implications for ABC, which has
charged advertisers huge prices for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives profess no more concern about the future of
``Millionaire'' than they did before ``Survivor'' arrived. At least
one interested party expressed nothing but warmth for the new
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Burnett, the executive producer of ``Survivor,'' said he
received one especially welcome call amid many of congratulations.
Michael Davies, the executive producer of ``Millionaire'' called to
say, as Burnett put it, ``welcome to the hit club.''
</P>

   A DEATH IS NOTED IN THE META-MEDIA FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   In the expanding world of meta-media (translation: journalists
writing about journalists) the Web site NewsWatch.org has been a
relatively tiny boutique.
</P>
<P>
   Its offerings were limited, tailored to those interested in what
was written, not who was doing the writing. Last week, it became
the first casualty among the current generation of meta-media
sites, as its one financial backer backed off.
</P>
<P>
   As Paul Mongerson, a former engineer and executive who
originally offered $1 million to underwrite the site, explained on
Friday, his original idea was to point out examples of distortion
by the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't to educate people or philosophize,'' he said. ``It
was to say, `This is what is said, and it's not the case.' The
purpose was to bring ordinary news consumers into the debate over
media distortion that currently takes place among elites.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, he said, the audience of about 25,000 unique
visitors each month turned out to be not the news consumers that
Mongerson had put up $1 million to reach, but the same old elites.
You know, the ones who hop from Jim Romenesko's MediaNews site
(www.poynter.org/medianews/index.cfm) to Kurt Andersen's Inside.com
to the Online Journalism Review ojr.usc.edu _ all sites that were
quick to note the death in the neighborhood last week.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Butterworth, the editor of the two-year-old site, said
the decision came as a shock when he heard about it last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought our success in creating an audience and winning
plaudits on a minor scale,'' he said, was something Mongerson would
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he had a different vision,'' Butterworth added, ``and what
we managed to do did not please him so he pulled the plug.''
</P>
<P>
   S. Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs, the organization that runs NewsWatch, said on Friday that
he had some hope of finding new financing. But when he spoke of the
site, it was in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed what you can do as a mom-and-pop organization,'' he
said, ``but we also showed the limits of that.'' &QL;
</P>

   PUBLISHING EXECUTIVE TO BE NAMED
</P>
<P>
   American Express Publishing is expected to announce Monday that
its new president and chief executive will be Ed Kelly, the
publisher of the company's Travel &AMP; Leisure group.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, whose group publishes Travel &AMP; Leisure and its spinoffs,
T&AMP;L Golf and Travel &AMP; Leisure Family, will succeed Daniel B.
Brewster, who resigned two weeks ago to become the chief executive
of Gruner &AMP; Jahr, a unit of Bertelsmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   American Express Publishing, which is a partnership between the
Time Inc. unit of Time Warner and the American Express Co.,
publishes four consumer magazines, including Food &AMP; Wine and Travel
&AMP; Leisure and specialty publications for American Express
customers, like Departures magazine. &QL;

THE NEW ECONOMY: NOT ALL TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITIONS SUCCESSFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In no sector of the technology business have more companies with
less revenue been acquired for richer sums than in communications
equipment. It is almost routine for obscure start-ups with little
or no revenue to be acquired for hundreds of millions, or even
billions, of dollars in stock by industry giants unable to keep up
with all the changes in communications technology.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, for instance, Lucent Technologies Inc. agreed to
pay $4.5 billion in stock for Chromatis Networks, which is
developing technology to enhance the capacity and capabilities of
fiber optic networks within cities.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, many of these deals look good for everyone, and
they often are. The buyers can move into new areas. The
entrepreneurs become rich, as do the venture capitalists who buy
into the target company. But not every deal can be a success, and
as the pace of acquisitions grows, so may the number of bad deals _
like the examples below, all of which offer lessons on the risks of
the get-bigger-by-buying strategy.
</P>
<P>
   CIENA-OMNIA, $429 MILLION, MARCH '99: Ciena Corp. is a leader in
optical communications equipment. But when Ciena agreed to buy
Omnia Communications Inc. last spring, it was trying to move into a
new market: data networking. Omnia was developing products using a
technology called asynchronous transfer mode, which uses optical
networks but is not itself an optical system.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Omnia has generated essentially zero revenue for Ciena,
and few analysts foresee any such revenue any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena says that customers simply do not want to buy Omnia's sort
of product. That means either that Ciena badly misgauged the market
or that its sales force, tailored to optical gear, has not figured
out how to sell Omnia's technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect significant revenue this year from that
product, so that's a disappointment to us,'' said Denny Bilter, a
Ciena spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Be careful when expanding beyond your core market and
make sure your sales force can distribute the new product.
</P>
<P>
   SIEMENS-ARGON, $240 MILLION, MARCH '99: When Siemens of Germany
decided to become serious about data networking last year, it
bought three start-ups in the United States _ Redstone
Communications Inc., Castle Networks Inc. and Argon Networks Inc. _
and put them into a new division called Unisphere. Redstone, which
makes gear that pools data traffic at the edge of big networks, has
been a big success. Castle, which wants to develop the
next-generation of voice telephone switches, seems to be making
headway. And then there is Argon.
</P>
<P>
   When Siemens agreed to acquire it, Argon wanted to make an
ultrahigh-capacity switch for the core of big networks using both
asynchronous transfer mode and Internet protocol formats. That was
pretty much the last anyone heard about Argon.
</P>
<P>
   One problem was that Argon's technology did not mesh smoothly
with Redstone's. Unisphere is trying to work out the kinks.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens might be faulted for not recognizing this problem before
spending hundreds of millions of its shareholders' dollars on
Argon. But at the time, other European communications giants like
Alcatel and Ericsson were rushing into the data communications
market, and Siemens apparently did not want to be left behind.
Unisphere executives declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Even if the competition is making noise, take the time
to do technical due diligence research. Moving recklessly can cost
a lot of time and money later.
</P>
<P>
   TELLABS-NETCORE, $575 MILLION, JUNE '99: In a move somewhat
similar to the Ciena-Omnia deal, Tellabs Inc., a leader in optical
transmission, tried to move into a new market by acquiring NetCore
Systems Inc., a company that wanted to build high-capacity routers
using asynchronous transfer mode and Internet protocol formats for
the core of big networks.
</P>
<P>
   But NetCore's technology did not work as well as Tellabs had
anticipated, and it is not clear when the deal may start paying
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``In NetCore's case you have a combination of a
less-than-elegant integration of the company into Tellabs, probably
a product that was not as mature as Tellabs' management thought it
was, and a marketplace that got pretty competitive,'' said Steven
D. Levy, chief communications equipment analyst for Lehman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors judge older companies like Tellabs mainly on the
growth of their per-share earnings. With a market value of only $27
billion, Tellabs cannot throw its stock around as aggressively as
bigger companies can, without risking dilution of its earnings.
That has led some experts to believe that Tellabs is simply afraid
to pony up the money necessary to acquire private companies with
the best technology. Tellabs declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Be careful expanding into new markets but also remember
that spending too little may yield little in results.
</P>
<P>
   CISCO-MONTEREY, $500 MILLION, AUGUST '99: Cisco Systems Inc.'s
acquisition of Monterey Networks Inc., which makes gear that links
optical communications networks at high speeds, appears set to
become much more successful than the Omnia, Argon and NetCore
deals. But it is not a home run just yet.
</P>
<P>
   And home runs, or at least doubles, are what the market has come
to expect from Cisco, almost surely the most successful corporate
acquirer in the past decade. On the day the Monterey deal was
announced, Cisco also said it was buying Cerent, a different sort
of optical networking company, for about $6.9 billion. That deal
has definitely been a home run: Cerent may well generate $1 billion
in revenue for Cisco this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Monterey deal has just about fallen off the radar
screen. People close to Cisco have said the company's original
internal target of moving Monterey's products into the market this
spring was a result of unwarranted optimism within the Monterey
team.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco still has not announced any sales of Monterey's systems,
though people close to the company said last week that they
expected announcements of some tests with major communications
carriers shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: Even acquisition champs like Cisco can have an off day.
That is one reason Cisco, using a portfolio approach, does so many
deals.
</P>
<P>
   LUCENT-NEXABIT, $900 MILLION, JUNE '99:
</P>
<P>
   In this deal, Lucent did not seem to get what it thought it was
buying. But at least it got something of value, and even the
original vision may finally be coming into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Nexabit Networks Inc. was supposed to catapult Lucent to
immediate leadership in the market for ultrahigh-capacity Internet
routers, devices that help direct data traffic. According to many
communications experts, it turns out that Nexabit's technology is
actually better-suited for transmitting information in a format
known as frame relay rather than the conventional Internet protocol
format.
</P>
<P>
   The Nexabit deal could still work. This week, Lucent plans to
announce that VCities, a small communications carrier based in
Dallas, has agreed to buy the Internet protocol version of the
Nexabit product.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson: The lesson from Lucent and all these companies is that
nothing can replace thorough research before a deal and
nose-to-the-grindstone execution afterward. With the pace of
acquisitions accelerating, it is only getting easier to make bad
deals.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's secret service has tightened security
around Prime Minister Ehud Barak, news reports say, as some Jewish
settlers warn that the domestic climate could turn ugly and violent
quickly if the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks move forward.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm bells began ringing here last week, when the leader of
a young, radical settlers' group issued a disturbing assessment of
the feelings in his community, which were aroused by the prospect
that some settlers would be evacuated as the result of a peace
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, when I see Barak's plans and I hear the voices around
me,'' said Shimon Riklin, leader of the Next Generation settlers'
organization, ``I say that if, God forbid, he carries out this
dangerous plan, his days could be numbered.''
</P>
<P>
   To Israelis, who are only now coming to grips with the traumatic
assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, this kind of
language is profoundly unsettling. The country is in a far
different place now, having absorbed the initial shock of what
concessions the peace effort entails and the aftershocks of Rabin's
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   But among the political leadership and the security
establishment, the fear of being caught unawares or unprepared _
much less of reliving such a trauma _ is strong. So as the threats
continued over the weekend with more inflammatory statements by an
extremist settler and two rabbis, Barak's close associates seemed
eager to take them at their word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear friends, there will be a murder,'' Benjamin Ben-Eliezer,
the communications minister, said Sunday on Israeli radio. ``I am
warning the security services and everyone: Don't put your heads in
the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The director-general of the Settlers Council, the umbrella
organization that has a relatively moderate leadership, said Sunday
he did not believe that Barak faced any danger from his community.
The organization repeatedly on Sunday condemned the use of
violence, although it declined to condemn any of the statements
that others considered inflammatory.
</P>
<P>
   And the Settlers Council's spokesman, Yeshoshua Mor Yosef, even
said in an interview that he thought the prime minister's bureau
was fabricating information about supposed threats on Barak's life
in order to manipulate public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an evening newscast cited unidentified
security sources as saying it would be impossible to tighten
security around the prime minister since his security was already
supposedly airtight. Barak's office would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   After Barak addressed the issue of incitement during his
closed-door Cabinet meeting, his bureau made some of his remarks
public. As he habitually does, he expressed deep respect for ``the
settlement enterprise,'' which has sought over several decades to
reclaim the West Bank from the Palestinians, seeing it as the
biblical Land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But the prime minister also delivered a warning of his own
against any attempt to use violence, or the threat of violence, to
derail his peacemaking plans _ which he sees as a continuation of
the work of his mentor, Rabin. It is futile, he said, to try to
block a ``historical process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The murder of Yitzhak Rabin was a human and national tragedy,
but it could not stop the peace process,'' Barak told his Cabinet,
a statement released by his office said. ``This is a flawed grasp
of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The repercussions of any political assassination would
boomerang against those fighting for the Greater Land of Israel,''
he said. ``If there is anything that deviates from the legitimacy
of the settlers' struggle, it is acts such as these.''
</P>
<P>
   Yigal Amir, an ultranationalist Jew who was convicted of
murdering Rabin, said he had acted to thwart plans to transfer land
to the Palestinians. The assassination took place against the
backdrop of increasingly vicious personal attacks on Rabin, and
many here believe that an atmosphere of incitement, including some
by rabbis, encouraged Amir and other extremists.
</P>
<P>
   As the settlers' movement gears up to battle Barak, some here
worry that protest rallies could once again get out of hand as
verbal hostility increases. A settler rabbi, for instance,
published an article this weekend accusing the government of
``treason'' and ``crimes against the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   As if transported back in time, many Israelis rushed to say what
some wished they had said five years ago. Among them was Carmi
Gilon, who was director of the General Security Services at the
time of the assassination and resigned afterward. In an interview
on Israeli radio, he said, ``It behooves the rabbis to understand
the weight of responsibility they bear and to be cautious in their
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, David Levy, the foreign minister, said:
``Rabbis, I call to you, be careful with your words. You are
spiritual leaders, and dangerous expressions could, God forbid,
bring about another blow that we won't be able to withstand.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The secret service also has stepped up its monitoring of extreme
right-wing organizations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   To many Palestinian officials, the idea of such anxiety rippling
through Israel seems a bit premature. Although President Clinton
sounded a note of optimism last week when he said a peace accord
was ``within view,'' Palestinian and Israeli officials have been
exchanging barbs about what they call each other's recalcitrance,
and both sides say the talks on substantive issues are at an early
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, on Sunday
described the talks as ``in crisis,'' although this is something he
often says, reflecting his long frustration with the effort.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak continued to break character and to criticize the
Palestinians publicly, as he did last week for the first time. He
described the way they are conducting themselves in the talks as
``a regression.'' With a September deadline for a final accord
looming, he said the Palestinians were postponing discussions ``on
various pretexts'' and generally dragging their feet. The
Palestinians issued the same charge in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, briefly sparred
Sunday on the contentious issue of Jerusalem. Barak said he had
instructed his negotiators to put the subject aside for the moment,
while Arafat angrily retorted that Jerusalem must be on the table,
``and whoever doesn't like it can go drink from the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are pushing for the next land transfer, which
is supposed to take place this month. Associates of Arafat say he
is determined to obtain as much land as possible from the Israelis
in case the negotiations break down; that land will be the sole
basis for a Palestinian state if he unilaterally declares one in
September, as he has warned that he will do if talks do not
progress.
</P>
<P>
   But in Israel, as opposed to the Palestinian side, where there
is far deeper skepticism, the general presumption is that the peace
talks are marching forward. Thus the settlers' anxiety is
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Friday to his Labor Party, Barak said he aspired
to keep 80 percent of the settlers under Israeli sovereignty in the
``final status'' accord. He declared that this would be an
``unusual historic achievement'' and that the settler movement
would have achieved its goal of permanence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak urges us to see the cup as half full,'' Shimon Shiffer
wrote Sunday morning in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlers were not buying it.

AMERICAN BALLET'S `LE CORSAIRE' PLEASING ROMP WITH PIRATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yes, the plot is nutty. And yes, the music thumps
along with absolutely no subtlety. But when American Ballet Theater
presented ``Le Corsaire'' on Saturday afternoon at the Metropolitan
Opera House, that swashbuckling 19th-century Russian story ballet
kept a theater full of children entranced and had the adult
balletomanes among them cheering. And that is no small feat.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to see ``Le Corsaire,'' which Ballet Theater will
perform again Monday night, is to go with the flow and not allow
oneself to get lost in the crowds of fierce pirates and nubile
slave women and other local color at the Turkish bazaar, gardens
and pirate cave where much of the action takes place. What is
important about the production, based on versions by Marius Petipa
and Konstantin Sergeyev and staged for Ballet Theater by Anna-Marie
Holmes, is the opportunities it offers for unabashedly lovely and
pyrotechnical dancing that, for once, grows out of, and furthers,
the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Jaffe and Jose Manuel Carreno epitomized the contrasting
delicacy and prowling sensuality that make the ballet's most famous
excerpt, the ``Corsair Pas de Deux,'' more than just ballet
razzle-dazzle danced by two lead characters, Medora and the slave
Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo Gomes' pirate Conrad, a role debut, was a man of simple
passions communicated through easy, expansive classical dancing
that contrasted enjoyably with the terrier-like intensity and
whirligig travel of Joaquin De Luz, an endearingly villainous
Birbanto. The clarity and amplitude of Maxim Belotserkovsky's
dancing, a high point of the afternoon, made the slave dealer
Lankendem unusually likable.
</P>
<P>
   Ekaterina Shelkanova, new as Gulnare, hovered between tragedy
and mischief in an unsubtly danced performance. Ethan Brown was a
charming Pasha, whose dream of an animated garden leads to one of
the ballet's most exquisite sequences. That kind of beauty was also
communicated in the dancing of Yan Chen, Michele Wiles and Anna
Liceica in the Odalisque trio.
</P>
<P>
   The lead cast was completed by Eleena Melamed as the do-or-die
head pirate woman and Carlos Molina as the Pasha's sweetly bumbling
sidekick. Ermanno Florio conducted the score, a stew of music by
Drigo, Delibes and three other composers.

ODD FLOCK OF MEXICAN PARROTS SETTLE IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Just as the blazing afternoon sun softens
and begins to set, the parrots start to arrive, squawking and
keening as they wheel high overhead in the blue sky and drop into
the upper fronds of palm trees growing along the Rio Grande River.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do that every night,'' says Jessie Moreno, a cashier at
the Fort Brown Hotel, who likes to watch the birds roosting on the
hotel grounds. ``They come swooping back here when it starts to get
dark and spend the night up in those palm trees. In the morning
they'll take off again and fly out over the city looking for
food.''
</P>
<P>
   The birds call to each other as they dart from tree to tree,
brightly colored slashes of green, yellow and blue, and when a
truck backfires nearby they howl and take to the air as one,
screaming wildly as they swirl overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' Moreno says, ``they'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   But the flock of parrots, more than 300 of a species known
scientifically as Amazona viridigenalis, are not really supposed to
be here in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Wild parrots in an urban environment like this dusty, bustling
border city seem unusual enough, but this flock is also odd for
other reasons, local experts say.
</P>
<P>
   They are at least a hundred miles from their typical roosting
grounds deep in Mexico, and a third of the parrots are birds
released by or escaped from smugglers trying to slip them illegally
into the country, said Steve Walker, a staff member at the
University of Texas at Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said a devastating freeze in 1982, coinciding with an
agrarian overhaul that deforested large sections of Northern
Mexico, combined to draw the birds into the Brownsville area.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that freeze we started seeing large numbers of
free-range parrots here,'' Walker said. ``Our conjecture is that a
flock of old veterans, who had made the trip before, decided to
come up out of Mexico into this area to forage. These birds can
live to be 60 to 70 years old and sometimes longer than that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is anecdotal evidence from old military diaries, Walker
said, of sightings of parrots even farther north, along the Nueces
River area, at a time when Gen. Zackery Taylor's troops were
quartered there in the Mexican War in 1847.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was in November, in the pecan season, and these parrots
just love pecans,'' he said. ``So they must have flown at least 200
miles even further north to look for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brownsville flock now contains more than 160 nesting pairs
of three types of parrots: yellow-cheek parrots, also known as
red-lored, red-crowned parrots, and, the most colorful of the local
flock, yellow-head parrots, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think most, if not all, of the yellow-heads are escaped or
released birds,'' he said. ``But the red-crowns have just wandered
into the area to feed and ended up staying.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the escaped or released birds would have been trapped
along the Rio Corona or Rio Soto La Marina in southern Tamaulipas,
Mexico, Walker said, and the red-crowned parrots would have come
from still further south. It is illegal to bring any of the parrots
into the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that some members of the flock still have their
wings clipped as a bird smuggler would do; those are released or
escaped birds,'' Walker said, adding that they were easy to spot:
``They have to beat their wings twice as fast to go half as far.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who became interested in the birds when he hosted a
local wildlife show on television, says the birds eat palm dates,
citrus from the vast commercial groves that surround Brownsville,
and mosquitoes that swarm over the city's many ``resacas,'' a kind
of catchment pond for rain.
</P>
<P>
   Up until two years ago, there was a Catch-22 in protecting
parrots from hunters or trappers, says Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't supposed to be here so they weren't really
covered by state laws,'' he said. But Walker and other local
wildlife enthusiasts worked with the Texas Birding Association to
have the local parrots designated as a native population in 1998,
making them a protected species.
</P>
<P>
   Walker also led a successful effort to have the parrot
designated as the official city bird of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are monogamous for life, keep their families together
for a long time, and have what Walker calls `shared intelligence.'
``That means they like to talk to each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The parrots are also amazingly adaptive creatures, Walker said.
The same freeze that drew the birds here in the early 1980s killed
many local palm trees, and the rotted trunks make perfect homes for
the parrots.
</P>
<P>
   To build their nests, the parrots find holes made by woodpeckers
seeking insects in bark. The parrots then patiently peck and claw
at the woodpecker holes until they have made a large enough cavity
for nesting.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the hotel grounds, Moreno slapped the base of one of
those palm trees with bare her hand several times and two small
yellow parrot heads popped inquisitively from a hole halfway up the
tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two have a nest in there, so we'll be seeing some more
babies soon,'' she said.

   TRADE SHOWS SUFFER
</P>
<P>
   The shakeout and consolidation that is sweeping Internet
retailing has reached a related industry: Internet retailing trade
shows.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of layoffs, closings and executive layoffs at
Internet retailers, the publisher and show organizer, Faulkner &AMP;
Gray, has canceled its Internet Retailer World 2000 conference,
which was scheduled later this month in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt T. Peters, a group publisher at Faulkner &AMP; Gray, said that
Web trade shows were under the same pressures as Web retailers.
More narrowly focused shows, like automobile e-commerce
conferences, are now in favor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the normal shakeout and consolidation you see in
any industry,'' Peters said. ``It's just happening faster on the
Internet because everything happens faster on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters said registration was still strong for another show,
Electronic Commerce World 2000, which his firm was planning for
October in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In another bad omen, the Internet Retailer World 2000 show had
also planned to feature some companies that are now in deep trouble
_ or out of business. ToySmart, the defunct Disney-backed toy Web
retailer, had agreed to send its chief e-commerce officer, Mark
Reese, to the show as a speaker. Executives from the struggling
companies CDNow and Skymall.com, were among other officials who had
originally agreed to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as another confirmation that there's a problem in the
e-commerce segment,'' said Richard Smith, an Internet consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Smith knows this first-hand. In February, he agreed to speak at
Internet Retailer World 2000 about balancing marketing needs with
customer privacy. But in mid-May, he received a letter from the
organizers saying the show had been canceled because not enough
people had signed up. &QL;

<P>
   SALON RELENTS AND REDESIGNS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to soothe ruffled readers, the online magazine Salon.com
completed its product recall last week.
</P>
<P>
   Salon pulled back the site redesign, which had elicited an
immediate and hearty chorus of e-mail boos and hisses from readers
after it was introduced on May 22. The disgruntled audience said
the new site included bugs, was hard to navigate and used type that
was too small to read.
</P>
<P>
   Within two days, Salon's editor, David Talbot, posted a note to
readers saying he had heard their wails and was taking the concerns
into consideration. Then, last Thursday, came another note from
Talbot, entitled ``Salon to readers: you win!'' and introducing a
new new design that addressed many of the readers' criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   The new five-column look remains in place, but the third and
fourth columns effectively serve as a single column to showcase a
feature article. Type sizes can be controlled by readers, and
headlines for the main articles once again link directly to the
reports, rather than taking readers through department home pages.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said the magazine in its latest guise had accomplished
the goals of promoting breaking news from news services while also
featuring more of Salon's own content. But he said the latest
overhaul had also removed the bugs and eliminated some of the
``horizontal sprawl'' that one reader complained about in the May
22 redesign.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said the ``ear splitting'' response had indicated how
deeply the readership was attached to the magazine. ``We
unwittingly turned our readers into a focus group,'' he said,
noting a lesson for any future redesigns. ``Maybe we'll test it out
a little internally first.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Can the Everglades be saved?By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Speeding fast enough for the wind to stop your breath,
Tom Shirley's airboat roars over ankle-deep water through a maze of
reedy grasses. And the creatures of the marsh spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   Alligators roll and dive, roiling the cola-colored water seconds
before the boat glides overhead. Egrets and white ibises take off
in the distance, fluttering like tattered handkerchiefs across a
horizon marked by scattered clumps of willow. Awkward as always,
great blue herons lumber into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, at least 25 miles west of the strip malls of Broward
County, Shirley stops for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   His destination is a gray, clapboard cabin along a canal lined
by dwarf cypress trees, snake-necked anhingas that plunge for their
food, and rainbow-hued birds called gallinules that stalk across
the lily pads. A sign warns, ``Beware of Attack Frog.''
</P>
<P>
   Out here in the sparse, watery wilderness called the Everglades,
a tourist could imagine that the Real Florida still exists as the
first European explorers encountered it: the land of mosquitoes and
water moccasins, panthers and wood storks, untouched by the asphalt
and stucco suburbs swarming in from the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist would be wrong, however _ a fact that's leading
Florida and the nation to embark on a great experiment: Can $7.8
billion, four decades of bulldozing and drilling and digging, and
the assembled wisdom of scientists and engineers save this
ecological treasure? At the same time, can South Florida keep its
farming economy and double its population to 12 million people?
</P>
<P>
   Shirley, for one, is worried about the answer. The Fort
Lauderdale man has a scrapbook of memories here a half-century old,
with photos to back them up, and they tell him how much of the
Everglades has already vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Stout hardwood trees toppled by floods, their islands
disintegrated. Bird flocks and once-abundant snakes, shrunk to bare
remnants of their selves. An emaciated gator. The skulls and
skeletons of drowned white-tailed deer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of barometers telling us something is
wrong,'' says Shirley, his arms as creased as a gator's hide.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley first ventured into the Everglades in the 1940s, and
later spent 30 years as a state wildlife officer. At 68 _ 15 years
older than Everglades National Park, some distance to the south _
he still makes his living here operating airboat tours. But not
happily.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come out here today,'' he says, ``it breaks my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   NO QUICK FIX
</P>
<P>
   After spending a combined $3.5 billion trying to treat the
Everglades' ills, state and federal taxpayers are on the verge of
trying for an all-out cure _ if Congress approves it in the next
two months.
</P>
<P>
   No more tinkering with problems in one part of the region, only
to worsen them someplace else. No more pitting people against
nature. No more putting nature last.
</P>
<P>
   That's the promise, at least.
</P>
<P>
   The $7.8 billion restoration plan is the creation of dozens of
agencies, led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South
Florida Water Management District. It's already won support from
Gov. Jeb Bush, the state legislature, the White House and key
congressmen from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the ecological disaster was more than a century in the
making. Reversing it won't be quick.
</P>
<P>
   With drainage projects beginning in the 1880s, Florida _ and
later the feds _ shrank the historic Everglades by half, turning
the rest to cities and farms. When the corps finished the job after
World War II, the remaining marsh was hemmed in by dikes,
crisscrossed by 1,600 miles of canals, and subjected to a ruinous
cycle of dryness and floods.
</P>
<P>
   The results:
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades lost more than 90 percent of its wading birds,
and its central marshes lost more than 60 percent of their
tree-covered islands. Florida Bay and Lake Okeechobee flirted with
ecological collapse. More than 600 of the region's species are
considered rare or imperiled. Fish in most of the Everglades became
off-limits to eating because of toxic mercury contamination.
Meanwhile, the same drainage system that has damaged the Everglades
dumps so much wasted water out to sea _ roughly 600 billion gallons
a year _ that serious shortages loom in coming decades. In coastal
estuaries such as the St. Lucie River and the Lake Worth Lagoon,
canals routinely dump pollution and wreck the ecological balance
that fish and sea grass require.
</P>
<P>
   Reverse course, the plan's supporters say, and you not only
rescue the nation's largest freshwater marsh, you also safeguard
the water supply for future residents.
</P>
<P>
   The experts who wrote the plan acknowledge that much remains
unclear about how the Everglades used to flow, and about how that
flow supported its old abundance. The result is a plan that skimps
on a lot of details, leaving them to be filled in as knowledge
improves.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters say it's critical to begin the years of tests,
pilot projects, and early earthwork as soon as possible _ including
getting Congress to approve the plan this year. Most likely, that
means getting an initial vote in the House and Senate before
members break for their August recess.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves scant few weeks to answer some critical questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Who will set the rules for the restoration _ federal
bureaucrats or the state?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will Congress provide enough money for the plan? And will
Florida's promise to pay its own share, codified in a law Bush
signed last month, prove to be enough?
</P>
<P>
   _ How much leeway should the corps have to carry out the plan
without lawmakers scrutinizing every one of its 68 planned
projects?
</P>
<P>
   _ Perhaps most fundamentally, will the plan really help the
Everglades, or will it become a giant water-supply subsidy for
farmers and developers? And should Congress guarantee that the
Everglades gets its water before anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   Then there are myriad other disputes that could undermine the
restoration even if it wins Congress' OK: Struggles between
environmentalists and the sugar industry over the fate of a planned
reservoir in western Palm Beach County. Arguments between
environmentalists and the Miccosukee Indian tribe over which
federal agency they mistrust the least _ the Corps of Engineers or
the Interior Department. The fate of a proposed international
airport next to the Everglades in Homestead.
</P>
<P>
   And don't discount the effect of this year's presidential
election, which pits Vice President Al Gore against the governor's
brother, George W. Bush. Gore and Jeb Bush have already traded some
jabs over the Everglades, along with some carefully calibrated
praise.
</P>
<P>
   Even identifying the plan's main goal has caused a food fight on
Capitol Hill. The White House's legislative language says the
plan's ``primary and overarching purpose'' is to restore the
Everglades _ irking farmers and utility managers who insist that
water supply and flood control should get equal footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a bumpy ride,'' said Tom Adams, a National
Audubon Society lobbyist in Washington. He said he's optimistic the
bill will pass, but it could be the last thing Congress does this
year.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan fails this year, supporters fear, they'll never get
another chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What choice do we have but to move forward?'' asked Shannon
Estenoz, co-chairwoman of the Everglades Coalition. ``We've got an
almost dead lake. We've got an almost dead (St. Lucie) estuary. . .
. It's unconscionable that we would wait one day longer than we'd
have to.''
</P>
<P>
   AGREEING ON A PLAN
</P>
<P>
   But even the environmentalists are far from united. Some groups
say a bad restoration plan is worse than none at all _ and this
one, they argue, is fatally compromised by concessions to sugar and
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be accused of being great naysayers and
totally negative, yadda yadda yadda,'' said Juanita Greene,
conservation chairwoman of the group Friends of the Everglades. But
she said the plan ``doesn't seem to be emphasizing Everglades
restoration. Unless it's revised, we will oppose what's in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan still has the backing of almost all of the largest
state and national environmental groups, including the Audubon
Society, the World Wildlife Fund, the National Wildlife Federation
and the Everglades Coalition, a 42-group alliance.
</P>
<P>
   But some smaller groups call it a plan only an engineer could
love.
</P>
<P>
   True to the no-compromise spirit of its founder, the late
Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Greene's group wants a plan that
eventually would buy all 500,000 acres of sugar cane south Lake
Okeechobee. That land would go back to its original function:
storing water and letting it flow in an unbroken sheet to the
Everglades, replenishing the marsh and filtering pollution. It
would actually expand the remaining Everglades, not just make do
within its existing borders.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers say the buy-it-and-let-it-flow idea sounds great,
but it couldn't work in the drained, shrunken and sunken Everglades
that remain. Corps restoration chief Stu Appelbaum has likened the
Everglades to a comatose patient who must remain on the respirator.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the plan calls for storing hundreds of billions of
gallons of water along the margins of the Everglades, then creating
pumps to move it around the marshes in ways that are supposed to
mimic nature's historic patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The storage would include 60,000 acres of reservoirs in the
sugar region, leaving the rest to farming, and nearly 200,000 acres
east of the Everglades and around Lake Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also would store billions of gallons underground in
more than 330 storage wells, a technology never before used on such
a huge scale. Some scientists worry about whether the injected
water would pollute existing ground water _ or whether it would
seep away before it could be used.
</P>
<P>
   Another controversial part, costing $1 billion, would create
reservoirs on 15 square miles of limestone quarries that miners
already plan to dig in wetlands next to the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers refer to the quarry reservoirs as a ``Lake Belt,''
but they'd resemble no natural lakes ever seen in South Florida: up
to 36 feet deep with ruler-straight banks. Such deep water would be
an impossible place for wading birds to feed, or for sunlight to
nourish plants on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call this restoration _ this square hole in the ground,''
scoffed Sierra Club activist Barbara Lange. In a letter to the
corps about the miners' plans last year, Interior Department
scientists criticized the proposed quarries as ``non-natural
habitat of little or no value to the Everglades ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   The department is still waiting to see whether the corps will
soothe its criticisms with a revised version of the quarry plan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Shirley and other outdoorsmen complain that the plan
would drown, not save, tree islands in the central Everglades. They
say the plan, aimed at replenishing long-deprived sections of
Everglades National Park and Florida Bay, calls for keeping water
too deep north of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have their way, this place will be under water,''
Shirley says.
</P>
<P>
   In a packet of documents that outdoor groups have sent to
members of Congress, Shirley stands in a photo next to a tree
toppled last year by flooding from Hurricane Irene. The caption:
``Everglades restoration at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, said the corps' Appelbaum. He said his agency will
look at any evidence the outdoorsmen have collected about what
water depths the tree islands can withstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the same goals they do,'' Appelbaum said. ``We're
trying to restore the entire system.''
</P>
<P>
   The corps' and water managers' assumptions also will face
scrutiny from a panel of experts appointed by the National Academy
of Sciences, which could release a report early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's ultimate leap of faith is that ``getting the water
right,'' as the engineers put it, will reap benefits for the plants
and animals. Until they try it, they can't know for sure that it
will.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan's supporters say they know one thing: The system as
it exists doesn't work.

11 YEARS AFTER TIANAMEN SQUARE MASSACRE, MEMORIAL EBBING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Eleven years after China turned its tanks and troops
against student protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, tens of
thousands people gathered at a candlelight vigil here Sunday to
remember the doomed democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   This year's ceremony drew far fewer people than last year's,
when a crowd of 70,000 packed Victoria Park to mark the 10th
anniversary of the massacre. Three years after Hong Kong's
reversion to Chinese sovereignty, Tiananmen Square is no longer the
emotional touchstone it once was. But as the only public
commemoration on Chinese soil, the vigil is still remarkable for
seeming so routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven years ago, the Chinese government was corrupt,'' said
Ang Chi-peng, who works in a trading firm. ``Eleven years later,
the Chinese government is still corrupt. We have to keep coming out
and saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ang, 51, has attended the vigil every year since 1989, when more
than 1 million people poured into the streets of Hong Kong to
protest the violent crackdown in Beijing on the night of June 3-4.
This year, he brought his 12-year-old daughter to witness Hong
Kong's annual assertion of free expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is a political display window for China,'' Ang said.
``They allow things to happen here, but not anywhere else in
China.''
</P>
<P>
   The police presence was light on this stifling evening as the
crowd sang songs and waved softly flickering candles under a
crescent moon. Giant screens at either end of the park replayed
images of tanks rolling through Tiananmen Square as the sound of
machine-gun fire echoed from loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in China, security forces fanned out to ensure that
the anniversary passed without notice. In Beijing, police arrested
a pro-democracy activist in Tiananmen Square as he tried to scatter
banners commemorating the crackdown. The man, Shen Zhidao, was
arrested in the square last year as well, when he opened an
umbrella covered with anti-government slogans.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, the police broke up memorial services for the
victims of the massacre in Beijing and Xian, said the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democracy, a Hong Kong-based civil
rights group. The group also said that 50 dissidents in four cities
had begun a 24-hour hunger strike to honor the victims and demand
that the Chinese government reassess the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, however, the anger toward Beijing has clearly
ebbed. An annual survey released by the University of Hong Kong
indicated that public support for the group that organizes the
vigil had fallen to a record low _ 49 percent of those polled. In
last year's survey, 56 percent of people polled said they supported
the group, the Alliance in Support of Patriotic and Democratic
Movement in China.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the alliance said, ``Under heavy political
pressure, some people have quietly withdrawn, some people's hot
blood has run cold, and some people have even betrayed their
conscience by defending the massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the fading memory of Tiananmen Square, the
vigil's organizers concentrated their efforts on young people. The
theme was ``passing the torch of democracy'' to a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   Among adults here Sunday, the subject of China's economic ties
with other nations came up repeatedly. T.C. Leung, who works in a
hotel, said that China's campaign to join the World Trade
Organization and establish normal trade relations with the United
States would foster a new democratic movement in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A 44-year-old teacher standing nearby agreed. ``China wants to
be accepted into the global economy, so it will unconsciously
accept the rules of the game,'' said the woman, who would gave her
name only as Au. ``The rules are set by democratic countries.''

SIERRA LEONE'S AMBASSADOR CONFRONTS TERROR AND INDIFFERENCE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many of the worst photographs are kept in a red
paper folder on the coffee table in the ambassador's office.
</P>
<P>
   As some diplomats might want to share photographs of a
sun-dappled tourist resort or a new business development in their
homelands, Ambassador John E. Leigh asks visitors to the Sierra
Leone Embassy to inspect the evidence of the nightmare that has
descended on his West African nation.
</P>
<P>
   He takes the first photograph from the pile. ``Here, what has
she done to deserve this?'' he asks of the child in the photo, a
girl not more than 3 or 4 years old. Her belly is covered with
scars from blade cuts. Most of her right arm is missing, removed
from above the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just put your arm on the ground and chop it off,'' he
says of the grotesque tactics of the rebels who have mutilated
whole villages of people, including infants, by hacking off their
limbs, in an undeniably successful effort to spread terror. A
second photograph shows a pretty young woman, perhaps 20, with two
stumps where her hands had been.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other civilians have been killed outright in almost
a decade of fighting in Sierra Leone, a diamond-rich nation of 5
million people whose history is bound up with the United States.
Much of the population, including Leigh, is descended from American
slaves who fought their way off Southern plantations and returned
to Africa. English remains the official language.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador, an American-educated businessman and lawyer
turned diplomat who has run the embassy here since 1996, said he
did not believe the first reports of the mutilations when they
began to trickle back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned by it; I thought it was a made-up story,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But quickly enough, the evidence became overwhelming. ``When
they chop off people's hands, they will say to the victims, `Let's
see how you're going to vote now,''' Leigh explained. ``In Sierra
Leone, people are in a state of shock. Nobody thought that fellow
Africans could be this vicious.''
</P>
<P>
   The extreme violence, he said, is explained by the diamonds,
which the rebels _ who have received support from Libya and
neighboring Liberia _ seek to control. ``The greedier you are, the
more violent you are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scale of atrocities, he said, it has been difficult
to get Americans to listen and care, including officials of the
Clinton administration. ``It's just not important to them,'' he
said. ``Sierra Leone is small, the economy is tiny.'' As for the
State Department, he said, ``They listen to me but they do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh said a possibly racist double standard became clear last
year, when Sierra Leone continued its descent into chaos as the
United States began its multibillion-dollar military and
humanitarian aid campaign in Kosovo. ``Here is a white nation
getting all of these goodies, and here is Sierra Leone, where they
are cutting off the arms of women and children, and they are not
paying any attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps worse, he said, the United States joined with other
Western powers last year in pressuring the Sierra Leone government
to negotiate with the rebels, producing a cease-fire agreement in
which the government pardoned the guerrillas who had been
mutilating civilians. After the deal was signed, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright traveled to Sierra Leone and met with the rebel
leader, Foday Sankoh. The agreement has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forced into it,'' Leigh said. ``The United States went
in and pushed it on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Leigh is unpopular across town at the State
Department. ``They give me dirty looks,'' he said with a throaty
chuckle. ``They don't like me there because I speak out.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for the administration's response, a State Department
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the United
States had provided more than $300 million in humanitarian aid in
Sierra Leone over the last decade. Washington was the principal
financial backer of an international peacekeeping force there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that we haven't done very much is certainly
erroneous,'' the official said, adding that the United States had
not pressed the peace agreement on Sierra Leone but had instead
been an honest broker at the request of the government there.
``That is absolutely false, and I think Ambassador Leigh knows
that.''
</P>
<P>
   To the 61-year-old ambassador, the anger that he arouses among
American diplomats is simply proof that he is doing his job. The
Sierra Leone government asked Leigh to take over the embassy here
in the hope that after spending most of his adult life in the
United States, he would know how to make his voice heard in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   His roots to the United States go back to the 18th century, when
his ancestors escaped from Southern plantations and, according to
family accounts, fled to Nova Scotia and eventually to Sierra
Leone. ``Sierra Leone was a place for the guys who were
rebellious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh grew up in Freetown, the capital, and was educated at
American- and British-run missionary schools. His father worked for
what was then the British colonial government. Like many from elite
families, he went to college in the West. He received a bachelor's
degree and an MBA from New York University, and a law degree from
Suffolk University.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he has married an American, had three children,
all of them American citizens, and worked for the Chase Manhattan
Bank, Squibb Pharmaceuticals and Xerox. When he was tapped to
become ambassador, he was a lawyer in private practice in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But he says he has no desire for American citizenship. An
American passport, he said, would dishonor the memory of relatives
who had to risk their lives centuries ago to escape the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   `'My wife has been on my case to become an American,'' he said.
`'But I didn't feel right doing that. My ancestors fought their way
out of America's slave population. I didn't want to negate that
heritage.''

WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE BABY? AMONG OTHER COSMIC, ONE-ACT
QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leslie Caputo's ``Birth Marks,'' which closes the
first half of the third and final installment of Marathon 2000, the
Ensemble Studio Theater's annual festival of new plays, has enough
situational complexity to make you want a second act. As it opens,
a young woman named Terry _ she's maybe 18 or 20 _ has just given
birth to a baby in a hospital on the Lower East Side. Played by
Jenna Lamia, she's blonde, lovely, Irish Catholic and alone. Her
husband, who is Hispanic, hasn't shown up at the hospital, and he
never will.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she is visited by her disapproving, bigoted and
spineless father (Martin Shakar), who brings letters from his wife
to read to her, letters that begin, ``To my disgraced daughter.''
She is also visited by her husband's sister, Yvonne (Nicole Gomez),
who is both a spitfire party girl and a genuinely concerned friend,
and by her husband's brother, Luis (Ramon de Ocampo), a dopey kid
who has been dispatched to find the missing spouse and failed his
mission in spectacularly dunderheaded fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The plot issue is what will happen to the baby, and the play
could stand expansion to more fully simmer the emotional stew that
is cooked up in a mere 40 minutes. But the pungency of this small
play is in its rendering of the cross-cultural and
cross-generational conflicts in a working-class pocket of the city.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening conversation, in which Terry's father speaks to
his daughter with an Irish accent and Terry responds in New Yawkese
_ ``her'' is pronounced ``huh'' _ the ingrained obstacles to every
relationship in this play are painfully and realistically evident.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue is written with a sure ear, no mean feat
considering the vernacular variety, and all the actors, but
particularly Lamia and Gomez, give their characters the sense that
for all their will to connect, they're speaking in separate
tongues. By the end, an entire neighborhood, its ethnic mix thrown
together by economics and circumscribed by limited dreams, has been
evoked by four people in a hospital room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birth Marks'' is the highlight among the five bite-size plays
that make up the program, which runs through June 11. The others
are less ambitious, though each has its moments to recommend.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Proof,'' by Jeff Reich, the play that closes the evening
by running bizarrely off the track of its initially comic premise,
does have a great beginning. In it a professor of neuroscience at
an undistinguished college takes out the frustration of a life of
academic obscurity on a classroom full of first-year students. The
scene takes the form of his opening lecture, and it is hilariously,
farcically bitter, complete with a slide show in which all the
slides are upside down. (You wouldn't think an upside-down goldfish
would look so weirdly funny, but it does.)
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Nathan Simpson, is played with a delicious comic
sense of self-loathing distress by Brad Bellamy. But alas the play
doesn't know what to make of the situation it has wrought; it
devolves into a windy confrontation between Simpson and his pompous
mentor (Forest Compton).
</P>
<P>
   The other plays include ``The Final Interrogation of Ceausescu's
Dog,'' by Warren Leight, the playwright's first work on a New York
stage since his ``Side Man'' won the Tony Award for best play last
year. An amusing trifle, it depicts the canine companion of the
deposed Romanian dictator being questioned by a suddenly liberated
citizen. His efforts to crack the dog's smugly privileged demeanor
cause him no end of frustration, which Ean Sheehy does a nice job
of letting bubble up until he cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy has the thankless role, here, however: as the dog,
Alexander R. Scott, dressed in a houndstooth jacket and speaking in
an Eastern European-accented pidgin English, is the star of the
show. ``I am simple dog,'' he says, whenever he's unmoved to
respond, an anthropomorphism that makes you giggle every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alien Boy,'' by Will Scheffer, is a monologue about a
13-year-old coming to recognize his homosexuality. It has a vivid
central anecdote _ the confused boy writes to a psychiatrist,
picked out of the phone book, pleading for treatment _ and the
performance, by David Greenspan, is an idiosyncratic one, well
thought out both physically and verbally. But the play itself has
too many familiar signposts _ mother issues, ``The Boys in the
Band'' _ not to feel a bit shopworn.
</P>
<P>
   The play that opens the evening, ``Cannibals'' by Heather
Dundas, is a comic reverie about Jane, a suburban mother who
wonders how she got that way. ``Here's what I don't understand,''
she says, stepping out from behind the wheel of her car, in which
she's driving her clamorous two children and their friends to
school. ``Ten years ago I was a bisexual living in New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   In scenes that flip back and forth between Jane's stressed
daydreams and the reality of her stressed morning, she persuasively
reveals the understandable conflict between what her life might
have been and what it is. The script is detailed enough to make
Jane a real character, and in the lead role, Diana LaMar is
singular enough to rouse a potentially hackneyed circumstance to
the level of a sympathetic predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The switchbacks are directed with comic efficiency by India
Cooper, even if the final image, Jane drawing a line down the front
of her face with lipstick, is on the heavy-handed side. The main
difficulty with the play is in its use of full-grown actors as
7-year-olds and a 3-year-old. Despite their ardent efforts here,
the actors come across as such ill-assigned performers generally
do, not as children but mentally deficient adults.
</P>

   PRODUCTION NOTES:

FUSAICHI PEGASUS TO MISS BELMONT AFTER INJURING HOOF IN BARN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time in 30 years, the third jewel in
horse racing's Triple Crown will not have the Kentucky Derby winner
or the Preakness winner in the starting gate. Trainer Neil Drysdale
announced Sunday that Fusaichi Pegasus injured his right hoof and
will not race in the Belmont Stakes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred Saturday at 2 p.m. when a blacksmith working
on another horse in Barn 1 at Aqueduct dropped a tool and startled
Fusaichi Pegasus, who was asleep in the back of his stall. The
Derby winner jumped forward, lost his footing, slid into the door
and sustained a cut about the size of a dime in his right front
hoof wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was immediately treated and bandaged and there is no
soreness,'' Drysdale said. ``He'll be fine in five or six days, but
if we trained him for the Belmont it could lead to a larger crack
in his hoof wall. You have to do what is right for the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The mishap occurred seven days after Frank Stronach and Joe
Orseno _ the owner and trainer of Red Bullet _ decided that their
lightly-raced colt needed to rest after beating Fusaichi Pegasus by
four lengths on a wet and taxing track in the Preakness on May 20.
</P>
<P>
   With no stirring rematch and no inherent drama of a horse trying
to capture the Triple Crown as it had the past three years, the
focus for the Belmont was on the $4 million horse with a penchant
for rodeo-style bucking in the morning and often-displayed
effortless and overpowering speed in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Grade 1 $1 million Belmont is a wide-open race with a
different kind of significance. Silver Charm, Real Quiet and
Charismatic each failed in their bids to become only the 12th horse
in 123 years to sweep the grueling series, which demands the
3-year-old horses to prevail over the varying distances of a mile
and a quarter, a mile and three-sixteenths and the Belmont's mile
and a half in a span of five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But not since 1970, when Dust Commander followed his victory in
the Derby with a ninth-place finish behind the Preakness winner
Personality, has the Belmont been without the winner of either
race. Dust Commander skipped the Belmont and Personality scratched
the day before the race because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were intending to run no matter who showed up,'' said Todd
Pletcher, who trains Impeachment, the third-place finisher in both
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. ``This shows you how tough it is
for horses to run these races. It just makes the Belmont that much
more wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   If Impeachment indeed makes it to the starting gate, he will be
the only one of 19 Derby starters to run in all three Triple Crown
races. So far there are nine probable starters for the Belmont,
though with the loss of the formidable Fusaichi Pegasus as well as
Red Bullet that number may grow, perhaps to as many as 14.
</P>
<P>
   The likely favorite now is the Derby runner-up Aptitude who
skipped the Preakness as did other contenders such as the
fifth-place Derby finisher Wheelaway and the seventh-placed Curule.
The trainer of Aptitude, Bobby Frankel, acknowledged his colt can
run himself into contention for winning year end honors with a
victory in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Fusaichi Pegasus not running, there's a potential for
more uncertainty about the 3-year-old championship,'' Frankel said.
``Obviously, we would like to make a run for that. But right now,
we're taking things one race at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Triple Crown faces include the Peter Pan winner
Postponed, Globalize, Tahkoda Hills, Appearing Now and Chief
Seattle. It is likely that Commendable, who finished 17th in the
Derby and Hugh Hefner, the sixth-place finisher in the Preakness,
will move from the possible to the probable list, along with
perhaps the Peter Pan runner up Unshaded and anyone else who
believes their horse can go the distance for a rich purse in a
significant race.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: For the first time since 1996 when
Grindstone won the Derby, Louis Quatorze won the Preakness and
Editor's Note won the Belmont, three different horses will have a
victory in the spring's classic races.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said the owner of Fusaichi Pegasus, Fusao Sekiguchi,
was disappointed by the development but agreed that they hold him
out of the Belmont and point the colt to the Breeders' Cup Classic
in November at Churchill Downs, where he first prompted talk of a
super horse with his impressive victory in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer, however, did not seem too shaken Sunday. He will be
inducted into thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame at Saratoga and is
admired for his cautious and conservative approach to handling
horses. In 1992, he scratched A.P. Indy from the Derby on the
morning of the race when the colt came up with a far more serious
hoof injury. A.P. Indy returned to win the Belmont, as well as the
Breeders' Cup and was named horse of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale acknowledged the first two legs of the Triple Crown had
taken a lot out of Fusaichi Pegasus and was waiting on a workout
scheduled for yesterday before committing the colt to the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is a blessing in disguise,'' he said. ``The
decision whether or not to run him hadn't been made. Well, he made
the decision himself.''

LONGEVITY STUDY FOCUSES ON YEARS OF `HEALTHY LIFE;' U.S. LAGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States falls behind almost every
country in Europe, as well as Canada, Australia and Israel, in what
the World Health Organization calls ``healthy life expectancy,''
according a report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With the report, the organization joins a trend toward measuring
life expectancy in a new way, for the first time factoring in the
diseases and disabilities that are likely to rob people of a
lifetime of good health.
</P>
<P>
   By this adjusted measure, Japan leads the world in healthy life
expectancy, according to WHO, which is part of the U.N. system. A
Japanese citizen can expect to lead a life of 74.5 healthy years,
it said. At the very bottom of the scale is battered Sierra Leone,
where a child born in 1999 can expect to live a healthy life of
fewer than 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every country with a healthy life expectancy below 40 is
in Africa, where AIDS and warfare are lowering life spans
significantly. The group estimates that HIV-AIDS has cut 15 years
to 20 years off life expectancy in southern Africa, and five years
to 10 years in other parts of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   As in other measures of well-being, the study found, the United
States loses ground against other industrial nations because it has
its own ``Third Worlds'' within its population.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the health agency says, years lost to disease,
injury and other disabilities are substantially higher in poorer
countries, and poorer communities in richer nations.
</P>
<P>
   The new study lists poor health among American minorities, the
effects of AIDS, tobacco-related cancers, heart disease and
violence as factors in reducing a healthy life expectancy in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the Population Reference Bureau, a private demographic
research organization in Washington, Carl Haub, who compiles annual
statistics on world population, said the American ranking is not
particularly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a 25 percent minority population that has lower life
expectancies,'' he said, adding that even by traditional measures
of mortality, the United States does not rank among the nations
with the highest longevity. ``If you look at the U.S. by ethnic
group, you see a somewhat different result. African-Americans in
the U.S. have a much lower life expectancy, particularly males.''
</P>
<P>
   Using traditional methods, average life expectancy in the United
States was 76.7 years in 1998, Haub said, with men at 73.9 years
and women at 79.4.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization table of healthy life expectancy
lowers the level to 70 years for Americans overall, with 67.5 years
for men and 72.6 years for women.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Eberstadt, who studies demographic surveys at the
American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said there has been a
trend, beginning in Europe, to add new dimensions to the study of
longevity. ``There has been an enormous amount of work done on
healthy life expectancy,'' he said. ``Some of these efforts have
been inventive, but none have been particularly compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Eberstadt said that a number of surveys have factored in
perceptions about health and well-being among populations, which
can vary dramatically from one country or region to another,
despite the statistical similarities.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization survey does not deal with
perceptions, but does include projections based on what is known
about major health factors like heart disease or lung cancer
related to smoking. In Japan, for example, the new survey states
that lung cancer rates for men ``are expected to jump in coming
years as the long-term effects of the post-World War II smoking
popularity begin to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   China, the world's most populous nation, with one-fifth of the
world's people, was found to have a healthy life expectancy of
62.3, well ahead of the second-largest country, India, at 53.2. The
Chinese figure is considered particularly impressive, given the
country's income level, WHO says. China outranks not only India in
a healthier life but also Russia and many nations in Central Asia,
the Middle East and North Africa.

AGASSI VS. POTTS VS. ELIZONDO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Answers. For Life. punctuation is cq.)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The tennis star Andre Agassi once asserted in
advertising for Canon EOS Rebel cameras that ``image is
everything.'' Now, in a campaign for the Twinlab line of products
like vitamins and nutritional supplements, he seems willing to
consider that substance may be as important as style.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi and his recent comeback, which included winning three of
the last four Grand Slam tennis events, are the focus of the
campaign, by Hanft Byrne Raboy &AMP; Partners in New York. The budget
is estimated at $25 million, the largest ever for the Twinlab Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, scheduled to begin appearing on Friday, will introduce
a theme _ ``Answers. For life.'' _ that seeks to link Agassi's
performance with the use of Twinlab products in his training
regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a celebrity who actually uses our products and has
become a fitter, stronger player,'' said Neil Blechman, executive
vice president at Twinlab in Hauppuage, N.Y. ``It's a unique
opportunity for our company.''
</P>
<P>
   Twinlab's hiring of Agassi, who signed a multiyear contract with
undisclosed financial terms, is emblematic of the continued strong
appeal of celebrity endorsements as a marketing tactic. In the
category in which Twinlab competes, there are almost as many
pitchstars as, to quote an old saying, Carter's has little liver
pills.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi will face off against actors including Hector Elizondo,
who promotes the Quanterra line of herbal supplements sold by
Warner-Lambert, which is being acquired by Pfizer, and Annie Potts,
who peddles a similar product line for One-A-Day, sold by Bayer.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding whether to sign celebrity athletes, marketers are
increasingly looking for proven, long-term performance rather than
one-time feats like, say, winning a Super Bowl or a World Series.
By that standard, Agassi _ who has also worked for consumer
marketers like Nike and PepsiCo in addition to Canon _ would
qualify as endorser material.
</P>
<P>
   Centering campaigns on athletes ``could either be home runs or
crash and burn quickly,'' said Adam Hanft, managing partner and
president at Hanft Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have very sophisticated antennae to distinguish
between genuine passion for a product and expediency,'' he added.
``The ones who are doing it for the money are so transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanft said he believed that Agassi's appeal was enhanced by his
story of rising to the top of the tennis world, falling to a
ranking of 141st and then rising again, because ``what he
represents is more aspirational for the majority of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre is the perfect bridge from where we were to where we
want to go,'' he added, referring to a goal of emphasizing the
range of Twinlab vitamins, minerals and herbal products rather than
just concentrating on sports nutrition items favored by body
builders.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign includes television and radio commercials, print
advertisements, Internet marketing, a sweepstakes and store
displays and posters. The voice of Agassi's trainer, Gil Reyes, who
helped Agassi and Twinlab hook up, is heard in the radio spots.
</P>
<P>
   In one television commercial, Agassi recounts his comeback to
first as an announcer declares, ``When you're ready to look out for
No. 1, Twinlab will show you how.''
</P>
<P>
   A second television spot intercuts scenes of Agassi playing
tennis with footage from a program on ABC depicting him playing in
1974. An interviewer _ the former baseball star Don Drysdale _
asks, ``You want to be a tennis player when you get big?'' Young
Agassi replies, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The second spot ends with Drysdale asking, ``Do you know how old
you are?'' Young Agassi replies, ``Six.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, when it comes to hiring athletes as
endorsers, a funny thing can happen on the way to the stadium.
Promotional materials for the campaign describe how its start is
meant to coincide with the French Open, ``where Agassi is the No. 1
seed and defending champion.'' But last Thursday, Agassi lost in a
second-round match to a player ranked 65th, Karol Kucera.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's defeat occurred just before Blechman's telephone
interview for this column. Told that Agassi had lost, Blechman
said, ``I didn't think he was playing today.'' After a pause, he
added: ``This is really off the cuff, but even if he doesn't win
the title, Andre's resurgence in the past two years is the real
story. As long as he continues to be at the top of his game, we're
confident he will be a major asset to the brand in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't wait till he plays in New York,'' Blechman said,
referring to the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Hanft's reaction to Agassi's shocking shortfall at the French
Open, attributed to a blistered right toe, was more puckish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have `Answers. For life.','' Hanft said, laughing, ``but
not `Answers. For feet.'''

STATE JUDGES ARE ACTING MORE LIKE POLITICIANS AS CHALLENGES GROW 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Mich., Ala., Ill., Idaho, Ohio, Texas, Calif., Wis., Fla.) (See also DEFIANT-JUDGE) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With touchstone issues like death penalty challenges, school
financing and changes in liability laws hanging in the balance,
contests for state judgeships around the country have become
bruising multimillion dollar political affairs that critics say are
threatening the independence of the nation's state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars in campaign contributions are flowing into
races for top state judgeships this year, while candidates are
testing the limits of rules that forbid them from signaling how
they might vote on cases, according to judicial candidates,
political consultants and lawyers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Attack advertising, the use of aggressive political consultants
and what are often only thinly veiled promises to sustain or
overturn controversial decisions are now established parts of
campaigns for seats on state courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judicial campaigns are getting noisier, nastier and
costlier,'' said Roy A. Schotland, an expert on judicial politics
who is a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. ``The
amount of money being spent keeps escalating and the number of
states in which this is happening is escalating.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio this year, more than $5 million and possibly as much as
$12 million may be spent in a battle for a single seat on the state
Supreme Court. The campaign, one of the most bitterly contested in
the country, could shift the ideological balance of the court.
Twenty years ago, a campaign for the same court cost $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Races for state Supreme Courts in Michigan, Illinois, Alabama,
Idaho and other states are also drawing national attention. Already
this year, supreme court campaigns have included claims of race
baiting, dirty politics, catering to rich trial lawyers and
abdication to business interests.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the races, legal and political experts say,
indicates that the big-dollar judicial politicking that gained
momentum in the 1980s with campaigns that ousted top judges in
Texas and California, among others, have now become entrenched
parts of the political system.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be the polarization that has affected government
at all levels, creating an ever-more vibrant cottage industry in
most cities of political consultants and advisers. Also, as the
federal government has become less ambitious in seeking solutions
to social problems, in the eras of Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton,
state courts have become battlegrounds for emotional issues like
abortion, health care and the financing of public schools. And many
of those issues are now starting to land in the state trial and
appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to limit liability lawsuits and damage awards in many
state legislatures _ so-called tort-reform _ have also accelerated
the political forces at work on state courts. The measures, which
often place a maximum on damage awards and otherwise limit
recoveries by people claiming injury, have spawned legal challenges
in many state courts, which, in turn, have spawned campaigns by
trial lawyers and business groups to shift those courts their way.
</P>
<P>
   But the issues in statewide judicial races are unpredictably
diverse. In the Alabama race for chief justice of the Supreme
Court, for example, a candidate who posted the Ten Commandments in
his courtroom has built a huge following.
</P>
<P>
   In the Idaho race last month, a trial judge unseated an
incumbent state Supreme Court justice for the first time since 1944
after an extraordinarily bitter campaign in which the eventual
winner had declared that the theory of evolution could not be true.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, two Democratic judges vying for a seat on the state
Supreme Court this spring each spent $1 million in campaigns that
included pummeling each other in television advertising. One
suggested the other was responsible for sending ``innocent men to
death row while killers walk the street.'' The other warned voters
that ``one candidate has taken the low road.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Party Battle in Michigan
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan race this year was superheated even before the
Democratic Party had selected its three candidates to oppose three
sitting Republican justices. The three conservative incumbents were
originally appointed by Gov. John Engler, also a Republican, to
fill vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups had declared the election of the incumbent
justices a priority, while unions and trial lawyers had begun
gathering a war chest for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, tensions exploded publicly over a flier handed out
by the state Democratic Party at a dinner of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Detroit. Among
other accusations, the flier declared that one of the three
incumbent justices, Robert P. Young Jr., who is black, opposed the
1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision desegregating public schools,
Brown vs. Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The flier said that the three Republicans who are part of a
Republican majority on the court were active members of the
conservative Federalist Society and went on to assert that Young
was a ``staunch believer that Brown v. Board of Education was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Young responded by releasing a scathing letter he wrote to the
state Democratic Party chairman, Mark Brewer. It demanded a
retraction of the accusation about his views on the 1954 opinion.
``This statement is a lie,'' intended to harm him with black
voters, the justice said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Young said he had long expressed public support
for the 1954 desegregation ruling. He asserted that he had said he
simply shared the views of some critics who say it was based ``too
much on sociology.''
</P>
<P>
   His public response, Young said, was ``a moral call to
conscience about whether race baiting has any role in the political
discourse in a judicial election.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Brewer said there would be no retraction and
that civil rights would continue to be an issue. ``It is not a
lie,'' Brewer said of the flier's description of Young's views.
``It is true. He has told a number of people throughout Michigan
that Brown vs. Board of education was `wrongly decided.' Those were
his exact words.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the court's critics say that despite the vitriol, the
real issue is the court's reputation as a harshly conservative
panel that regularly sides with business, prosecutors and insurance
companies. The critics say Young's reaction may have been partly to
distract attention from criticism of the court.
</P>
<P>
   One source of that criticism was an analysis of 57 of the
court's rulings last year. The analysis was published in a union
newspaper, Michigan AFL-CIO News, and then described in a newspaper
for Michigan lawyers, Lawyers Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the article's author, Mary Ellen Gurewitz, the
general counsel of the Michigan AFL-CIO and of the State Democratic
Party, said the results were ``stunningly one sided,'' with
criminal defendants, for example, losing 15 out of 15 cases decided
by the Michigan Supreme Court. People claiming injuries lost 12 out
of 13 cases she examined.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Republican justices have countered that
Gurewitz's analysis was a politically motivated attack on the court
and a manipulation of statistics.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   An Ouster in Idaho
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho this year one explosive issue in the judicial campaign
was water rights.
</P>
<P>
   A state Supreme Court justice, Cathy Silak, who had been
appointed by a Democratic governor, riled conservatives by writing
the majority opinion last year in a 3-2 decision that said the
federal government, not the state, controlled water rights in
certain wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponent was a trial judge, Daniel Eismann, who was known
for his conservatism and for being unusually open in expressing his
views. Eismann described his campaign as a challenge to judges who
``legislate from the bench.'' And in the campaign he told local
reporters that he was morally opposed to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   After Eismann's lopsided victory on May 23, in which he drew 59
percent of the vote, he answered questions about remarks he had
made in the campaign about his views of creationism. ``I can prove
scientifically,'' he said in an interview, ``that evolution has not
and cannot occur.''
</P>
<P>
   In the election, Silak, who years ago had volunteered as a
coordinator for the state branch of the American Civil Liberties
Union, quickly became a target of conservative critics. She was a
subject of advertising by proponents of term limits and opponents
of gun control and was even the target of an aggressive campaign
tactic known as a push poll in which the questioner includes
negative information to discourage support of an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper advertisement placed by a supporter of Eismann
asked in huge letters: ``Will partial-birth abortion and same-sex
marriage become legal in Idaho? Perhaps so, if liberal Supreme
Court Justice Cathy Silak remains on the Idaho Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Silak said her record as a volunteer for the civil liberties
group had been distorted. She described her judicial record as
moderate and said she had never expressed views about same-sex
marriage or partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You now have the active involvement of political parties and
special interest groups and individuals with special axes to
grind,'' she said in an interview. ``I think it is a way of getting
some hand-selected judges on the court so you have judges whose
opinions you have essentially bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Eismann said Silak's assertion did not merit a response. He said
he had no connection to the activities of many of the groups that
had opposed her candidacy.

<P>
   Judges as Politicians
</P>
<P>
   In the new judicial politics, judges sometimes appear as petty
as other politicians _ and as subject to influence.
</P>
<P>
   In a boisterous $1.3 million campaign last year in Wisconsin,
the state's chief justice, Shirley S. Abrahamson, was forced to
explain, for example, why she had once allowed a late-night
aerobics class in the court's ornate hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahamson said the exercise class had been a ``morale builder''
for her aides.
</P>
<P>
   She won re-election, although there was widespread concern that
the court had been harmed by a campaign that divided the justices.
Four of her colleagues broke the unspoken precedent that typically
keeps justices outside the political fray and openly supported
Abrahamson's well-financed opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The four suggested they were opposed to Abrahamson's management
style, but there was also speculation that one of the four would
have liked to have succeeded her in the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, there are significant consequences to judges
taking on the persona of politicians, said Anthony Champagne, a
political science professor and expert on the judiciary at the
University of Texas at Dallas. In many states, until the 1980s, the
appointment or election of judges was arranged through quiet
agreements among politicians and bar associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a new system,'' said Champagne, ``where lots of money is
involved, where judges are highly dependent on their political
parties and political operatives and where judges are tempted to
make promises that might affect their judicial decisions. It is
something that is new in America and it has the potential of being
a really corrupting force.''
</P>
<P>
   The politicking is becoming increasingly explicit. As the battle
over changes in liability laws has moved into the courts in the
last few years, both business groups and their trial lawyer
adversaries have been increasingly open in describing the battle to
win judgeships in bald political terms.
</P>
<P>
   In a newsletter last fall, for example, the Michigan
Manufacturers Association told its members about the importance of
this year's state Supreme Court election. The newsletter flatly
outlined the group's political goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the last election, it boasted, contributions from the
manufacturers' political action committee ``swayed the Supreme
Court election to a conservative viewpoint, ensuring a
pro-manufacturing agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Discord in Florida
</P>
<P>
   In all, 42 states elect judges at some level and more than 80
percent of all state appeals judges face election, according to the
American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the top courts of many states outside the Northeast
are elected. In the Northeast, most states, including New York,
Connecticut and New Jersey, have appointive systems for the highest
courts. Scholars say the elective systems for judicial selection
have their roots in the populist movement that sought to expand the
power of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new brand of open political warfare over judicial selection
is also being felt this year in states like Florida, where top
appeals judges are appointed.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Florida Republicans proposed measures that would
have given Gov. Jeb Bush and his conservative allies increased
control over the state Supreme Court and over selection panels that
review candidates for appointment to intermediate appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Democrats filed a tongue-in-cheek amendment that
they said made clear the extent of the challenge to the
independence of the judiciary. It declared that the Christian
Coalition ought to simply be given the power to certify who would
be eligible for judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican speaker designate of the Florida House, Tom
Feeney, said in an interview that the Democrats' little joke showed
how out of touch the liberal legislators were.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last bastion of big-government liberalism in Florida is
the state Supreme Court,'' Feeney said, explaining why what the
Republicans call ``court reform'' is necessary. The Republican
measures were not brought to a vote in this year's session but are
expected to be introduced again next year.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Impartiality Falters
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in more than a dozen states, judges, lawyers,
legislators, political professionals and experts on the judiciary
said the image of impartiality in the courts is a casualty of the
new judicial politics. Even while campaign contributions were
growing in the 1980s and 1990s, some of them said, judges seemed
able to remain somewhat aloof from the battle. In place of those
old inhibitions, judges are now finding themselves full
participants in the same kind of ideological warfare that has
affected other branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the watchdog group Public Citizen filed a federal suit
in April challenging as unconstitutional the state's system of
judicial election because of the state's history of huge
contributions for top judges. Some newspapers in the state
editorialized that it was about time. ``Texans know that the
state's system of choosing its court judges is a mess,'' The Austin
American-Statesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the Illinois primaries this spring, a Republican
Supreme Court justice, S. Louis Rathje, was unseated by a
challenger who paid for campaign fliers that were distributed by
anti-abortion groups. They described the challenger, Robert R.
Thomas, as ``the only endorsed pro-life candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rathje said the tactic showed that politics had fully arrived in
the courthouse. People who have cases in court, he said, will have
to get used to appearing in front of judges who have already stated
their views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you feel more or less comfortable,'' Rathje asked,
``with a judge who has already told you how he is going to rule?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a former Chicago Bears football player who now sits on
an appeals court, said in an interview that the pro-life
declaration was simply a statement of his personal views. ``It has
nothing to do with my even-handed participation in cases,'' he
said.

   RACE-IMMIGRANTS (Miami) _ Before they left Cuba for America in

miles apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by
a far greater distance, one they say they never envisioned back in
Cuba. In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to
the white one, they have grown apart in the U.S. because of race.
For the first time, they inhabit a place where the color of their

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Ignoring stern warnings from the government
in Jakarta, separatists in the province of West Papua made a
declaration of independence on Sunday, in hopes of following the
lead of East Timor, which broke away from Indonesia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Around 3,000 supporters of separation gathered in what they
called a ``congress'' this past week. On Sunday they unanimously
endorsed the declaration and called on the United Nations to
recognize a new state, which it is unlikely to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Papua is independent and enjoys a status of sovereignty
since the 1st December of 1961,'' said the statement, referring to
the date of the territory's independence from the Netherlands, its
former colonial overlord.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration was read by a separatist leader, Thaha Alhamid,
to wild cheers at the gathering in Jayapura, the provincial
capital. Thousands of people packed Jayapura's streets Sunday night
to celebrate, and local police and military units remained out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia, seeking to combat the
specter of disintegration for his nation of 210 million people, has
flatly ruled out independence for West Papua, which lies on the
western half of the island of New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   The area holds some of the world's most pristine rain forest,
and its 2 million inhabitants, mostly Melanesians, are racially and
culturally distinct from people in the rest of the vast archipelago
that forms Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration said that ``Indonesia must recognize the
sovereignty of West Papua, based on historical, cultural, ethnic
and religious rights.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the province's people live a strikingly primitive
existence, often hunting with bows and arrows or spears, West Papua
carries disproportionate importance to Indonesia's economy because
of its giant copper and gold mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its economic stature is very important,'' said Hasnan Habib, a
leading analyst of political and military affairs, ``and if the
other regions see that it is easy to get free, I think it would
break us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces would never want to see Irian Jaya separate
from Indonesia,'' he added, using the territory's former name,
``and our armed forces are still powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dharmawan Ronodipuro, Wahid's spokesman, said late Sunday that
West Papua was an integral part of the country and dismissed the
independence declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Tanjung, speaker of the House of Representatives, said
during a visit to Sumatra province on Sunday that he had called
Wahid, popularly known as Gus Dur, and the commander of the armed
forces and told them the legislature supported firm actions against
any move toward separatism in any part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have expressed to Gus Dur by telephone that he should not
hesitate to take firm steps to safeguard the territorial integrity
of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia,'' he told the
state-run news agency Antara.
</P>
<P>
   Tanjung said the president assured him that he ``holds the same
stance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, who faces other separatist movements in far-flung
provinces, most notably a violent rebellion in Aceh province, said
on Saturday that while some Papuans wanted independence, the vast
majority wished to remain part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   But the independence leaders in West Papua, as well as many
other people living there, have been deeply angered by years of
perceived economic exploitation and human rights abuses at the
hands of the military, and they were unmoved by the government's
warnings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The gathering also declared that the independence flag of the
Free Papua Movement, a budding guerrilla insurgency, should be
flown throughout the province, and it called on the United States,
the United Nations and the Netherlands to mediate a dialogue with
Jakarta aimed at securing the province's separation.
</P>
<P>
   Few, however, believe that outside parties would support such a
move. Unlike the situation in East Timor, an abandoned Portuguese
colony that Indonesia invaded and annexed in the mid-1970s, West
Papua's independence movement has little international support.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations never recognized the annexation of East Timor
and is now administering the territory as it prepares for
statehood. West Papua's integration into Indonesia in the 1960s was
not internationally challenged.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, West Papua's independence movement is fractured,
and the weeklong gathering exposed deep divisions over tactics. A
majority of moderates favored peaceful negotiations with Jakarta
through international mediation, while a more radical minority
wanted the formation of a provisional government in exile.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE WINNIE PALMER AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer had never had such a terrible first round at the
Masters. America's golfer, a four-time winner at Augusta National,
had opened the 1985 Masters with an embarrassing 83, and now, as he
was about to tee off in the second round, somebody asked Winnie
Palmer if her famous husband had considered withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said, ``he considered shooting a 67.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not shoot 67 that day, but he did shoot a smooth par 72
while his wife was shooting down anybody who made the mistake of
even wondering if he might have thought about withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   That was Winifred Walzer Palmer, the woman behind the man who
put ``charge'' into the golf vocabulary, the woman who died last
Nov. 20 of abdominal cancer at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnold has had his share of good fortune in life,'' his lawyer
and agent, Mark McCormack, has said, ``and the best fortune of all
was marrying Winnie. From the beginning, she brought to Arnold an
ability to cope with the kind of problems he never knew existed.
She was astute, discerning and a realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years she was wife and secretary and business consultant.
She handled the family finances. She balanced the books, paid the
bills, made the travel arrangements, mailed the entry blanks and
devoted her entire attention to one goal: making sure that her
husband's mind was free to concentrate on his golf.''
</P>
<P>
   She also devoted herself to the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Women
and Children in Orlando, Fla., and to their hometown Latrobe, Pa.,
hospital, library and St. Vincent's College.
</P>
<P>
   In her memory, the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association
instituted the Winnie Palmer Award for ``an individual in golf who
has consistently given their time, energy and enthusiasm to those
less fortunate.'' At its national awards dinner Monday night at the
Westchester Marriott, the first recipient of the bronze sculpture
will be Barbara Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara and Jack have been our close friends for many years,''
Arnold Palmer said. ``Winnie would be as pleased as I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Nicklaus has raised more than $10 million for various
charities, including the Children's Hospital of Columbus (Ohio),
the American Cancer Society, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes
and the Chi Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winnie would be embarrassed by the award,'' said Donald
``Doc'' Giffin, the longtime aide-de-camp to Arnold Palmer, ``but
she would be delighted that Barbara's getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Walzer, Winnie's brother, remembered the Saturday morning
in 1954 he noticed his parents and 19-year-old sister talking
quietly in their Coopersburg, Pa., home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 13,'' he said, ``old enough to know that just from the
way they were talking, it was serious. The previous Tuesday night,
Arnold, who had just won the U.S. Amateur, had met Winnie at a
party for a golf tournament at Shawnee-on-Delaware, and now she was
telling my mother and father that on Friday night Arnold had
proposed to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, just before Thanksgiving, they eloped. They
were married in Falls Church, Va., near the home of Arnold's
sister, Cheech.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was all for it,'' Marty Walzer said, ``but Dad had
reservations. He came around eventually, but after Winnie and
Arnold had their two daughters, Peggy and Amy, I remember Dad
telling Arnold, `You wait and see, you'll feel the same way I
did.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Arnold's rookie year on the PGA Tour, he and Winnie traveled
from tournament to tournament with a trailer hitched to his coral
pink Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Masters,'' Marty Walzer said, ``the trailer park was
next to a drive-in movie. I sat outside the trailer and watched the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, Palmer's charisma put him centerstage as a
golfer. Then he developed into a multimillion-dollar golf
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winnie never lost her perspective; the money never changed
her,'' Marty Walzer, who owns the Pine Barn Inn in Danville, Pa.,
said. ``She was as comfortable with Mamie Eisenhower and Barbara
Bush as she was with my baker. She was so accommodating to
everyone, so genuine. I don't think she had an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnie also knew how to surprise her husband.
</P>
<P>
   On his 37th birthday, the doorbell rang in their Latrobe home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Answer it, Arn,'' she said. ``It's the TV repairman.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Arnold opened the door, he saw a golf pal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you put up an old friend for the night?'' Dwight D.
Eisenhower asked.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Palmer had arranged for Arnold's jet to pick up the
former president at his Gettsyburg, Pa., farm as well as taking
care of most of the other details of her famous husband's birthday
party.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, was Winnie Palmer.

KAFELNIKOV AND SANCHEZ-VICARIO RALLY TO ADVANCE IN FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Sunday was a day for proving points while winning them
at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario made it clear that, despite all the red
clay that has passed under her quick feet, she is still not to be
taken lightly. Venus Williams, Monica Seles and Chanda Rubin showed
that, despite injuries and occasional bouts of self-doubt, they
still belong in the second week of a Grand Slam event. And Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, despite a visit from the trainer, proved that foot
blisters do not always result in an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's normal, normal circumstances for the professional tennis
player when you have blisters on your feet, and it's a matter of
treatment I think,'' said the fourth-seeded Kafelnikov
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Andre Agassi faded meekly away after developing the
same condition against Karol Kucera in the second round. But
Sunday, Kafelnikov kept plugging and sliding away in the fourth
round, coming 2 points from defeat before finding a way to overcome
Fernando Vicente, 5-7, 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (4), 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   The day's finest comeback, however, belonged to Sanchez-Vicario,
the indefatigable Spanish veteran who trailed Austrian baseliner
Barbara Schett by 0-6, 1-4 before rallying for a 0-6, 6-4, 6-2
victory and reaching the 13th French Open quarterfinal of her
career. She has won the title here three times and, despite the
fact that a few French fans earned her wrath last week for booing
her for drop-shotting too often, this remains her favorite event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a very competitive woman; I still know that you have
to play much better than me to beat me,'' said the 28-year-old
Sanchez-Vicario.
</P>
<P>
   For her efforts, Sanchez-Vicario earned a date in Tuesday's
quarterfinals with Williams, who flirted with trouble late in the
opening set against Anke Huber before taking firm control and
winning, 7-6 (4), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling 80 percent now, and before I was about 50
percent,'' said Williams, who missed the first four months of the
season because of tendinitis in both wrists. ``I'm still making too
many errors for my taste, still inconsistent, but it's better every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The other women's quarterfinals, to be played on Tuesday, will
match top-seeded Martina Hingis against Rubin; the third-seeded
Seles against No. 6 Mary Pierce, and the No. 5 Conchita Martinez
against Marta Marrero, a fellow Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis had to shake off a disastrous second set to defeat
Ruxandra Dragomir, 6-3, 0-6, 6-1. Rubin, a Lousianan who was ranked
in the top 10 in 1996 before a serious hand injury knocked her
back, defeated Natasha Zvereva, 6-4, 7-5. Seles, suffering from
sinus problems and bronchitis but not from a lack of power or
confidence, defeated Amelie Mauresmo of France 7-5, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce overwhelmed Asa Carlsson, 6-4, 6-0. Martinez beat Ai
Sugiyama, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, and Marrero, a 17-year-old qualifier
playing in her first Grand Slam event, beat Rossana De los Rios,
4-6, 6-0, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when qualifiers had no place in the women's
game, but the depth and suspense is clearly increasing. A year ago,
Barbara Schwartz became the first women's qualifier to reach the
quarterfinals here. At last year's Wimbledon, a record three
qualifiers reached the fourth round. The 108th-ranked Marrero and
151st-ranked De los Rios reached the fourth round here this year,
but while De los Rios walked off the court an exhausted loser, she
could also be proud. In 1994, the Paraguayan took a five-year break
from the game to get married and have a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to play tennis again because one fine morning, I
woke up feeling like I wanted to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune has not often been Seles' friend in recent years. But
she arrived at this French Open in a fine frame of mind and,
despite her sinus problems that are requiring her to take
antibiotics, in very respectable shape. She needed to be against
Mauresmo's probing groundstrokes, but though Seles double-faulted
on her first match point, she got the benefit of a net cord on her
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really for me today the main thing was just to stay mentally
strong out there, because I had to fight so many things,'' Seles
said of facing the popular Mauresmo. ``It wasn't just like a
regular tennis match.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd may not be quite so partisan when she faces Pierce,
who represents France but now spends most of her time in the United
States. Pierce beat Seles, 6-1, 6-1, on her way to the title in
Hilton Head in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just see if I can rise up to the occasion; it's going to
be up to me,'' said Seles, who missed five months of action and
this year's Australian Open because of a stress fracture in her
foot.

   A tiny stress fracture in Rubin's right hand changed the course
of her career. In 1996, she reached the semifinals in Australia
and, at just 21, was considered the next great American player. But
she played little the rest of the year while doctors tried to
diagnose her problem. She had not been back in the quarterfinals of
a Slam again until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows fear now,'' said her coach, Benny Sims. ``From age
12 to 21, she didn't know any. What was there to fear? She was
black, pretty, a millionaire. I see her getting her feet back under
her now.''
</P>
<P>
   Spaniards generally have little difficulty with their footing on
clay. Along with the three women who reached the quarterfinals
Sunday, two Spanish men, Alex Corretja and Juan Carlos Ferrero also
made it to the final eight. Corretja, the No. 10 seed, defeated the
Swiss teen-ager Roger Federer in straight sets. Ferrero, seeded
16th in his first French Open, eliminated Mark Philippoussis, 6-2,
6-2, 3-6, 6-3. The two Davis Cup teammates, who will face the
United States on clay in the semifinal in Santander in July, will
face each other next.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov will face No. 5 Gustavo Kuerten, who defeated
11th-seeded Nicolas Lapentti, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4).

SPORTS COLUMN: MOST BRAVES JUST WANT RELIEF FROM ROCKER 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In their quest for serenity and maturity, the Atlanta
Braves do not permit music to be blared in their clubhouse. The
Braves are one of the classy organizations in sports, and plan to
remain so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a chemistry problem on this club, they've always
been able to cut out the cancer,'' said Chipper Jones, choosing his
words calmly and precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, throughout this elite locker room, there was
the silent scream of the Turner Field Men's Chorus, probably close
to 24 inner voices shouting in unison: Get this guy out of here!
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker probably blew his career in Atlanta Sunday in
spectacularly oafish fashion. It is hard to imagine he will be on
the Braves' roster when they travel to Shea Stadium for games from
June 30 to July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Braves sick of having to discuss his antics,
they also see him as a threat to their safety. Kevin Millwood, hit
by a flying object from an assassin-fan in Los Angeles, does not
want to stand near Rocker anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, neither do I,'' Chipper Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   They give the impression they do not want to dress near him
either. Sunday, before playing their dominators from New York, the
Braves had to deal with another outburst from the troubled man.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who got himself in trouble from a vicious stream of bile
against gays, people with AIDS, welfare mothers, people who speak
foreign languages in the U.S., minorities and other urban types,
spotted Jeff Pearlman, the reporter from Sports Illustrated who
wrote the article quoting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't over between us,'' Pearlman quoted Rocker as
saying. ``Do you know what I could do to you?''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker then demanded that two stadium security agents not allow
Pearlman into the clubhouse. The episode took no more than two
minutes, and nobody was hurt, but there was the stunning
realization that Rocker has even less control of himself in person
than on the mound _ 25 walks in 18 innings, including Sunday's
shaky inning in the 7-6 loss to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   John Schuerholz, the Braves' executive vice president and
general manager, released a statement that said, ``We immediately
began to address the matter internally and are continuing to do
so,'' adding, ``We will do everything in our power to insure that
similar incidents do not occur in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   There is only one way to guarantee that. Tom Glavine, who has
been here the longest, said he is not a psychiatrist, which tells a
lot about what the players are thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Major League Baseball accomplished nothing with the
15-game suspension to start the season. The commissioner's office
merely told Rocker to stay away from work but never got through to
his heart and soul. His parents, who are said to be good people,
have not been able to affect his hair-trigger impulses.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Rocker gets plenty of support. What kind of a
signal is it that management permits the display of the Georgia
flag with the Confederate emblem directly in front of the Braves'
dugout while the National Anthem is being played?
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Yankees were stunned to see the vast majority of
Braves' fans roar when Rocker came running in from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's home,'' said Brian Jordan, an African-American, a college
man, a leader in the clubhouse, either meaning Rocker plays for the
home team, or appeals to a nasty strain of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Rocker does not seem to have many fans left in his
own clubhouse. If the players thought this was some news-media
invention, they had the chance to scream at the reporters Sunday.
Instead, they sighed when asked why the leaders have not warned
Rocker to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been done already,'' Millwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Braves _ ``white, black, Hispanic''_ had given
Rocker a second chance. Alluding to his own history of domestic
problems, Jones said, ``I've provided some distractions myself from
time to time, and I'm not going to throw stones at John for saying
things that may have been politically incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is reasonably pragmatic, but then Jones admitted:
``Yeah, it's a pain in the butt for 24 other guys. It's something
we don't want to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones heard about Rocker's confrontation and said: ``He may feel
he was misrepresented. The professional thing would have been to
walk away. I haven't seen John do that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   One locker over, Jordan said: ``He's going to have to give this
up sooner or later. The Braves will make do, with or without John
Rocker. The general manager is too good. Bobby Cox is too good a
manager. This is something John is going to have to deal with. I'm
sure it will be soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made his bed, now he's going to have to lie in it,''
Jordan said. ``Geez, you only get nine lives. He's using them up
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves gave every impression they wanted John Rocker's life
with the Braves to be over in less than four weeks _ before they go
to New York.

YANKEES' RIVERA SAVES GAME WON BY BELLINGER'S PINCH-HIT HOME RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After seven innings Sunday, the Yankees' lead over the
Braves was one run and Manager Joe Torre was absolutely determined
to hold it, having seen the Yankees blow three leads on Saturday.
There would be no middlemen, no finessing of the bullpen, no
manipulation of matchups. Six outs remained and Torre summoned
Mariano Rivera to get them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it very badly,'' Torre said later, cheerfully, after
Rivera navigated through the final two innings, with difficulty,
clinging to a 7-6 victory. Clay Bellinger gave the Yankees the lead
with a pinch-hit home run in the top of the seventh in his first
at-bat since May 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (30-22) took two of three games from the team with
the best record in baseball and left with the self-respect that had
been stripped during Saturday's miserable defeat. Torre berated his
players in a meeting immediately following that game, angry over
their play.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of his rant might be construed as that of a venting
manager, but some players thought Torre's outburst was more
calculated than that. He singled out a handful of perceived
offenders who occupy different sectors of the roster: Roger
Clemens, a pitcher destined for the Hall of Fame; Jason Grimsley, a
middle reliever; and Bernie Williams, the cleanup hitter, center
fielder and highest-paid Yankee. If Clemens and Williams were being
chastised, others perceived, then everybody has to be accountable,
and Williams and Clemens seemed to understand what Torre was trying
to accomplish. ``We're all family,'' Torre said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   What Torre was trying to convey, his extended family understood,
was that they were not meeting their own standards; they were not
playing to their own capabilities, having lost 14 of 23 games.
``We're better than that,'' Torre told his players.
</P>
<P>
   They responded with intense desperation Sunday, Chuck Knoblauch
forcing a 10-pitch walk to open the game and ignite a three-run
burst, Tino Martinez driving in the last run with the first of his
two doubles. The Yankees scored again in the third, the fourth and
the fifth, though Paul O'Neill and Jorge Posada were out of the
lineup. And Torre thought that Andy Pettitte was pushing himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte's arm was not responding, and he could not command
the flight of the ball. The Yankees led, 4-0, in the third and
Pettitte surrendered two runs in the third. The Yankees scored a
run in the fourth; the Braves did, too. Scott Brosius slugged a
homer in the top of the fifth, Atlanta matched that in the bottom
of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez and Reggie Sanders bashed back-to-back homers in the
bottom of the sixth inning, tying the game at 6-6. It felt like
Saturday all over again, the blown leads, the inability to contain
the Atlanta offense. Torre felt his team had fought, battled. He
wanted this game, badly.
</P>
<P>
   Bellinger batted for Pettitte with two outs in the seventh, just
hoping to reach base. There was no reason to anticipate a home run;
Bellinger rarely plays, and no Yankee had hit a pinch-hit homer
since May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Mulholland threw a fastball, a strike. He threw another
fastball, same speed, same spot, and Bellinger slammed it, knowing
on contact it would clear the left-field fence. He jogged around
the bases, head down, stifling his smile until he reached the
dugout, where teammates gave him high fives and hit him on the
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley pitched the bottom of the seventh, striking out Brian
Jordan. Two innings remained. Torre turned to the pitching coach,
Mel Stottlemyre. ``What about Mo for two?'' Torre asked, using
Rivera's nickname. Stottlemyre smiled slightly when speaking.
``It's very tempting,'' he replied to Torre.
</P>
<P>
   What Stottlemyre did not say was no, and with that, Torre's
decision was made. He wanted his closer, right then, one inning
earlier than normal. ``We fought hard,'' Torre said. ``I didn't
want it to slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera retired the first two batters in the eighth easily. Bobby
Bonilla, a switch-hitter, batted for Walt Weiss _ right-handed,
against the right-handed Rivera, figuring it would be easier to
combat Rivera's cut fastball that way. He drove the ball to the
right-field corner, and catcher Chris Turner and Torre and others
thought it would land safely.
</P>
<P>
   But Shane Spencer motored in pursuit, extended his glove, caught
the ball and took two more steps before bouncing off the fence.
Rivera and others waited in front of the dugout to congratulate
him.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera got two easy outs in the ninth. Then Andruw Jones
singled. Rivera jammed Chipper Jones with a cutter, but Jones
looped the ball over Brosius' head. Andruw Jones reached third and
Chipper Jones stopped at first, ensuring that Rivera would have to
pitch to the next hitter, Andres Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if jeopardy transformed into adrenaline in Rivera's
fastball: Turner could feel the velocity increase. Galarraga took a
big swing, fouling the ball straight back: 96 miles per hour, radar
guns flashed. Another fastball, another foul, straight back: 97
mph. Rivera threw a ball outside. Turner called for a four-seam
fastball, a high fastball. Galarraga swung and missed the 97-mph
pitch, and the Yankees spilled out of their dugout to congratulate
their closer.

MILO SPERIGLIO, 62, NOTED SHAMUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milo A. Speriglio, a tireless private detective with an
unquenchable thirst for publicity and an obsession with the death
of Marilyn Monroe, died April 30 at his home in Encino, Calif. He
was 62.
</P>
<P>
   He died of lung cancer, his wife, Patricia, said.
</P>
<P>
   Speriglio, the director of Nick Harris Detectives Inc. of Van
Nuys, Calif., unabashedly modeled himself on the fictional gumshoes
Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe and was inspired to become a private
eye by the television series ``Peter Gunn,'' which ran from 1958 to
1961. He wore gold chains, cracked wise, smoked cigarettes and had
a penchant for turning up at murder sites where television crews
might be expected, notably that of Nicole Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Speriglio necessarily came across as some sort of
outsize Runyonesque character. ``Milo is half the size of Cannon,
not nearly as handsome as Mannix and a lot smarter than Barnaby
Jones,'' The Los Angeles Times reported in 1976. ``He's a quiet,
soft-spoken guy, on the small side with glasses. He could pass for
a bank clerk. But he's handled more cases than all the television
sleuths combined, about 35,000 over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a 20-year investigation he undertook on his
own beginning in 1972, Speriglio wrote three books about Marilyn
Monroe, whom he asserted was murdered in 1962 by the Mafia, at the
behest of President John F. Kennedy and his father, Joseph Kennedy
Sr. His accusations led to the opening of police files on her death
and calls for a grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After a censored version of the FBI's file on the case was
turned over to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office in
1982, prosecutors endorsed the original conclusion: that the
actress committed suicide. They said there was no need for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the evidence available to us,'' District Attorney
John Van de Kamp said at the time, ``it appears that her death
could have been a suicide or a result of an accidental drug
overdose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Speriglio continued the hunt. He wrote two more books about
Monroe's death, which he insisted added more evidence to support
his controversial contentions. He said his last book on the
subject, ``Crypt 33: The Saga of Marilyn Monroe _ The Final Word,''
which was written with Adela Gregory and published by Birch Lane
Press in 1993, should have silenced his critics and led to arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing left to tell,'' he said in a review he wrote
of his own book for the Amazon.com Web site in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of Speriglio's cases over 41 years involved normal
investigative fare, like spying on unfaithful spouses, he also
handled several other famous cases. One involved the death in 1959
of George Reeves, who played Superman in the 1950s television
series.
</P>
<P>
   The actor's mother disputed the official verdict of suicide.
Speriglio concluded that the bullets that killed Reeves were fired
from at least 16 inches away, and his opinion became a significant
part of a debate that still continues. The case, however, was never
reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Speriglio was born in Greenwich, Conn., and moved to California
when he was 3. He once told a reporter that his first case involved
a hunt for a missing panther when he was 16. A picture of him armed
with a baseball bat appeared in the local newspaper, and other high
school students began calling him Panther Boy.
</P>
<P>
   He briefly worked as a rock 'n' roll disc jockey, calling
himself Mad Milo. He then held other jobs and took criminology
courses before, his wife said, he ``burst'' onto the investigative
scene.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughters,
Janelle Speriglio of San Diego, and Holly Skodis of Burbank, and a
sister, Amelia Speriglio of Torrance, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Speriglio's genius for getting publicity was demonstrated when a
telephone company in 1975 assigned a dial-a-Santa service a number
just one digit different from the detective agency's. A few
children called the agency by mistake, and word got out that the
private eyes were more fun than the ``real'' Santa. Thousands more
children called after the story became news.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times described the Christmas scene: ``For a
famous detective, Speriglio cut a bit of a mousy figure in build,
curly hair, a gold bracelet on his wrist and an almost bashful
smile on his lips. He wore a short-sleeved red shirt and a
cone-shaped Santa's cap with a cotton ball dangling over one ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Speriglio, who believed all publicity with the correct spelling
of one's name was good publicity, explained, ``If you're going to
go undercover and play the role of someone, you have to dress the
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Speriglio's agency kept the nearly-Santa number for years.
</P>
<P>
   Another scheme by Speriglio that got a lot of holiday publicity
was the Finder of Lost Loves Reunion, which promised in the late
1980s to reunite three people with their lost loves _ by Christmas,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   As Speriglio told it, you could almost hear the ping of the
heartstrings. ``A widower in his 60s here in town asked us to find
his childhood sweetheart _ he knew only her maiden name,'' he said.
``It turned out they lived a few blocks apart. She was a widow and
they fell in love again and were married, and I was the best man.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also the time Speriglio promised to find Nicole
Simpson's killer, for whom O.J. Simpson's defense team was
incidentally offering a $500,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only I knew some voodoo that would make those trees talk,''
he said as he cruised the leafy streets of the Simpsons'
neighborhood with a Washington Post reporter. ``I do not believe
O.J. did it. Whoever did it deserves to hang. I cannot let this
woman down.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Speriglio's two-decade interest in Marilyn Monroe's
death that received the most attention. His offer of $10,000 for
her lost red diary was widely noted, if unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Always, he kept his main focus and was hardly shy about saying
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fan of Marilyn's,'' he pronounced on a book
promotion tour. ``I haven't seen her movies. And I don't read books
about her unless they mention me.''

INTERNET TV COVERAGE OF PARALYMPICS IS PLANNED 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the Summer Olympics in Sydney, NBC Sports will
carry 161 hours and MSNBC and CNBC will telecast 276{ more hours on
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, also from Sydney, Wemedia.com will Webcast at least
100 hours of the Paralympics, which are contested by disabled
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   This is not prime-time television, but Wemedia Corp., which owns
the Internet site and publishes We, a slick magazine for disabled
people from its downtown Manhattan office, is capitalizing on
advances in streaming video to bring the Paralympics to computers
from Oct. 18-29. After the Paralympics, the company plans to
Webcast two events a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create access and mobility to watch the games
for people nobody have cared about, and make it free to the
world,'' Cary Fields, Wemedia's president, said. ``The computer
makes the disabilities disappear. It's the ultimate enabler.''
</P>
<P>
   Wemedia's plans for the 18-sport Paralympics are ambitious:
three separate daily feeds of 12 hours of live events, feature and
studio coverage, from 7:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. Eastern, which would
be repeated for the next 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track and field and swimming and velodrome cycling could all
be starting at once and you can go to one for two or three hours
then switch to another,'' said Rick Gentile, the executive producer
of Wemedia Sports, who served in the same position at CBS Sports.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to shifting between three video feeds, there will be
a second screen offering a continuous flow of accompanying
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a blank slate _ an entire network to program,'' said
Gentile, who was a top programming or production executive during
CBS's telecasts of the 1992, 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics. ``And
with three feeds, we'd better be good. A lot will depend on our Web
site boys to synchronize it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Wemedia tested its technology in April at the Paralympic sailing
trials and plans more tests next month at the track and field and
swimming trials. The quality of the Webcast depends on the
capabilities of the computers receiving it as well as on the
equipment Wemedia uses to transmit the video. Nonetheless, the
quality of streaming video in general seems to improve on an almost
daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks ago, I would have said TV is TV, but this is
different,'' Gentile said. ``What works on TV doesn't necessarily
work on the Web. Pictures and graphics are smaller. But on a
laptop, where you'll have one box with a moving pictures, we can
synchronize graphics in a way that makes this unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Wemedia's primary goal is to expand the presence of the
underexposed Paralympics _ and bring new members to its web site,
which will add a much larger sports news and information component
today. But it also intends to spread the gospel about the
extraordinary skills of the thousands of athletes who are blind,
paraplegic, amputees, mentally retarded or have cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Huebner, executive director of the United States
Association of Blind Athletes, doubted the Wemedia would face a
shortage of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 300 to 400 local, regional and national events within
our own organization,'' he said. ``Wemedia is helping parents and
kids find out what events are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Pincus, the vice president of content for Wemedia Sports,
added: ``There are basketball tournaments, rugby, tennis
tournaments, sailing regattas, skiing and expedition-adventure
events. There's no question we'll have enough to do two events a
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic viewers are accustomed to network features about
athletes that often strain to find the obstacles, family tragedies
or melodramatic woes that formed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here every story smacks you in the face,'' Gentile said.
``They're all remarkable. At the dock where the athletes get on the
boats, many have to be picked up or hoisted into the boats. Then
you see 30 empty wheelchairs and prosthetic arms and legs on the
dock.''
</P>
<P>
   To advocates of the disabled, Wemedia's sports strategy fills a
long overdue void and will provide broad recognition for their
athleticism .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy to think only disabled people will watch disabled
events,'' said Deborah Bonsack, executive director of America's
Athletes with Disabilities, which promoted 190 disabled sports
events last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to think of disabled sports as sports played by
people with different physical compositions.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wemedia finds viewer success in Webcasting the Paralympics
and other events, she said: ``Folks will have a shift in opinion.
You'll hear people stop and say, `How does that amputee swimmer do
that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Imparato, president of the American Association of People
with Disabilities, said: ``Too often, the public view of people
with disabilities is a charity model, that we need to raise money
for them. But the Paralympics and Special Olympics show disabled
people achieving well beyond what people with disabilities are
supposed to be able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that many disabled people _ as well as those who
are able-bodied _ cannot afford a computer and cannot view the
Webcast of the Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
   But with the U.S. television rights, on top of its world Web
rights deal, Wemedia has a TV strategy. It is seeking a cable
partner to for daily reports, and a broadcaster for a
post-Paralympics special.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the Webcast to enhance the broadcasts,'' said Jay
Rosenstein, the vice president of programming for Wemedia Sports,
``and the broadcasts to make the public aware of the Webcast.''

ICON OF RELIGIOUS RIGHT ATTEMPTS TO TRADE IN ON HIS RENOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With JUDGES-POLITICS) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHILDERSBURG, Ala. _ Three years ago, Judge Roy S. Moore became
an icon of the Christian conservative movement by defying the order
of another Alabama judge that he remove the Ten Commandments from
the wall behind his bench and stop opening court sessions with a
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, proudly unrepentant, Moore of the Circuit Court in
Gadsden is trading on his renown to run for chief justice of the
Alabama Supreme Court, the top judicial post in the state. And days
before the Republican primary on Tuesday, leading political
observers in Alabama said he just might win.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's campaign against three Republican opponents is the
latest battle for party supremacy between the religious right and
the business community in Alabama. Last October, Christian
conservatives scored a major success by voting down the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significantly, a win by Moore would provide strong
confirmation that there are places in the country, and Alabama has
been the epicenter, where voters are simply fed up with the breadth
of the separation between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Moore taps into that discontent by arguing that many Americans,
and activist judges in particular, have misinterpreted the founding
fathers' intent. He contends that the removal of God from public
life has contributed to school shootings, an expansion of gay
rights and other examples of what he sees as moral decay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've forgotten that judges shouldn't be running around trying
to form society into something they think it should be,'' he told
members of the Kiwanis Club here last Thursday. ``They've taken
something away from us that is the most valuable thing that our
forefathers held dear, the freedom to worship God, publicly,
privately, in the manner we choose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moore, 53, does not stop at promoting himself as a strict
constructionist. Man's law, he insists, is deeply rooted in God's
law as revealed by the Holy Scriptures. Furthermore, he says, his
study of Washington, Jefferson and Madison has convinced him that
the United States is a Christian nation that was founded on
Christian principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not say it's a Christian nation by establishment,''
he said in an interview. ``In other words, you do not have to
worship God as a Christian. But that did not mean that our
principles, our foundation, our business organizations, our
fraternal and civic organizations, were not founded by Christian
principles and that Christian principles did not govern the laws of
our land.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assertions appall those who believe the First Amendment
provides absolute protection for religious minorities against the
potential tyranny of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Moore, if he's elected, must understand that it's the
Constitution and not the Bible that governs Alabama,'' said Barry
W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of
Church and State, which is based in Washington. ``His understanding
of the Constitution can only be described as bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   It is telling, however, that none of Moore's Republican
opponents have tried to depict him as extreme. Indeed, Associate
Justice Harold See of the state Supreme Court, who is also trying
to move to the chief justice's chair, has used television
advertisements to promote his own work, while a law professor, in
researching Moore's defense in the Ten Commandments case.
</P>
<P>
   Both public and private polls have consistently shown Moore with
a lead but falling below the majority needed to avoid a runoff. In
addition to See, his opponents are Judge Wayne Thorn of the Circuit
Court in Birmingham and Judge Pam Baschab of the Court of Criminal
Appeals in Montgomery. The winner will face the Democratic
candidate, Sharon Yates, in November.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial elections in Alabama are highly partisan, often pitting
business-minded Republicans who favor restrictions on tort claims
against consumer-minded Democrats who have the backing of trial
lawyers. Republicans currently hold a 5-4 majority on the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   See is the clear choice of the state's Republican political and
business leadership. He received $150,000 from the Business Council
of Alabama last month, the largest of his $1.14 million in
contributions, and has made heavy purchases of television
advertising. Moore has raised $260,000, enough to run a few
advertisements on cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has received a boost, however, from Thorn, who hopes to
squeeze into a runoff by attacking See for abandoning his seat in
order to run for chief justice. If See wins, Thorn points out, the
state's Democratic governor, Donald Siegelman, would appoint a
successor, presumably a Democrat who could reverse the partisan
majority on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Flynt, a historian at Auburn University, said he expected
Moore to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of the Republicans in Alabama,'' Flynt said,
``are George Wallace Democrats who crossed over in the culture wars
_ women need to stay in their place, we need a restoration of
morality in schools _ and Roy Moore really resonates with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of See's supporters said this week that they expected
Moore to finish first on Tuesday, though not with a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's primary political assets are his name recognition and
his reputation as a man of conviction. In 1995, the American Civil
Liberties Union sued him in an effort to remove the Ten
Commandments and end his courtroom prayers. It took nearly three
years, but by 1998 both a federal judge and the state Supreme Court
had thrown out the lawsuit on technical grounds without resolving
the underlying issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, a circuit court judge had ordered Moore to
remove the tablets and cease the prayers. Moore refused, becoming a
hero to thousands of Alabamians who held rallies in his defense. At
one point, Fob James Jr., then the governor, threatened to call out
the National Guard to defend the Ten Commandments against
court-ordered removal.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's admirers clearly like his principles and the ramrod
style he developed as a West Point cadet, a military policeman in
Vietnam and a local prosecutor. He footnotes his speeches, and his
casual conversations, with memorized recitations of historical
tracts _ letters from Madison, writings by John Locke _ almost
always to support his proposition that the founders recognized
government's subordination to God.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearances last week, Moore did not hesitate to
criticize the courts for legalizing abortion and for pushing
Vermont lawmakers to allow gay unions. Without a moral and legal
standard based on Scripture, he said, the logical extension will be
laws allowing unions between ``two men and four women,'' or between
``a sheep and a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me ask you this,'' he said. ``Are you going to pay your
tax money to support a man and a sheep on welfare? Hmmm?''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is also something of a poet. ``While truth and law were
founded upon the God of all creation, man through law now denies
him and calls it separation,'' he said, closing his Kiwanis speech.
``Children are told they can't pray in school and they teach them
evolution. Why can't they see the fear of God is the only true
solution?''

SPORTS COLUMN: A CALAMITY HURTS INTERLEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This may be viewed some day as the game that killed
interleague play. Oh, it will be tough to commit that deed, as
justifiable and as merciful as it might be, as long as Bud Selig is
commissioner. On the other hand, if Selig had been at Shea Stadium
Sunday and watched the Mets be humiliated, 15-5, by the worst team
in the major leagues, he might have different thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the potential excitement of a Mets-Yankees series,
there is a game like the one at Shea, where 43,610 fans, including
many innocent, impressionable youngsters, were subjected to a
horror show that in movie theaters would have been rated R, if not
NC-17, and on television would have carried a warning for viewers
to watch at their discretion.
</P>
<P>
   The only surprise was that the team creating most of the
viewer-discretion material was the one that is supposed to be good,
not the team they played, the one with the worst record in Major
League Baseball, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. Jones, perhaps the most critical member of the Mets'
starting rotation, was the primary perpetrator, but he had help, a
lot of it, from his friends, though with friends like these, who
needs enemies?
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Jones gave up home runs on consecutive
pitches to two players who had not previously hit a home run this
season. One, in fact, Esteban Yan, the Devil Rays' starting
pitcher, had never batted in 10 years as a professional and hit his
home run on the first pitch he had ever seen at that end of the 60
feet 6 inches between the mound and home plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Jones walked two batters in loading the
bases and setting the stage for his departure and a five-run flurry
that turned the game in the Devil Rays' favor.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Kurt Abbott and Robin Ventura, the men who
man the left side of the Mets' infield, squandered opportunities to
get double plays, adding agony to the five-run flurry.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, Rich Rodriguez hit two batters sandwiched
around an Abbott error, loading the bases and leading to another
five-run outburst, Bubba Trammell delivering the coup de grace with
a pinch-hit three-run home run against Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Now the defending World Series champion Yankees and the
perennial National League champion Atlanta Braves did not play two
sparklers Saturday and Sunday, and teams have inflicted any number
of awful intraleague games on the paying public. But if the
commissioner and his cohorts are going to try to sell interleague
games other than the obvious matchups, they are going to have to
come up with something better than Sunday's game at Shea.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Mets are going to wind up in playoff games in
October, they are going to have to come up with someone better than
Jones for their starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he's been back, he's had some real strong innings,''
Manager Bobby Valentine said, grasping for something positive to
say about Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Since he returned from a monthlong stay on the disabled list
with a strained calf muscle, Jones has started four games, emerging
with one victory, one loss, two no-decisions and a 7.59 earned run
average. That ERA beats the 16.20 he concocted in his three
pre-injury starts, but it is nothing to boast about.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Devil Rays said Jones had nothing Sunday, noting
that he struggled to get on top of the ball and suggesting that the
right-hander will have little chance for success if he continues
pitching that way. He said Jones looked like he was pitching hurt.
Valentine said that with 100 or so games left, Jones has time to
get it together. ``I'm confident he'll get it back,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   But consider the record of the pitcher in whom the Mets have
placed their faith. Three years ago almost to the day, Jones gained
his 10th victory in his 12th start of the 1997 season, reaching a
double-digit victory total faster than any Mets pitcher before him,
faster than Tom Seaver, faster than Dwight Gooden, faster than
Jerry Koosman, David Cone, Frank Viola. Since then, however, Jones
has compiled an 18-21 record.
</P>
<P>
   Warming up Sunday, Jones said, he had ``probably the best
fastball I've had this year.'' In the second inning, he threw a
fastball on a 1-2 count to Felix Martinez, and the Devil Rays' new
shortstop hit the ball over the right-field fence for two runs.
Jones threw a fastball on his next pitch, too, and the opposing
pitcher, in his maiden stance at the plate, hit the ball over the
left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martinez's home run was missed location,'' Jones said. ``I
tried to go fastball in and left it out over the plate. The pitch
to Yan, he hadn't had a bat before. You try to make a good pitch.
Anyone with a bat in their hands is dangerous. I knew when he hit
it that it was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The day only deteriorated from there.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials have not completed next season's schedule.
They can still change their minds and abandon interleague play.
Sure, the Mets and the Yankees create anticipation and excitement,
but if the Mets are going to play like they did Sunday, let the
National League's woeful members, the Phillies, for example,
benefit. Charity begins at home. &QL;

SCHWAB PLANS WIRELESS LINK ON THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to catch the wireless Internet wave, Charles Schwab the
leading discount brokerage firm, plans to let its online customers
cut the cord and do their online trading from cars, commuter trains
or even the beach, using wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which Schwab plans to announce Monday, comes more than
a year and a half after one of its main competitors, Fidelity
Investments, introduced wireless access. But so far, wireless
brokerage services have remained such a small market niche that
Schwab does not consider itself late to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the first, but we're early,'' said Dawn Lepore,
Schwab's chief information officer. ``This is a marathon, and it's
just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab plans to introduce a service called PocketBroker that
will enable its customers to maintain constant contact with their
brokerage accounts while they are away from their homes or offices.
Through two models of hand-held digital organizers made by Palm
Inc., and eventually through pagers and mobile phones that can
connect with the Internet, customers will be able to make trades
and receive messages from Schwab about stocks they track and trades
they have ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, based in San Francisco, burnished its image as a
pacesetter in the brokerage business in the last four years, when
it encouraged most of its customers to switch to trading online at
a time when investors were largely conducting business over the
phone or in person. But many competitors beat Schwab to market with
wireless trading services _ most notably the brokerage arm of
Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual funds giant, which
began offering such a feature in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while Fidelity has aggressively promoted wireless trading
and is the undisputed leader in wireless brokerage services, those
activities still account for only a sliver of the company's
brokerage business. More than 65,000 Fidelity customers have signed
up for wireless access to their accounts, but that is less than 2
percent of Fidelity's brokerage customers.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ferra, who heads Fidelity's wireless operations, said the
Fidelity Web site was visited 4 million times by Palm VII users in
May. But only a tiny part of that activity involved stock trades,
for which Fidelity collects commissions of $15 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see those figures as evidence that, until now, the
demand for stock quotes, news and information about the financial
markets has overshadowed demand for trading stocks using a wireless
device.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, a confluence of activity by wireless
equipment and network companies, Internet service providers and
publishers of news and information have given momentum to various
sorts of wireless Internet applications. And so the online
brokerage industry is stepping up its efforts. Besides Fidelity, an
FMR Corp. unit, the online brokerage services TD Waterhouse,
ETrade, Ameritrade and DLJdirect have been busy linking up with
Palm, pager makers and mobile phone service providers. The AT&AMP;T
Wireless Group, for example, is promoting the ties between its new
PocketNet wireless Internet service and Waterhouse, ETrade and
DLJdirect. Wireless access to Fidelity and Ameritrade is a featured
service of the Sprint PCS Wireless Web.
</P>
<P>
   Ferra, the Fidelity executive, said that locking up those
relationships now, as the service providers promoted their
offerings, would be critical to success as wireless catches on with
users. Fidelity, for instance, has nailed down a potentially
valuable deal with Palm, which loads wireless connection software
on every one of its Palm VII's, that company's only model so far
with a built-in wireless modem.
</P>
<P>
   When Fidelity introduced wireless access, Ferra said, it
expected only the most active traders to want it, and so it offered
the wireless service only to those with account balances of at
least $100,000. Now, anyone with a Fidelity brokerage account can
register a wireless device. Fidelity also provides delayed stock
quotes and other data free to users of certain wireless devices and
services who are not Fidelity customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firms who get out here early and create a superior product
will win this space,'' said Ferra, who calls wireless the ``second
coming of the Internet.'' He said that about 70 percent of
participants in a recent focus group indicated that they might
switch brokers if their current broker did not provide wireless
access soon.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage houses have been waging an expensive fight for
bigger shares of the fast-growing market for online investing. If
wireless access will get customers to open accounts and move
assets, firms will gladly offer it _ in the same way that
traditional Wall Street firms like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter came around last year and began offering low-commission
online trading. Morgan Stanley introduced wireless access to online
accounts earlier this year, and Merrill has said it will follow
suit before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   By then, ETrade hopes to have made its brand synonymous with
mobile trading, said Jim Safka, general manager of ETrade's
wireless effort. The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., wants to
strike deals as quickly as it can with all of the major device
makers and service providers and plans to use a big marketing
budget to heavily promote wireless, starting in the fall, Safka
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not focusing so much on it being a pure trading
device,'' he continued. Whether an investor has a use or a need for
wireless access to his brokerage firm, Safka said, ``has more to do
with someone's lifestyle than it does with their trading
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ETrade's 3 million customers make, on average, two trades a
month, Safka said. But he predicted that within four years ETrade
customers would increasingly be making connections using wireless
devices rather than stationary personal computers. ``This market is
going to take off like wildfire in the next six to 12 months,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Safka, Lepore of Schwab contends that no brokerage company
has yet gained a lasting competitive edge, because the market for
wireless financial services is only now developing in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brokerage business isn't on wireless yet,'' Lepore said.
``I don't think in five years we will look back and say that in May
2000 the die was already cast. Wireless will really take off when
more of the products are phone-based.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Schwab's PocketBroker service will not be accessible
through mobile phones. At first, it will be available for $55 a
month to users of two devices, the Palm IIIx and Palm Vx, to which
modems must be added for use with wireless services. But Schwab
said it planned soon to extend the service to two-way pagers made
by Research in Motion and later to mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with this country, the more immediate business
opportunity through mobile phones is in Europe and Asia, Lepore
said. Through an alliance with the Swedish cellular phone giant
Ericsson, Schwab is developing mobile Internet applications for use
in Britain, Japan and Hong Kong _ areas in which wireless phones
are already in wide use as portable data terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Lepore said Schwab planned to introduce wireless brokerage
service for mobile phones this fall in Hong Kong, where many
investors do all their stock trading through wireless connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This truly is a global play,'' Lepore said. ``And right now,
it's very, very early in the game.''

BATTLE OVER HUDSON RIVER POLLUTION MAY SOON END 
</HEADLINE>
   A Special Report 
 (Eds: A shorter version of this story, slugged
GENERAL-ELECTRIC-ENVIRON-ABR, is also being sent.) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A generation-long tug of war between environmental
officials and General Electric Co. over what, if anything, to do
about the Hudson River's last big chemical stain is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years of false starts and conflicting studies, the
federal Environmental Protection Agency appears poised to order a
cleanup of what it calls a persistent threat to people and
wildlife: the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, that lace the
river bottom north of Albany and contaminate many kinds of fish
throughout the river.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which has vowed to find a remedy by the end of the
year, has so far not said that it will choose to dredge up the
chemicals. But top EPA officials have strongly hinted that doing
nothing _ the option preferred by General Electric, whose factories
released over 1 million pounds of PCBs into the upper Hudson from
1946 until 1977 _ is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the only realistic alternatives to inaction,
according to many environmental experts outside the agency, is
dredging, which could range from a huge, costly project to limited
excavation of the worst hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the Hudson has nearly become the life's work of
some scientists and lawyers at the EPA and GE. Widespread
contamination of the river was first revealed in 1975, and a
197-mile stretch from Hudson Falls to the Battery in New York City
was placed on the federal Superfund cleanup list in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the EPA and New York state environmental
officials were caught between private environmental groups, which
wanted a prompt cleanup, and the company, which has used lobbying,
public relations campaigns and dozens of its engineers and
scientists to stave off dredging.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, with the river's PCB levels dropping, the federal
government chose a wait-and-see approach. In 1989, the state
prepared a dredging test, but upstate opposition killed it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the EPA has concluded that PCBs in river mud threaten
wildlife and pose a cancer risk to people who regularly eat Hudson
fish. Even though PCB levels are declining in the water and in some
fish, the agency has decided that the threat is not dissipating
fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   GE, in contrast, points to studies showing no health problems in
factory workers exposed to PCBs. And it says the river is safely
burying old PCBs under clean silt. Finally, GE contends that the
main source of fish contamination is not the old pollution but
lingering PCB leaks under its factory in Hudson Falls, which it is
plugging one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Independent scientists hold a range of opinions. Many say that
the long-lived chemicals are a peril, while others say they are
relatively benign. Some simply say the river is too complicated to
fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Bopp, a geologist at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in Troy, who has studied Hudson PCBs for 23 years,
starting with his doctoral thesis, said the delays had largely
resulted from society's desire to have scientific certainty before
starting any costly cleanup. But, he said, there rarely is a
``golden box of answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is quick to say that its case is not ironclad.
Nonetheless, its officials say, evidence of health and ecological
risks justifies moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing two years ago before a New York state Assembly
committee, Carol Browner, the EPA administrator, made one of the
strongest statements by a federal official about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have every single piece of data,'' Browner said.
``But clearly the science has spoken. PCBs are a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest, as GE does, that no action should be taken,
because some of the PCB studies may be inconclusive, flies in the
face of every decision this country has made in the last
quarter-century to protect human health and the environment,'' she
continued. ``Clearly, the time for action is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Other EPA officials stress that dredging is only one of several
possibilities, and that _ at least technically _ taking no action
is still an option.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the December announcement the last word. The EPA will
accept comments for six months before issuing its final ruling in
June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, momentum toward a solution appears to be building.
</P>
<P>
   Last week saw the conclusion of a series of peer reviews of
EPA's Hudson analysis by panels of independent scientists. Three
out of four panels with some caveats endorsed the agency's methods
and its conclusions about the health risks for people who eat fish
from the river.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the fourth panel, which assessed the agency's
calculation of the risk to wildlife, largely rejected the agency's
work as inadequate. But EPA officials said the clearly established
health risk to humans was sufficient for them to press ahead toward
a decision in December on a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   After the decision is announced, GE's options shrink. It can
fight in court, but would have to prove that the government's
remedy was ``arbitrary and capricious'' _ a daunting challenge,
many environmental lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if the company balks, the EPA can start the work on its
own and charge GE up to triple the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, GE has intensified its anti-dredging campaign. Last
month it began an anti-dredging advertising blitz in upstate
newspapers and on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   The company's lobbyists and supporters in Congress have also
been busy. Last month, language was proposed for the annual bill
containing the EPA budget that would require the agency to delay
any decision on dredging until it incorporates findings of a
forthcoming National Academy of Sciences report assessing dredging
methods.
</P>
<P>
   The report, to be released this fall, was commissioned by the
EPA under pressure from several Republican representatives.
</P>
<P>
   One staff member for a Democratic congressman said the
legislative maneuver was a ploy by GE to delay any decision until
after the presidential election, when a shift in control of the
White House could favor the company. ``It's all part of the big
stall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GE officials say that the company's efforts are intended to
ensure that the agency bases its decision on sound science.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen D. Ramsey, GE's vice president for environmental
programs _ and formerly the top environmental lawyer for the
Justice Department _ said the EPA's stance had largely been shaped
by pressure from private environmental groups, and by the notion
that a government agency had to do something concrete to prove its
worth.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the company's work to plug PCB leaks under its
factory, coupled with the natural burial of old PCBs, would solve
the problem. ``Dredging is irrelevant to the recovery of the
river,'' Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a recent spring morning in Hudson Falls, it was hard to
imagine that anything was amiss. Engorged with spring runoff, the
river rumbled over Baker's Falls before broadening and settling
down for its journey to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The foamy brown effluents from paper mills and sewage pipes that
once sullied the stream were gone. But where the river surged past
General Electric's shuttered Hudson Falls capacitor factory, the
banks were laced with pipes and the river bed was pierced by
well-drilling rigs, all designed to drain PCBs from underground
fissures. A similar cleanup was under way at another GE plant two
miles downstream in Fort Edward.
</P>
<P>
   The plants once used 10 million pounds of PCBs a year to make
capacitors, storage devices for electricity. The PCBs, which are
oily liquids, served as insulation and as a coolant. The plants had
state permits to dump up to 30 pounds of spilled PCBs a day into
the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   That dumping led to the invisible stain that represents the last
large legacy of an era when pollution flowed freely into the
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the permits, New York state ruled in 1976 that GE had
violated water quality laws. The company signed a settlement in
which both it and state contributed $3 million for cleanup work,
and GE paid another $1 million for research.
</P>
<P>
   But that cleanup focused on the factories and river banks. The
debate about the river itself was unresolved, and once the Hudson
became a federal Superfund site, it intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Part of GE's effort has been to generate volumes of research
about the river and PCBs, spending many times more than the $16
million spent by the EPA since 1990. (The company says it has spent
$160 million on research and its cleanup so far, but officials
decline to be more specific.)
</P>
<P>
   It has meticulously dissected the river banks near its plants.
John G. Haggard, GE's manager for the Hudson cleanup, said that in
the last eight years, as the company plugged cracks in the cliffs,
the amount of PCBs leaking from the factory grounds dropped to 3
ounces a day, from 5 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   According to GE's analysis, it is these freshly leaking PCBs
that settle on the bottom and enter fish, leading it to conclude
that plugging the leaks would end the problem.
</P>
<P>
   CONFLICTING DATA, PREVAILING CAUTION
</P>
<P>
   To the EPA, the GE effort to clean its sites is welcome and
essential, but a sideshow. Farther south, in the mud under a
40-mile stretch of broad, relatively placid waters, lie tons of
PCBs that flowed from the plants in decades past.
</P>
<P>
   After years of drilling mud cores and running computer studies
of the way silt accumulates, EPA scientists have concluded that
these buried PCBs pose the greatest continuing threat.
</P>
<P>
   GE's experts disagree, saying the old deposits are decomposing
and are too deeply buried to pose a risk. Essentially, the company
and the environmental agency have distinct visions of the river and
the way PCBs affect it.
</P>
<P>
   Their stances on the health hazard from PCBs are just as far
apart. That gap was illustrated earlier this year in Saratoga
Springs, at a debate between two scientific powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
   One was Dr. V. James Cogliano, a top official at the EPA center
for environmental assessment. The other was Dr. Renate D.
Kimbrough, a pathologist who in the 1970s published one of the
first studies linking PCBs to cancer in animals. Now, though _ in a
study partly paid for by GE but reviewed by independent scientists
_ she found no hint of a greater incidence of cancer in the medical
histories of 7,000 GE workers with varying amounts of exposure to
PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   Cogliano pointed out that few of the workers had been exposed to
high PCB levels. He described many animal studies showing a cancer
link, and human studies showing learning problems in children who
nursed from mothers who ate PCB-tainted fish. Kimbrough proceeded
to poke provocative holes in some of that work.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the evening ended with no clear winner.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the audience, Peter Tarana, a chemistry professor at
Adirondack Community College, in Queensbury, explained that he had
served on a state panel examining a proposed site for a landfill
for dredged PCBs. Upstate opponents defeated the plan and the
dredging never happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got here is a lot like what we had 10 years ago,''
Tarana said. ``You've got conflicting data, reputable people _ so
what's a decision-maker to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Cogliano said certainty was never likely when a risk to public
health was being weighed. He said the evidence supported a cautious
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can either wait and wonder or you can try to be
protective,'' he said. ``We tend to be protective in the face of
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   A LARGE EMPLOYER PROVES PERSUASIVE
</P>
<P>
   General Electric has certainly not been content to wait. It has
lobbied long and hard since the early days of the PCB issue. In
1976, when New York was pursuing violations against GE for its PCB
dumping, Gov. Hugh Carey pressed his environmental commissioner to
quickly negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Carey explained that the urgency came
from a meeting he had one day with Reginald Jones, then the company
chairman. ``Jones was adamant,'' Carey recalled. ``If we blamed GE
entirely, he was going to move 55,000 people out of the state _ and
he could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   GE got its settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, the company has pulled no punches to prevent a
costly cleanup. The public relations work has focused mainly on the
upper reaches of the Hudson, where GE is a large _ though shrinking
_ employer and where many communities, for various reasons, are apt
to side with it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, many rural communities and landowners have a
longstanding fear that the government will order someone else's
hazardous waste entombed in landfills near their property.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has never been very successful at wooing
supporters close to New York City and its suburbs. There, groups
like Riverkeeper and Hudson River Sloop Clearwater have managed to
portray the conflict as an earthy David vs. a buttoned-down
Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the environmental groups have struggled to maintain
momentum, particularly because the river's most visible pollution _
sewage, dyes and other factory discharges _ is a fading memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It horrifies me that it's taken so long,'' said Cara Lee,
environmental director for Scenic Hudson. Lee has been embroiled in
the PCB debate since 1983. ``This is the largest PCB contamination
site in the country, and yet people who live here seem to have
blinders on.''
</P>
<P>
   A GOVERNMENT AGENCY CAUGHT IN BETWEEN
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed in the middle, the EPA's regional staff is struggling
to find an approach that will avoid future legal challenges from
either side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very heated issue _ people here don't think in
compromising terms,'' said Richard L. Caspe, who directs the
agency's toxic-cleanup section in New York. ``We're probably going
to get killed whatever decision we make.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency would begin announcing aspects of its cleanup
proposal late this summer. With the consequences of the decision so
substantial, plenty of people will be eager to listen.
</P>
<P>
   If dredging is chosen, GE would have to pay for it, which could
run into hundreds of millions of dollars. Under Superfund law, the
company could also be billed for the damage to natural resources _
like the river's commercial fishery, which was shut down because of
PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   And communities along the most contaminated stretch of river,
from Troy north for 40 miles to Hudson Falls, could see years of
disruptive excavation.
</P>
<P>
   Many elected officials and residents upriver oppose dredging,
but some business owners who rely on boating and tourism are eager
to see the pollution removed. Channels along parts of the canal
linking the Hudson to Lake Champlain are clogged because no
dredging has been allowed until the EPA has a cleanup plan.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one thing that GE, environmental groups and
some scientists agree on: that there are serious problems with the
way the country handles complicated toxic cleanups.
</P>
<P>
   Bopp, the Rensselaer geologist, said the Superfund process
requires the EPA to summarize the entire Hudson River problem in a
single, enormous document.
</P>
<P>
   But the river is a variegated system. Some parts are easy to
understand, and others are impossibly complex. A better approach,
he said, might be to go at it mile by mile, cove by cove. ``You
could come up with a way to clean cove 10, and then maybe get to
cove 16 and there GE would resist, but at least you would have
accomplished something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the EPA decides, Bopp said, the battle over the
Hudson provides a lesson on the errors of the past _ of a business
routinely dumping waste in a river and regulators routinely
allowing it to happen. ``Will my daughter be writing her Ph.D.
thesis on PCBs in the Hudson?'' Bopp said. ``I hope not. My biggest
hope is that we'll never see anything like it again, that we'll
file this away and learn from our past mistakes.''

TEEN-AGE PITCHER HOMERING IN FIRST AT-BAT STARTS ROUT OF METS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To lose to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays Sunday, the Mets
had to summon up demons that had been chased away long ago in the
Bobby Valentine regime.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays tormented the Mets in a 15-5 victory _ the
highest score against the Mets this season, and equaling Tampa
Bay's record.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine yielding a home run to a pitcher who had never been to
the plate in his professional career _ on the first pitch he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Or imagine seeing the Gold Glove third baseman Robin Ventura,
distracted by a broken bat that arrived at the same time as a
ground ball, throwing the ball away to start a five-run sixth
inning that broke open the game.
</P>
<P>
   Later that inning, Ventura, as well as shortstop Kurt Abbott,
bobbled balls that could have resulted in inning-saving double
plays.
</P>
<P>
   And to top it off, the Devil Rays scored an additional five
unearned runs two innings later after loading the bases on two hit
batsmen and an error.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets, who captured the first two games of the weekend
series, get another chance Monday night against another weak
American League team when the Baltimore Orioles come to Shea for a
three-game series. And then there is the annual interborough soap
opera against the Yankees next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had started this series with baseball's second-best
record (30-21) in the history of interleague play. They also have
been a very successful home team this season, winning almost twice
as often as their opposition. And the Devil Rays? One of baseball's
worst teams, quite simply, a team that won only once in every three
games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devil Rays unveiled some surprises, including a hitter
named Estaban Yan. He was also the starting pitcher, though he had
never had an at-bat in a professional game. Not even in the minors,
and certainly not in his previous 132 games in the major leagues.
Sure, he said in a charming accent, he had at-bats before ``in
school in the Dominican.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Valentine was assessing Yan as a hitter. After
all, what did the Mets know about this 25-year-old who had never
been to the plate?
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect the guy today isn't a hitter,'' Valentine said.
``He's never done the National League thing and he's a young
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the second inning, the Mets starter Bobby J. Jones could
be forgiven if he thought he had an easy out, especially after
Felix Martinez had launched a two-run home run (on a 1-2 pitch) to
propel the visitors to a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Yan, oblivious to the fact that only 11 pitchers in
the history of baseball had ever homered in their first at-bat, and
none had done it in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `I got a chance,''' Yan said. ``I feel
comfortable. I feel I want to swing at the first pitch. He try to
throw a strike. He figures I'm an easy out.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on the first pitch he had seen in an at-bat in a game
since his teen-age years, and after seven seasons of pro ball, Yan
swung at the first pitch, a fastball. He drilled it almost 370 feet
over the left-center field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to throw a fastball down the middle by any
means,'' Jones said. ``Anyone with a bat in his hands is
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   That 3-0 edge, though, does not mean much for a team that
struggles as much as the Devil Rays do. Jones recovered to pitch
three straight scoreless innings, and the Mets scored four times to
take a 4-3 lead into the sixth. Mike Piazza, in his second game
back after being sidelined with a concussion, knocked home two of
the runs.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the Devil Rays' five-run assault in the sixth.
They knocked out Jones, the eventual loser, even though he said he
had felt better about his fastball and slider Sunday than he had
previously this season.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Pat Mahomes, who followed Jones, was lifted for a
pinch-hitter in the seventh. And then his relief, Rich Rodriguez,
was the victim of his own and his teammates' sloppiness in the
crushing eight inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit two players. Abbott threw a ball away. That set
the stage for the five unearned runs, including Bubba Trammell's
third pinch-hit homer of the season, a three-run blast.
</P>
<P>
   Yan, who got the victory for his five-inning stint, was
magnanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Told about Valentine's assessment, the pitcher said, ``He may be
right. Maybe I got lucky this time. I'm very excited.'' &QL;

   KAFR SHUBA, Lebanon _ Sweet things can grow in the rocky soil of
south Lebanon. Before the civil wars that raked the people from the
land and the Israeli occupation that drove a wedge between those
who remained, its terraced farms once yielded a bounty of plump
cherries, grapes and apricots.
</P>
<P>
   Little but enmity and wild roses have been cultivated since in
villages like Kafr Shuba, a jumble of houses atop a steep hill
where a brisk wind always blows. Now this swath of liberated
Lebanon, bombed and conquered and then governed until late May by
the South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed militia, is reaping the
bitter harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nine-mile-deep border strip that Israel maintained as
a military buffer zone for 22 years, every village and town has its
tales of divided families and estranged neighbors, of a household
that made its accommodation to the occupation while the one next
door persisted in stubborn resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Take Ali Komra, a lean, sun-weathered former police officer of
52. He lost his younger brother during those unhappy years _ first
to the ranks of the South Lebanon Army, which Komra considered a
bunch of mercenary traitors, and then to a roadside bomb planted by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in its guerrilla war against
the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Komra, a retiree living in a home he rebuilt over the rubble
left from an Israeli bombing raid in 1970, said he had begged his
brother to run away from the $500-a-month paycheck offered by the
Israelis. He argued that even a stint for desertion in the
notorious prison run by the South Lebanon Army in the nearby town
of Khiam was a better fate than collaboration with a foreign
occupier.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger man shrugged aside the appeals _ and Komra
finally turned his back on him.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Hezbollah bomb ripped his brother apart on a
deserted road in 1993, Komra refused to bend. Repelled at the
thought of rubbing shoulders with his dead brother's commanders, he
broke every convention of his village culture and refused to attend
the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do regret it,'' he said, while inspecting a tiny field of
wheat and barley that he has tried to revive in a small valley
outside the village, just behind the Israeli border. ``After all,
he was my brother. But I couldn't go. The way I felt, who I was, I
just couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   This part of south Lebanon closest to the Israeli border has
been a battleground for years. In the 1970s Palestinian guerrillas
used its rugged landscape for attacks on Israel and provoked
devastating reprisals against the villages that sheltered them.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the retribution from Lebanese Christian militias in
the south that allied themselves with Israel to overpower the
majority Muslim and Druse population.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and 1982. When the main body of
Israeli troops withdrew in 1985, they held on to the buffer zone
along the border. To administer the area and protect the border
from attacks by Hezbollah and others, Israel set up the South
Lebanon Army as a formal civil administration and security
structure.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Israelis and about 6,000 men from that group and
their families scrambled out of the zone recently, the South
Lebanon Army had evolved from a right-wing Christian militia to a
more representative organization.
</P>
<P>
   Its top commander, Antoine Lahd, was a Maronite Christian. But
like south Lebanon as a whole, it eventually had more Shiite
Muslims than Christians in its ranks. In areas populated by the
Druse sect or, like Kafr Shuba, by Sunni Muslims, it recruited from
those groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli occupation was enforced against Lebanese by
Lebanese, and over the years it corroded social relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no more trust left,'' said Muhammad Ahmed Hassan, a
retired Lebanese army officer who lives in Kafr Shuba. ``On the
surface we would say all the nice things, the traditional things,
but they were just words. Underneath there was nothing anymore. We
drew away from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   South Lebanese Army security men lived in the same
neighborhoods, perhaps attended the same schools, as men and women
they imprisoned without trial. Contacts with someone in the group
could not be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   It not only patrolled the zone, but also collected utility
bills, operated phone networks and decided who received the coveted
passes to travel in and out of the so-called security zone.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, its command would send out a demand for more
foot soldiers. Lists would be drawn up by the local officers who
knew the villagers. Bonuses were given for new conscripts.
</P>
<P>
   With south Lebanon's economy devastated by war and isolation
from the rest of the country, steady work with the Israeli-backed
militia was sometimes more attractive than abstract nationalistic
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Pure financial desperation led Nazem Adel Alayin to join the
group as a foot soldier about six years ago, said his wife, Afifi
Adri. He had five children to support _ the couple has nine now _
but no land to cultivate and no job.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the order to present himself to officers at the South
Lebanon Army post in the nearby city of Hasbeya.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `You have to work with us; we need you and we can
help you with money,''' Mrs. Adri recalled. ``At first he didn't
tell me what it was all about. He just came home and stormed around
and acted angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second time they called him in, they told him he could
either join or he could go to jail or he could leave _ those were
his only choices. So he thought about things, and the third time
they asked him, he said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Adri has been anxiously making the rounds of her neighbors
in Kafr Shuba lately, effusively congratulating them on the end of
the Israeli occupation and professing joy that the group's reign is
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never friction here,'' she insisted. ``In this
village people are very understanding. My children were never
harassed.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are scars that may not heal so easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were afraid of the Lahd people,'' admitted Talal George
Khalil, 42, a school principal from the Christian village of
Rasheiye, a few miles from Kafr Shuba. ``We knew them because they
were from around the area. And when I would run into one of them, I
would smile and I would say: `How are you? Have a coffee. Sit down
with me. How are you doing?' Just because I was afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   His fawning did not protect him. He was imprisoned in one of the
musty crowded cells in the Khiam jail seven months ago _ as two his
brothers had been before him _ and was there when his third child,
a daughter, was born.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not been told why he had been detained, but
speculated that it was simply because South Lebanon Army officials
suspected, rightly, that he was in favor of the armed militias
fighting the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   He was freed, with another 145 prisoners, by Khaim residents on
the day of the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil said he bore no grudge against people who worked with the
South Lebanon Army for the money. ``But some of them are criminals
and they tortured people,'' he added. ``Nobody forced them to do
that. Israel didn't tell them what to do, but they treated people
badly because they felt like it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in the end, the petty cruelties that came with the South
Lebanon Army's petty power over other Lebanese that are remembered
with the deepest anger. For three years, Hassan said, he was not
permitted to travel outside the security zone.
</P>
<P>
   He could not say goodbye to a brother who died in a Beirut
hospital. His wife could not attend her father's funeral. Their son
was imprisoned, losing his chance to attend a military academy in
Beirut, in another attempt to put pressure on the father.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan's wife, who has only one kidney, had a heart attack, then
a breakdown under the stress, and she was at last allowed to go
outside the zone for treatment. There, she could also do what
Hassan could not: attend the wedding of their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother of the bride always has to be happy and has to
dance for her daughter,'' said Hassan, beginning to weep as he
recalled what happened. ``All she could do was walk once around the
hall and leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when she came back here, they immediately called her to
the Lahd headquarters, and they said, `Whatever happens to you, we
will never give you another pass. If you are so ill, why were you
dancing at your daughter's wedding?'''

MARY JENKINS LANGSTON, 78, ELVIS PRESLEY'S COOK 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Jenkins Langston, who cooked for Elvis Presley for 14
years, serving him meatloaf, banana icebox pie and his beloved
fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches, died at a Memphis
hospital on Tuesday. She was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Her caretaker said the cause was complications after two
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that the only thing in life he got any enjoyment out
of was eating,'' Langston said in ``The Burger and the King,'' a
1996 British Broadcasting Corp. documentary on Presley's eating
habits. ``And he liked his food real rich.''
</P>
<P>
   She cooked the meals in king-size proportions: cheeseburgers,
chicken-fried steaks, hamburger steaks, caramel cakes and
family-size bowls of banana pudding.
</P>
<P>
   ``For breakfast, he'd have homemade biscuits fried in butter,
sausage patties, four scrambled eggs and sometimes fried bacon,''
she said. `I'd bring the tray up to his room, he'd say, `This is
good, Mary.' He'd have butter running down his arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Langston became more than hired help. Over the years, Presley
bought her four cars and a three-bedroom home. Last week, The
Memphis Commercial Appeal quoted Jerry Schilling, long a part of
Presley's entourage, as saying, ``After a while when someone's
there on a daily basis, they become family, and that's how Elvis
thought of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Langston served everyone in Graceland, she reserved a
special place for its monarch. She knew he wanted his food prepared
lightning-fast and raced to his bedroom, where he devoured the food
from a tray as he sat in bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the rest of us were sitting in the kitchen starving to
death, she'd be upstairs talking to Elvis,'' said Richard Davis,
one of Presley's former bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Though legends spread around the globe about the scope of
Presley's palate, Langston knew the truth. ``It's not true that
Elvis liked burnt bacon sandwiches,'' she told The South Bend
Tribune at an Elvis festival two years ago. ``He liked his bacon
very crisp.''
</P>
<P>
   Details about Langston were scarce. Her only survivor, a nephew,
Fate Mosley, whom she raised, did not know her birthplace or exact
birth date. She was married from sometime in the 1980s until her
husband died about three years ago. The couple had no children.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Langston moved from the house Presley bought
for her to an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Langston started working for the Presley family as a maid in
1963. When Priscilla, Presley's new bride, arrived at Graceland
three years later, she promoted Langston to cook, saying they had a
similar preference for homestyle beef and vegetable dishes. After
Elvis Presley died in 1977, Langston stayed on to cook for the
family for 12 more years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Langston wrote a book about her experiences called
``Memories Beyond Graceland Gate,'' using just her maiden name,
Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Her domain was a wood-paneled kitchen with harvest gold and
avocado appliances, which was added to the Graceland tour in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   According to the BBC documentary, Presley's love of food went
back to his impoverished childhood in Tupelo, Miss., during which
his family sometimes ate squirrel. He never took to filet mignon
and caviar, but remained fond of pigs feet, collard greens,
chitlins and the other foods of his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when Presley was hospitalized and on a restricted diet,
Langston smuggled in bags of hot dogs and sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   Presley's cook could also handle new taste sensations, but it
sometimes took experimentation and cooperation with others. One
morning, Priscilla Presley once said, Elvis asked to try what
became his favorite snack after returning from a tour, fried peanut
butter and banana sandwiches. She tried five times but could not
get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Langston tried several ways of decking white bread with thin
banana slices and peanut butter, then grilling it. Presley rejected
them all.
</P>
<P>
   Then his father, Vernon, suggested toasting the bread before
putting it in the skillet. It worked, though grilling the bread to
Presley's taste meant using two sticks of butter for every three
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be just floating in butter,'' Langston said at an Elvis
commemoration. ``You'd turn it and turn it and turn it until all
the butter was soaked up; that's when he liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   After work, Langston returned home to cook for family and
friends. ``They had peanut butter and banana sandwiches at
Graceland, and we had them too,'' Mosley, her nephew, said. ``And
they were good.''

 &HT;    Where Lemieux goes, Cups follow
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ During the Eastern Conference finals, the Philadelphia
Flyers made the fatal mistake of poking fun at Claude Lemieux's
spelling. They should have known better. You don't agitate the
NHL's No. 1 agitator.
</P>
<P>
   Early in New Jersey's series with the Flyers, Lemieux tried to
get under the skin of Philadelphia captain Eric Desjardins by
saying, ``What's the `C' stand for? Selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Lemieux can spell in French a whole lot better than he can
in English. But when it comes to Lemieux, C' stands for only one
thing _ Cup. That's Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux has already played on three Cup winners. This could be
his fourth. The Devils lead the Stanley Cup finals 2-1 going into
tonight's Game 4 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   If New Jersey captures its second championship in six years,
Lemieux will become the first player to win a Cup, get traded to a
team that wins another, then return to the old team and win again.
</P>
<P>
   Confusing? Perhaps. But Lemieux has always been at his best in
the postseason, when the games mean the most.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, 34, broke in by winning a Stanley Cup as a rookie with
Montreal in 1986, scoring 10 playoff goals. Then he was the Conn
Smythe Trophy winner as postseason MVP in 1995 when he scored 13
goals and New Jersey swept Detroit in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just incredible my name will be on it,'' Lemieux said at
the time. ``To be the most hated man in hockey and have your name
on the Conn Smythe Trophy is really special.''
</P>
<P>
   But before the next season, Lemieux was traded to Colorado after
a falling-out with general manager Lou Lamoriello. What did the
Avalanche do? Win the Cup in Lemieux's first season, beating
Florida. A year later, when Colorado lost in the Western Conference
finals, Lemieux had 13 playoff goals.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux wore out his welcome in Colorado, too. But after
watching his team bomb in the playoffs since 1995, Lamoriello
decided the Devils needed Lemieux back. The deal was made early
this season, with the postseason in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, who is an unrestricted free agent after the season,
ranks sixth in the NHL in career playoff games (218) and eighth in
goals (80). His 19 game-winning goals trail only Wayne Gretzky (24)
and Brett Hull (21).
</P>
<P>
   After four goals and five assists in the first three rounds,
Lemieux has been quiet in the Stanley Cup finals. Quiet in scoring,
that is. He is never quiet on the ice. Or angelic. If ever a player
belonged on a team called the Devils, it's Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   He is nicknamed ``Pepe'' _ as in Pepe LePew, the cartoon world's
most famous skunk.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Hockey 101, according to Pepe Lemieux:
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to hit somebody as hard as you can. If he's shaken up,
or if he's going to miss a shift or two, or he's worrying he's
going to get hammered again, then you've done your job. You'll
whack somebody sometimes, maybe just give a guy a slash, maybe 15
seconds of little shooting pain. That takes him off his game.''

 &HT;    Rocker rants at reporter
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nearly 5 1/2 months after the fact, John Rocker
finally made his editorial response to Sports Illustrated. It was
no love sonnet.
</P>
<P>
   In a chance encounter outside the Atlanta clubhouse Sunday
morning, Rocker dressed down SI writer Jeff Pearlman, accusing him
of portraying the Braves closer in the worst possible light and
making a veiled threat that the issue is not settled.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting Pearlman in the tunnel outside the Braves clubhouse at
around 11 a.m., Rocker quickly turned his cap around to get it out
of the way, then positioned himself inches from the writer's face.
For the next two minutes and 45 seconds, Rocker backed Pearlman
across the walkway with a steady stream of invective.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was witnessed by three newspaper reporters and a
Yankees broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'It's not over with you and me,' `` said Pearlman,
who had been in town all weekend covering the Yankees-Braves
series.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Turner Field visit this year for Pearlman, who
wrote the December story that portrayed Rocker as an angry young
man with disparaging views on race and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Rocker poked a finger at the tip of Pearlman's
nose, grazing him the last time before storming off to the
clubhouse. He returned moments later with a security guard, whom he
instructed to keep Pearlman from entering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a choice,'' Rocker said. ``and you chose to f--- me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Rocker's second heated exchange with a media member since
returning from his suspension. The first, an April on-field
encounter with WAGA sportscaster Jeff Hullinger, almost came to
blows.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment afterward, Rocker declined, saying, ``Do I
ever?''
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz also declined to discuss
the incident but issued a statement that said, ``We will do
everything in our power to ensure similar incidents do not occur in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But happening as it did, with a New York press crops in town,
the Braves were again left to explain their puzzling pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pain in the butt for the 24 other guys,'' said third
baseman Chipper Jones, ``and it's not something we like to deal
with.''

<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ Jose Patino Moreno was unusually well-versed
in the risks of his work as a narcotics investigator. He had seen
colleagues killed by drug traffickers, and he had seen traffickers
bribe their way free.
</P>
<P>
   He had watched raid after raid compromised by corrupt officials.
He even lost his job for a time after a senior official in league
with smugglers grew displeased with his efforts against the drug
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Patino pressed on, friends said, partly because he believed
someone at some point would finally make headway in the fight
against organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   But late on the morning of April 10, months after taking charge
of a new team set up to pursue Mexico's most-wanted drug suspects,
he and two other officials were abducted as they drove here from
San Diego. Their badly tortured bodies were found the next day in a
desert ravine.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks surrounding Patino's death, the Mexican authorities
have made their most significant progress in years against the the
Tijuana-based gang he had come to fight, run by the Arellano Felix
brothers. And Mexican officials have suggested that the deaths of
Patino and his two colleagues might foster the success that they
could not achieve themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blood of our friends was not spilled in vain,'' Attorney
General Jorge Madrazo promised his subordinates at a service for
the three. ``The hour has come to act and to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost as quickly, questions have emerged among U.S.
officials and others about how the offensive has been carried out
and whether it will be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Although Madrazo and his federal police have taken much of the
credit for the most important blows landed in the new offensive _
the arrests of two of the drug organization's presumed leaders _
officials say the attorney general's office had almost no role in
either action. Nor do those arrests appear to have involved much
work by American law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, officials said privately, the man accused of running the
day-to-day operations of the gang, Ismael Higuera, was tracked down
by Mexican civilian and military intelligence officers who received
unusually good information from the Central Intelligence Agency.
The capture a few weeks earlier of a powerful uncle of the Arellano
brothers was the work of a military intelligence unit that the CIA
trained and supported, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they have seen no clear sign of a change
in the loyalties of Mexican officials or institutions linked to the
drug traffickers' protection.
</P>
<P>
   Some terrified Mexican drug agents here even asked to be
reassigned after Patino's death, officials said, and the government
has denied reports that other agents quit rather than be sent here.
</P>
<P>
   The push in the state of Baja California comes after a long
stretch of frustration. Last year, the number of drug seizures was
mostly down, the government's promises to extradite drug suspects
to the United States was unfulfilled and official corruption was
widespread. Only last fall, American officials were despairing that
the Mexican authorities had effectively given up in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Then the prosecutor who heads the long-running federal inquiry
in San Diego, Gustavo P. Curiel, and his new boss, U.S. Attorney
Gregory A. Vega, decided to fly to Mexico City to meet with
Madrazo. ``We figured that unless we re-engaged with the Mexicans _
unless we did something _ nothing was going to happen,'' Vega said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Madrazo and his drug enforcement chief said they
would begin a new campaign against the Arellanos. Mexican
prosecutors and military officials agreed to focus on different
leaders of the gang, and Madrazo put Patino, 49, in charge of his
side of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Pepe Patino, as his friends called him, was in some ways an
obvious choice. He had worked intermittently on the Arellano case
since 1993, when the gang was blamed for killing a Roman Catholic
cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Although American law enforcement officials are generally loath
to vouch for their Mexican counterparts, Patino had earned a
reputation for honesty on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you needed any kind of help, he was there,'' said Reid C.
Pixler, a federal prosecutor in Phoenix who worked closely with
Patino. ``He was absolutely courageous. He was extremely bright. He
did everything he ever promised and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Patino rushed to the scene on March 3, 1994, after Mexican
federal agents working under a young police commander, Alejandro
Castaneda, caught up with a man they believed to be Ismael Higuera
and one later identified as the youngest of the Arellano brothers,
Francisco Javier, in Tijuana. When Castaneda ordered the men to
surrender, they and their bodyguards opened fire, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview years later, Patino said he argued bitterly with
state justice officials over the custody of the suspects. After a
tense standoff, the state officials took the men away, only to
allow them to sneak out the back entrance of a state police office
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the way things were,'' Patino recalled.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the federal police team with whom Patino worked, it was the
latest in a long series of mishaps and frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got their clocks cleaned in Tijuana,'' recalled Alex M.
Romero, an American drug enforcement agent who worked with Patino's
group on several cases in the early 1990s. ``That was definitely
their Waterloo.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after Castaneda was killed, the shock of his death
was swept aside by the assassination here of the governing party's
presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio. Patino's team was
pulled back to Mexico City. Then, after a shake-up in the attorney
general's office, the team was disbanded by a senior official who
was later found to have worked for the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Patino returned to the federal anti-drug force in 1997. United
States officials were strongly encouraged when he was named to lead
the new push in Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also took it as an indication of Mexico's
seriousness that Patino and a few colleagues had decided to work
from San Diego rather than Tijuana _ farther from the prying eyes
of other Mexican officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the supposed priority and evident danger of their
mission, it took Patino months to obtain financing from Mexico City
to rent a house, and his pleas for an armored car were answered
only by promises.
</P>
<P>
   Working closely with agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration, Patino and
his colleagues began compiling addresses and seeking search
warrants for safe houses, law offices and other businesses that the
traffickers used.
</P>
<P>
   The team had not gotten far, officials said, when word came on
March 11 that members of the army's drug intelligence unit had
captured the Arellanos' uncle and reputed confederate, Jesus Labra
Aviles, a wealthy Tijuana executive.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials later speculated that Patino had been
made a target by the Arellanos for his role in helping to transport
Labra to a high-security prison outside Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   But a Mexican official who worked closely with him said Patino
appeared to have drawn the traffickers' attention in long battles
over search warrants in the notoriously corrupt courts here.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues of Patino said he had been acutely aware of the
dangers he had faced. But because of a longstanding dispute between
Mexico and the United States over whether agents of one country
working in the other could carry guns, Patino and the two other
officials were unarmed when they drove to Tijuana from San Diego on
April 10.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a short distance from the border crossing to a
federal police office where they kept their weapons. Along the way,
officials said, the three men were intercepted by perhaps 10 others
who were heavily armed and clearly knew their routine.
</P>
<P>
   The three were tortured with a brutality that immediately led
officials to suspect Higuera, 38, who has a considerable reputation
for savagery. The men were cut with knives, beaten with bats or
pipes and run over with a large truck. The heads of two are thought
to have been crushed in a pneumatic press.
</P>
<P>
   Higuera, indicted in federal court in San Diego on charges of
conspiring to ship tons of cocaine into the United States, was
captured on May 3. Mexican police officials said they had helped
arrest him at a house near the port city of Ensenada after
neighbors had reported a wild party.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said he had been caught in a complex operation in
which Mexican intelligence agents, set in motion by the CIA, had
tracked his Colombian girlfriend and a friend of hers.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they had growing evidence that Higuera
had been captured by the Mexican military a month before in
Mazatlan, the western resort city, only to be freed by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's office denied that. But its account was publicly
challenged by a spokesman for the Defense Ministry and an army
general in Baja California.

THIS WEEK'S TV HIGHLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
TODAY: Summer's version of ``Monday Night Football,'' without all
the talk of Rush Limbaugh joining the gang in the booth. And one of
the storylines should be Devils goalie Martin Brodeur, who made
Brett Hull and Mike Modano look like Ice Capades rejects on their
home damp floor in Game 3. Brodeur even got so bored with things he
flipped the puck over the glass with four minutes left and drew a
penalty -- just so he could kill it himself. NHL finals Game 4: New
Jersey at Dallas, Channel 7, 5 p.m. (ABC has the rest of the
series: Thursday's Game 5 at New Jersey and Saturday's Game 6 at
Dallas, if necessary, both at 5 p.m.) 
TUESDAY: Gotta admit, our interest in this interleague concept
starts to wane after the Dodgers-Angels weekend series. MLB:
Dodgers at Texas, Fox Sports West 2, 5:35 p.m.; San Francisco at
Angels, Fox Sports West, 7:05 p.m. (Channel 5 has Dodgers' Monday
game at 5:35 p.m., while FSN2 has Wednesday's series finale at
12:05 p.m.; FSW has Angels' Monday and Wednesday games at 7:05
p.m.) 
WEDNESDAY: This just in: NBC has broken format and agreed to
televise an important sporting event live, not just tonight, but
for the rest of the series. May sweeps must be over. NBA Finals
Game 1: Indiana at Lakers/Portland, Channel 4, 6 p.m. 
THURSDAY: Tonight's MTV Movie Awards show won't have Dennis Rodman
or Shaquille O'Neal to kick around. We'll have to be content with
another odd event - this rain make-up game at Dodger Stadium. MLB:
Houston at Dodgers, Fox Sports Net, 6 p.m. 
FRIDAY: Wanna know how funny Michael Richards' new show will be
this fall? Don't have to ask. By the time the NBA Finals coverage
is over, you'll have seen each episode during the commercial
breaks. NBA Finals Game 2: Indiana at Lakers/Portland, Channel 4, 6
p.m. 
SATURDAY: No Andre. No Pete. No Lindsay. By the end of this week,
maybe Monica. No worry, say the French. They'll have just as much
fun playing on the clay without those ugly Americans. Now, if
there's a way to guarantee Venus Williams will get to the finals
... !ital!ooooh, la la.!off! Tennis: French Open, women's final,
Channel 4, noon (NBC also has the men's final Sunday at 6 a.m.) 
SUNDAY: The Travel Channel's episode of ``Trailblazers'' is about
the Bushmen who who collect drops of water in the Kalahari Desert.
Interesting. But frankly, we're all Trailblazered out by this
point. NBA Finals Game 3: Lakers/Portland at Indiana, Channel 4,
4:30 p.m.

ANALYSIS: CLINTON'S PROSPECTS FOR AN ARMS DEAL WITH PUTIN AS DIM AS
EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-CLINTON, RUSSIA-CLINTON-RADIO) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Seeking to lower expectations Clinton administration
officials had insisted this should not be viewed as an arms control
summit. But it was.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of the two days of meetings with President
Vladimir Putin was to soften the Kremlin's resistance to American
plans for a limited missile defense, and to pave the way for a new
arms control framework by the end of the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Two days of meetings, however, failed to produce progress on
either count, and the prospects for a breakthrough on Clinton's
watch seem as dim as ever.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why the Clinton administration
approached the summit with a sense of urgency. Unlike the Reagan or
Bush administrations, the Clinton administration has yet to
negotiate a landmark accord on strategic arms and it is eager to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure also comes from the Clinton administration's
schedule for deploying an anti-missile system. The administration's
goal is to install 20 interceptors and build a large
battle-management radar in Alaska by 2005, a defense system the
White House insists is needed against a potential North Korean
threat.
</P>
<P>
   To meet that deadline Clinton needs to give the go-ahead for at
least some of the work by the end of year. And unless the Russians
drop their objections and agree to modify the 1972 Antiballistic
Missile Treaty to allow a limited defense, Clinton will have to
consider withdrawing from the accord.
</P>
<P>
   That would not only create a confrontation with Moscow, it would
also seriously aggravate Washington's relations with its allies in
Western Europe, who are nervous that the American missile-defense
program will undermine the existing arms agreements and spark a new
arms race with Russia and China, and perhaps even with new nuclear
states like India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some modest shifts in the Russian positions, however,
the fundamental disagreements remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Putin made absolutely clear to President Clinton
that Russia continues to oppose changes to the ABM treaty that the
United States has proposed,'' Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary
of state, acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the two sides made no headway on arms
control. They agreed on a set of guidelines, grandly called the
``principles of strategic stability,'' for future talks.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines take note of the emerging missile threat and
allude to the possibility of amending the accord, steps American
officials billed as an indication that Moscow is beginning to take
account of Washington's worries about the potential missile
capabilities of North Korea and Iran, even if the Kremlin believes
those fears are exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia also signed two secondary, but
noteworthy agreements. One requires each side to dispose of 34 tons
of weapons-grade plutonium over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   While 34 tons is enough to make thousands of warheads, it
represents one-fourth of Russia's military stockpile. The disposal
will also not take place unless industrialized nations underwrite
the $1.75 billion that it will cost to carry out the program in
Russia, a contribution that has yet to be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Another accord would also set up a Moscow-based center where the
United States and Russia would exchange information on missile
launches. The purpose is to help the Russians compensate for their
gaps in the frayed system of early warning radars and reduce the
chance that Moscow might launch its nuclear arsenal based on a
false alert.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and Putin signed the accords with great fanfare,
that did not mask their deeper dispute over missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials are still holding out the hope
that they may bring Putin around by the end of the year. And some
observers have speculated the solution might be a grand bargain in
which the United States would move forward on missile defense in
return for the arms cuts sought by Russia.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, several reasons why the Clinton
administration is unlikely to succeed. For one thing, the Clinton
administration does not appear to have pursued the grand bargain
with any real enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by budgetary pressures, for example, Moscow has urged
that the two sides agree to slash their strategic arms to 1,500
warheads as part of a START-III treaty. That would be substantially
less than the level of 2,000 to 2,500 warheads the United States
has insisted on.
</P>
<P>
   In his press conference Sunday, Clinton did not rule out the
deeper cuts. But administration officials said later that such
reductions probably could not be considered until after a START-III
treaty was concluded.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the Pentagon is opposed to such deep cuts and
the White House does not want to pick a fight with the military
during an election-year. The Clinton administration also has not
yet conducted the sort of wide-ranging review of its nuclear war
plans and targeting policy that would be required to properly
assess such a significant reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have previously agreed to a range of 2,000 to 2,500 on
START-III,'' Clinton said. ``If we were to come down below it, it
would require us to change our strategic plan, and we believe it
would be much better, if we were going to do that, if we could also
know that we were defending ourselves against a new threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason why a breakthrough does not seem near is that
Russian officials know missile defense is a campaign issue. Even if
they agree to Clinton's proposal, they may end up negotiating again
with George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, who is promoting a
far grander plan.
</P>
<P>
   The more fundamental reason, however, is that Putin and his
generals are still deeply concerned that a missile defense will
unleash a competition in defensive technology that the cash-poor
Russian state is bound to lose. Even if the United States builds a
limited defense, the Russians say, it is likely to be just the
first phase in a more ambitious system that will give the United
States a strategic edge over Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the summit meeting was to ease these anxieties.
And while administration officials sought to put the best face on
the meeting, they acknowledged there was still considerable work to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, Talbott added, still believes that an American missile
defense ``will undermine strategic stability, threaten Russia's
strategic deterrent and provoke an arms race.''

BATTLE OVER HUDSON RIVER POLLUTION MAY SOON END 
</HEADLINE>
   A Special Report  
(Eds: This is the abridged version of GENERAL-ELECTRIC-ENVIRON.) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A generation-long tug of war between environmental
officials and General Electric Co. over what, if anything, to do
about the Hudson River's last big chemical stain is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years of false starts and conflicting studies, the
federal Environmental Protection Agency appears poised to order a
cleanup of what it calls a persistent threat to people and
wildlife: the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, that lace the
river bottom north of Albany and contaminate many kinds of fish
throughout the river.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which has vowed to find a remedy by the end of the
year, has so far not said that it will choose to dredge up the
chemicals. But top EPA officials have strongly hinted that doing
nothing _ the option preferred by General Electric, whose factories
released over 1 million pounds of PCBs into the upper Hudson from
1946 until 1977 _ is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the only realistic alternatives to inaction,
according to many environmental experts outside the agency, is
dredging, which could range from a huge, costly project to limited
excavation of the worst hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread contamination of the river was first revealed in
1975, and a 197-mile stretch from Hudson Falls to New York City was
placed on the federal Superfund cleanup list in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the EPA and New York state environmental
officials were caught between private environmental groups, which
wanted a prompt cleanup, and the company, which has used lobbying,
public relations campaigns and dozens of its engineers and
scientists to stave off dredging.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, with the river's PCB levels dropping, the federal
government chose a wait-and-see approach. In 1989, the state
prepared a dredging test, but upstate opposition killed it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the EPA has concluded that PCBs in river mud threaten
wildlife and pose a cancer risk to people who regularly eat Hudson
fish. Even though PCB levels are declining in the water and some
fish, the agency has decided that the threat is not dissipating
fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   GE, in contrast, points to studies showing no health problems in
factory workers exposed to PCBs. And it says the river is safely
burying old PCBs under clean silt. Finally, GE contends that the
main source of fish contamination is not the old pollution but
lingering PCB leaks under its factory in Hudson Falls, which it is
plugging one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Independent scientists hold a range of opinions. Many agree that
the long-lived chemicals are a peril, while others say they are
relatively benign. Some simply say the river is too complicated to
fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   The December announcement will not be the last word. The EPA
will accept comments for six months before issuing its final ruling
in June 2001. Nonetheless, momentum toward a solution appears to be
building.
</P>
<P>
   Last week saw the conclusion of a series of peer reviews of
EPA's Hudson analysis by panels of independent scientists. Three
out of four panels with some caveats endorsed the agency's methods
and its conclusions about the health risks for people who eat fish
from the river.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the fourth panel, which assessed the agency's
calculation of the risk to wildlife, largely rejected the agency's
work as inadequate. But EPA officials said the clearly established
health risk to humans was sufficient for them to press ahead toward
a decision in December on a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   GE has intensified its anti-dredging campaign. Last month it
began an advertising blitz in upstate newspapers and on radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen D. Ramsey, GE's vice president for environmental
programs _ and formerly the top environmental lawyer for the
Justice Department _ said the EPA's stance had largely been shaped
by pressure from private environmental groups, and by the notion
that a government agency had to do something concrete to prove its
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Part of GE's effort has been to generate volumes of research
about the river and PCBs, spending many times more than the $16
million spent by the EPA since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The company's public relations work has focused mainly on the
upper reaches of the Hudson, where GE is a large _ though shrinking
_ employer and where many communities, for various reasons, are apt
to side with it. For example, many rural communities and landowners
have a longstanding fear that the government will order someone
else's hazardous waste entombed in landfills near their property.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has never been very successful at wooing
supporters close to New York City and its suburbs. There, groups
like Riverkeeper and Hudson River Sloop Clearwater have managed to
portray the conflict as an earthy David vs. a buttoned-down
Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the environmental groups have struggled to maintain
momentum, particularly because the river's most visible pollution _
sewage, dyes and other factory discharges _ is a fading memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It horrifies me that it's taken so long,'' said Cara Lee,
environmental director for Scenic Hudson. ``This is the largest PCB
contamination site in the country, and yet people who live here
seem to have blinders on.''
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed in the middle, the EPA's regional staff is struggling
to find an approach that will avoid future legal challenges from
either side.
</P>
<P>
   If dredging is chosen, GE would have to pay for it, which could
run into hundreds of millions of dollars. Under Superfund law, the
company could also be billed for the damage to natural resources _
like the river's commercial fishery, which was shut down because of
PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   And communities along the most contaminated stretch of river,
from Troy north for 40 miles to Hudson Falls, could see years of
disruptive excavation. Dr. Richard Bopp, a geologist at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy said the battle over the Hudson
provides a lesson on the errors of the past _ of a business
routinely dumping waste in a river and regulators routinely
allowing it to happen. ``My biggest hope,'' he said, ``is that
we'll never see anything like it again, that we'll file this away
and learn from our past mistakes.''

PETTER LINDSTROM, 93, PIONEERING NEUROSURGEON 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Petter Lindstrom, a Swedish-born neurosurgeon respected in
his field for his pioneering work in so-called bloodless brain
surgery, died on May 24 at his home in Sonoma, Calif. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Lindstrom was more commonly known as the husband Ingrid Bergman
deserted for Roberto Rossellini, who directed her in the movie
``Stromboli.'' The Lindstrom-Bergman marriage lasted 13 years and
ended in divorce in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Lindstrom went on to a distinguished career as a teacher and a
surgeon who contributed to the technical advances in brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Bergman wed Rossellini, but the marriage was annulled in
1960. She later married Lars Schmidt, a Swedish businessman and
theatrical producer. She died in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Lindstrom's specialty was surgery of the deep brain using
ultrasound, carried out to leave no lesions or permanent changes in
brain function. He performed the procedure on patients with
intractable pain; psychoneuroses like obsessive-compulsive
disorders, anxiety and depression; and certain types of epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Petter Lindstrom was born in Stode, Sweden. He studied dentistry
in Heidelberg, Stockholm and Leipzig, where he received a doctorate
in dental surgery in 1931. He went into private practice in
Stockholm and held an associate professorship at the Karolinska
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Lindstrom married Bergman in 1937. Two years later her acting
career took her from Sweden to Hollywood, where she won acclaim for
her performance in the movie ``Intermezzo.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lindstrom received his medical degree from the University
of Rochester in 1943, he joined her on the West Coast and completed
three years of residency in neurosurgery at Los Angeles County
Hospital in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Going into private practice in his specialty, Lindstrom also
held teaching and clinical appointments at the University of
Southern California and the University of California at Los
Angeles. He was on the staff of several hospitals in the area and
had risen to chief of neurosurgery at Los Angeles County Harbor
Hospital by 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Moving east in 1952, Lindstrom chief of neurosurgery at the
Veterans Administration Hospital in Pittsburgh and continued his
research at the University of Pittsburgh. From 1955 to 1964 he was
chief of neurosurgery at the Veterans Administration Hospital in
Salt Lake City and, as of 1961, a full professor of neurosurgery at
the University of Utah. It was in Pittsburgh and Utah that he
introduced his ultrasound surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lindstrom returned to California in 1964 and filled academic and
hospital appointments in San Francisco and San Diego. He retired as
a clinical professor from the University of California at San Diego
in 1987, and he retired from private practice in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lindstrom is survived by his wife of 45 years, Dr. Agnes
Rovnanek Lindstrom; a daughter from his first marriage, Pia
Lindstrom of Manhattan, a former film and theater critic for
WNBC-TV in New York; three sons and a daughter from his second
marriage, Peter, of Ridgecrest, Calif., Michael, of Boise, Idaho,
Karl, of Sonoma, and Brita Lindstrom of San Diego; and eight
grandchildren.

CLINTON AND PUTIN FAIL TO CLOSE GAP ON MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-CLINTON-RADIO, RUSSIA-CLINTON-ASSESS) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton and President Vladimir Putin of
Russia concluded two days of talks Sunday with mutual praise, but
without narrowing the differences over the national missile defense
system the United States wants to erect.
</P>
<P>
   The summit did produce two other narrow agreements. One was an
undertaking by the United States and Russia to each destroy 34
metric tons (about 75,000 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium _
enough to make tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. The other
called for a joint center in Moscow to share early warnings about
missile launches _ a facility that would be the first-ever
permanent U.S.-Russia military operation.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, senior administration officials described the
atmosphere between the lame-duck American president and the new
Russian president as correct and businesslike, though not
necessarily warm. That was evident at their news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two presidents shook hands as they entered the
hall, and Clinton gently nudged Putin to pose with him for the
cameras afterwards, they did not look or smile at each other during
their opening statements or while answering questions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two men had met twice before, in 1999 when Putin
was prime minister, this was their first meeting since the Russian
was elected president in March. And although they had a broad range
of issues on their agenda _ including Russia's struggle to reform
its economy and its unresolved war in Chechnya _ arms control
dominated their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to temper expectations, senior Clinton administration
officials had said before the trip that there would not be a
substantial breakthrough on the contentious question of a national
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is committed to make a decision before the end of
his administration on whether to move forward with a limited
national missile defense system against the possibility that a
``rogue state'' like North Korea might develop a missile capable of
reaching the United States. Russia says the project would undermine
the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty (ABM), a cornerstone of
strategic arms controls, and unleash a new arms race. The proposed
national missile defense is also opposed by China, and Washington's
European allies have expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who took office only five months ago, evidently felt no
urgency to change his position.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader made that clear during the news conference,
which was held in the grand, gilt-trimmed St. George's Hall in the
recently renovated Czarist-era Grand Palace of the Kremlin. While
acknowledging that there was ``a commonality'' in foreseeing the
possibility of unspecified new threats, Putin said, ``We're against
having a cure which is worse than the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed to a joint statement pledging to continue
talks on further cuts in strategic nuclear weapons and terming the
ABM treaty the ``cornerstone'' of global strategic security. The
statement called on experts from both sides to prepare a joint
report on how to tackle new threats to strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
   But briefing reporters after the press conference, Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott stressed that Putin had not
softened his position. ``President Putin made absolutely clear to
President Clinton that Russia continues to oppose the changes to
the ABM Treaty that the United States has proposed since last
September,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said Russia believes the missile defense plan ``will
undermine strategic stability, threaten Russia's strategic
deterrent and provoke a new arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, Putin insisted he was willing to
continue working on the issue, if necessary, with the next American
president. ``We know that today, in the United States, there is a
campaign ongoing,'' Putin said, adding that he was familiar with
the programs of the two main candidates. He said, ``No matter who
gets to be president, we're willing to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton has only eight more months in office, that in
itself does not necessarily preclude progress on arms control or
U.S.-Russian relations. President Reagan spent a large part of
1988, his last year in office, pressing for improvements in
Washington's relations with Moscow and pushing arms control
agreements. And President Bush signed the Start II treaty, calling
for the most significant rollback yet in the formidable nuclear
arsenal of the Cold War, just two weeks before Clinton's
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that during their eight hours of talks over two
days, Putin spoke some English, and both leaders displayed a
readiness to hear the other out. But, the officials said, the
exchanges lacked the first-name familiarity that characterized the
relationship between Clinton and former President Boris Yeltsin,
where it was always ``Boris'' and ``Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   One American official in the delegation said of Putin: ``You can
see he is not a warm person, he's a cold fish. People say he's a
control freak.'' But the official pointed out that on arms control
issues, that may not be bad.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how they would describe each other's personalities and
leadership styles, Putin said of Clinton, ``He's a very experienced
politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, we've established now not only good business ties,
but also personal relations. For me, President Clinton is a person
who is a very comfortable and pleasant partner in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if everyone behaves the way President Clinton has
behaved, not trying to find dead ends and problems, but to seek
ways of moving ahead, I think between us in the future our
relations really will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was even more formal in his assessment of Putin, saying,
``If you want to know what my personal assessment is, I think he is
fully capable of building a prosperous and strong Russia while
preserving freedom, pluralism, and the rule of law. It's a big
challenge. I think he's fully capable of doing it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his talks with Putin, Clinton raised other areas of
contention. He urged the Russian leader to seek a political
settlement to end Russia's eight-month-long military offensive
against rebel guerrillas in Chechnya and to allow international
monitors to investigate charges of human rights violations in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   And he called on Putin to protect the rights of a free press.
Earlier this spring, Putin ordered an armed raid on Media-Most, a
major communications company that had been critical of the Kremlin.
The invasion was officially described as a tax raid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton underscored his message by giving an interview to Echo
Moskvy, a radio station owned by Media-Most.
</P>
<P>
   The joint Kremlin news conference was also an occasion to
formally announce the agreements that had been reached. The two
presidents sat at a long gilt-trimmed white table with two sets of
pens as an overpowering, disembodied voice filled the vast,
40-foot-ceilinged hall relating in both Russian and English each of
the agreements and statements.
</P>
<P>
   The voice was so powerful that Clinton and several members of
his delegation, including national security adviser Sandy Berger,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson could not stop themselves from smiling. Putin did not
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also indulged in a bit of sightseeing, visiting the
imposing new Christ the Saviour Cathedral on the Moscow River
embankment near the Kremlin en route to his talks Sunday with
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The massive and still unfinished white church, topped with
gilded domes, was built on the original site of a church built
early this century and later destroyed on Stalin's orders.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A generation-long tug of war between environmental
officials and General Electric Co. over what, if anything, to do
about the Hudson River's last big chemical stain is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years of false starts and conflicting studies, the
federal Environmental Protection Agency appears poised to order a
cleanup of what it calls a persistent threat to people and
wildlife: the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, that lace the
river bottom north of Albany and contaminate many kinds of fish
throughout the river.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which has vowed to find a remedy by the end of the
year, has so far not said that it will choose to dredge up the
chemicals. But top EPA officials have strongly hinted that doing
nothing _ the option preferred by General Electric, whose factories
released over 1 million pounds of PCBs into the upper Hudson from
1946 until 1977 _ is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the only realistic alternatives to inaction,
according to many environmental experts outside the agency, is
dredging, which could range from a huge, costly project to limited
excavation of the worst hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the Hudson has nearly become the life's work of
some scientists and lawyers at the EPA and GE. Widespread
contamination of the river was first revealed in 1975, and a
197-mile stretch from Hudson Falls to the Battery in New York City
was placed on the federal Superfund cleanup list in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the EPA and New York state environmental
officials were caught between private environmental groups, which
wanted a prompt cleanup, and the company, which has used lobbying,
public relations campaigns and dozens of its engineers and
scientists to stave off dredging.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, with the river's PCB levels dropping, the federal
government chose a wait-and-see approach. In 1989, the state
prepared a dredging test, but upstate opposition killed it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the EPA has concluded that PCBs in river mud threaten
wildlife and pose a cancer risk to people who regularly eat Hudson
fish. Even though PCB levels are declining in the water and in some
fish, the agency has decided that the threat is not dissipating
fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   GE, in contrast, points to studies showing no health problems in
factory workers exposed to PCBs. And it says the river is safely
burying old PCBs under clean silt. Finally, GE contends that the
main source of fish contamination is not the old pollution but
lingering PCB leaks under its factory in Hudson Falls, which it is
plugging one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Independent scientists hold a range of opinions. Many say that
the long-lived chemicals are a peril, while others say they are
relatively benign. Some simply say the river is too complicated to
fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Bopp, a geologist at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in Troy, who has studied Hudson PCBs for 23 years,
starting with his doctoral thesis, said the delays had largely
resulted from society's desire to have scientific certainty before
starting any costly cleanup. But, he said, there rarely is a
``golden box of answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is quick to say that its case is not ironclad.
Nonetheless, its officials say, evidence of health and ecological
risks justifies moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing two years ago before a New York state Assembly
committee, Carol Browner, the EPA administrator, made one of the
strongest statements by a federal official about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have every single piece of data,'' Browner said.
``But clearly the science has spoken. PCBs are a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest, as GE does, that no action should be taken,
because some of the PCB studies may be inconclusive, flies in the
face of every decision this country has made in the last
quarter-century to protect human health and the environment,'' she
continued. ``Clearly, the time for action is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Other EPA officials stress that dredging is only one of several
possibilities, and that _ at least technically _ taking no action
is still an option.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the December announcement the last word. The EPA will
accept comments for six months before issuing its final ruling in
June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, momentum toward a solution appears to be building.
</P>
<P>
   Last week saw the conclusion of a series of peer reviews of
EPA's Hudson analysis by panels of independent scientists. Three
out of four panels with some caveats endorsed the agency's methods
and its conclusions about the health risks for people who eat fish
from the river.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the fourth panel, which assessed the agency's
calculation of the risk to wildlife, largely rejected the agency's
work as inadequate. But EPA officials said the clearly established
health risk to humans was sufficient for them to press ahead toward
a decision in December on a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   After the decision is announced, GE's options shrink. It can
fight in court, but would have to prove that the government's
remedy was ``arbitrary and capricious'' _ a daunting challenge,
many environmental lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if the company balks, the EPA can start the work on its
own and charge GE up to triple the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, GE has intensified its anti-dredging campaign. Last
month it began an anti-dredging advertising blitz in upstate
newspapers and on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   The company's lobbyists and supporters in Congress have also
been busy. Last month, language was proposed for the annual bill
containing the EPA budget that would require the agency to delay
any decision on dredging until it incorporates findings of a
forthcoming National Academy of Sciences report assessing dredging
methods.
</P>
<P>
   The report, to be released this fall, was commissioned by the
EPA under pressure from several Republican representatives.
</P>
<P>
   One staff member for a Democratic congressman said the
legislative maneuver was a ploy by GE to delay any decision until
after the presidential election, when a shift in control of the
White House could favor the company. ``It's all part of the big
stall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GE officials say that the company's efforts are intended to
ensure that the agency bases its decision on sound science.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen D. Ramsey, GE's vice president for environmental
programs _ and formerly the top environmental lawyer for the
Justice Department _ said the EPA's stance had largely been shaped
by pressure from private environmental groups, and by the notion
that a government agency had to do something concrete to prove its
worth.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the company's work to plug PCB leaks under its
factory, coupled with the natural burial of old PCBs, would solve
the problem. ``Dredging is irrelevant to the recovery of the
river,'' Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a recent spring morning in Hudson Falls, it was hard to
imagine that anything was amiss. Engorged with spring runoff, the
river rumbled over Baker's Falls before broadening and settling
down for its journey to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The foamy brown effluents from paper mills and sewage pipes that
once sullied the stream were gone. But where the river surged past
General Electric's shuttered Hudson Falls capacitor factory, the
banks were laced with pipes and the river bed was pierced by
well-drilling rigs, all designed to drain PCBs from underground
fissures. A similar cleanup was under way at another GE plant two
miles downstream in Fort Edward.
</P>
<P>
   The plants once used 10 million pounds of PCBs a year to make
capacitors, storage devices for electricity. The PCBs, which are
oily liquids, served as insulation and as a coolant. The plants had
state permits to dump up to 30 pounds of spilled PCBs a day into
the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   That dumping led to the invisible stain that represents the last
large legacy of an era when pollution flowed freely into the
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the permits, New York state ruled in 1976 that GE had
violated water quality laws. The company signed a settlement in
which both it and state contributed $3 million for cleanup work,
and GE paid another $1 million for research.
</P>
<P>
   But that cleanup focused on the factories and river banks. The
debate about the river itself was unresolved, and once the Hudson
became a federal Superfund site, it intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Part of GE's effort has been to generate volumes of research
about the river and PCBs, spending many times more than the $16
million spent by the EPA since 1990. (The company says it has spent
$160 million on research and its cleanup so far, but officials
decline to be more specific.)
</P>
<P>
   It has meticulously dissected the river banks near its plants.
John G. Haggard, GE's manager for the Hudson cleanup, said that in
the last eight years, as the company plugged cracks in the cliffs,
the amount of PCBs leaking from the factory grounds dropped to 3
ounces a day, from 5 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   According to GE's analysis, it is these freshly leaking PCBs
that settle on the bottom and enter fish, leading it to conclude
that plugging the leaks would end the problem.
</P>
<P>
   CONFLICTING DATA, PREVAILING CAUTION
</P>
<P>
   To the EPA, the GE effort to clean its sites is welcome and
essential, but a sideshow. Farther south, in the mud under a
40-mile stretch of broad, relatively placid waters, lie tons of
PCBs that flowed from the plants in decades past.
</P>
<P>
   After years of drilling mud cores and running computer studies
of the way silt accumulates, EPA scientists have concluded that
these buried PCBs pose the greatest continuing threat.
</P>
<P>
   GE's experts disagree, saying the old deposits are decomposing
and are too deeply buried to pose a risk. Essentially, the company
and the environmental agency have distinct visions of the river and
the way PCBs affect it.
</P>
<P>
   Their stances on the health hazard from PCBs are just as far
apart. That gap was illustrated earlier this year in Saratoga
Springs, at a debate between two scientific powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
   One was Dr. V. James Cogliano, a top official at the EPA center
for environmental assessment. The other was Dr. Renate D.
Kimbrough, a pathologist who in the 1970s published one of the
first studies linking PCBs to cancer in animals. Now, though _ in a
study partly paid for by GE but reviewed by independent scientists
_ she found no hint of a greater incidence of cancer in the medical
histories of 7,000 GE workers with varying amounts of exposure to
PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   Cogliano pointed out that few of the workers had been exposed to
high PCB levels. He described many animal studies showing a cancer
link, and human studies showing learning problems in children who
nursed from mothers who ate PCB-tainted fish. Kimbrough proceeded
to poke provocative holes in some of that work.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the evening ended with no clear winner.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the audience, Peter Tarana, a chemistry professor at
Adirondack Community College, in Queensbury, explained that he had
served on a state panel examining a proposed site for a landfill
for dredged PCBs. Upstate opponents defeated the plan and the
dredging never happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got here is a lot like what we had 10 years ago,''
Tarana said. ``You've got conflicting data, reputable people _ so
what's a decision-maker to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Cogliano said certainty was never likely when a risk to public
health was being weighed. He said the evidence supported a cautious
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can either wait and wonder or you can try to be
protective,'' he said. ``We tend to be protective in the face of
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   A LARGE EMPLOYER PROVES PERSUASIVE
</P>
<P>
   General Electric has certainly not been content to wait. It has
lobbied long and hard since the early days of the PCB issue. In
1976, when New York was pursuing violations against GE for its PCB
dumping, Gov. Hugh Carey pressed his environmental commissioner to
quickly negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Carey explained that the urgency came
from a meeting he had one day with Reginald Jones, then the company
chairman. ``Jones was adamant,'' Carey recalled. ``If we blamed GE
entirely, he was going to move 55,000 people out of the state _ and
he could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   GE got its settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, the company has pulled no punches to prevent a
costly cleanup. The public relations work has focused mainly on the
upper reaches of the Hudson, where GE is a large _ though shrinking
_ employer and where many communities, for various reasons, are apt
to side with it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, many rural communities and landowners have a
longstanding fear that the government will order someone else's
hazardous waste entombed in landfills near their property.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has never been very successful at wooing
supporters close to New York City and its suburbs. There, groups
like Riverkeeper and Hudson River Sloop Clearwater have managed to
portray the conflict as an earthy David vs. a buttoned-down
Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the environmental groups have struggled to maintain
momentum, particularly because the river's most visible pollution _
sewage, dyes and other factory discharges _ is a fading memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It horrifies me that it's taken so long,'' said Cara Lee,
environmental director for Scenic Hudson. Lee has been embroiled in
the PCB debate since 1983. ``This is the largest PCB contamination
site in the country, and yet people who live here seem to have
blinders on.''
</P>
<P>
   A GOVERNMENT AGENCY CAUGHT IN BETWEEN
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed in the middle, the EPA's regional staff is struggling
to find an approach that will avoid future legal challenges from
either side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very heated issue _ people here don't think in
compromising terms,'' said Richard L. Caspe, who directs the
agency's toxic-cleanup section in New York. ``We're probably going
to get killed whatever decision we make.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency would begin announcing aspects of its cleanup
proposal late this summer. With the consequences of the decision so
substantial, plenty of people will be eager to listen.
</P>
<P>
   If dredging is chosen, GE would have to pay for it, which could
run into hundreds of millions of dollars. Under Superfund law, the
company could also be billed for the damage to natural resources _
like the river's commercial fishery, which was shut down because of
PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   And communities along the most contaminated stretch of river,
from Troy north for 40 miles to Hudson Falls, could see years of
disruptive excavation.
</P>
<P>
   Many elected officials and residents upriver oppose dredging,
but some business owners who rely on boating and tourism are eager
to see the pollution removed. Channels along parts of the canal
linking the Hudson to Lake Champlain are clogged because no
dredging has been allowed until the EPA has a cleanup plan.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one thing that GE, environmental groups and
some scientists agree on: that there are serious problems with the
way the country handles complicated toxic cleanups.
</P>
<P>
   Bopp, the Rensselaer geologist, said the Superfund process
requires the EPA to summarize the entire Hudson River problem in a
single, enormous document.
</P>
<P>
   But the river is a variegated system. Some parts are easy to
understand, and others are impossibly complex. A better approach,
he said, might be to go at it mile by mile, cove by cove. ``You
could come up with a way to clean cove 10, and then maybe get to
cove 16 and there GE would resist, but at least you would have
accomplished something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the EPA decides, Bopp said, the battle over the
Hudson provides a lesson on the errors of the past _ of a business
routinely dumping waste in a river and regulators routinely
allowing it to happen. ``Will my daughter be writing her Ph.D.
thesis on PCBs in the Hudson?'' Bopp said. ``I hope not. My biggest
hope is that we'll never see anything like it again, that we'll
file this away and learn from our past mistakes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A generation-long tug of war between environmental
officials and General Electric Co. over what, if anything, to do
about the Hudson River's last big chemical stain is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years of false starts and conflicting studies, the
federal Environmental Protection Agency appears poised to order a
cleanup of what it calls a persistent threat to people and
wildlife: the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, that lace the
river bottom north of Albany and contaminate many kinds of fish
throughout the river.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which has vowed to find a remedy by the end of the
year, has so far not said that it will choose to dredge up the
chemicals. But top EPA officials have strongly hinted that doing
nothing _ the option preferred by General Electric, whose factories
released over 1 million pounds of PCBs into the upper Hudson from
1946 until 1977 _ is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the only realistic alternatives to inaction,
according to many environmental experts outside the agency, is
dredging, which could range from a huge, costly project to limited
excavation of the worst hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread contamination of the river was first revealed in
1975, and a 197-mile stretch from Hudson Falls to New York City was
placed on the federal Superfund cleanup list in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the EPA and New York state environmental
officials were caught between private environmental groups, which
wanted a prompt cleanup, and the company, which has used lobbying,
public relations campaigns and dozens of its engineers and
scientists to stave off dredging.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, with the river's PCB levels dropping, the federal
government chose a wait-and-see approach. In 1989, the state
prepared a dredging test, but upstate opposition killed it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the EPA has concluded that PCBs in river mud threaten
wildlife and pose a cancer risk to people who regularly eat Hudson
fish. Even though PCB levels are declining in the water and some
fish, the agency has decided that the threat is not dissipating
fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   GE, in contrast, points to studies showing no health problems in
factory workers exposed to PCBs. And it says the river is safely
burying old PCBs under clean silt. Finally, GE contends that the
main source of fish contamination is not the old pollution but
lingering PCB leaks under its factory in Hudson Falls, which it is
plugging one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Independent scientists hold a range of opinions. Many agree that
the long-lived chemicals are a peril, while others say they are
relatively benign. Some simply say the river is too complicated to
fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   The December announcement will not be the last word. The EPA
will accept comments for six months before issuing its final ruling
in June 2001. Nonetheless, momentum toward a solution appears to be
building.
</P>
<P>
   Last week saw the conclusion of a series of peer reviews of
EPA's Hudson analysis by panels of independent scientists. Three
out of four panels with some caveats endorsed the agency's methods
and its conclusions about the health risks for people who eat fish
from the river.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the fourth panel, which assessed the agency's
calculation of the risk to wildlife, largely rejected the agency's
work as inadequate. But EPA officials said the clearly established
health risk to humans was sufficient for them to press ahead toward
a decision in December on a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   GE has intensified its anti-dredging campaign. Last month it
began an advertising blitz in upstate newspapers and on radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen D. Ramsey, GE's vice president for environmental
programs _ and formerly the top environmental lawyer for the
Justice Department _ said the EPA's stance had largely been shaped
by pressure from private environmental groups, and by the notion
that a government agency had to do something concrete to prove its
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Part of GE's effort has been to generate volumes of research
about the river and PCBs, spending many times more than the $16
million spent by the EPA since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The company's public relations work has focused mainly on the
upper reaches of the Hudson, where GE is a large _ though shrinking
_ employer and where many communities, for various reasons, are apt
to side with it. For example, many rural communities and landowners
have a longstanding fear that the government will order someone
else's hazardous waste entombed in landfills near their property.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has never been very successful at wooing
supporters close to New York City and its suburbs. There, groups
like Riverkeeper and Hudson River Sloop Clearwater have managed to
portray the conflict as an earthy David vs. a buttoned-down
Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the environmental groups have struggled to maintain
momentum, particularly because the river's most visible pollution _
sewage, dyes and other factory discharges _ is a fading memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It horrifies me that it's taken so long,'' said Cara Lee,
environmental director for Scenic Hudson. ``This is the largest PCB
contamination site in the country, and yet people who live here
seem to have blinders on.''
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed in the middle, the EPA's regional staff is struggling
to find an approach that will avoid future legal challenges from
either side.
</P>
<P>
   If dredging is chosen, GE would have to pay for it, which could
run into hundreds of millions of dollars. Under Superfund law, the
company could also be billed for the damage to natural resources _
like the river's commercial fishery, which was shut down because of
PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   And communities along the most contaminated stretch of river,
from Troy north for 40 miles to Hudson Falls, could see years of
disruptive excavation. Dr. Richard Bopp, a geologist at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy said the battle over the Hudson
provides a lesson on the errors of the past _ of a business
routinely dumping waste in a river and regulators routinely
allowing it to happen. ``My biggest hope,'' he said, ``is that
we'll never see anything like it again, that we'll file this away
and learn from our past mistakes.''

COMMENTARY: MISTAKE IN MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Double parentheses should be set as brackets.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``We have agreed to a statement of principles,''
President Clinton told a joint news conference in Moscow, ``which I
urge you to read carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Russian and American sides disagreed on whether
a limited missile defense against rogue states posed a threat to
the mutual deterrence of the ABM treaty, Clinton added: ``The
statement of principles that we have agreed to I thought reflected
an attempt to bring our positions closer together ... let me say I
urge you all to read that.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's read it. The central issue is whether the United
States will allow Russia to hold us to the ABM treaty negotiated 30
years ago with the Soviet Union. We want to build defenses against
the few missiles from terrorist nations, not the thousands held by
Russia. President Vladimir Putin wants to make us pay for his
permission by slashing our offensive missile forces in Start III
down to levels our military leaders consider imprudent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went along with the sweeping assertion that the two
nations ``reaffirm their commitment to that ((ABM)) treaty as a
cornerstone of strategic stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin then gave Clinton a little wiggle room by agreeing that
the missile threat from other nations ``represents a potentially
significant change in the strategic situation ...'' and to
``consider possible proposals for further increasing the viability
of the Treaty.'' That means allowing the United States to defend
its cities against rogue nations, terrorists and accidental
launches only in ways that Moscow approves.
</P>
<P>
   Thrice did Clinton embrace the word ``viability,'' which means
``capability of living.'' He committed the United States ``to
strengthen the ABM treaty and to enhance its viability'' and agreed
that we ``attach great importance to enhancing the viability of the
Treaty ....''
</P>
<P>
   So here we have Clinton breathing new life into the Cold War
treaty provided Putin will allow some minor amendments that may not
meet future U.S. defense needs.
</P>
<P>
   And then the outgoing American president stepped into the
incoming Russian president's trap. He paid for Putin's permission
to tinker with the ABM treaty with an enormous concession:
</P>
<P>
   ``They agree that issues of strategic offensive arms cannot be
considered in isolation from the issue of strategic defensive arms
and vice versa ....''
</P>
<P>
   Read that again to savor its import: that is the principle of
linkage. It's what Putin's military wanted and what Clinton never
should have given.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues of strategic offensive arms'' means Start III: the
reduction of the massive U.S. and Russian arsenals. The issue there
is how far to cut: Our military says our strength would be sapped
at fewer than 2,000 missiles, while the Russians _ who can't afford
to keep that many nukes _ want us to weaken our worldwide missile
forces by 25 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues of strategic defensive arms'' means ABM and our
national missile defense against dictators who could threaten us
with nuclear blackmail and against a possible Chinese threat. By
mistakenly linking reductions in Start III (our missile offense) to
the minor modification of ABM (our missile defense), Clinton played
into Russian hands, making future arms negotiation more difficult
for his American successor.
</P>
<P>
   Now here comes the strange part. Putin must know the substantial
difference in approach between candidates Al Gore and George W.
Bush. Gore goes along with Clinton and presumably will embrace his
ABM-Start III linkage. Bush wants a free hand with a limited
anti-missile system and would set our offensive missiles at a level
to suit our deterrent needs, inviting the Russians to reciprocate.
Huge policy difference.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Putin said, ``We're familiar with the programs of the
two candidates ... we're willing to go forward on either one of
these approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he mean to ad-lib that? Was he misinterpreted? Having won
his linkage with Clinton-Gore, is the inexperienced Putin willing
to toss that advantage aside with Bush?
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's policy error, he neither embraced the KGB's
man nor called him ``Volodya.'' Our president's demeanor remained
coolly correct, and we can at least be thankful for that.
</P>

ODD FLOCK OF MEXICAN PARROTS SETTLE IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 10th graf to correct spelling of Zachary Taylor)  By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Just as the blazing afternoon sun softens
and begins to set, the parrots start to arrive, squawking and
keening as they wheel high overhead in the blue sky and drop into
the upper fronds of palm trees growing along the Rio Grande River.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do that every night,'' says Jessie Moreno, a cashier at
the Fort Brown Hotel, who likes to watch the birds roosting on the
hotel grounds. ``They come swooping back here when it starts to get
dark and spend the night up in those palm trees. In the morning
they'll take off again and fly out over the city looking for
food.''
</P>
<P>
   The birds call to each other as they dart from tree to tree,
brightly colored slashes of green, yellow and blue, and when a
truck backfires nearby they howl and take to the air as one,
screaming wildly as they swirl overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' Moreno says, ``they'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   But the flock of parrots, more than 300 of a species known
scientifically as Amazona viridigenalis, are not really supposed to
be here in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Wild parrots in an urban environment like this dusty, bustling
border city seem unusual enough, but this flock is also odd for
other reasons, local experts say.
</P>
<P>
   They are at least a hundred miles from their typical roosting
grounds deep in Mexico, and a third of the parrots are birds
released by or escaped from smugglers trying to slip them illegally
into the country, said Steve Walker, a staff member at the
University of Texas at Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said a devastating freeze in 1982, coinciding with an
agrarian overhaul that deforested large sections of Northern
Mexico, combined to draw the birds into the Brownsville area.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that freeze we started seeing large numbers of
free-range parrots here,'' Walker said. ``Our conjecture is that a
flock of old veterans, who had made the trip before, decided to
come up out of Mexico into this area to forage. These birds can
live to be 60 to 70 years old and sometimes longer than that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is anecdotal evidence from old military diaries, Walker
said, of sightings of parrots even farther north, along the Nueces
River area, at a time when Gen. Zachary Taylor's troops were
quartered there in the Mexican War in 1847.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was in November, in the pecan season, and these parrots
just love pecans,'' he said. ``So they must have flown at least 200
miles even further north to look for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brownsville flock now contains more than 160 nesting pairs
of three types of parrots: yellow-cheek parrots, also known as
red-lored, red-crowned parrots, and, the most colorful of the local
flock, yellow-head parrots, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think most, if not all, of the yellow-heads are escaped or
released birds,'' he said. ``But the red-crowns have just wandered
into the area to feed and ended up staying.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the escaped or released birds would have been trapped
along the Rio Corona or Rio Soto La Marina in southern Tamaulipas,
Mexico, Walker said, and the red-crowned parrots would have come
from still further south. It is illegal to bring any of the parrots
into the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that some members of the flock still have their
wings clipped as a bird smuggler would do; those are released or
escaped birds,'' Walker said, adding that they were easy to spot:
``They have to beat their wings twice as fast to go half as far.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who became interested in the birds when he hosted a
local wildlife show on television, says the birds eat palm dates,
citrus from the vast commercial groves that surround Brownsville,
and mosquitoes that swarm over the city's many ``resacas,'' a kind
of catchment pond for rain.
</P>
<P>
   Up until two years ago, there was a Catch-22 in protecting
parrots from hunters or trappers, says Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't supposed to be here so they weren't really
covered by state laws,'' he said. But Walker and other local
wildlife enthusiasts worked with the Texas Birding Association to
have the local parrots designated as a native population in 1998,
making them a protected species.
</P>
<P>
   Walker also led a successful effort to have the parrot
designated as the official city bird of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are monogamous for life, keep their families together
for a long time, and have what Walker calls `shared intelligence.'
``That means they like to talk to each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The parrots are also amazingly adaptive creatures, Walker said.
The same freeze that drew the birds here in the early 1980s killed
many local palm trees, and the rotted trunks make perfect homes for
the parrots.
</P>
<P>
   To build their nests, the parrots find holes made by woodpeckers
seeking insects in bark. The parrots then patiently peck and claw
at the woodpecker holes until they have made a large enough cavity
for nesting.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the hotel grounds, Moreno slapped the base of one of
those palm trees with bare her hand several times and two small
yellow parrot heads popped inquisitively from a hole halfway up the
tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two have a nest in there, so we'll be seeing some more
babies soon,'' she said.

SOFT MONEY ADS BREWING AS ISSUE; BUSH, GORE BOTH LIKELY TARGETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two and a half months ago, flush with victory in
the primaries and eager to be seen as taking the high road, Vice
President Al Gore sent an e-mail message to Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, proposing a ban on ``issue ads'' paid for with unregulated
soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed the challenge as a ploy. But now, with Democrats
dropping hints that they may soon begin a television advertising
campaign on behalf of Gore, Republicans are eager to hoist the vice
president on his own petard.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that Gore's message amounted to a promise not to use
soft money, the Republicans are trying to paint Gore as a hypocrite
even before the Democrats' first commercial hits the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 1 letter to Ed Rendell, general chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, Jim Nicholson, the Republican
national chairman, suggested that Democrats were poised to renege
on the promise because Bush has been running ahead of Gore in some
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask you to tell the truth: Al Gore meant to keep his
pledge only so long as it was beneficial to him politically,''
Nicholson wrote. ``That's why he's changed his mind now that he's
fallen in the polls. That's why the DNC is looking for any excuse,
any loophole, any fine print to serve as justification for his
clear intention to violate another pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans made Nicholson's letter available to reporters
before it was sent. And to some who monitor the gamesmanship
between the parties, it appeared that the Republicans were seeking
to enlist on the side of the angels on a confusing and complex
issue in which neither party could claim purity.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Democratic officials said, obscure groups with ties to
the Republican Party are already running commercials in California
and Washington, D.C., that are intended to tar Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line here is that both the Bush campaign and the
Gore campaign are planning to spend tens of millions of dollars on
these illicit soft money ads in this election,'' said Fred
Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington group that
advocates campaign finance reform. ``I don't know that voters
should care about this game of `got you,' but they should deeply
care about the huge amounts of six-figure campaign contributions
that in the end are going to be spent.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Gore, though, who set the game in motion with his e-mail
message to Bush on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge you to accept my proposal that we both reject the
use of soft money to run issue ads,'' Gore wrote. ``I will take the
first step by requesting the Democratic National Committee not to
run any issue ads paid for by soft money unless and until the
Republican Party uses money for advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans remember the 1996 campaign, when the Democrats ran a
pre-emptive series of issue advertisements on behalf of President
Clinton well before the conventions that did substantial damage to
Bob Dole's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a period when Dole was low on cash,'' said Nelson Warfield,
a Republican consultant who served as press secretary for the Dole
campaign, ``the Clinton-Gore team was able to define him as an
extremist when in fact Dole was a mainstream Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the large-scale use of party-sponsored commercials
has yet to occur. But the memory of 1996 lingers, and Republican
officials are trying to hold Gore accountable for his offer, saying
that in the e-mail message, and in some statements on TV news
programs, Gore has pledged not to use soft money.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Gore said that just as in the case of a challenge
to former Sen. Bill Bradley to forgo commercials during the
Democratic primaries, Gore's proposal was contingent on an
agreement with his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who saw Bush's response to the Gore challenge knows the
Bush campaign has not taken it seriously from Day 1,'' said Chris
Lehane, press secretary for the Gore campaign. ``I think for Jim
Nicholson to suddenly be trying to get on the moral high ground is
laughable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, issue advertising _ ostensibly intended
to promote a cause rather than a person _ has become a tool in
congressional and presidential races. The advertisements are often
echoes of the commercials that the candidates run, but they avoid
terms like ``vote for'' or ``defeat.'' These words, the courts have
found, constitute electioneering, and would make the ads subject to
the strictures of the Federal Election Commission. Issue
advertisements paid for with soft money have no financial
disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans clearly want Gore to pay a political price should
the Democratic National Committee begin a blitz of issue
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Gore's standpoint,'' Wertheimer said, ``this is not a
pledge he should have made, and obviously, it was made to score
points. Now Bush is trying to use it to score points of his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials contend that Bush and his allies long ago
violated the spirit of Gore's overture. They say that over the last
several weeks, the Republicans have made clear that their
general-election television strategy will be to have the Bush
campaign run upbeat commercials while leaving the attack
advertising in the hands of little-known interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, organizations like the Sierra Club and the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League are running ads
attacking Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats point to a recent $1.5 million anti-Gore campaign on
television in California by Shape the Debate, a group formed by
associates of Pete Wilson, the former Republican governor, and to a
more recent series of commercials being run on cable television in
Washington. Sponsored by an organization called the Coalition to
Protect Americans Now, the latest 30-second commercial, unveiled
this week, criticizes the Clinton administration's handling of
America's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Backus, a Democratic National Committee spokesman, said
the commercials were part of a ``stealth campaign'' by Republicans
to attack Gore without having to reveal the source of the money
used to pay for the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gaffney, head of the advisory board for the Coalition to
Protection Americans Now, said the group was formed four months ago
to invigorate discussion on security issues, not to derail a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization is in no way connected to the Bush
campaign,'' Gaffney said. ``People that I am very close to and have
worked with are advising Bush. But that is in no way translated
into any kind of coordination.''

   MOSCOW _ Hours before he flew to Moscow on Friday, President
Clinton pointedly observed in a speech in Berlin that Westerners
``do not yet know if Russia's hard-won democratic freedoms will
endure.'' Sunday, with a few muted gestures, the White House
illustrated what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited
Radio Liberty, the United States-financed broadcaster whose blunt
coverage of the war in Chechnya last winter led to the Russians'
detention of a top reporter, Andrei Babitsky.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday evening, Clinton gave an hourlong interview to Echo
Moskvy radio, an all-news station that is part of Russia's
Media-MOST empire. Long known for critical reports on the Kremlin,
Media-MOST was raided last month by armed federal tax police,
curiously clad in camouflage and ski masks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Kremlin's denials, the raid was widely seen here as
a warning that opponents criticize this government at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   The two appearances underscored the sub-theme _ to the White
House, at least _ of this arms-control meeting: the shaky state of
Russia's democratic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised those concerns Sunday in meetings with President
Vladimir Putin. Putin was said to have reassured the president that
building a civil and democratic society was one of his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But some political experts here, both Russian and foreign, are
less sanguine. Putin's rise has brought an increasingly open effort
to bring the press, religious leaders and other potential opponents
to heel.
</P>
<P>
   That view was highlighted in recent confrontations involving
government authorities that left the distinct odor, if not the
reality, of a Kremlin crackdown on civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, customs officers searched the bags of an Amnesty
International employee arriving in Moscow and confiscated pamphlets
alleging human-rights violations by Russian troops in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said the employee lacked required documents
certifying that the pamphlets were legal. Amnesty International
called the seizure ``a dangerous precedent that brings back
memories of the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, potentially more serious, leaders of Russia's
Jewish minority charged on Thursday that the Kremlin was plotting
to undermine and divide them, apparently to dilute complaints about
Russian assistance to Iranian military programs. By those accounts,
a Kremlin official pressured Russia's chief rabbi, Adolf Shayevich,
to resign last week in favor of a Jewish leader who enjoys
government support. Rabbi Shayevich refused and wrote a letter of
complaint to Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has offered support to an independent religious
group, the Federation of Jewish Communities, which was founded in
Moscow late last year.
</P>
<P>
   International Jewish groups condemned the Kremlin overture.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Moscow rabbi, Pinchus Goldschmidt, quoted American
officials Sunday night as saying that Clinton had raised the
incident with Putin and received a positive response. ``I can only
hope that his response will be not only in words, but in deeds,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's paper commitment to civil and human rights is
impeccable. In his guiding statement of principles, he wrote that
``the main threat to human rights and freedoms, to democracy as
such, emanates from the executive authority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I, personally, am paying priority attention to
building partner relations between the executive authority and
civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the early going, Putin's passion for the strong center he
says Russians need seems to have trumped other concerns. He has
seeded the top ranks of his administration with former military and
KGB officials. And some of his farthest-reaching policies, such as
a plan to tighten the Kremlin's grip on Russia's 89 regions, have
come from strategists on his military-oriented security council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until President Yeltsin's resignation'' _ the deft move that
virtually assured Putin's election victory last March _ ``it was
almost evident that Putin was playing a role written by someone
else,'' Nikolai Petrov, a senior analyst with the Moscow Center of
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a recent
interview. ``When he replaced this team of former Yeltsin advisers
with former KGB guys, he looked more or less independent. But I'm
not sure he still is.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the most visible suggestion of a Kremlin clampdown
centers on the news media, which exist under the watchful eye of
their own government ministry, beefed up by Putin last year. Since
then, the ministry has pulled the license of one television station
and threatened to auction the licenses of two others. One, Moscow's
TV Center, is controlled by Yuri M. Luzhkov, a Kremlin rival and
the mayor of Moscow. The other is ORT, a state-owned, avidly
pro-Putin network controlled by the financier Boris A. Berezovsky.
The two were accused of slanting election coverage.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, ORT easily recaptured its license in a
one-sided auction last month. Luzhkov's TV Center, on the other
hand, appears to face at least one serious bidder. It is fighting
its license revocation in court.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry also has demanded that the news media ban
interviews with or other quotations from Chechen guerrillas or
opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorists are waging a media war'' against the government,
said Vladimir V. Grigoriev, the deputy press minister. ``We are
insisting that electronic and printed media not give a chance to
the terrorists to address and lie to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how a newspaper might be punished for violating the ban,
he replied: ``That's the main problem. The mass media is probably
the most democratic institution. There could be no real penalty _
probably a reprimand.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Federal law provides, however, that a newspaper can be shut down
by court order after two government reprimands. And the case of the
most rebellious and powerful of the Kremlin's press critics _ the
Media-MOST empire run by Vladimir V. Gusinsky _ suggests that a
powerful journalistic critic of the Kremlin risks an unusual run of
bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   The company runs not just Echo Moskvy, but the newspaper
Sevodnya, the newsmagazine Itogi and the NTV television network _
the only network with a reach even approaching the coast-to-coast
coverage of state-owned ORT. When his empire began attacking the
war in Chechnya and refused to endorse Putin, Gusinsky said
recently, retribution was swift.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the government-controlled gas monopoly Gazprom
decided to call due a $211 million loan to the company. The
Media-MOST headquarters were raided last month in what the Kremlin
says was an inquiry into illegal surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, the Central Bank stepped in to prevent the sale of
the insolvent MOST Bank, once controlled by Gusinsky. He charges
that the action was taken to prevent Media-MOST from profiting from
the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio interview Sunday night, Clinton was asked by a
Russian journalist whether he ever had an urge to throttle a
reporter or to sic his tax police on an unruly critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that in the history of our country,
nobody has had more negative press coverage than myself,'' he said.
``But if the approach is balanced, then you have a chance to give
an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   As for wielding the police against his enemies, Clinton said:
``I have never done anything like that. It's illegal.''

 &HT;    Father chooses high profile attorney for his son
 &HT;    By Susan Spencer-Wendel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Attorney Bob Udell has handled at least
70 murder cases, gotten death sentences overturned, defended the
most reviled of killers, and gotten outright acquittals.
</P>
<P>
   But Udell says the main reason Nate Brazill's father put him on
his son's case was the fact Udell has a 13-year-old son too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to figure them out is a crapshoot,'' Udell said of
13-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   But Udell, 51, has been tapped to try. He contacted the family
late last week about representing Nate Brazill, the teenager
accused of shooting Barry Grunow, a language arts teacher at Lake
Worth Community Middle School. Udell met the teen for the first
time Sunday at the Juvenile Detention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the child everybody hopes for: thoughtful, bright,
sensitive,'' Udell said. ``He just did a very stupid thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to accept responsibility. Nathaniel pulled the
trigger. We know that,'' Udell said. ``But his state of mind at the
time. . . that's what we'll have to litigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Udell wouldn't comment about what Brazill told him was the
reason he took the gun to school except to say: ``Nobody planned or
intended to kill anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury is scheduled to decide next week whether to indict
the 13-year-old on murder charges and try him as an adult. Udell
said he will consider the rare and risky move of having his client
testify before the grand jurors. The risk is that anything Brazill
says at the hearing could be used against him later in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Udell, a small, wiry man who has captivated courtrooms with his
high-strung energy, will be assisted by another Stuart attorney,
Lance Richard. Richard has limited criminal defense experience.
</P>
<P>
   The public defender initially appointed to represent Brazill
said Sunday that the news was disappointing, but not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked promising for Nathaniel,'' said Assistant Public
Defender Randy Berman. ``A junk gun with a hair trigger, no
animosity for the teacher, a good kid _ it looked promising.''
</P>
<P>
   Udell would not comment on whether he has taken on the case for
free or the family is paying. ``We'll work that out later,'' he
said. Brazill's mother works in food service and his father is a
postal worker.
</P>
<P>
   A family member who answered at the Brazill home Sunday night
declined to comment on the decision to switch.

WING'S RETURN A BOOST FOR STARS' NIEUWENDYK  

</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dallas forward Jamie Langenbrunner is expected to play
for the first time in these Stanley Cup finals when the Stars meet
the Devils on Monday night in Game 4. With the Stars trailing, two
games to one, nobody should be happier than Dallas center Joe
Nieuwendyk to see Langenbrunner back on his left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk won the Conn Smythe Trophy last season as the most
valuable player of the playoffs, in which the Stars took their
first Stanley Cup. In the finals this year, however, Langenbrunner
has had a knee injury and Nieuwendyk has been a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Stars had a potent second line featuring
Nieuwendyk and Langenbrunner to complement Mike Modano and Brett
Hull on their top line. Nieuwendyk led all playoff scorers with 11
goals last year and tied the National Hockey League record for most
game-winning goals in one playoff year with six. He and
Langenbrunner combined for 21 playoff goals last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have lacked that second-line punch this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock went so far as to change his strategy
from Games 1 and 2 and shy away from playing Modano's line against
Jason Arnott's. ``We have to try and break even against Arnott,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   But Arnott's line dominated an older, slower line centered by
the Stars' Guy Carbonneau in Game 3, which the Devils won, 2-1;
Arnott's line accounted for both goals. For the second time in
three games, Arnott's line played the more decisive role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any secret right now that we've got one
line that is obviously concerning Jersey,'' Hitchcock said. ``We
need more from more players to win this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner has been out since Game 5 of the Western
Conference finals with a sprained knee. Nieuwendyk has no goals or
assists in the five games Langenbrunner has missed.
</P>
<P>
   Two questions put to Hitchcock Sunday were: How much has
Nieuwendyk missed Langenbrunner? And is it a valid excuse?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Hitchcock said. ``This is a game about
adjustments. We have learned how to play without people all year. I
think it is less about that and more going into the critical areas
to score. I think that all of us, Joe included, but also Mike and
Brett _ you are not going to score from a distance against this
team. You are going to have to get into gritty areas to score, and
that's really the bottom line. And Joe knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   He just had not been able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing we'd like to see more from Joe is that he
doesn't play to score, he plays the game,'' Hitchcock said. ``What
we'd like to see is when you look at Nieuwendyk at the end of the
game, he is front and center. He's gotten his chances. He's been
one of the best players on the ice. We'd like to see him dictate
that tempo early. He has done that at critical stages in series
past. But sometimes in those series, these games haven't happened
until Game 5 or sometimes even Game 6. This is Game 4 tomorrow, and
we need it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk, 33, has complained lately that he has not had a good
scoring wing to play with since Langenbrunner was injured. But he
was not available to speak to reporters Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So the questions about Nieuwendyk's lack of production were put
to Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is like any other scorer,'' Hitchcock said. ``He is a lot,
in our case, like Brett Hull. When you are a scorer and you are
scoring, it seems that every part of your game is energized. Joe is
a perfect example. He is a streaky player. And if he scores early,
like he did at times during the last two series, then he is a very
effective player for that game and for the next few games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you don't score, you start thinking too much. I find
that with great offensive players and great scorers, when they
start thinking, that is when they are at their worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk scored just 15 goals this season, the lowest total of
his 13-year NHL career. He played 48 regular-season games, missing
21 with a separated right shoulder. Hitchcock noted that Nieuwendyk
and his regular linemates, Langenbrunner and Scott Thornton, were
together for about 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very good line for us,'' Hitchcock said, ``but
they haven't played together very much.''

BILL TO PROTECT DATABASES CREATES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On one side are the Chamber of Commerce, Consumers
Union, research librarians and Charles Schwab. On the other side
are the New York Stock Exchange, real estate agents and the
American Medical Association. Yahoo is on one side, eBay on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   These odd alliances of lobbyists have formed over the question
of whether databases _ collections of facts like telephone
directories, weather reports, stock tables and real estate listings
_ can be copied, repackaged and distributed by anyone with an
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill
sponsored by Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., that would establish
criminal penalties for the unauthorized use of material in
databases. Opponents say the bill would allow companies with
databases to control access to facts.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, held up by competing commercial interests and a
jurisdictional dispute in the House, seems unlikely to be enacted
this year, but few other issues before Congress this year have
generated so much lobbying. Advocates on both sides say their
livelihoods are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Realtors, with members in every
congressional district, is one of the capital's most formidable
lobbies. Last month, at the association's Washington meeting,
hundreds of real estate agents visited their senators and
representatives to argue that without the Coble bill, their
multiple-listing services were in danger of being pirated.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's senators, Bill Frist and Fred Thompson, both
Republicans, were so besieged that they had to reserve a committee
hearing room so they would have space for all the agents from their
state.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, lobbyists for Bloomberg LP, the financial
information service, have been telling lawmakers that if the Coble
bill becomes law, the stock exchanges could make it impossible for
the company to publish complex calculations about stock prices and
trends. ``The bill would mean they would have absolute ownership
right over something as basic as stock quotes,'' said Kevin
Sheekey, a Bloomberg spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Bloomberg, the company's founder, is northeastern
vice chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and largely because
of his influence the chamber has thrown its considerable lobbying
weight into the fray. ``Factual data is the nuts and bolts of the
information age,'' said Rick Lane, the chamber's chief lobbyist on
technology issues. ``If you try to control its use, you're going to
stifle commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides may be exaggerating. But the question of database
piracy is one instance in which technology has developed so rapidly
that it has outstripped the laws governing commercial
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Before there was an Internet, the issue was pretty well settled
by copyright law. Creative works could be copyrighted; facts could
not. If a database was nothing but a collection of raw facts _ say,
a list of countries in Europe _ then it was public property. But if
the compilation involved selection and coordination _ for instance,
European countries ranked in order of their wine production _ then
it could be copyrighted, and no one could use the list without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have ruled, for example, that the telephone white
pages cannot be copyrighted because the only arrangement involved
is alphabetical. But the Yellow Pages are protected because someone
had to select the various categories.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the sheer volume of information on the Internet, the ease
with which it can be retrieved and the size of the potential
profits have blurred the line between what is acceptable and what
is not. For example, is the five-digit coding system for medical
services and procedures developed by the American Medical
Association more like the white pages or the Yellow Pages?
</P>
<P>
   Companies and interest groups have chosen sides on the issue
depending on whether they primarily collect data that is put on the
Internet (the stock exchanges, real estate brokers, Lexis-Nexis,
eBay, AMA) or use the data compiled by someone else (the Chamber of
Commerce, Consumers Union, Yahoo, Schwab, research librarians).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   EBay, the online auction company, is a collector. It worries
that an ambitious Web-meister will take its listing for, say, a set
of Wedgwood china and the listings on all the other auction sites
for a set of the same china and provide a new list for comparative
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which makes most of its money from transaction
fees, could suffer from the competition. Even worse, a lobbyist for
eBay said, is that the prices and availability of its items change
minute by minute. The competing Web site could have misinformation.
And customers would blame eBay, damaging its reputation and
business.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, eBay recently sued a company called Bidder's Edge that
has just the kind of Web site it fears. Last month a U.S. District
Court in California issued a preliminary injunction preventing
Bidder's Edge from using eBay's data.
</P>
<P>
   Associations of real estate brokers who run multiple-listing
services have won similar suits.
</P>
<P>
   A few cases have gone against the owners of databases. But even
the legislation's proponents say that in almost every instance,
companies that have been damaged because their databases were
copied have been able to get relief in court.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of the Coble bill say this shows that no sweeping
new legislation is needed. ``Existing law takes care of any
legitimate issue of database piracy,'' said Jonathan Band, a lawyer
representing a group of Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Verstandig, senior vice president of the National
Association of Realtors, disagreed. ``We've been pretty lucky with
these cases so far,'' he said. ``But we're afraid this isn't going
to hold up much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's opponents have endorsed a measure sponsored by Thomas
Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce Committee. The bill
would allow the Federal Trade Commission to issue orders preventing
inappropriate reproduction of databases.

EDITORIAL: DRUG LAWS THAT MISFIRED  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 5:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For more than a quarter-century, New York has imposed some of
the toughest, most rigid prison sentences on drug offenders. But
there is now ample proof that these laws, enacted under Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller, have not cut drug trafficking or addiction. Instead,
their main effect has been to fill state prisons with thousands of
low-level drug users at enormous public cost. Even some of the
original sponsors of these laws have come to agree that it is time
to find a better approach.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Gov. George Pataki has been too timid to offer
any meaningful change to the drug laws. But there is still time in
the remaining days of the legislative session for lawmakers like
Joseph Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate,
to take the lead in fashioning drug law reform. Even Republican
elders like Warren Anderson, the former State Senate majority
leader, and Douglas Barclay and John Dunne, who each voted to enact
Rockefeller's proposals in 1973, have become strong proponents for
ending a failed experiment that seemed like a good idea 27 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The current laws are the product of a time when the nation was
first confronting the rapid rise in narcotics trafficking. Drug use
was infiltrating suburbs and middle-class communities.
Substance-abuse treatment techniques were in their infancy, and
politicians wanted to address public fears of drug-driven crime.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller's national political aspirations may have helped to
move him toward harsh criminal penalties. But his drug laws mostly
grew out of frustration with ineffective treatment programs and a
belief that tough mandatory sentences could deter drug pushers.
That is why the laws require, for example, minimum sentences of 15
years to life for a first-time offender caught selling as little as
two ounces of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the time of enactment, there was intense opposition to
this inflexible, one-size-fits-all approach to sentencing. The
Democrats were opposed, as were civil liberties groups, court
administrators, district attorneys and Mayor John Lindsay of New
York City. In order to push the proposal through, Rockefeller had
to make a rare appearance before a joint hearing of the Senate and
Assembly Codes Committees to lobby personally.
</P>
<P>
   Barclay, who was the Senate sponsor of the bill and chairman of
the Senate Codes Committee in 1973, says there was strong pressure
to do something about narcotics and the Rockefeller approach seemed
logical at the time. But he now supports change because the laws
have failed to achieve their goals. He and other Republican
reformers are not pushing for leniency. Instead, they want to end
the pointlessly rigid mandatory sentences and give judges
discretion to mete out appropriate punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed in the past quarter-century. New York state has
spent some $4 billion building prison cells in the past two
decades. There are now more than 70,000 inmates in the system, up
from 12,500 in 1973. Over the years, more and more prison space has
been devoted to locking up nonviolent drug offenders. Yet at the
same time, drug treatment programs have become more effective.
There are now real options to incarceration, such as allowing
courts to offer low-level, nonviolent offenders the opportunity to
avoid prison by completing treatment and staying clean.
</P>
<P>
   The costly lesson of the Rockefeller drug laws is that extremely
long sentences cannot by themselves solve the drug problem.
Governor Rockefeller was misguided on these laws, but he was also a
pragmatist capable of facing up to facts. It is time the
Legislature exhibited some pragmatism of its own by repealing these
outmoded laws in favor of a sentencing approach that takes into
account today's reality.

SPORTS COLUMN: PUT SOME ICE INTO THE STANLEY CUP

   DALLAS _ As the Stanley Cup finals continue in a state that
borders Mexico, the players fret about bad ice inside Reunion Arena
and everyone else notices the warm and humid conditions outside in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ice is so bad,'' Martin Brodeur, the Devils' goalie, said
Sunday. He tried to leave his net a few times to play the puck
Saturday night against the Stars but thought better of it. ``I
couldn't get to the puck because I missed the first two, three
steps because of the ice,'' Brodeur said.
</P>
<P>
   Most players seem to agree that the best ice, any time of year,
any place in the National Hockey League, is in Edmonton, where the
best teams used to be found when Glen Sather's Oilers won the cup
five times from 1984 through 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Would it make everyone happy for the NHL to do it the way the
National Football League does? The NFL plays the Super Bowl at a
warm-weather or domed site every January. Why not play the hockey
finals every June in Edmonton, a neutral site? They love hockey
there. And the late-spring weather is still cold enough to play
hockey on outdoor ice.
</P>
<P>
   (Just kidding on that last one, Canadian friends. Been there in
June. Know about the pleasant temperatures and the late-evening sun
so far north. Also remember the late-May snowstorm during one
finals there back when playoffs used to end before training camp
began.)
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to think about Edmonton these days because so many
former Oilers are front and center. Wayne Gretzky, the former
Edmonton star, bought into the Phoenix team last week. Sather, the
former Edmonton general manager, took over as boss of the Rangers.
And Jason Arnott of the Devils, a former Edmonton prospect, scored
a dynamic goal Saturday night to help his team gain a 2-1 victory
over the Dallas Stars and a two-games-to-one lead in the
four-of-seven-game championship round, which resumes here Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott leads the Devils in playoff points with 19. According to
Ken Daneyko, New Jersey's veteran defenseman, Arnott has really
started to take on a leadership role. ``He wants to be the go-to
guy,'' Daneyko said. ``To be an elite hockey player in this league,
you have to have that cocky attitude in a good way.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnott was a rarity in the last decade of Sather's Edmonton
regime: A good pick on the first round of the entry draft. Sather,
also a cocky guy, is an angle-player who last week scored a good
deal for himself in New York. Critics who cite Sather's poor draft
record in Edmonton in the 1990s might also consider his trading
record.
</P>
<P>
   He sent Arnott and Bryan Muir to the Devils in 1998 in a deal
for Bill Guerin and Valery Zelepukin. Lou Lamoriello, the Devils'
boss, got the best of that one. Like Sather of recent weeks,
Lamoriello will soon be a free agent. Unlike Sather, Lamoriello
will not take over the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   While Lamoriello gets credit for building this Devils team, much
applause is directed toward Larry Robinson, the coach who replaced
Robbie Ftorek with eight games left in the regular season. For now,
Robinson is on a motivational roll. When he threatened to bench
Scott Gomez in the Toronto series, Gomez perked up. When Robinson
screamed at the team in the Philadelphia series, the team responded
well.
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson publicly chastised the careless play of Petr
Sykora and Patrik Elias after Game 2 of the finals, Arnott's Czech
wings helped him dominate Game 3. Sykora scored the winning goal
Saturday and that line had 13 shots. Here's to you, Robinson. And
Sunday, Elias was not afraid to respond to his coach, in an oblique
sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is the right approach to just blame
individuals for a loss because this is a team,'' Elias said. But he
was smiling through the news conference, he and Sykora, up there
like two wild and crazy guys, joshing with teammates in the back of
the room and off to the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the mood with these chatty Devils, so many smiles as
they mingled with the news media. On the Dallas side, things are
glum. Stars supporters fear that the defending champions are too
old, too tired, too injured, too slow. But a Dallas victory Monday
night would change everyone's tune. And tunes are so much a part of
the atmosphere in funky Reunion, a barn only two decades old that
feels antiquated.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to hold heat and humidity. Flying insects were cruising
the press box Saturday night _ without credentials. The players may
hate to skate here and the cramped quarters give the league
logistical problems. But the fans are enthusiastic and friendly and
the music adds to the ambience. Unlike most NHL arenas, they employ
a disk jockey who refuses to assault the senses and sensibilities
of the customers by continuously blaring strip-joint rock.
</P>
<P>
   When the gates opened Saturday, and the fans climbed the steep
stairs to their dark, green seats, he softly played ``Sympathy for
the Devil,'' in deference to the visiting team. The lights were
still dim and the effect was wonderfully creepy. After an icing
whistle on the bad ice, the speakers softly emitted ``Ice, Ice,
Baby.'' It almost makes a neutral observer pull for a Stars victory
Monday night to guarantee Game 6 here Saturday. All things
considered, hockey in Dallas is pretty cool. &QL;

DEVILS TAKE AN ADVANTAGE IN KILLING PENALTIES  

</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Goaltending and special teams are the basic ingredients
for success in the playoffs, a claim made over the years by coaches
and players with several championship rings. That was the first
thing cited by Devils Coach Larry Robinson, who has seven
championship rings as a player and coach, before this postseason.
His Devils are justifying his claim in the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to their special teams, the Devils took a
two-games-to-one lead over the Dallas Stars with a 2-1 victory in
Game 3 here Saturday night. The Devils killed three of the Stars'
four power plays, including a five-on-three situation for 49
seconds at a critical time in the first period. They also killed a
delay-of-game penalty on Martin Brodeur with 4 minutes 15 seconds
left in the game, which many considered the goaltender's best
performance in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our penalty-killers won the game for us,'' said Petr Sykora,
whose power-play goal with 7:33 left in the second period _ a
blistering shot from the slot off a pass from Jason Arnott, who
scored the Devils' first goal _ was his third game-winner in the
playoffs. It was the 12th power-play goal in 62 attempts in the
playoffs for the Devils and the ninth for Sykora.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson attributed the success of killing Dallas' two-man
advantage to the strategy of keeping the puck out of their zone.
With Scott Stevens, Scott Niedermayer and John Madden leading the
way, the penalty-killers shut down Brett Hull and Mike Modano, two
of the game's most deadly snipers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any shot from the outside, it's Marty's,'' said Madden, the
best penalty-killer among the Devils' forwards. ``You want a shot
your goalie can see,'' he said, referring to Brodeur. ``You don't
want a shot from the middle because it can be tipped or
deflected.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer, who is usually the third defenseman on the
penalty-killing unit after Stevens and Ken Daneyko, said of killing
the penalty to Brodeur: ``That's a huge part of the game when
you're up a goal and they have a two-minute power play. Our PK has
done a great job for us in the playoffs and all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the regular season, the Devils' penalty-killers have
been the best in the playoffs. They killed 13 of Florida's 14 power
plays in the first round, and all 20 of Toronto's power plays in
the second round. When they reached the Eastern Conference finals
against Philadelphia, the Devils thwarted 15 of the Flyers' 17
power plays to reach the finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils are two victories from their second Stanley Cup for
other reasons, too: Stevens' crunching hits and brilliant play by
several forwards. Throw in a tirade by Robinson at precisely the
right time _ after three straight losses to the Flyers in the
conference finals _ and the Devils are threatening to dethrone the
defending champions.
</P>
<P>
   History is now on the side of the Devils, who have been the
better team in this series. In the 21 times the Stanley Cup finals
were tied at 1-1 after the first two games, the winner of Game 3
captured the trophy on all but three occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' hope that youth and exuberance would prevail over
experience is starting to materialize. The Stars had difficulty
keeping up with the Devils' speed on Saturday night, when their age
showed for the first time in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can use being tired as an excuse,'' said Kirk
Muller of the Stars, who, like the Devils, went through a grueling
seven-game series in the conference finals. ``You are fighting for
every inch out there, and there is no space. But I think we still
have enough left in the tank.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day Robinson kept his players off the ice, more than half a
dozen players refused to admit this afternoon that they had the
edge over the Stars in the four-of-seven-game finals, not even
after they handed the Stars only their second loss in 11 playoff
games at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot think you're better and get comfortable,'' said
Bobby Holik, whose team is 8-2 on the road. ``You cannot for a
moment think that, because they can come at you on the next shift.
They have a lot of experience and have responded to pressure
before.'' &QL;

RUELAS' HEAVY BAG OF BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley don't know
what to do with the millions they'll make for their June 17 fight
at Staples Center, they might want to see Rafael Ruelas.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas the fighter? Nope, Ruelas the personal financial planner.
Same guy, new career.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Ruelas isn't your typical ex-fighter. (Yep, he's
retired.)
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ring, he made the absolute most of limited natural
ability through unwavering determination and exhaustive
preparation. In other words, he truly realized his potential - and
then some.
</P>
<P>
   He got up from two first-round knockdowns to beat Fred Pendleton
and win the IBF lightweight title, his one and only world
championship. That's the kind of fighter Ruelas was and the man he
remains.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the ring, he was always a go-getter. As a teen-ager,
only a few years after he and his brother Gabriel moved here from
Mexico, he made a few bucks by using his bilingual skills to help
immigrants file amnesty papers.
</P>
<P>
   And as early as 1995, the year he lost his title to De La Hoya,
he began to dabble in the business world. Now, after taking UCLA
extension classes, he's a certified tax preparer and has been hired
by Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   He's training as a personal financial planner but must pass a
grueling six-hour test next month to become licensed. Anyone who
knows him will be surprised if he doesn't pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like winning a big fight,'' Ruelas said of his
post-boxing accomplishments. ``But I have a big fight (the exam)
ahead of me and I'm getting ready for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been under pressure before and I know good things are
hard to attain. It takes a lot of dedication. I think of this
(pre-exam period) as a studying camp instead of a training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I'm preparing for a big fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas will have some advantages if he passes the test.
</P>
<P>
   One, he knows quite a few wealthy people. De La Hoya and Mosely,
for example. He fought them both in the amateur ranks and De La
Hoya as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   And, two, De La Hoya, Mosley and others in the boxing business
who have money to invest know that Ruelas would fight for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact I'm known will help me,'' he said. ``People
know I'm a hard-working individual and that I'm not out to screw
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In boxing, I was always happy that people wanted me to win and
I didn't want to let people down. I was always prepared to win and
that's what I'm doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas has had something of a rivalry with De La Hoya, which
peaked when De La Hoya knocked him out in two rounds to win the IBF
title in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ruelas said De La Hoya shouldn't be surprised if he
makes a business proposition one day. A few minutes later,
realizing he'd left something out, he added: ``The same goes for
Shane. I know them both and they're both good guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas already is talking like a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone: Gabriel Ruelas, who'll be 30 in July, also
has his hands full at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The also-retired former junior lightweight champ is involved in
a variety of projects for Santa Clarita Valley-based Valencia
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   He's co-producing a feature film about his life; is a featured
athlete on Valencia's Internet and documentary outreach program,
``Hangin' with the Boyz''; will travel to Australia for the Sydney
Olympics to interview other featured athletes; and he's negotiating
for a Spanish-language television show, possibly as a game-show
host.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, he works several days a week as a representative
for Castaic Brick, one of his longtime sponsors, and runs a boxing
gym for kids in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Film production on his story is in the early stages. The script
for the film is almost finished, which is a feat in itself: There's
plenty to write about.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas almost died as a baby, immigrated from Mexico to the U.S.
with his brother as a child, discovered boxing here, broke his arm
in a pro fight, won a world championship in spite of it and
delivered the blows that killed Jimmy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Could be an interesting film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really amazing,'' Ruelas said. ``You never know what will
happen (whether the film will actually be made) because you know
how Hollywood is. I think it'll happen, though. And, right now, it
feels like winning the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Change in schedule: The five fight cards scheduled around the De
La Hoya-Mosley fight are now four. A June 18 card scheduled to be
televised by ABC has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a June 15 card at the Universal Amphitheater
featuring Laila Ali and Oba Carr in separate fights; a June 16 card
at Fantasy Springs Casino in Indio with Antonio Diaz facing
Demetrio Ceballos; an afternoon card on June 17 at the Bicycle Club
in Bell Gardens featuring Stevie Johnston on ABC; and the principal
card at Staples on the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Shades of the old Mike Tyson?
</P>
<P>
   David Tua took out capable but apparently frightened Obed
Sullivan in 51 seconds Saturday, a dramatic conclusion that will
help sell a prospective bout with champion Lennox Lewis in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what fans want, someone who goes out there and
destroys his opponent,'' Tua's promoter, Dan Goossen, told the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, also seeking a bout with Lewis, hopes he gets to the
Briton before Tua does.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's angry, mean and hungry,'' Tyson said recently of Tua.
``He's got that look in his eye, like he's ready to kill someone. I
hope it's not Lewis, because I want to end Lewis.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Robert Garcia fought too boldly toward the end of his bout with
Ben Tackie on the Tua-Sullivan undercard and lost a fight he was
winning easily.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, an Oxnard resident and former junior lightweight champ,
was caught with a left hook and stopped in the 10th round.
</P>
<P>
   ``My corner told me to come out and box and fight smart,''
Garcia said of the final round. ``But I'm a warrior. I made a
mistake, but things happen like that in boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's two consecutive knockout losses for Garcia. It'll be
tough for him to climb back to the top. ...
</P>
<P>
   Acelino Freitas of Brazil, one of the hottest prospects in
boxing at 25-0 with 25 KOs, faces Lemuel Nelson in a 12-round
junior lightweight bout Saturday on HBO. ...
</P>
<P>
   Arizona made the right decision when it granted Julio Cesar
Chavez a boxing license.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the 37-year-old former champion will get crushed by
WBC super lightweight champ Kostya Tszyu on July 29. Chavez's loss
to journeyman Willy Wise in October seemed to indicate that he's
nothing like the fighter he once was.
</P>
<P>
   However, if anyone has earned the right to give it one last
shot, it's him. He's one of the greatest fighters of all time and
remains as good as many contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be my last fight,'' he said. ``Let me go out with
dignity and honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's just hope he goes out healthy. ...
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has established a boxing commission, which sets the
stage for a fight between native son Stevie Johnston, the WBC
featherweight champ, and former titleholder Jesse James Leija in
September. ...
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield said he has fought - and lost - with injuries
or illness, in Riddick Bowe III (illness), Lennox Lewis I (illness)
and against Michael Moorer (sore shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't about to do it again against John Ruiz. Their bout
was pushed back until at least August after Holyfield tore a muscle
below his ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to embarrass myself the way I did when I fought
Lennox Lewis the first time,'' said Holyfield, 37. ``I'm just not
going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's advisor, Jim Thomas, said his client's injury has
nothing to do with his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said. ``It's a simple athletic injury. It
has nothing to do with age or deterioration. This could happen to
an 18-year old.''

 &HT;    Stewart gets back on track
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ The trophy and six-figure check were appreciated.
But more than anything, Tony Stewart was satisfied with the
reaction from the crowd after winning the MBNA Platinum 400 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best thing about this win,'' Stewart said in a
quiet voice. ``Having those people supporting me like that . . . I
haven't had that for a while now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has been the subject of controversy in the Winston Cup
Series for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it was his own fault. Frustrated after the race at
Richmond, he sped through the garage area and endangered the safety
of spectators and other teams' crew members. After he climbed out
of the No. 20 Pontiac, he was rushed by reporters and kicked a
cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   At The Winston all-star race a week later in Charlotte, Stewart
was criticized by Ward and Jeff Burton for rough driving.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Stewart was severely damaged even more a few days
later when a magazine quoted him as saying he was fed up with many
aspects of the circuit, including being hounded by
autograph-seeking fans and the loss of his privacy as a result of
his sudden rise to stardom last season.
</P>
<P>
   He did not realize the impact of the magazine article until he
was booed by the crowd during the week in Charlotte. Stewart later
apologized for his comments, saying they were taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, however, the tide finally appeared to be turning for
the young star, who is sponsored by Atlanta-based Home Depot.
Stewart was a popular figure throughout the weekend at Dover Downs
International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing those fans all around there cheering . . . I wish I had
the words to express (how much it meant to me),'' Stewart said.
``Because the last two weeks have literally been heck for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nice feeling seeing all those people (cheering) again.
Hopefully that will start building our fan base back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart dominated the 400-lap event around ``The Monster Mile,''
leading 242 laps. His only threat came at lap 387 when rookie Matt
Kenseth tried and failed to pass on the inside of the third turn.
Stewart took his first checkered flag of the season, becoming the
12th different driver to win in 13 races this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of the (chase for the Winston Cup championship)
by any means,'' said Stewart, who moved to ninth in the points
standings. ``I don't think you ever count yourself out with so many
races to go because you never know what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth finished second. Bobby Labonte finished third and
expanded his lead in the points standings to 82 over Ward Burton,
who finished two laps down and in eighth place.

EDITORIAL: INEFFECTIVE HUMANITARIAN AID  
 DRUG LAWS THAT MISFIRED  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 5:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian disasters have emerged as the most complex
challenges facing American foreign policy. There has been strenuous
debate over whether America should get involved when there is
famine in Somalia or Sudan, genocide in Rwanda, mass killings in
East Timor or a refugee exodus in Kosovo. What gets less attention
is the question of how to take effective action when we do get
involved. An internal State Department report provides an unusually
frank assessment of why American action has sometimes been slow or
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   The study was directed by Morton Halperin, head of the policy
planning staff at the State Department, and James Michel, counselor
to the Agency for International Development. It examines how
Washington responded to three man-made humanitarian disasters _
stemming from armed conflicts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Sudan _
and one natural disaster, Hurricane Mitch in Central America.
Although the report finds much to applaud, it is also a tale of
poor coordination, missions being duplicated or falling through the
cracks, and confusion inside the administration and the private
humanitarian groups that sometimes cannot be sure with which agency
to work. Confusion over which part of the government was leading
the response to Hurricane Mitch, for example, led to delays in
assessing the damage and getting aid to Central America. Most
important, at many times when American policy was made, no one was
present to remind officials of the humanitarian consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The report can be read as a plea for establishing a single
office to coordinate humanitarian assistance, with a chief who
would participate in high-level meetings the next time we are faced
with a Kosovo or Sudan. This is an eminently sensible
recommendation for the next administration, which is sure to find
itself wrestling with new famines, hurricanes and wars.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of this unclassified assessment have stirred
grumbling inside the State Department for their public bluntness,
especially because their criticisms have received most of the
attention. But they could have hoped for little impact if they had
kept their views classified, and the issue is one that deserves
airing. Halperin and Michel have performed a service by identifying
the shortcomings in America's humanitarian programs, and by
allowing the public to know.  &QL;

MRS. CLINTON GETS MIXED REACTION AT SALUTE TO ISRAEL PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio shook
hands and stood side by side Sunday, both vowing to support the
political and economic stability of Israel. But along the Fifth
Avenue route of the annual Salute to Israel Parade, the intense,
even angry, division among Jews over the two U.S. Senate candidates
was starkly on display.
</P>
<P>
   The parade, like so many others in New York, typically draws a
healthy contingent of vote-seeking politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the political jockeying was so pervasive and the
crowd seemed so politically engaged that even some organizers said
that campaigning was overshadowing the purpose of the event, to
celebrate the 52nd year of Israeli statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio marched with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, just ahead of the New
York City Police Department marching band. Clinton lined up behind
them, beside Sen. Charles Schumer and a collection of leaders of
Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady proved to be the biggest media attraction,
drawing such a large pack of television cameras and photographers
that her security team stretched out a rope to corral them. But she
also inspired the most vociferous reaction from the crowd, with
spectators sporadically booing, screaming and sometimes even
crudely insulting her as she passed.
</P>
<P>
   Also along the 22-block parade route, in addition to the groups
of school children, religious clubs and community associations,
were three likely future candidates for mayor _ City Comptroller
Alan Hevesi, Public Advocate Mark Green and City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone _ as well as many other state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary brings out passions in people,'' said Green, who
described the crowd as perhaps the most intense he had seen in his
decade of marching in parades in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and Clinton went to great lengths throughout the day to
try to demonstrate their devotion to Israel, as both candidates, in
what has quickly become a competitive race, clearly recognize the
importance of the large number of Jewish voters in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their competition for votes, they were quite cordial
with each other. They shook hands and chatted briefly about Lazio's
two daughters during a break in the parade while they stood at a
reviewing stand on Fifth Avenue at 69th Street.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lazio's and Clinton's first joint appearance since
Giuliani dropped out of the nation's highest profile Senate race
last month and Lazio replaced him as the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio repeatedly spoke Sunday about his support for moving the
U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, to recognize the
city that Israel claims as its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who also supports such a move, spoke more generally
about what she called her longstanding respect for the country and
its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has been and will be always there for
Israel,'' she said, drawing applause from crowd, including the
mayor and Lazio. ``And we will always support the Israeli
government and Israeli people as they struggle to find a safe and
secure peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates stayed away from more controversial topics,
such as whether there should be an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton angered many Jewish voters last year with when she
voiced support for such a state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to take the lead of the state of Israel on this,''
Lazio said Sunday when asked by a reporter about the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some serious questions about whether or not a
Palestinian state is sustainable, considering the security concerns
of the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   But the animosity felt by some in the crowd toward Clinton was
evident on nearly every block, with some holding signs recalling
her embrace last year of Yasser Arafat's wife, Suha, while others
shouted ``Go back to Arkansas,'' mocking her move last year to New
York state.
</P>
<P>
   Mira Hakak, a Queens statistician, held a torn up Clinton
campaign sign in her hands, just above an Israeli flag that was
propped up in her pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did not do anything in her life and now she wants to be
our senator,'' said Hakak. ``If she wants to be in Washington, she
should get a job as a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions ran so high that brief scuffles at times broke out
between the two camps, such as when one backer of Clinton had her
campaign sign pulled out of her hands and torn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just a lot of hate,'' said Resi Cooper, 29, of Long
Island, a supporter of Clinton, who said she was nearly knocked
over by Lazio supporters at one point during the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later about being booed at the Parade, Clinton responded:
``I had a great time. I mean, that's democracy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also amid the crowd were many undecided voters, like Lisa
Rosenzweig, 39, a lawyer from Brooklyn, who said she generally
votes for Democrats, but has not made up her mind in the Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's your lip?'' she yelled to Lazio, whose lip was still
swollen from a fall he took in a Memorial Day parade last week on
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   She later told a reporter that she considered Lazio a worthy
candidate and would not likely decide on her vote until November.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who was campaigning for his second time with Lazio, at
times seemed to attract more attention than the Long Island
congressman, with spectators chanting his name and some even
holding his old Senate campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor appeared to make an effort to let Lazio take the
lead, allowing him to decide when to break away from the parade and
greet supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lazio and Clinton dashed from the end of the Salute to
Israel Parade to the smaller Philippine Day Parade on Madison
Avenue in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a much warmer welcome from this crowd, some of
her supporters so excited that they tried to climb over police
officers to reach her.

`SEX AND CITY' OUT-CHICKS
 `CHICK TV'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 BY BILL GOODYKOONTZ 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  Remember `Ghost?` You know, the Demi
Moore-Patrick Swayze weeper about true love, short bangs and making
clay pots while a ghost hugs you?
<TEXT>
<P>
   That movie pretty much defines the term ``chick flick.'' It
combined all the elements: the sappy plot, the tear-jerking
emotions, the, you know, romance.
</P>
<P>
   Television has its own version of the chick flick, naturally.
The elements are the same - watch any episode of ``Once and Again''
and before Sela Ward's teenage daughter sheds her first weekly
tear, you'll have the idea - only they're repeated week after week.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say real men don't watch ``Once and Again,'' or
didn't hide tears in a darkened theater when ``Unchained Melody''
swelled during ``Ghost.'' Variety, spice of life, like that. But
like prime-time ice skating, this sort of entertainment clearly is
aimed at women.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, TV for chicks that serves as an antidote to
chick TV. And it returns tonight - ``Sex In the City,'' the HBO
series starring Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie, a New York sex
columnist (based on the ``New York Observer'' writings of the
genuine item, Candace Bushnell).
</P>
<P>
   If you've never seen the program, its title is stunningly
accurate. This is a show about sex, pure and simple. Actually,
that's not true - the sex in ``Sex and the City'' is rarely pure
but is complicated enough to send Dr. Ruth into a screaming fit
(but then, what sex isn't?).
</P>
<P>
   This season, the show's third, is no different. In the first two
episodes, Parker's character dates a politician. So there is some
talk of politics - which leads directly to talk about sex. It also
leads to sex, sort of, sex that by the second episode is so kinky
it would not only be unfair for me to spoil the surprise, but
should it worm past a snoozing editor would also probably cost me
my job for trying.
</P>
<P>
   There is more sex, lots of sex, hotter sex. How much hotter sex
is there than sex leaning against a fire truck?
</P>
<P>
   There is also utterly profane lan guage from the mouths of the
babes, if you'll forgive a sexist term, who hang out with Carrie -
another series trademark.
</P>
<P>
   While we're at it, let's just go ahead and say it: The language
is shocking. And the only reason I can figure why is because you
don't expect beautiful women to talk that way. Or about that kind
of thing (including more terms for the male sex organ than you'll
hear in a junior-high locker room).
</P>
<P>
   Yet the same kind of talk about the same type of subject doesn't
even raise an eyebrow when I hear it on, say, ``The Sopranos,''
because that's how I expect a bunch of mobsters to talk. Guy
mobsters, at that.
</P>
<P>
   Is that fair? Of course not. Yet I don't feel bad for responding
that way, because an underlying premise of ``Sex and the City'' is
that the series is showing me how women really talk, and what they
really talk about - a universe normally off-lim its to guys.
</P>
<P>
   If that's all there was to the show, it would be an interesting
lark, nothing more. What makes ``Sex and the City'' something
better is the occa sional nugget sandwiched in between all the sex
talk and sex action that puts the sometimes desperate antics into
perspective. One of Carrie's friends, for instance, blurts out her
belief that `women really just want to be rescued.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not just something men don't know. According to Carrie,
it's some thing single women in their 30s don't even want to admit
to themselves. Thus we learn another secret women keep.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, of course, is whether it's true - all of it
or any of it, the ambitious sex, the frank sex talk and the
vulnerability that lies just beneath.
</P>
<P>
   You're asking a guy? I don't know. But to its credit, ``Sex and
the City'' does make it seem so.
</P>

CONVENTION COVERAGE GROWS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (MOVING in ``A'' and ``K'' categories)  
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over, TV networks and gavel-to-gavel cable broadcasters.
The Internet is coming to the 2000 political conventions in a big
way.
</P>
<P>
   What one convention official calls an ``astronomical'' growth of
online news will provide a dimension of coverage scarcely imagined
just four years ago, when the first convention Webcasting took
place.
</P>
<P>
   The shift comes as commercial television networks pare back live
coverage of what they increasingly see as a ``canned'' four-day
show that can't sustain the interest of most viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Local stations, too, are showing less and less commitment to
staffing the events. For example, about 30 stations affiliated with
or owned by ABC covered the 1996 convention, but only about half
that many will be going this year, said Michael Huitt, executive
producer of the network's convention coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, three of the six largest commercial
television stations will have a presence at the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Schedules aren't yet firm, but the mainstream networks are
expected to air as little as an hour a day of convention reportage.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves non-stop coverage to be supplied by cable
broadcasters CNN and C-SPAN, by the non-commercial PBS net work
and, increasingly, by online providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see an explosion from all quarters in the
amount of information on the Internet about the convention,'' said
Tim Fitzpatrick, press secretary for the Republican National
Convention, which opens July 31 in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain how many of the 15,000 members of the media
covering each convention will represent e-media.
</P>
<P>
   The count is difficult because many holding accreditation will
file video, sound and text both to the traditional print and
electronic outlets and to those organizations' relatively new World
Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, will work exclusively in cyberspace, their
material disseminated by outlets as large as America Online, with
more than 20 million members, and as specialized as a pair of
minority-oriented Web sites, politicallyblack.com and, for Latinos,
www.hola.com.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Internet offers unlimited space and time for both
live and archived online stories, it can fulfill the information
needs of small niche groups and insatiable political junkies alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a way to let Americans personalize, rather than
just localize, the news they receive,'' Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, (Thomas) P. ``Tip'' O'Neill (the late Democratic
House speaker from Boston) was famous for the adage that all
politics is local. We view it now as all politics is PERSONAL, with
the power of the Internet,'' Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are gearing up to Webcast their own coverage. They
also promise opportunities for interactive participation during the
conventions, although for now they won't reveal more than
generalities about possible chat rooms, polling and direct
messaging of officials.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP convention's Web site won't be operating until next
month, Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, at www.dems2000.com, already are accepting
worldwide input for the party platform that will be adopted at the
Aug. 14-17 convention in Los Angeles, spokesman David Dam said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This convention will make history as the most technologically
sophisticated event ever,'' said Lydia Camarillo, chief executive
for the Democrats' gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Whether all the newfound availability of information will
translate into interest and utilization is open to question,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this year's conventions, using the Internet is still
enough of a novelty and a low-tech experience _ watching 20,000
cheering politicos on a one-inch picture _ that it will be more
like watching the Mars landing a couple of years ago,'' said Steve
Doig, who specializes in computer-assisted journalism as Knight
Professor of Journalism at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offers some wonderful opportunities for many organizations
to very cheaply present their viewpoints,'' Doig said, and it
allows people to view as much as they want whenever they want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're probably a convention away from what it can be
someday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, although convention Webcasts attracted millions of
visits a day, ``there weren't a lot of Americans who had computers
powerful enough to watch live programming,'' Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet Alley,'' a few out-of-the-way media spaces with
computer connections provided in 1996, will be practically a
boulevard this year, with 55 booths assigned, he said. &QL;

190 ARRESTED AS POLICE RAID COCKFIGHTING RING IN THE BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police raided a rundown movie house in the Bronx and
broke up a professional cockfighting ring just as a night of
gambling and bloody fighting was getting started, the authorities
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six people suspected of organizing the spectacle were
arrested. Another 154 people were issued summonses for observing
animal fights.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and the police said the raid, conducted by about 75
officers who surrounded the building and burst through two
entrances with a battering ram, caught the gamblers by surprise
before the scene turned to bedlam and a chase ensued across the
theater's roof, where some bettors tried to escape by scrambling
down a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators paid $25 to sit under low-hanging fluorescent lights
in a squalid auditorium while the roosters sliced each other open
and bettors howled with glee or frustration. The 36 people
suspected of organizing the event were each charged with one count
of animal fighting, a felony under state agriculture law.
</P>
<P>
   The theater was the scene of a similar raid in March 1995, when
the police stopped what they said was a national championship
cockfight. Nearly 300 people were arrested or ticketed that night.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Inspector Michael Brooks, commanding officer of the Vice
Enforcement Division, said that during the latest raid, which began
late Saturday and continued into Sunday morning, roosters and men
ran through the building with the police in pursuit. The floors
were soiled with dog feces, blood and feathers. The odor was rank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' he said. ``The place was a real dump.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the raid, fire marshals ordered the building
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said the police were still trying to determine who owned
the building and who had promoted the cockfights.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the area said Sunday that cockfighting returned to
the building last year, as meticulously organized as before.
</P>
<P>
   Bettors wagered $200 to $500 on the roosters of their fancy,
neighbors said. Each fight lasted until one rooster collapsed and
refused to fight on, a condition that often meant death.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they stopped the fights within an hour. Eight
roosters were already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said an undercover detective began attending fights
months ago to gather information on the bird handlers, guards and
money collectors. The authorities said the detective's work enabled
the police to pick out the organizers from the spectators after the
raid.
</P>
<P>
   The police said $14,000 was confiscated and 33 fighting cocks
were taken to the Center for Animal Care and Control in East
Harlem, where they would be humanely killed. Two pit bulls were
also seized. Brooks said the dogs would probably be killed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cockfighting roosters, which are bred for ferocity, swiftness
and stamina, are too evil-tempered to be adopted as pets and too
tough to eat. Many are also injected with steroids to make them
meaner in a fight.

GUN SALE REJECTION RATE LEVEL AT 2.4% 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ About 204,000 gun sales were rejected after
background checks of the buyers in 1999, the Justice Department
said in a report issued over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That was a rejection rate of 2.4 percent of the 8.6 million gun
sale applications submitted under federal, state and local laws.
The laws bar the sale of firearms to people with records of felony
conviction or indictment, fugitive status, court restraining
orders, mental illness and misdemeanor domestic violence
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by the department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics, found that the rejection rate was higher at the state
and local level than at the federal level. The reason, it said, was
that the state and local police departments ``have access to more
detailed criminal history records than the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six states, which encompass more than two-thirds of the
country's population, perform their own background checks. The
other states rely on the FBI to perform the checks. Of the 8.6
million checks last year, the FBI conducted 4.5 million checks, and
state and local agencies performed 4.1 million checks.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection rate for the state and local background checks was
3 percent, compared with a rejection rate of 1.8 percent for
federal checks. The Clinton administration has argued that the
states are better equipped than the FBI to perform background
checks, but some states contend funding constraints preclude paying
for the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Holder, the deputy attorney general, said the gun sale
rejections were part the federal Brady Law effort to keep guns out
of the hands of ``felons, fugitives, domestic abusers and other
persons not legally allowed to have a gun.'' The law is named for
James Brady, the press secretary to President Ronald Reagan who was
wounded an assassination attempt on Reagan in 1981 by a man later
determined to be mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our success,'' Holder said, ``we must not become
complacent. There are still 89 Americans, including 12 young
people, dying every day from gunshot wounds. We must continue our
efforts to prevent crime and gun violence and our tough enforcement
strategies at the federal, state and local level.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 123,000 gun sales rejected by state and local authorities
last year, 73 percent were prompted by prospective buyers having
records of felony convictions or indictments and 11 percent by
domestic violence convictions or restraining orders.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said that background checks had resulted
in the rejection of 536,000 gun sales, out of 22.2 million
applications, since the Brady law was passed in 1994 through the
end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The national rejection rate has remained 2.4 percent since 1994,
despite the Nov. 30, 1998, switch to computerized instant checks
and the addition of checks on long-gun purchasers. Only handgun
buyers were checked before.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a Democrat from New York who began
advocating gun control after her husband was killed and her son
severely wounded in the Long Island Rail Road shooting in 1993,
said Sunday that more money should be provided for the background
checks of prospective gun buyers. ``This is another reason that we
should close the gun show loophole,'' McCarthy said, referring to
the fact that background checks are not required for buyers at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of gun control have blocked efforts to enlarge the
background checks to include purchases at gun shows. With Vice
President Al Gore casting the tie-breaking vote, the Senate voted
in 1999 to include gun shows, but the House of Representatives
deleted the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   A symbolic measure, a resolution that does not have the force of
law, was approved by the Senate last month in a 50-to-49 vote,
urging that all sellers at gun shows be required to conduct checks
on buyers.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said that the 2.4 percent rejection rate showed that
``ordinary, law-abiding citizens can get a gun'' and that the rate
would be no different at gun shows.

NEW YORK FANS SAY THEIR FINAL GOODBYES TO TITO PUENTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUAN FORERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hundreds of people, from world-famous musicians to
retired taxi drivers, came together at a Manhattan funeral chapel
Sunday to say goodbye to the Mambo King.
</P>
<P>
   Tito Puente, the legendary band leader and percussionist, died
Wednesday after half a century of delighting crowds the world over
with his Latin jazz and frenetic salsa. And Sunday, faithful fans
and loyal friends waited for hours for the brief chance to spend a
quiet moment beside hise white coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners started arriving at the Riverside Memorial Chapel on
the Upper West Side as early as 10 a.m., and hours later hundreds
of people remained, waiting in a line that stretched nearly a block
along West 76th Street from the corner of Amsterdam Avenue. For
many, it was an emotional farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tearfully saw him, left him a kiss and said goodbye,''
said Michael Terrace, 74, a former professional dancer who often
performed at the old Palladium in Midtown where the Tito Puente
Orchestra solidified its reputation in the 1950s. ``It hurts. It
really hurts. You have to say: `Tito, I enjoyed working with you. I
loved you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Puente, who died at age 77 after suffering complications from
open-heart surgery, will be buried Tuesday after a private funeral
in Nanuet, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   So it was Sunday's seven-hour wake _ along with another wake
Monday between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. at the chapel _ that gave fans a
chance to bid farewell to El Rey.
</P>
<P>
   Public officials like Peter F. Vallone, the City Council
speaker, and Rep.Jose E. Serrano of the Bronx attended. Latin music
fans penned in behind police sawhorses, meanwhile, reveled in the
collection of young and old Latin musicians who came together to
pay their respects to a man who shaped their music, including Ruben
Blades, the Panamanian singer and actor; Cheo Feliciano, the
baritone; and Tito Nieves, the salsa star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen musicians that I hadn't seen since I was a little
girl,'' said Cindy Rodriguez, the daughter of the late band leader
Tito Rodriguez, who, with Puente and Machito, are credited with
driving the mambo craze. ``You know, you're not going to see these
people in one place again.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who spent hours in line waiting to get into the chapel
were rewarded with a walk up a short flight of stairs to a chapel
where Puente's body, clad in a white suit and white tie, lay in a
coffin surrounded by white orchids. Eight pictures of Puente, one
of him in a Navy uniform during World War II and the others showing
him banging on his timbales with delight, were placed around the
coffin.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the mourners passed the coffin, many saying a brief
prayer or kissing the plastic glass that covered the open coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Esperanza Rengifo of Queens carried four of Puente's 118 albums,
clutching them to her chest as she recalled how important his music
had been to her. ``I've been here since 8 a.m.,'' said Rengifo, 73,
as she neared the entrance to the chapel at 1 p.m. ``I missed Mass
to be here, so I asked God for forgiveness. I said `I'll have to
miss Mass because I need to see Tito Puente.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who came, it seemed, had a personal memory of the
band leader: salseros who danced to his music in the Palladium half
a century ago, friends who laughed and joked with a man famous for
his sense of humor, musicians who performed with him in smoky
neighborhood joints and world-class music halls.
</P>
<P>
   Luz Pagan said being so close to Puente reminded her of the days
when she paid $1.50 to get into the Palladium to dance for hours to
his music. ``Imagine, how great it was,'' she said. ``To hear those
timbales. You would feel it in your blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Others carried Puerto Rican flags in honor of one of the
island's most famous sons, who was born in 1923 in East Harlem to
Puerto Rican migrants and is credited with spreading the island's
music to far corners of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people wore T-shirts or buttons featuring the
musician's famed pudgy cheeks and irascible grin that they had
bought from vendors near the chapel. Some parked their cars nearby
and cranked up their stereos, playing ``Oye Como Va'' and other
famous songs composed by Puente.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to come here,'' said Pedro Aguilar, a dancer
known as Cuban Pete, who first met Puente in 1949. ``I just
couldn't miss this. I wanted to say my goodbyes properly.''

RANGERS' DRAFT GURU SAYS TALENT POOL WEAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Major League Baseball's 2000 First-Year
Player Draft begins today, and five of the first 64 selections
belong to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that might not be the boon it would appear to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were quality in the draft pool and depth, it would be
a much more comforting feeling,'' said Chuck McMichael, the
Rangers' director of scouting. ``But it's not that good of a draft,
in my opinion. I've sat in 20 draft rooms now, and it's one of the
weakest I've seen. Now, that's not to say we're not going to get
good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing that amateur talent, though, will be a costly endeavor
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have one selection in the first round (No. 25), two
supplemental first-round choices (Nos. 35 and 39) and two during
the second round (Nos. 56 and 64).
</P>
<P>
   The five players chosen with those selections during the 1999
draft received signing bonuses totaling $4.19 million, and that
figure could exceed $5 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have the draft picks, you're probably paying that
money to free agents,'' Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said.
``Yet, they're unproven, and that's the risk you run. The draft
does get very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lost their first-round selection to the St. Louis
Cardinals for signing left-hander Darren Oliver as a free agent,
but the organization received the New York Mets' first-round choice
as compensation for losing third baseman Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Rangers received supplemental first-round selections
for Zeile and right-hander Aaron Sele, whom the Seattle Mariners
signed as a free agent. The Rangers also received the Mariners'
second-round selection as compensation for Sele's departure.
</P>
<P>
   So, what will the Rangers do with their first five selections?
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, McMichael would prefer two power arms, a power bat, a
pure hitter and a middle infielder/center fielder with speed and
the potential to become a leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, McMichael cannot predict with any degree of certainty who
will be available when he makes the 25th pick. On Friday evening,
McMichael estimated that he spent 12 of the previous 24 hours on
the telephone attempting to gain a sense of who would be chosen
before the Rangers' first selection.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael's efforts produced 63 possibilities, leaving him
little idea of who will be available at No. 25.

GLYNN GETS START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers will recall right-handed pitcher
Ryan Glynn from Triple-A Oklahoma and start him tonight against the
Los Angeles Dodgers, manager Johnny Oates said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn will be replacing left-hander Darren Oliver, who
complained of a ``dead arm'' after each of his past two starts.
Oates, though, expects Oliver to return to the rotation and start
Sunday against the Colorado Rockies in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn went 3-1 with a 3.17 earned-run average in 11 appearances
(10 starts) for the RedHawks this season, but he missed his
previous scheduled start with a finger blister.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers plan to option outfielder Scott Podsednik to
Double-A Tulsa to make room for Glynn on the 25-man roster. The
Rangers purchased Podsednik's contract Saturday from Tulsa.  &QL; 
Kapler on schedule
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers expect outfielder Gabe Kapler to return to the
lineup as their center fielder Friday against the Rockies, manager
Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler will begin his second medical rehabilitation assignment
with Double-A Tulsa and play five innings tonight, seven innings
tomorrow and nine innings Wednesday before rejoining the Rangers,
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler went on the 15-day disabled list May 4 after suffering a
partial tear to his right quadriceps muscle. The Rangers plan for
Kapler to replace Ruben Mateo (fracture, right femur) as their
center fielder after the latter suffered a season-ending injury
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve outfielders Scarborough Green and Jason McDonald will
share playing time in center field until Kapler's return, Oates
said.  &QL; 
Sheldon plays
</P>
<P>
   Reserve infielder Scott Sheldon logged his first start this
season at third base for Mike Lamb, who strained the trapezius
muscle in his right shoulder Saturday during a 4-3 loss to the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The injury did not prevent Lamb from playing, but Oates chose to
give the left-handed hitter the evening off against Arizona
left-hander Omar Daal. Lamb strained the muscle swinging the bat
during his final plate appearance Saturday.  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Reserve infielder Frank Catalanotto likely will make his first
start defensively since May 18 tonight against the Dodgers, Johnny
Oates said. Catalanotto likely will spell second baseman Luis
Alicea.
</P>
<P>
   The first-inning home runs by catcher Ivan Rodriguez and first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro marked the second time this season the
Rangers hit back-to-back homers.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Craig Counsell snapped a 210 at-bat homerless streak
with his second-inning solo shot off right-hander Esteban Loaiza.
It was Counsell's first home run since hitting one off of
Philadelphia's Wayne Gomes on July 24, 1998. / nn

   Thomas E. Healy and his wife, Jane, both outdoor enthusiasts who
live in Vail, Colo., were visiting their children and grandchildren
in Manhattan last month and enjoying an afternoon in Central Park.
Near their picnic spot, a 40-ish father was playing, quite
raucously, with his son. He eventually climbed quite far up a
small, budding tree to demonstrate either his enthusiasm for the
day or perhaps his retained prowess.
</P>
<P>
   As he reached a level of about 15 feet, shouting all the way, he
grabbed a branch that was apparently covered with some unpleasant
natural residue. Healy, much amused, reported the reaction _ ``With

   I have lived for the last 30 years in a building housing people

I know by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Sheila,'' I greeted her. She nodded and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is your name Sheila?'' the actor asked. She nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``I've been calling you Lillian for years and

she said she would need some time to work on it and asked how she

   In an instant, he pulled out a cell phone. ``Let me give you my

   It happened on a crowded 86th Street crosstown bus, one of those
double-size buses with accordion pleats. At Central Park West,
there were a number of people waiting to get on and off, and I was
pleased when the driver finally closed the door, waiting for the
light to change. As it was, I was going to be late for an
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a woman from the back came forth holding something and
called out: ``He dropped his wallet. Can you catch him?''
</P>
<P>
   The driver asked, ``Do you know which one it was?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm sure,'' the woman said. ``He was a heavy-set man who
just got off.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver opened the door and honked vigorously, but no one
turned around.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the driver said: ``Go find him. He must be just
around the corner. I'll wait for you.''
</P>
<P>
   When the woman hesitated, looking down at the small child she
was with, several people said: ``Don't worry, we'll take care of
the child. Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Off she ran, rounded a corner and came back in a minute or two,
smiling, triumphant and empty-handed. She had found him. He was
flabbergasted and, of course, very grateful.
</P>
<P>
   As she climbed back onto the bus, we all cheered, and it was
almost as if we had all participated in this good deed. All that
day, I glowed with the memory, and every time I think of it, it
makes me proud to be a New Yorker.

   Citibank: ``Is that in ... which state?''

   Citibank: ``Oh, Europe.'' Long silence. ``Exactly where is
Norway located? In which country?''
</P>
<P>
   L.W.: ``Norway is a country.''
</P>
<P>
   Citibank then gave her another number where, after listening to

started with Andorra and eventually informed her that there are 740
ATMs in Norway. The country. In Europe.

ERSTAD HAS TURNED IT AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It's three hours before the first pitch of the
day as the sweltering sun of a late spring afternoon bakes the
baseball diamond at Edison International Field.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the air conditioned confines of the Angels clubhouse,
left fielder Darin Erstad is busy studying videotape of Dodger
pitchers as he and his teammates begin this year's round of
Interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, who turned 26 Sunday, is in the midst of a ritual that
has made him one of the American League's most dangerous hitters
this season. Through Friday night Erstad possessed the league's
second best average of .372. His plate presence has helped keep the
Angels the chase for the American League Western Division title.
That's a far cry from 1999 when Erstad finished the year batting a
dismal .253 on a franchise that was among baseball's all-time
worst.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Erstad was named the American League Player of the
Week. In the course of six games he hit .481, with 13 hits in 27
at-bats -- including a triple and four home runs. His slugging
percentage of 1.000 lead the league.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``This year the hits are falling,'' Erstad explained. ``Last
year they weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be as simple as that, but there's more to the science
of hitting than dumb luck. It takes hard work and dedication, two
qualities that Angels' manager Mike Scioscia claims Erstad has in
abundance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darin's an All-Star caliber player,'' Scioscia said. ``And I
think he's rebounded from an off year last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the leadoff hitter he's really in a swing position where
you have to drive in runs and set the table for other hitters and
he's done both magnificently and become one of the premeir hitters
in our league this year.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Erstad's comeback might e the fact that he's
played without injury this season. Still another might be the fact
that he hasn't had to bounce around from position to position in
the outfield or from spot to spot in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, he's committed to the team, Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would faze him to do anything that would help
us win,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Troy Glaus agreed with Scioscia noting that Erstad is
as responsible for the Angels success this season as anyone on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get a leadoff hitter hitting .370, that helps
everyone out,'' Glaus said. ``I mean Mo Vaughn has 40-something
RBIs and a lot of them are (Erstad).
</P>
<P>
   ``So what he's doing this year helps everybody out,'' Glaus
added. ``The more he gets on base, the more chances we have to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's teammates all say his daily ritual before a game plays
a key role in Erstad's performance on the field. While the ritual
varies slightly from day to day there is also some consistency to
the routine.
</P>
<P>
   After watching videotape Friday, Erstad spent 10 minutes
preparing his by rubbing and scraping the shaft with pine tar
wrapped in a rag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to get a bat ready for play so this is just something I
do,' Erstad explained. ``Sometimes there's a glossiness on a bat
and by doing this you get a rough edge feel to it. I just like to
get it so there's that rough stuff on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Angels take batting practice about two hours
before the opening pitch. Erstad is the first one on the field and
while he waiting his turn, he hits balls off a tee.
</P>
<P>
   Batting practice begins with two bunts, a grounder, then long
flies to the outfield. On Friday, Erstad took the fifth batting
practice pitch he saw and effortlessly ripped it into the right
field stands.
</P>
<P>
   After that Erstad retreats to the clubhouse to finish preparing
for the game. The hard work all pays off. In his first at bat
Friday night, Erstad cranked a hit to right. Before the night had
ended, Erstad was 2-for-5 at the plate with an RBI as his team
defeated the Dodgers 12-5.
</P>
<P>
   As the first half of the 2000 season draws to a close, the
Angels hope that Erstad will contine to perform with the
consistency he has shown this far. For his part, Erstad said he
will do his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the leadoff hitter that's my job and that's all I'm
concentrating on is getting on base,'' he said. ``I want to get on
base so that guys like Mo Vaughn and Tim Salmon can do their jobs.
``If I can do that, then the offense and the team is going to be in
a lot better shape than it was last year. That's what I'm working
for.''

OLSON NEWS ISN'T PROMISING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Already miffed by home-plate umpire Chris
Guccione's strike zone and Todd Hollandsworth's sore hamstring, Los
Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson wasn't ready for a Gregg
Olson update after such a frustrating loss.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's scheduled rehabilitation outing for Single-A San
Bernardino was scrapped Sunday when the reliever experienced more
pain in his arm while warming up in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, disabled since April 11 with a right forearm strain,
played catch before heading to the bullpen. After throwing three
warm-up pitches, he was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeez. That's amazing,'' a flabbergasted Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's setback was disappointing considering the 33-year-old
was optimistic about returning soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to prove to everybody else that I'm pain-free and
I'm throwing the way I'm supposed to,'' Olson said Friday. ``The
bullpen was throwing so well early on. I'd like to be off (the
disabled list) right now and be able to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges and Antonio Osuna struggled Sunday, Herges blowing a
7-5 lead in the eighth and Osuna issuing three walks and hitting a
batter to allow the winning run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' concern of finding healthy and effective relievers
makes Hollandsworth's updated condition even more difficult to
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The center fielder pulled up lame chasing a fly ball Saturday
and suffered a pulled right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth's status is technically day-to-day, but Johnson
calls that diagnosis just that: technical.
</P>
<P>
   ``How bad it is, you're looking at day-to-day, but
(Hollandsworth is out) at least a week,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had already lost one outfielder over the weekend
when Geronimo Berroa was placed on the disabled list with a bone
bruise on his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Makeup game: The Dodgers' April 17 home rainout against the
Houston Astros will be made up Thursday at 6:10 p.m. at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That open date in the schedule was one of just two off days for
the Dodgers in June and is sandwiched between interleague series
with Texas and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   For the record: Eric Karros' first-inning, three-run homer
Sunday was the first baseman's 227th career home run with the
Dodgers, leaving him one shy of tying Ron Cey's Los Angeles record
of 228.
</P>
<P>
   Karros ranks fifth combining the Brooklyn/L.A. years. Duke
Snider (389), Gil Hodges (361), Roy Campanella (242) and Cey hold
the top four spots.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek went 0 for 4 Sunday
and snapped a streak of 21 consecutive games reaching base safely
(via a base hit, walk or hit by pitch). Right fielder Shawn Green
had two hits and has reached safely in 50 of 53 games played in
2000. ... The Dodgers have the 17th pick in today's free-agent
draft. Baseball America's mock draft has the Dodgers choosing Miami
prep shortstop David Espinosa.

   AFAIK, I'll BRB, FWIW. Until then, I'll TTYL. Time flies,
IYKWIMAITYD.
</P>
<P>
   YWIA.
</P>
<P>
   Sanskrit? Hieroglyphics? Osco-Umbrian?
</P>
<P>
   If this looks like some indecipherable ancient language, rest
assured you won't need the Rosetta Stone to translate it, just a
working knowledge of e-mail jargon, a dialect that compresses
English into as many acronyms as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: As far as I know, I'll be right back, for what it's
worth. Until then, I'll talk to you later. Time flies, if you know
what I mean, and I think you do.
</P>
<P>
   Are e-mail and the Internet changing the English language?
</P>
<P>
   Of course they are. Everything changes language, especially
time, technology and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the epic poem (beginitalic)Beowulf,(enditalic) written
more than 1,000 years ago in Old English. For modern readers, it's
almost incomprehensible, resembling a cross between Norse and
Latin:
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic) Oft Scyld Scefing(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic) monegum maegbum(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic) egsode eorl,(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic) feascaft funden;(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic) weox under wolcnum (enditalic){hellip}
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to the 14th century and try to read Geoffrey
Chaucer's (beginitalic)Canterbury Tales.(enditalic) The text is a
little easier than (beginitalic)Beowulf (enditalic)but still
something of a stumper without a glossary: ``Whan that Aprill, with
his shoures soote, the droghte of March hath perced to the roote
{hellip} ``
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's plays, written in the late 1500s and early 1600s,
are easier still, but no one would confuse them with Arthur Miller:
``Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internet arrives with its own brand of poetry: ``Forget
600 megahertz, this baby is running at a gigahertz through a RAM
bus big enough to download twice the information.''
</P>
<P>
   To the uninitiated, it might as well be a line from Chaucer.
</P>
<P>
   Language experts are not alarmed. They neither condemn nor
condone the evolution but simply watch with interest as technology
plays a hand in how we communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do about it,'' says Alleen Pace
Nilsen, linguist and English professor at Arizona State University.
``That's like saying is rain all right. {hellip} It's just where we
happen to be right now.''
</P>
<P>
   More formal writing, Nilsen says, probably won't be affected by
acronyms and the casual structure of computer language (spelling
and punctuation are lax, subjects are often omitted: ``Hope to see
you soon'').
</P>
<P>
   And don't despair that e-mailspeak will change English so much
that some of us will be tempted to leap off the Tower of Babble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's self-regulating,'' says Elly Van Gelderen, ASU linguist
and associate professor of English. ``If you don't understand
someone anymore, you go back to what's slightly more standard.''
</P>
<P>
   What's standard?
</P>
<P>
   That question could not have been answered 300 years ago. Until
English was codified around 1700, when the printing press was well
established, spellings and grammar were inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Pronunciation, while difficult to determine before recorded
speech, was also subject to the whims of time. Between the eras of
Chaucer and Shakespeare came the Great Vowel Shift, where English
vowels played a game of musical chairs. In Chaucer's time, the word
``meat'' was pronounced ``mate.'' ``House'' was pronounced
``hoos.''
</P>
<P>
   Over succeeding centuries, those pronunciations changed, though
linguists are at a loss to explain exactly why.
</P>
<P>
   War can change language when conquering armies bring in their
own vocabularies. When William I of Normandy invaded Saxon England
in 1066, the English language was enriched with French influences
and became the most important language in the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Creativity can change language. People invent new words.
Shakespeare was the first to use such terms as pedant,
assassination, obscene and frugal, though all have roots in Latin
or Greek.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of words often involves combining ``morphemes,''
the smallest meaningful units of language, such as prefixes and
suffixes. Your children know about morphemes. They're the basis of
the names for Pokeman characters, which have the ring of
familiarity: Squirtle, Wartortle, Blastoise, Bulbasaur, Charlizard,
Charmeleon.
</P>
<P>
   Some words are created because they sound like the objects they
describe, a device called onomatopoeia. But not every ear hears
these sounds the same.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ``Snap! Crackle! Pop!'' the sound Rice Krispies make.
Sounds logical? Think again.
</P>
<P>
   In Austria the cereal says, ``Piff! Paff! Poff!'' In South
America, it's ``Pim! Pum! Pam!'' And in Japan, ``Pitchie! Patchi!
Putchi!''
</P>
<P>
   Invention can be the mother of language. When scientists began
to genetically engineer foodstuffs, someone dubbed it
``frankenfood,'' but the term never quite caught on. The life span
of a new word depends on who invents it, who uses it and how
relevant it is.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of the automobile at the turn of the century
came a new vocabulary to name new parts. Who can forget the fabled
Dynaflow, a transmission developed by Chrysler?
</P>
<P>
   We borrow words from old technology to describe new technology.
The word ``car'' comes from the previous mode of transportation,
the carriage. The word ``carriage'' had come from ``chariot.''
</P>
<P>
   And we still ``roll up'' our car windows even though most are
power-driven these days and simply rise with the flip of a switch
instead of a crank.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the Internet to see how software writers are giving us
familiar terms for cyberspace functions. We ``bookmark'' favorite
Web sites. We store material in ``folders.'' We use ``yellow
pages'' and ``channels.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are also new words, and technology has always expanded
our vocabulary. Since the earliest times, objects have needed
names.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who invented the wheel had to come up with a word to
describe it,'' notes James W. Ney, ASU professor emeritus of
linguistics.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, subsets of society have invented their own
vocabulary. American miners in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries developed a language called Bootlink. In the 1950s and
'60s, Blacks introduced such terms as ``jazz me, baby,'' ``let it
all hang out,'' ``beat to his socks'' (which evolved into the White
term, the ``Beat Generation'') and ``funky.''
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers are notorious for creating their own slang - from
``twenty-three skiddoo'' in the 1920s to ``tubular'' and ``grody to
the max'' in the 1990s. Slang is popular because it forges unity
within a group, what Van Gelderen calls an ``identity marker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appealing because it's forbidden,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Awesome.
</P>
<P>
   When slang is unique to a particular field or industry it's
called jargon. Newspaper jargon uses such words as ``obit,''
``graf,'' ``lede,'' ``typo.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers talk about ``jumpers,'' ``901H'' (dead
body), ``m.o.'' (modus operandi, or motive).
</P>
<P>
   In computers, technogeeks toss around words like ``gigabyte,''
``terabyte,'' ``RAM bus,'' ``serial port.''
</P>
<P>
   While acronyms have become popular in computer language, they
are not a new device. The German language has always been full of
acronyms, Van Gelderen says. In America, they enjoyed great
popularity in the 1940s, when divers Jacques Cousteau and Emile
Gagnan invented scuba equipment, or Self-Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus, and the American military gave us the snafu
(Situation Normal, All Fouled Up).
</P>
<P>
   Today, the word is ``fubar'' - Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Language is identity and power. Ruling forces try to exert their
authority by crushing language. As waves of immigrants arrived in
America in the 19th century, many were forbidden to speak their
native languages, and bilingualism remains controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Language separates people by class. In George Bernard Shaw's
play (beginitalic)Pygmalion(enditalic) aristocrat Henry Higgins
elevates the social standing of Eliza Doolittle by teaching her
proper English.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is not so much a particular class that embraces
computer language as it is a generation. But while young
entrepreneurs created the Internet, they are now aging and bringing
with them the power to shape the vocabulary, Nilsen says.
</P>
<P>
   Invention takes power and money, traditionally vested in the
hands of adults.
</P>
<P>
   While not all Internet and e-mail influences will be permanent,
some will remain, Nilsen predicts the creativity to invent words,
informal spelling and punctuation and the trend toward
``bicapitalization'' - HarperCollins, DreamWorks, PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   For those who fear English might change too rapidly, Ney points
to forces that stabilize language. In the 15th century, the
invention of the printing press began the move toward
standardization of spelling. Today, broadcast networks standardize
speech.
</P>
<P>
   But computer communication is democratic. With the proliferation
of personal Web sites, anyone can forge a new lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GMTA.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Great minds think alike.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; G/G now.
</P>
<P>
   (Gotta go.)
</P>
<P>
   Or is it too archaic to sign off with, ``Catch you on the flip
side''?
</P>
<P>
   We thought so.

   Teenagers are notorious for creating their own slang - from
``twenty-three skiddoo'' in the 1920s to ``tubular'' and ``grody to
the max'' in the 1990s. Slang is popular because it forges unity
within a group, what Van Gelderen calls an ``identity marker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appealing because it's forbidden,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Awesome.
</P>
<P>
   When slang is unique to a particular field or industry it's
called jargon. Newspaper jargon uses such words as ``obit,''
``graf,'' ``lede,'' ``typo.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers talk about ``jumpers,'' ``901H'' (dead
body), ``m.o.'' (modus operandi, or motive).
</P>
<P>
   In computers, technogeeks toss around words like ``gigabyte,''
``terabyte,'' ``RAM bus,'' ``serial port.''
</P>
<P>
   While acronyms have become popular in computer language, they
are not a new device. The German language has always been full of
acronyms, Van Gelderen says. In America, they enjoyed great
popularity in the 1940s, when divers Jacques Cousteau and Emile
Gagnan invented scuba equipment, or Self-Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus, and the American military gave us the snafu
(Situation Normal, All Fouled Up).
</P>
<P>
   Today, the word is ``fubar'' - Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Language is identity and power. Ruling forces try to exert their
authority by crushing language. As waves of immigrants arrived in
America in the 19th century, many were forbidden to speak their
native languages, and bilingualism remains controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Language separates people by class. In George Bernard Shaw's
play (beginitalic)Pygmalion(enditalic) aristocrat Henry Higgins
elevates the social standing of Eliza Doolittle by teaching her
proper English.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is not so much a particular class that embraces
computer language as it is a generation. But while young
entrepreneurs created the Internet, they are now aging and bringing
with them the power to shape the vocabulary, Nilsen says.
</P>
<P>
   Invention takes power and money, traditionally vested in the
hands of adults.
</P>
<P>
   While not all Internet and e-mail influences will be permanent,
some will remain, Nilsen predicts the creativity to invent words,
informal spelling and punctuation and the trend toward
``bicapitalization'' - HarperCollins, DreamWorks, PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   For those who fear English might change too rapidly, Ney points
to forces that stabilize language. In the 15th century, the
invention of the printing press began the move toward
standardization of spelling. Today, broadcast networks standardize
speech.
</P>
<P>
   But computer communication is democratic. With the proliferation
of personal Web sites, anyone can forge a new lexicon.

COMMENTARY: PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The University of Maryland Baltimore County has grown
dramatically since it opened 34 years ago in a former cow pasture
not far from downtown. The fledgling campus has become the anchor
of a science and technology corridor and offers an undergraduate
science program that is widely admired at the National Science
Foundation and other important scientific institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, UMBC ranked fourth, in a tie with Yale,
for the number of undergraduate biochemistry degrees awarded.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientific community is particularly excited about the
university's success in turning out black scientists, at a time
when African-Americans in cutting-edge science programs are
exceedingly rare.
</P>
<P>
   UMBC's Meyerhoff scholarship program routinely sends black
science students to postgraduate programs at elite universities. In
the first seven years of the program, 84 percent of the students
went on to postgraduate study, most of them pursuing Ph.D.s or
medical degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarship program was conceived and financed by the
Maryland philanthropists Robert and Jane Meyerhoff in 1988 to help
African-American students pursue careers in science and
engineering. The program has since been opened to all
high-achieving high school seniors, and has enrolled 481 students,
about 80 percent of whom are black.
</P>
<P>
   The Meyerhoff effort is guided by UMBC's energetic 49-year-old
president, Dr. Freeman Hrabowski, an African-American mathematician
who has become widely known for his advocacy of programs directed
at high achievers in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Rita
Colwell, recently hailed the Meyerhoff program as a model that
``needs to be replicated all over the United States.'' The
curriculum should be easy to copy. But what drives the program is
Hrabowski's ceaseless proselytizing and his contagious belief that
every student he recruits is capable of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   At many colleges, the expectation of mediocrity has become the
order of the day for minority students, and students respond
accordingly. During the 1990s, for example, the dropout rate for
black college students was 20 percent to 25 percent higher than
that of whites. Among students who finish college, black students
average two-thirds of a grade lower than whites.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement gap is troubling because it often persists even
when blacks and whites arrive at college with similar SAT scores
and levels of preparation
</P>
<P>
   Black students suffer great anxiety, fearing white professors
are judging them unfairly for racial reasons, or because they sense
that these professors do not respect them intellectually. This
leads them to underperform. The Stanford University psychologist
Claude Steele recently described in The Atlantic Monthly how
race-based stereotypes hurt student performance.
</P>
<P>
   Black students in Steele's studies did poorly on tests when
experimenters intimated that the students would be judged on the
basis of race. This ``stereotype threat'' proved especially
damaging to black high achievers, who were accustomed to getting
good grades and performing well on tests before arriving at
college. These students worried that failure would confirm negative
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   The tension they experienced precluded the relaxed, open
concentration that is necessary for maximum academic performance.
But these tensions subsided when the subjects were put at ease and
believed they were being judged fairly, even when the judgments
were harsh.
</P>
<P>
   In the Meyerhoff program, young men and women get to know one
another during a special summer semester before the regular school
year and live in the same dormitory once school begins. The program
stresses group study, so that the students learn to conceptualize
complicated problems collectively, as teams of scientists do.
Studying in groups also dispels cultural stereotypes that the
students have about one another.
</P>
<P>
   Meyerhoff students are coveted as research assistants, and are
quickly exposed to opportunities that lead to internships and to
having research published in the leading science journals.
</P>
<P>
   Hrabowski says the program succeeds because it creates the
expectation of excellence and that excellence begets excellence as
years go on. But walk through a room on campus with Freeman
Hrabowski and you feel something else at play as well. He is a
tireless academic cheerleader and seems to know every student's
name.
</P>
<P>
   As a black university president who is also a mathematician, he
cuts against well-established stereotypes and demonstrates to
minority students in particular that they, too, can perform at the
highest levels of science. Hrabowski's optimism about student
ability seems to permeate the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   To recreate UMBC's success, universities will need to think
about more than curriculum. They will need to filter out damaging
preconceptions connected to race that dominate the culture as a
whole _ and subscribe to Freeman Hrabowski's gospel of academic
achievement.

LIVE! NUDE! AND LEGAL! ARTIST GETS HIS NAKED PHOTO
</HEADLINE>
  By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the moment Sunday morning when the flat, pink glow
of dawn gave way to yellow sunlight and shadow, Spencer Tunick
announced that his photo shoot was complete.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred-fifty-two naked models, who had been lying on an
empty stretch of Delancey Street in Manhattan, under the
Williamsburg Bridge, sprang to their feet and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   The moment was triumphant, or at least worry-free, for Tunick,
who is known for his photographs of nudes in public places, and for
being arrested for taking them. On Saturday, the U.S. Supreme Court
said the city could not stop him from staging such pictures, and
Tunick said he hopes the decision will end a long First Amendment
battle.
</P>
<P>
   With a handful of police officers looking on, Tunick said he was
thankful that he could work without the fear of being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for the body as an art object, not a sexual
object or a recreational object,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Finney, a frequent model for Tunick, said the photographs,
which often show bodies arranged in abstract forms, emphasized
people's similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you watch those shows on the Discovery Channel
and you see a herd of antelope,'' Finney said. ``This is like a
herd of naked people. We're so used to looking at the clothes to
define a person.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the shoot was over, on went hooded sweatshirts, silk
skirts, bike shorts and jeans. Many of the models, all volunteers,
headed to Ratner's restaurant, a few blocks away, for a celebratory
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   There, Tunick, 33, moved from table to table, jittery from the
morning's high-speed logistics. A district court judge had granted
him 15 minutes for the shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick began shooting nudes in public in 1992, when he posed a
naked man in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that people paid more attention to my backgrounds when
I placed a nude person in front of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick has been arrested several times on charges that vary from
unlawful assembly to exposure of a person, but the charges against
him have always been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   When Tunick began to find police waiting for him at the
appointed time and place of his photography shoots, he said he
decided in 1999 to sue New York City in federal court, seeking,
among other things, an injunction to prevent his future arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel, said the city had
received no complaints about the shoots. But, he contrasted
Tunick's photography in public to theater productions that viewers
choose to see: ``People who do not choose to watch it are being
exposed to it.'' He .
</P>
<P>
   Tunick said he knew that shooting nude people en masse- was not
always appropriate: ``I don't think I could do this in the middle
of the day in front of Macy's.''.

COMMENTARY: CANDIDATES WHO AGREE TO DISAGREE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Say what you will about the shake-up in New York's
Senate race _ and there is so much to say that we'll be reading
about it in the history books _ Rudolph Giuliani's withdrawal has
given the public a choice.
</P>
<P>
   We had one before, but on personality much more than on
substance, because Hillary Rodham Clinton and the mayor agreed on
most major issues. Not so Clinton and Rick Lazio, Giuliani's
successor as the Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and the congressman from Long Island do share
some of the same positions and give themselves similar labels: He
calls himself ``mainstream'' and she calls herself a ``centrist.''
But you get the impression that these two candidates would often
vote differently in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, he is ``mainstream'' enough to get the support of the
Conservative Party, which rejected Giuliani as too moderate. And
Clinton is ``centrist'' enough to win support from the Liberal
Party, which is mainly in business to pursue patronage jobs, not an
ideology. But this time the old label fits.
</P>
<P>
   Except for her support for the death penalty and lukewarm
embrace of welfare reform, it is difficult to find an issue on
which the first lady is not liberal _ which she cannot acknowledge,
because her opponents use the ``l'' word as a synonym for
``extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatives line up for patronage, too, but the
Conservative Party also embraces a strong eponymous ideology,
marked by opposition to abortion, to gay rights and to affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio does not agree with the Conservatives on every issue, but
if he wins it is logical for voters to at least expect the party to
have access to him and a claim on loyalty, just as liberals would
to Clinton. And he does support the party's position on an issue of
the greatest concern to the party and its leader Michael Long _
opposition to what critics of the procedure call partial-birth
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio supports both fundamental abortion rights and many curbs
on abortion. For instance, he voted for a ban on Medicaid coverage
for abortions, against abortions for women in federal prisons,
against allowing military women to get privately financed abortions
in military hospitals overseas, against human embryo research.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio strongly objects to so-called partial-birth abortions,
often inaccurately described as dealing only with a rare,
gruesome-sounding procedure used in late-term abortions. Critics
want the procedure banned; supporters argue that congressional
legislation is so vaguely written that it could prohibit common
procedures early in a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has no voting record, of course, but says she supports
abortion rights without restrictions, and she won the endorsement
of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. On
the other issue where the two candidates differ most starkly, gun
control, Clinton backs comprehensive gun-control measures, and
Lazio supports some regulations but not others.
</P>
<P>
   He voted for the Brady Bill, which put a five-day waiting period
on the purchase of guns, and for a ban on the sale of assault
weapons. But he also has reservations about gun licensing and
registration, which he calls ``speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   This is interesting because his congressional district is in
Suffolk County, which has some of the strongest registration and
licensing regulations in the country. Suffolk requires anybody
purchasing a handgun to register with the county Police Department
or the sheriff, and to undergo an initial background check and
another to renew every five years.
</P>
<P>
   County officials say that there are 30,900 licensed gun owners
in Suffolk and that the regulations work well.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates say that national registration would help
cut down on gun trafficking _ critical to states like New York,
where most crimes, including the recent massacre at Wendy's in
Queens, are committed with guns originally sold out of state. There
seems little doubt that the issue will be going before the next
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative future of the abortion debate is more
complicated, related to a pending Supreme Court decision on
abortion, to who wins the presidency and to whom he might nominate
to fill Supreme Court vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe _ in fact, probably _ New Yorkers will vote less on
ideology than on intangibles, like temperament. But at least for
the purists, Lazio and Clinton will be able to debate those
positions on which they disagree. From the perspectives of
mainstream centrists, that is.

 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With touchstone issues like death penalty challenges, school
financing and changes in liability laws hanging in the balance,
contests for state judgeships around the country have become
bruising multimillion dollar political affairs that critics say are
threatening the independence of the nation's state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars in campaign contributions are flowing into
races for top state judgeships this year, while candidates are
testing the limits of rules that forbid them from signaling how
they might vote on cases, according to judicial candidates,
political consultants and lawyers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Attack advertising, the use of aggressive political consultants
and what are often only thinly veiled promises to sustain or
overturn controversial decisions are now established parts of
campaigns for seats on state courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judicial campaigns are getting noisier, nastier and
costlier,'' said Roy A. Schotland, an expert on judicial politics
who is a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. ``The
amount of money being spent keeps escalating and the number of
states in which this is happening is escalating.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio this year, more than $5 million and possibly as much as
$12 million may be spent in a battle for a single seat on the state
Supreme Court. The campaign, one of the most bitterly contested in
the country, could shift the ideological balance of the court.
Twenty years ago, a campaign for the same court cost $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Races for state Supreme Courts in Michigan, Illinois, Alabama,
Idaho and other states are also drawing national attention. Already
this year, supreme court campaigns have included claims of race
baiting, dirty politics, catering to rich trial lawyers and
abdication to business interests.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the races, legal and political experts say,
indicates that the big-dollar judicial politicking that gained
momentum in the 1980s with campaigns that ousted top judges in
Texas and California, among others, have now become entrenched
parts of the political system.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be the polarization that has affected government
at all levels, creating an ever-more vibrant cottage industry in
most cities of political consultants and advisers. Also, as the
federal government has become less ambitious in seeking solutions
to social problems, in the eras of Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton,
state courts have become battlegrounds for emotional issues like
abortion, health care and the financing of public schools. And many
of those issues are now starting to land in the state trial and
appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to limit liability lawsuits and damage awards in many
state legislatures _ so-called tort-reform _ have also accelerated
the political forces at work on state courts. The measures, which
often place a maximum on damage awards and otherwise limit
recoveries by people claiming injury, have spawned legal challenges
in many state courts, which, in turn, have spawned campaigns by
trial lawyers and business groups to shift those courts their way.
</P>
<P>
   But the issues in statewide judicial races are unpredictably
diverse. In the Alabama race for chief justice of the Supreme
Court, for example, a candidate who posted the Ten Commandments in
his courtroom has built a huge following.
</P>
<P>
   In the Idaho race last month, a trial judge unseated an
incumbent state Supreme Court justice for the first time since 1944
after an extraordinarily bitter campaign in which the eventual
winner had declared that the theory of evolution could not be true.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, two Democratic judges vying for a seat on the state
Supreme Court this spring each spent $1 million in campaigns that
included pummeling each other in television advertising. One
suggested the other was responsible for sending ``innocent men to
death row while killers walk the street.'' The other warned voters
that ``one candidate has taken the low road.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Party Battle in Michigan
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan race this year was superheated even before the
Democratic Party had selected its three candidates to oppose three
sitting Republican justices. The three conservative incumbents were
originally appointed by Gov. John Engler, also a Republican, to
fill vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups had declared the election of the incumbent
justices a priority, while unions and trial lawyers had begun
gathering a war chest for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, tensions exploded publicly over a flier handed out
by the state Democratic Party at a dinner of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Detroit. Among
other accusations, the flier declared that one of the three
incumbent justices, Robert P. Young Jr., who is black, opposed the
1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision desegregating public schools,
Brown vs. Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The flier said that the three Republicans who are part of a
Republican majority on the court were active members of the
conservative Federalist Society and went on to assert that Young
was a ``staunch believer that Brown v. Board of Education was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Young responded by releasing a scathing letter he wrote to the
state Democratic Party chairman, Mark Brewer. It demanded a
retraction of the accusation about his views on the 1954 opinion.
``This statement is a lie,'' intended to harm him with black
voters, the justice said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Young said he had long expressed public support
for the 1954 desegregation ruling. He asserted that he had said he
simply shared the views of some critics who say it was based ``too
much on sociology.''
</P>
<P>
   His public response, Young said, was ``a moral call to
conscience about whether race baiting has any role in the political
discourse in a judicial election.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Brewer said there would be no retraction and
that civil rights would continue to be an issue. ``It is not a
lie,'' Brewer said of the flier's description of Young's views.
``It is true. He has told a number of people throughout Michigan
that Brown vs. Board of education was `wrongly decided.' Those were
his exact words.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the court's critics say that despite the vitriol, the
real issue is the court's reputation as a harshly conservative
panel that regularly sides with business, prosecutors and insurance
companies. The critics say Young's reaction may have been partly to
distract attention from criticism of the court.
</P>
<P>
   One source of that criticism was an analysis of 57 of the
court's rulings last year. The analysis was published in a union
newspaper, Michigan AFL-CIO News, and then described in a newspaper
for Michigan lawyers, Lawyers Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the article's author, Mary Ellen Gurewitz, the
general counsel of the Michigan AFL-CIO and of the State Democratic
Party, said the results were ``stunningly one sided,'' with
criminal defendants, for example, losing 15 out of 15 cases decided
by the Michigan Supreme Court. People claiming injuries lost 12 out
of 13 cases she examined.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Republican justices have countered that
Gurewitz's analysis was a politically motivated attack on the court
and a manipulation of statistics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An Ouster in Idaho
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho this year one explosive issue in the judicial campaign
was water rights.
</P>
<P>
   A state Supreme Court justice, Cathy Silak, who had been
appointed by a Democratic governor, riled conservatives by writing
the majority opinion last year in a 3-2 decision that said the
federal government, not the state, controlled water rights in
certain wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponent was a trial judge, Daniel Eismann, who was known
for his conservatism and for being unusually open in expressing his
views. Eismann described his campaign as a challenge to judges who
``legislate from the bench.'' And in the campaign he told local
reporters that he was morally opposed to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   After Eismann's lopsided victory on May 23, in which he drew 59
percent of the vote, he answered questions about remarks he had
made in the campaign about his views of creationism. ``I can prove
scientifically,'' he said in an interview, ``that evolution has not
and cannot occur.''
</P>
<P>
   In the election, Silak, who years ago had volunteered as a
coordinator for the state branch of the American Civil Liberties
Union, quickly became a target of conservative critics. She was a
subject of advertising by proponents of term limits and opponents
of gun control and was even the target of an aggressive campaign
tactic known as a push poll in which the questioner includes
negative information to discourage support of an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper advertisement placed by a supporter of Eismann
asked in huge letters: ``Will partial-birth abortion and same-sex
marriage become legal in Idaho? Perhaps so, if liberal Supreme
Court Justice Cathy Silak remains on the Idaho Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Silak said her record as a volunteer for the civil liberties
group had been distorted. She described her judicial record as
moderate and said she had never expressed views about same-sex
marriage or partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You now have the active involvement of political parties and
special interest groups and individuals with special axes to
grind,'' she said in an interview. ``I think it is a way of getting
some hand-selected judges on the court so you have judges whose
opinions you have essentially bought.''
</P>

   Eismann said Silak's assertion did not merit a response. He said
he had no connection to the activities of many of the groups that

<P>
   Judges as Politicians
</P>
<P>
   In the new judicial politics, judges sometimes appear as petty
as other politicians _ and as subject to influence.
</P>
<P>
   In a boisterous $1.3 million campaign last year in Wisconsin,
the state's chief justice, Shirley S. Abrahamson, was forced to
explain, for example, why she had once allowed a late-night
aerobics class in the court's ornate hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahamson said the exercise class had been a ``morale builder''
for her aides.
</P>
<P>
   She won re-election, although there was widespread concern that
the court had been harmed by a campaign that divided the justices.
Four of her colleagues broke the unspoken precedent that typically
keeps justices outside the political fray and openly supported
Abrahamson's well-financed opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The four suggested they were opposed to Abrahamson's management
style, but there was also speculation that one of the four would
have liked to have succeeded her in the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, there are significant consequences to judges
taking on the persona of politicians, said Anthony Champagne, a
political science professor and expert on the judiciary at the
University of Texas at Dallas. In many states, until the 1980s, the
appointment or election of judges was arranged through quiet
agreements among politicians and bar associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a new system,'' said Champagne, ``where lots of money is
involved, where judges are highly dependent on their political
parties and political operatives and where judges are tempted to
make promises that might affect their judicial decisions. It is
something that is new in America and it has the potential of being
a really corrupting force.''
</P>
<P>
   The politicking is becoming increasingly explicit. As the battle
over changes in liability laws has moved into the courts in the
last few years, both business groups and their trial lawyer
adversaries have been increasingly open in describing the battle to
win judgeships in bald political terms.
</P>
<P>
   In a newsletter last fall, for example, the Michigan
Manufacturers Association told its members about the importance of
this year's state Supreme Court election. The newsletter flatly
outlined the group's political goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the last election, it boasted, contributions from the
manufacturers' political action committee ``swayed the Supreme
Court election to a conservative viewpoint, ensuring a
pro-manufacturing agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Discord in Florida
</P>
<P>
   In all, 42 states elect judges at some level and more than 80
percent of all state appeals judges face election, according to the
American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the top courts of many states outside the Northeast
are elected. In the Northeast, most states, including New York,
Connecticut and New Jersey, have appointive systems for the highest
courts. Scholars say the elective systems for judicial selection
have their roots in the populist movement that sought to expand the
power of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new brand of open political warfare over judicial selection
is also being felt this year in states like Florida, where top
appeals judges are appointed.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Florida Republicans proposed measures that would
have given Gov. Jeb Bush and his conservative allies increased
control over the state Supreme Court and over selection panels that
review candidates for appointment to intermediate appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Democrats filed a tongue-in-cheek amendment that
they said made clear the extent of the challenge to the
independence of the judiciary. It declared that the Christian
Coalition ought to simply be given the power to certify who would
be eligible for judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican speaker designate of the Florida House, Tom
Feeney, said in an interview that the Democrats' little joke showed
how out of touch the liberal legislators were.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last bastion of big-government liberalism in Florida is
the state Supreme Court,'' Feeney said, explaining why what the
Republicans call ``court reform'' is necessary. The Republican
measures were not brought to a vote in this year's session but are
expected to be introduced again next year.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Judicial Impartiality Falters
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in more than a dozen states, judges, lawyers,
legislators, political professionals and experts on the judiciary
said the image of impartiality in the courts is a casualty of the
new judicial politics. Even while campaign contributions were
growing in the 1980s and 1990s, some of them said, judges seemed
able to remain somewhat aloof from the battle. In place of those
old inhibitions, judges are now finding themselves full
participants in the same kind of ideological warfare that has
affected other branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the watchdog group Public Citizen filed a federal suit
in April challenging as unconstitutional the state's system of
judicial election because of the state's history of huge
contributions for top judges. Some newspapers in the state
editorialized that it was about time. ``Texans know that the
state's system of choosing its court judges is a mess,'' The Austin
American-Statesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the Illinois primaries this spring, a Republican
Supreme Court justice, S. Louis Rathje, was unseated by a
challenger who paid for campaign fliers that were distributed by
anti-abortion groups. They described the challenger, Robert R.
Thomas, as ``the only endorsed pro-life candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rathje said the tactic showed that politics had fully arrived in
the courthouse. People who have cases in court, he said, will have
to get used to appearing in front of judges who have already stated
their views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you feel more or less comfortable,'' Rathje asked,
``with a judge who has already told you how he is going to rule?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a former Chicago Bears football player who now sits on
an appeals court, said in an interview that the pro-life
declaration was simply a statement of his personal views. ``It has
nothing to do with my even-handed participation in cases,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the moment Sunday morning when the flat, pink glow
of dawn gave way to yellow sunlight and shadow, Spencer Tunick
announced that his photo shoot was complete.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred-fifty-two naked models, who had been lying on an
empty stretch of Delancey Street in Manhattan, under the
Williamsburg Bridge, sprang to their feet and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   The moment was triumphant, or at least worry-free, for Tunick,
who is known for his photographs of nudes in public places, and for
being arrested for taking them. On Saturday, the U.S. Supreme Court
said the city could not stop him from staging such pictures, and
Tunick said he hopes the decision will end a long First Amendment
battle.
</P>
<P>
   With a handful of police officers looking on, Tunick said he was
thankful that he could work without the fear of being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for the body as an art object, not a sexual
object or a recreational object,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Finney, a frequent model for Tunick, said the photographs,
which often show bodies arranged in abstract forms, emphasized
people's similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you watch those shows on the Discovery Channel
and you see a herd of antelope,'' Finney said. ``This is like a
herd of naked people. We're so used to looking at the clothes to
define a person.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the shoot was over, on went hooded sweatshirts, silk
skirts, bike shorts and jeans. Many of the models, all volunteers,
headed to Ratner's restaurant, a few blocks away, for a celebratory
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   There, Tunick, 33, moved from table to table, jittery from the
morning's high-speed logistics. A district court judge had granted
him 15 minutes for the shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick began shooting nudes in public in 1992, when he posed a
naked man in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that people paid more attention to my backgrounds when
I placed a nude person in front of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick has been arrested several times on charges that vary from
unlawful assembly to exposure of a person, but the charges against
him have always been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   When Tunick began to find police waiting for him at the
appointed time and place of his photography shoots, he said he
decided in 1999 to sue New York City in federal court, seeking,
among other things, an injunction to prevent his future arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel, said the city had
received no complaints about the shoots. But, he contrasted
Tunick's photography in public to theater productions that viewers
choose to see: ``People who do not choose to watch it are being
exposed to it.'' He .
</P>
<P>
   Tunick said he knew that shooting nude people en masse- was not
always appropriate: ``I don't think I could do this in the middle
of the day in front of Macy's.''.

LAKERS SAVE THEIR BEST FOR LAST TO ELIMINATE TRAIL BLAZERS  

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant were about to
suffer the most devastating playoff collapse of their careers, a
loss so agonizing it would take only a National Basketball
Association title to live it down.
</P>
<P>
   But something miraculous happened at the Staples Center on
Sunday night, something neither their fed-up legions nor the
Portland Trail Blazers ever expected after controlling Game 7 of
the Western Conference finals for nearly four quarters.
</P>
<P>
   They grew up. O'Neal, Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers played
like champions, somehow coming back from a 16-point deficit and
rallying to defeat the Blazers, 89-84. The Lakers outscored
Portland, 31-13, including a run of 25-2, in the fourth quarter
after trailing by 71-58.
</P>
<P>
   The end came so suddenly for Portland, the two young stars
showing more resilience than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Leading by 4 points with 45 seconds left, Bryant drove the
middle of the lane and at the last possible second lofted an
alley-oop pass for O'Neal, his 7-foot-1-inch, 330-pound teammate.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who had disappeared for long stretches of the game,
caught the ball with his right hand, cocked it back and dunked it
maliciously, a basket that made the score 85-79 with 41.3 seconds
left and turned the arena into a state of extended delirium.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with 18 points and 9 rebounds and Bryant had 25
points and 11 rebounds. Portland was led by Rasheed Wallace's 30
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers face the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the National
Basketball Association finals beginning Wednesday night here. They
came close to losing a 3-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   A devastating 15-0 run helped their cause. Brian Shaw made two
pivotal 3-pointers during the run, including a bomb from the left
wing with 4:02 remaining that severely damaged Portland's
confidence. That shot tied the score at 75-75 and sent the building
into a tizzy, 20,000 people rising from their seats in yellow
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice completed a 3-point play with less than six and a half
minutes remaining. He went hard to the goal, laid it in, drew a
foul and made the free throw to give the Lakers their first lead _
49-48 _ since it was 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith scored the next 7 points on long jumpers, including
one from beyond the top of the arc. When Portland led, 57-51, it
appeared to be in tremendous shape.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers played an awful first half and several times seemed
on the verge of being blown out.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal picked up his third foul with 6:18 left in the second
quarter, swinging his elbows as he tried to create space for
himself around Arvydas Sabonis. Rather than frustrate him, though,
it made him focus and play more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 10, the Lakers drew to 3 points after consecutive
baskets by O'Neal inside and a 3-pointer by Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant played with fire, too, making Bonzi Wells and Steve Smith
take impossible shots and making plays on offense. He played 48
minutes on a sprained right foot in Game 6 on Friday. Rather than
practice on Saturday, he underwent therapy for the injury.
</P>
<P>
   If he was sore, the Lakers were hurting worse. They were
struggling badly, and needed Bryant to be superhuman.
</P>
<P>
   He was not, but his 12 points, his defense (3 blocked shots) and
his rebounding (6) were enough to keep the Lakers in the game. He
sent the Lakers to the locker room with momentum by taking a
give-and-go from Ron Harper and dunking underneath to cut
Portland's margin to 42-39.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had taken only four shots. Wallace was in a groove,
connecting on 6 of 11 attempts, and Pippen was providing all the
intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   An L.A.-Indiana series _ the only matchup that could save the
league from a small-market finals and perhaps the worst televised
ratings in basketball's modern era _ did not look promising.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers were seeking to become only the seventh team in
league annals to overcome a 3-1 deficit in a four-of-seven-game
series and the first Western Conference team to accomplish the
feat. The Larry Bird-led Boston Celtics were the last team to
succeed, stunning Julius Erving and Philadelphia in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   After Game 4 in Portland _ the Lakers' second victory on
Portland's home court _ Coach Phil Jackson described the Blazers as
being ``at death's door.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, no one was home.
</P>
<P>
   All the mental tweaking Jackson attempted backfired and became
used as fodder for Pippen, his former pupil. After victories in
Games 5 and 6, the Blazers suddenly had Jackson and his team on a
psychological ledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they're a little bit of a fragile team,'' Pippen said
before Sunday's game. ``They don't have the experience. They don't
truly believe in the triangle system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you catch guys like that, you tend to think things are
working in your favor.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was so flustered by recent developments, he eruptedwhen
asked about Sabonis, his counterpart in the key, who helped to
limit the league's leading scorer to 17 points and 7 rebounds in
Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done anything,'' O'Neal said on Saturday. ``He has
three players helping him. I don't give him any credit at all.
None. Don't ask me about a one-on-one matchup. No one will ever
play me one on one. I've got four players on me. I'm angry because
you asked me about Sabonis. He can't play.''
</P>
<P>
   If the pressure was on anyone, it was on O'Neal to deliver in
only the second Game 7 he ever played. He and Anfernee Hardaway
sent the Orlando Magic to the 1995 finals with a memorable
performance against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   He became the central theme of the national news media, all of
whom implored the NBA's most valuable player to perform like the
best player in basketball when it mattered most. The lead sports
column in The Los Angeles Times bellowed, ``Superman, where are
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Even Magic Johnson, who directed the Lakers to their last title,
in 1988, and serves as a team vice president and part owner, sensed
the feeling building. ``He needs this so people don't look at him
as a loser,'' Johnson said. ``This is his time. Everyone knows
it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal came late to that realization. He finally dived for a
loose ball with less than nine minutes left in the third quarter,
tumbling into the second row as the Superman theme was cued up over
the public-address system.
</P>
<P>
   Among his litany of self-proclaimed nicknames _ the Big
Aristotle being the most recent _ O'Neal earlier this season called
himself Shaq Kent. But there are no phone booths inside the Staples
Center, no supermen to save the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Only fallible human beings who play basketball for a living. And
against a remarkably resilient team from Portland, they were just
enough.

CHINA PHONE COMPANY CHANGES PLANS FOR NEW NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's second telephone carrier, China
Unicom, has confirmed that it has abandoned plans to use current
wireless telephone standards known as CDMA, developed by U.S.-based
Qualcomm Inc.
</P>
<P>
   China Unicom, which is preparing to list its shares in Hong Kong
soon, said it still plans to build a network using later-generation
CDMA technology, the official China Daily Business Weekly said on
Sunday. But it said it cannot risk investing in current CDMA
technology that might soon be obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of construction of a narrow-band CDMA system has
become unfavorable, so we plan to build a wide-band CDMA network,''
an unidentified China Unicom official told the newspaper. ``CDMA''
stands for ``code division multiple access,'' and Qualcomm's
current CDMA technology is a narrow-band technology.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the latest in a wild ride for CDMA's fortunes in
China and Qualcomm's fortunes back home. Talk that China would
scrap its CDMA plans has plagued Qualcomm for over a year. Last
week China Unicom gave conflicting signals on its CDMA stance,
hammering Qualcomm's share price.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm's stock is trading at less than half its January high,
largely because of the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of China's potential market, the country's
backing could cement CDMA as a technology standard for the future.
China Unicom had been expected to build a CDMA network capable of
serving 10 million subscribers by the end of this year. And the
company signed a royalty agreement with Qualcomm in February.
</P>
<P>
   But telecommunications analysts have long argued that it made
little sense for China to invest billions of dollars in a new
standard when the country is already largely served by competing
GSM technology and when technology standards are changing quickly
in any case.
</P>
<P>
   China's support of the technology became a political issue
during negotiations over the country's entry to the World Trade
Organization. The United States lobbied heavily for China to open
its markets to CDMA technology and CDMA proponents claimed China
had agreed to back the technology last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's newspaper report said the February agreement with
Qualcomm ``could be canceled.'' Now Qualcomm can only hope to
benefit from Unicom's use of more advanced CDMA technology in the
future, it said.

STANDING UP TO GANGSTERS COSTS MAN HIS FINGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Despite his fear ofgangs, a 46-year-old man
somehow summoned the courage to turn away a group of drunken thugs
when they tried to get into his apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   It cost him dearly: The gangsters got inside and used a shotgun
to blast away the machinist's livelihood along with his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he underwent surgery, while his wife wondered where
they and their 1-year-old son will live now, and how he will
support them if he can't return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been back. I want to move,'' said the woman, who
asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation. ``With his
injury, he is going to be disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   Through tears, she called on city officials to take more action
against gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city government should be more concerned about the people,
and apartment managers should do more thorough background checks on
people,'' she said. ``Whatever happened to my husband I don't want
to happen to anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they believe they know who was behind this
vicious shooting and vowed to deploy extra officers to find the six
to eight gang members.
</P>
<P>
   ``When innocent people and their families are victimized, I
think we need to spend some time on this,'' said Detective Bruno
Pabon of the &UR;  &LR; Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley Division.
</P>
<P>
   The gang members' attack Tuesday _ and the man's refusal to
submit to them _ reflects a growing frustration among residents and
police with gangs in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It is a particularly acute problem in the west end of the
valley, historically a placid area of the city, where violent gang
crime rose 12 percent in the first quarter of the year, as compared
with the same period last year. Two people were shot last month on
the handball courts at Canoga Park High School in what police
suspect was a gang-related shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet according to LAPD statistics, for the first three months of
this year, violent gang crimes in the valley have decreased, as
compared with the same time period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the complex where Thursday's shotgun attack
occurred said the gangs seem to operate without concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's worried about what's happening here. It
doesn't make any sense,'' said one neighbor, Jose Barajas.
</P>
<P>
   This incident occurred when at least a half-dozen gang members
peered through the gate of the complex where the machinist lives
Tuesday night and asked him to let them in.
</P>
<P>
   He refused.
</P>
<P>
   They broke the glass next to the gate, got into the complex and
chased the man to his apartment while his wife and baby watched in
horror. First, they threw beer bottles at his apartment, and they
shot into the apartment with a shotgun, hitting the man in his left
hand and chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran into the apartment frightened that they were following
him,'' said his wife. ``The gang was telling him to open the door.
I was terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   When confronted by the shotgun, the man instinctively raised his
left hand to shield his body, so the shot blasted off his pinkie
and ring fingers.
</P>
<P>
   He was in fair condition Friday, but his boss is unsure whether
he will be able to return to work at the Canoga Park machine shop
where he had been providing a good living for his family. There, he
specialized in deburring parts, a skill that requires dexterity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be difficult. We'll have to see what movement he has to
the hand,'' said Ralph De La Cruz, the shop foreman. ``It really
upsets me. He's a good worker and very dependable.''
</P>
<P>
   A co-worker, Denver Rhodes, called for a crackdown on gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track record of our court system is written on the streets
of our city, where criminals run free and law-abiding, hard-working
citizens have to lock themselves behind bars at night,'' Rhodes
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the man and his family moved to the area in the 21800 block
of Lanark Street about eight months ago, they were aware of the
gang problems, but the rent was cheap and within a reasonable
distance to ride to work by bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor said this group of gang members has long intimidated
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hated that they were always outside his apartment building.
He was frightened for his life because he would have to pass by
them when going home,'' the neighbor said.

ALERT FOR WATER SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JUDI VILLA  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Virginia Geffre worried about the play pool in the
front yard a couple doors down.
</P>
<P>
   A child could easily fall in, and no one might see.
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't bear the thought of little lungs filling with
water. So last week Geffre joined a growing num ber of Phoenix
residents who are calling the Fire Department to report unsafe
pools on their own streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see a kid drown. I don't care whose kid it
is,'' Geffre said. ``Kids are precious, and people need to protect
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone, seven people called on Phoenix firefighters to
check a pool that posed a hazard to children. There have been 83
such calls to the Fire Department this year and 144 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the calls involve breaches in fences at community pools.
Others are about open or unlocked gates that provide easy access to
a backyard pool. Several, like Geffre's, deal with blowup pools
left out front, filled with three to four feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't people get the picture?'' asked Geffre, a
grandmother of seven. ``People need to be aware that kids can drown
in a bucket. To open yourself to something like that is
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials attribute the calls to heightened awareness about
pool safety, and they speculate that people don't know their
neighbors well enough anymore to approach them with such a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not trying to turn in their neighbors,'' Deputy Chief
Bob Khan said. ``They're saying, `Hey, the kids could get hurt.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighter Karee Lansbery recently was called to a Phoenix home
where a family left a 15-foot-long blowup pool filled but unused in
the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   `They just don't think about it,'' Lansbery said. ``Maybe
they've gone inside but they're going to come back out and swim
some more. They forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansbery said many people view play pools simply as a toy for
their kids and don't realize they can be just as dangerous as
in-ground pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you put water in the (play) pool, you're creating a
danger to everybody,'' Lansbery said. ``A little kid could run down
the street, see it and fall in and drown.''
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Pugh said she appreciated the call she got from the
Fire Department about her backyard pool. Pugh was having some yard
work done, and someone apparently forgot to secure the gate. She
has no kids and no pets, so her pool isn't fenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It heightens my awareness now to check on it every day and at
night and whenever I leave,'' Pugh said. ``It's important that
people are aware and alert because it is such a tragedy that
children fall into the pools and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Six children have drowned in Phoenix this year, one more than
all of last year. Twenty-two children have nearly drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials warn the numbers are bound to get worse. June is
typically the month when the most water incidents occur each year.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors keeping an eye on each other could make a difference,
Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Mom and Dad anymore,'' he said. ``It's all of
us, and if we all work together, then the number of kids that die
and end up in wheelchairs will go down.'' &QL;

ANGELS RALLY TO BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT MAGOLOFF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Sunday's battle for baseball supremacy in
Southern California was probably what Major League Baseball had in
mind when it introduced interleague play in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The players, managers and coaches for the Los Angeles Dodgers
and Anaheim Angels consistently shifted focus away from the
turf-war theme of the three-game series at Edison Field. But they
still gave the fans - whose offsetting ``Dodgers'' and ``Angels''
chants suggested much greater fan interest - an exciting finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels trailed by two runs after seven innings but exploited
Los Angeles' troublesome bullpen for a come-from-behind 8-7 victory
to claim the first series of the season 2-1. The teams meet for
another three games at Dodger Stadium on July 13-15.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's newest player, shortstop Kevin Stocker, scored the
game-winning run when reserve outfielder Orlando Palmeiro was
walked by Antonio Osuna (0-2) with the bases loaded in the bottom
of the ninth inning and two outs. Osuna issued four walks and hit
Tim Salmon with a pitch. He lost the game without allowing a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (the count) got to (2-0), that's when I started taking,''
Palmeiro said. ``I saw him walk (Troy Glaus before me), and I
wanted to make him throw it over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Osuna never found home-plate umpire Chris Guccione's strike
zone, walking Palmeiro on four pitches. The result: Eleven of the
Angels' last 18 victories have now been by one run and 16 have been
by three runs or less.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' inability to get a hit off Osuna led the Dodgers' to
believe Guccione's strike zone shrunk throughout the game,
culminating with a miniscule window by the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those pitches were close,'' Osuna said. ``I threw a lot of
strikes. For me, I think, I don't know. (The problem) was behind
home plate, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson was a little more straightforward
about the rookie umpire, who was making his major-league debut
behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a real small strike zone to begin with,'' he said.
``Then it got wide a little bit, and then at the end it got a
little smaller. It's a tough way to lose a game, when it's
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the take on the strike zone, Anaheim's bullpen got the
job done while the Dodgers' didn't. After starter Jarrod Washburn
allowed seven runs on eight hits and five walks through 5 innings,
Mike Fyhrie and Troy Percival (3-2) combined for 3 innings of
shutout relief. They gave up a combined three hits and struck out
five of the 12 batters they faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have days when your guys are going to come out
and do the job,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``Our bullpen
gave us the opportunity to come back today. Both of our offenses
are very potent, and they did the job when they had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers reliever Matt Herges gave up the game-tying runs in the
eighth on an RBI single by Bengie Molina and a run-scoring
fielder's choice for Adam Kennedy (Cal State Northridge). Tim
Salmon (2 for 2) reached base in all five of his at-bats and hit
his 13th homer of the year. Darin Erstad (2 for 5) had his third
consecutive multiple-hit game and leads the American League in that
category with 30.

BELIEF AND SKEPTICISM MINGLE AT THE PARAPSYCHOLOGY FOUNDATION  

</HEADLINE>
   By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A die-hard group of regulars settled into black
folding chairs in the library of an elegant brownstone on the Upper
East Side. They come every month to hear about any and all things
pertaining to the realm of parapsychology.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the lecture was about surviving death. Other times, it had
been on out-of-body experiences, seances, channeling and remote
viewing, a form of clairvoyance.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular night, the audience leaned close to hear
whether Harry Houdini, the magician and escape artist, communicated
a secret message from beyond the grave in 1929 to his widow,
Beatrice, through a man described as a trance medium. The question
has long been pondered among Houdini aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, William Rauscher, a retired Episcopal priest and
psychic researcher, did not keep the audience in suspense for long.
He said that it was all a hoax and that the medium, Arthur Ford,
had conspired with Houdini's widow. Rauscher told the audience that
he believed Ford did have psychic abilities, just not in this
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some in the audience wanted the real goods. An intense
little man with coal-black hair raised his hand and asked why
Houdini failed to communicate from the grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he was dead,'' said Rauscher, as muffled cackles rose
from here and there in the packed library. ``It just didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was the other night at the Eileen J. Garrett Library
of the Parapsychology Foundation. The library is stocked with more
than 10,000 volumes on matters ranging from ghosts and
poltergeists, psychic spies and healing research, to spiritualism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place where just about any assumption might be
contemplated, and where psychic phenomena are accorded the respect
that they have yet to receive in the material world beyond the
tastefully appointed brownstone on East 71st Street.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, the foundation's executive director, Lisette
Coly, was standing in the hallway, watching the audience watch the
lecturer. Her diminutive 84-year-old mother, Eileen Coly, sat near
the carpeted staircase leading to the second floor. Upstairs is
home to an audiovisual lab, a periodicals room and a rare books
collection, which includes a pigskin-bound volume in Latin that
dates from the 1500s. A taffy-colored cat named Sushi, which lives
in the brownstone, lorded over the front reception desk.
</P>
<P>
   The library has one of the world's largest collections of
parapsychology books, according to Coly. The foundation was
established in 1951 by her maternal grandmother, Eileen Garrett, a
writer and a so-called trance medium who died in 1970. It was
endowed by Garrett's close friend Frances Payne Bolton, a wealthy
Ohio Republican who served in the House of Representatives from
1940 to 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett accepted her psychic abilities as a fact of life, her
granddaughter said, though she also was known for her skepticism.
Coly recalled her as saying: ``Monday, Wednesday and Friday, I
believe in the paranormal. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, I don't.
Sunday, I don't give a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Coly shares her grandmother's ambivalence, though she does not
claim any psychic ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things that cross my desk that I cannot
understand,'' said Coly, 50. ``I see stuff that is very provocative
and very suggestive of a psychic explanation, and yet I see people
who are harmed by charlatans every day.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday, Coly was introducing that night's
lecturer, Rauscher, and welcoming the two dozen or so people who
were taking their seats. She wants to raise awareness about
parapsychology by holding more lectures at the library, which is
free to the public. ``Parapsychology wants to look at all this
murky seance stuff in the bright light of day with scientific
methodology.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Coly, a good-humored woman with shoulder-length blond
hair, admits that it can be tough sometimes. When she meets people
for the first time, especially at PTA meetings _ she has two
school-age children _ she plays it safe, saying only that she is
the executive director of a nonprofit foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parapsychology elicits a very strong response, and I don't
want to open that can of worms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the people attending the lecture, it is precisely
their concern about being ostracized that makes the library such a
comforting place. A middle-aged man, whose business card indicated
that he was a physician and cancer researcher in New York City,
asked to remain anonymous. He said his belief in psychic phenomena
could jeopardize his high-level hospital position.
</P>
<P>
   (The physician is convinced that two of his patients had
out-of-body experiences, with one elderly, comatose woman floating
to the hospital ceiling and watching her own death before she was
resuscitated.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, thinking there is communication from the
other world is very weird,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people would burn us at the stake,'' his female companion
added.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the library that night, some who gathered had spent much of
their lives contemplating psychic issues. Among them was Dr. Hans
Holzer, an elderly author of dozens of books who describes himself
as a scientific investigator of the paranormal but is more commonly
known as a ghost hunter. His most recent books include ``Hans
Holzer's Travel Guide to Haunted Houses'' and ``Psychic: True
Paranormal Experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzer likes to catch up with old friends and hear about new
interpretations of psychic phenomena at the monthly forums. The
other evening, he leaned over to chat with his longtime friend
Martin Ebon. Ebon, 83, has written ``Psychic Warfare: Threat or
Illusion?,'' about Russian military research into the paranormal,
among other books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the atmosphere is one of openness,'' Holzer said. ``By
and large, there is a nucleus of people like me there every
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzer later said he was unmoved by the Houdini lecture. (He is
convinced that a secret code was relayed by Houdini to his wife.)
Holzer pointedly noted that Rauscher has a background as a
magician. ( Rauscher was introduced as belonging to England's Magic
Circle and the International Brotherhood of Magicians.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a waste of time; it had nothing to do with
parapsychology,'' Holzer said sternly of Rauscher's lecture. ``Let
me put it this way: I never trust a magician fully. Magicians
believe firmly that psychic phenomena are all fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauscher, the author of a new book, ``The Houdini Code
Mystery,'' insists he is not a psychic debunker. He believes in
extrasensory perception and the mystical experience, but says he
cannot be tricked easily.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Ann Drucker, who teaches in the English department at
Nassau Community College, was also expecting to hear something else
from Rauscher, but because he is a man of the cloth: ``I thought
that he would not find reasons to disbelieve what Arthur Ford had
been saying through his mediumship.''
</P>
<P>
   Drucker, an author who specializes in children's psychic
experiences, has become a regular at the Wednesday night lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Drucker and eight other people went to an
Upper East Side restaurant, where they chewed over details of that
night and the world of parapsychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, it's different,'' Drucker said. ``A lot of these
people have been in the field for a long time and have published in
it. It's sort of like a way of having a little community
get-together in the field of parapsychology in New York City. We
catch up with who is doing what, where. It's a small world.''

NEW YORK BARS PRISONER ADVOCATE, ALLEGING COMPLICITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An advocate for prisoners in New York has been barred from
visiting state prisons because officials contend she encouraged a
systemwide inmate strike, which was supposed to begin Jan. 1 but
was averted.
</P>
<P>
   The advocate, Alice Green, executive director of the Center for
Law and Justice, has visited state prisons for 20 years as an
liaison between inmates, their families and the state. As an
employee of the New York Civil Liberties Union in the 1970s, Green
said she helped prisoners prepare for their release with job
training and advice on their transition to life outside.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 years, Green's Albany-based group, the Center
for Law and Justice, has organized an annual meeting between
prisoner advocates and state lawmakers. Green said she typically
visits state prisons about once a month to plan for the conference
and meet with inmates for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than a year, Green said, she has been denied entry
to every prison she has sought to visit. About a month ago, she
said she began calling the State Department of Correctional
Services each day to find out if she was, in fact, being banned.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she said she received a letter dated May 9 from Glenn
S. Goord, the commissioner of the department, which stated: ``You
are correct. Pursuant to the authority vested in me by law, I have
directed each superintendent to deny all visitation access by you
and any member of your organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, wrote Goord, was that Green posed ``a clear threat
to the safety and security'' of inmates and prison employees. The
letter accused Green's organization of ``encouraging an illegal
systemwide inmate action on Jan.1.''
</P>
<P>
   But Green said she had not ben permitted to enter the prisons
since last spring, months before the inmate action was scheduled.
She said she thought she had been barred because of an incident in
January 1999 in which she unfurled a banner that read ``No More
Prisons'' behind Gov. George E. Pataki while he was giving a
speech. She was arrested but acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I got an invitation from prisoners at Attica and I
was approved to go in, but then, at the last minute, I was told I
couldn't come in,'' Green said. ``I was told I was a radical,
opposed to prisons, and that was the reason for not letting me
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said she did not help foment a prison strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly brought it to the attention of people outside but
I in no way encouraged that strike,'' Green said. ``I had not even
been in the prisons for at least a year, and I've worked in the
prisons for 20 years without incident.''
</P>
<P>
   James B. Flateau, a spokesman for the New York Department of
Correctional Services, said there was no connection between Green's
action at the Pataki rally and the corrections department denying
her prison access. He said members of Green's group were allowed
into the prisons until late last fall, but he declined to comment
further on any role she might have had in a strike.
</P>
<P>
   To avert a strike, many inmates were transferred, two prisons
were placed under lockdown and guards were added.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, no member of the public is allowed into state
prisons without permission from Goord's office.
</P>
<P>
   Green said it will be almost impossible to plan the prison
legislative conference this year without visiting inmates, and her
advocacy on behalf of inmates will be hurt by the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara J. Olshansky, assistant legal director for the Center
for Constitutional Rights in New York, has been following Green's
case. She said she was worried that the ban against Green would
squelch advocacy by other prisoner support organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to be very concerned about saying anything they
believe in, whether inside or outside the prison, because they're
going to be afraid that they will be exiled as well,'' she said.
``Then everyone's First Amendment rights get squashed, both inside
and outside the prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Flateau disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work her group ostensibly is doing is carried on by a
number of groups, and we don't expect there to be any noticeable
impact on the inmate population because she's not there,'' he said.

COPPELL SLUGGER A PRIME PROSPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK HERRIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPPELL, Texas _ Most of the tales are true. They may sound a
bit far-fetched, but they happened.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   There are witnesses. More come to see if they will have
something to tell. Jason Stokes, Coppell High School's
super-slugging first baseman, carries with him stories of
gargantuan hits. The kind that prompt the question, ``Did that kid
just do that?''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 230-pound Stokes, who hit a state-record 25 home
runs this season, has sent fans buzzing and coaches scrambling for
measuring devices. The recently awarded Gatorade National High
School Player of the Year has what some call ``major-league
power.'' That raw power is expected to land him in the first round
of the Major League Baseball first-year player draft, which begins
today.
</P>
<P>
   The Stokes stories are extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer with the Connie Mack League Dallas Mustangs, Stokes
hit a 525-foot home run at Dallas Jefferson. Over the left-field
fence, over the street, and over the first row of homes. Several
players, including Stokes, later measured the hit.
</P>
<P>
   At Carroll this year, Stokes launched a 500-foot blast over the
left-field scoreboard that hit the school's tennis courts, 145 feet
past the outfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got out and measured it,'' Carroll coach Larry Hughes. ``I
had never seen a ball hit like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also the estimated 500-foot-plus shot at Trinity
Christian Academy in Addison, over an apartment complex off
hard-throwing David Purcey, also a heavily watched prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball America'' has projected Stokes to go in the first
round. The magazine's predraft projection had Stokes going as high
as No. 4 to the Kansas City Royals. The Royals are one of two
teams, San Diego being the other with the ninth pick, Stokes said
has shown the most interest. ``Baseball America's'' latest
projection has Stokes being selected at No. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Stokes, Jason's father, said he has been told his son
could slip in today's first round _ possibly out of the top 10 _
because small-market teams at the top of the draft are showing
reluctance to pay Stokes the money high picks can command.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason is a top-five pick,'' Bobby Stokes said, ``but they
don't want to pay him as a top-five pick.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Baseball America's'' predraft projection does materialize,
however, Stokes will be the fourth Fort Worth-Dallas area high
school player to go in the first five picks since 1994. The last
was Arlington Bowie outfielder Vernon Wells, who went No. 5 to the
Toronto Blue Jays in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons of Stokes, though, are geared toward another local
hitting phenom, Ben Grieve, the No. 2 pick overall out of Martin in
the 1994 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to pitch to Grieve,'' said Keller coach Rob Stramp,
who coached against Grieve at Irving Nimitz. ``He'd miss every once
in a while, but with Stokes, he just constantly rockets the ball.
He's the best power hitter in high school I've ever seen. Pitching
to him wasn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a senior, Stokes' vaunted bat demolished school records. He
touted a .536 average with 62 runs batted in with a 1.330 slugging
percentage. Stokes powered Coppell's 32-3 season that ended in the
Class 4A Region II semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets ``real'' quiet when he's up,'' said Daniel Raudabaugh,
a 13-year-old Coppell fan. ``Everyone wants to see what he's going
to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes, 18, is regarded as the top power hitter available, and
he is expecting a first-round selection and quick signing. Despite
signing a scholarship with the University of Texas, he doesn't feel
that hinders his signability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to sign as quick as possible and get out and start
playing,'' said Stokes, in his down-home drawl. ``I'm just looking
somewhere in the first round, and I'll be more than happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Before high school, Stokes looked far from a future first-round
draft pick. He was once a 5-10, 245-pound chubby middle school kid
with little athletic ability. Then Stokes hit his growth spurt and
the weights. He grew taller, stronger and got thinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we really considered Jason to be an athlete
until his sophomore year,'' Coppell coach Dave Curliss said. ``Not
until he started to lose some of the baby fat.''
</P>
<P>
   As Stokes grew, so did his reputation. He hit eight home runs as
a sophomore and 13 as a junior. Then he followed with 32 more that
summer with the Mustangs.
</P>
<P>
   His bat speed and his hand strength are what sets him apart.
</P>
<P>
   Curliss said Stokes' bat speed has been clocked as high as 103
mph. That compares with his teammates' average in the 70- to 80-mph
range. Curliss said one scout, who tested Stokes' hands, said his
score was second only to Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very strong human being,'' said one major-league
scout. ``He has tremendous hand strength, which relates to bat
speed, which relates to power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the power stroke. He hits them where they don't have
any defensive players.''
</P>
<P>
   While scouts rave about his power, he's hardly one-dimensional
at the plate or in the field. Stokes showed running ability by
stealing 12 bases in 13 attempts. He showed contact hitting ability
by striking out only 12 times in 112 at-bats. And he showed arm
strength, which could project him as an outfielder, while playing
some at third base.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Stokes' compact and laser-quick power stroke that make
him a soon-to-be professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pure hitter and has major-league power, and he's proven
it,'' said Dave Acton, a part-time Toronto Blue Jays area scout.
``The best thing about Stokes is he produced under the amount of
pressure he had.''

DEFENSE-MINDED LEHTINEN CREATING OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The day-to-day status reports of Jere Lehtinen's
certain return had become so day-to-day misleading, it seemed his
only use in the playoffs would be as a decoy.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed those reports were to make Edmonton, San Jose and
Colorado think the league's top defensive forward might play at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Through two series, despite Stars coach Ken Hitchcock's
insistence on several occasions that Lehtinen would return,
Lehtinen remained a scratch. His recovering fractured right ankle
was still causing him fits. By the end of the second round, perhaps
only his teammates and coaches believed Lehtinen would truly grind
in the corners before the season ended. But the Stars knew.
</P>
<P>
   `` somebody else, maybe ,'' Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor said.
]''Everybody knows Jere is probably working twice as hard off the
ice as we are on the ice,'' Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen, who won the Selke Trophy the past two seasons as the
NHL's top defensive forward, finally made his grand return for Game
1 of the Western Conference Finals. Ten games into his comeback and
three games deep into the Stanley Cup Finals, Lehtinen's tenacious
two-way play shows no signs of missing 65 regular-season games and
10 playoff games. He has one goal and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have loved to have had a full year together, playing
healthy, playing together,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. ``It's
scary to think what we could have accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Or not have accomplished if the ankle had sidelined him against
Colorado. His return gave the Stars a fallback when rookie Brenden
Morrow, who had replaced Lehtinen at left wing on the Stars' first
line, went down with his own ankle injury in Game 1 against
Colorado. Lehtinen also was used on the second line in Game 2 of
the Stanley Cup Finals in an attempt to ignite Joe Nieuwendyk, who
hasn't scored in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use Lehtinen as a catalyst,'' Hitchcock said. ``When
anybody is not going well, we just put him with Lehtinen. So, if I
am having a bad day, Lehtinen comes for coffee with me. If we need
Nieuwendyk to get rolling, then that is where we put Jere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock hinted yesterday that Morrow is playing well enough to
jump from the fourth line and rejoin Modano and Brett Hull, which
would allow Lehtinen to play on the second line. Those plans also
hinge on the impending return of Jamie Langenbrunner, who Hitchcock
said he expects to rejoin the lineup today for Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the line is going to be, but it doesn't
matter where everybody goes,'' Lehtinen said. ``We have to get more
shots and get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen had the assist on Hull's game-winner in Game 2 against
New Jersey. And, immediately after Hitchcock moved Lehtinen
alongside Nieuwendyk and Jon Sim later in that game, the line
generated scoring chances but couldn't cash in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jere just adds a little different aspect to that
line,'' said winger Scott Thornton, whom Lehtinen replaced. ``He's
obviously a great defensive hockey player, but he can create a lot
of offense in the zone. He's confident with the puck, and he's
poised in the corners, and he is not afraid to go battling and get
his nose dirty.''

STARS DON'T WANT HISTORY TO REPEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the resident Civil War buff, Ken Hitchcock was asked
yesterday if the Stanley Cup Finals reminded him of anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it isn't Pickett's Charge that we're running here,''
the general of the Stars said.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1863, history tells us, the combined Confederate forces
of Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett advanced on Union troops at
Gettysburg. Results were disastrous. A total of 6,240 Confederate
soldiers lay dead, wounded or missing after the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Union's great advantage was better firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free, therefore, to draw your own Stanley Cup Finals
analogies here.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Stars, down two games to one heading into tonight Game 4
at Reunion Arena, have the firepower to overcome the New Jersey
Devils? Or are they walking into a disaster?
</P>
<P>
   Like a Zamboni driver on prescription cold medication, the Stars
have careened up and down the ice in this series.
</P>
<P>
   At times, they have appeared groggy, and at times inspired. For
brief spells, they have fought like bulldogs _ for others, they've
simply played like Chihuahuas.
</P>
<P>
   With each downhill plunge of the roller coaster, the knee-jerk
reaction has been to forecast the Stars' imminent demise. But the
defending champs have always rallied to prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's 2-1,'' Hitchcock said. ``We win tomorrow, and all
you people are telling us how great we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars seem to know the drill as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of experience in the dressing room,'' defenseman
Darryl Sydor said yesterday. ``I think that obviously you couldn't
like what happened the night before. But the next day is a new day,
and we realize what we have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we just play a little bit more desperate, a little bit
more under control, and keep it simple. Keep it simplified and get
things done.''
</P>
<P>
   History, not unlike Hitchcock's Civil War reference, is not on
the Stars' side. In the Cup finals, the team that won Game 3 to
take a 2-1 lead has gone on to win the championship 18 of the past
21 times. The Stars will be trying to do something that has only
been accomplished twice in the past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Do they have enough firepower?
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing opinion is that that is largely up to Joe
Nieuwendyk, who, history also reminds us, won the Conn Smythe
Trophy as the playoffs' Most Valuable Player last year.
</P>
<P>
   Getting injured winger Jamie Langenbrunner back should help.
Langenbrunner has a high intensity style that forces the other team
to pay attention. If his wounded knee allows him, he should provide
instant energy to whatever line he plays on.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars need him. They need contributors, not watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Are they a tired team, as some have suggested?
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make sense. If anything, after eight months, they
can finally see the carrot at the end of the stick. They know the
satisfaction that is finally within their grasps.
</P>
<P>
   When asked yesterday, Hitchcock turned the question around on
the writers who wrote it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they're probably tired of covering this,'' he said. ``They
want to get on with the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated team does tend to look like a tentative team, and a
tentative team can appear to be tired.
</P>
<P>
   But as Hitchcock said, ``I thought the qualities of New Jersey
came out after they scored their first goal, and it frustrated us.
I think both teams have been able to control the other's
frustration level.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were prepared to play patient and strong defensive
hockey, even though the game was 1-1, and we were trying to push
the issue too much and got burned because of it.''

<P>
   The challenge for tonight, he conceded, is to see that the
frustration doesn't set in again.
</P>
<P>
   The roller-coaster season suggests that the Stars will rebound
and knot the best-of-seven series. But Finals history warns that
the defending champs might be waging a losing battle.
</P>
<P>
   Firepower wins, no matter how many times the general yells
charge.

GLYNN GETS START
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers will recall right-handed pitcher
Ryan Glynn from Triple-A Oklahoma and start him tonight against the
Los Angeles Dodgers, manager Johnny Oates said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn will be replacing left-hander Darren Oliver, who
complained of a ``dead arm'' after each of his past two starts.
Oates, though, expects Oliver to return to the rotation and start
Sunday against the Colorado Rockies in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn went 3-1 with a 3.17 earned-run average in 11 appearances
(10 starts) for the RedHawks this season, but he missed his
previous scheduled start with a finger blister.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers plan to option outfielder Scott Podsednik to
Double-A Tulsa to make room for Glynn on the 25-man roster. The
Rangers purchased Podsednik's contract Saturday from Tulsa.  &QL; 
Kapler on schedule
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers expect outfielder Gabe Kapler to return to the
lineup as their center fielder Friday against the Rockies, manager
Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler will begin his second medical rehabilitation assignment
with Double-A Tulsa and play five innings tonight, seven innings
tomorrow and nine innings Wednesday before rejoining the Rangers,
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler went on the 15-day disabled list May 4 after suffering a
partial tear to his right quadriceps muscle. The Rangers plan for
Kapler to replace Ruben Mateo (fracture, right femur) as their
center fielder after the latter suffered a season-ending injury
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve outfielders Scarborough Green and Jason McDonald will
share playing time in center field until Kapler's return, Oates
said.  &QL; 
Sheldon plays
</P>
<P>
   Reserve infielder Scott Sheldon logged his first start this
season at third base for Mike Lamb, who strained the trapezius
muscle in his right shoulder Saturday during a 4-3 loss to the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The injury did not prevent Lamb from playing, but Oates chose to
give the left-handed hitter the evening off against Arizona
left-hander Omar Daal. Lamb strained the muscle swinging the bat
during his final plate appearance Saturday.  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Reserve infielder Frank Catalanotto likely will make his first
start defensively since May 18 tonight against the Dodgers, Johnny
Oates said. Catalanotto likely will spell second baseman Luis
Alicea.
</P>
<P>
   The first-inning home runs by catcher Ivan Rodriguez and first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro marked the second time this season the
Rangers hit back-to-back homers.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Craig Counsell snapped a 210 at-bat homerless streak
with his second-inning solo shot off right-hander Esteban Loaiza.
It was Counsell's first home run since hitting one off of
Philadelphia's Wayne Gomes on July 24, 1998. / nn

MICROSOFT UNDER SIEGE BY LAWSUITS

<P>
   (Phoenix) - While fighting to keep from being split in two by
the federal government, Microsoft Corp. is also suddenly under
siege by about 150 lawsuits demanding refunds for millions of
buyers of its Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   Class-action attorneys have beaten paths to courthouses
nationwide since a federal judge declared on Nov. 5 that the
world's largest software company was using monopolistic power to
crush competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also gouged consumers in pricing Windows and its
entwined Internet Explorer browser, according to the onslaught of
private lawsuits. The company denies overcharging for any of its
products.
</P>
<P>
   Because the federal antitrust action won by the Justice
Department and 20 states did not seek monetary damages from
Microsoft, private consumers, including five in Arizona, have been
filing lawsuits at the rate of more than one every weekday in the
past six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are simply a bunch of attorneys trying to make money,''
Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said at the company's headquarters
in Redmond, Wash. ``This is not for the benefit of consumers in any
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Four lawsuits filed since December by Phoenix law firms are
seeking class-action status, several in conjunction with nationally
recognized firms that have represented consumers in
multimillion-dollar cases involving tobacco, breast implants, the
fen-phen diet drug and numerous other pandemics.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are a Phoenix law firm, a Scottsdale employment
agency that bought 13 computers loaded with Windows, two individual
Phoenix residents described as ``typical'' computer users and a
bowling-alley owner in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   If the lawsuits are success ful, virtually anyone in Arizona who
bought one or another type of Windows could qualify to collect
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The awards could be three times the amount Microsoft is judged
to have overcharged for Windows _ minus substantial lawyers' fees
and other costs of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the lawsuits are the findings of fact issued in
November by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in the
government's antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said a Microsoft study showed that the company could
have charged $49 instead of $89 for an upgrade to Windows 98, and
``there is no reason to believe that the $49 price would have been
unprofitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words gave attorneys visions of winning as three times the
$40 price differential cited by the judge, for every unit of
Windows bought by millions of individuals and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, claims could total in the ``tens of billions of
dollars,'' according to the Consumer Federation of America. In
fiscal 1999 alone, Windows sales totaled $8.5 billion, accounting
for more than 40 percent of Microsoft's total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Microsoft's vulnerability and wealth has
attracted many of the biggest names in class-action litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's literally coast to coast,'' said Michael Flannery, an
attorney in San Diego. His office of the nation's largest firm,
Milberg Weiss, is no stranger to Arizona, having won $240 million
for investors bilked by the collapse of Charles H Keating Jr.'s
American Continental Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Flannery said the firm is handling at least a dozen lawsuits
against Microsoft, including two in conjunction with the Phoenix
firm of Bonnett Fairbourn Friedman &AMP; Balint.
</P>
<P>
   Another Arizona lawsuit was filed by the Phoenix office of a
Minneapolis firm associated with the Cincinnati practice in which
class-action icon Stanley Chesley is a nameplate member. That firm
also is handling at least 12 Microsoft lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the lawsuits are baseless,'' Microsoft's Cullinan said.
``There was nothing in . . . the Department of Justice case that
ever sug gested that Microsoft was overcharging customers. In
actuality, the government found the exact opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullinan said the $89 vs. $49 cost cited in Jackson's findings
of fact was based only on Microsoft's marketing survey of what
consumers thought Windows 98 might be worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most consumers considered $89 a fair price and have shown so
since,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that a $49 price could have produced an adequate
profit is ``kind of weird,'' Cullinan said, because the cost of
developing an operating system ``is hundreds of millions, if not
billions, of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that's just an erroneous finding from the court,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   All four Arizona lawsuits started in Maricopa County Superior
Court because the state's antitrust and consumer protection
statutes are seen as hospitable to such actions. But two were
transferred to U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   In federal court, nearly identical Microsoft lawsuits from
around the country are likely to be merged into one, and ``cases
tend to go on forever,'' said Marty Harper, an attorney at the
Goodwin Raup firm in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the Phoenix cases moved to federal court was snet
to Maryland for likely consolidation, prompting the plaintiff's law
firm to start over in state court by filing a slightly different
action on behalf of a new plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   Harper said the lawsuit his firm filed was carefully crafted to
be ``unremovable'' from state court.
</P>
<P>
   Class-action lawyers deny they are motivated by greed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say they are basically a private attorney general'' for
consumers' interests, attorney Flannery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring to justice large corporate wrongdoers with large
amounts of wealth who might otherwise escape that justice because
individual consumers who are hurt can't take them on by
themselves,'' he said. &QL;

 DIVING INTO THE MP3 MOSH PIT  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kick.com's new storefront on a rough but
redeveloping block in downtown San Francisco looks more like a
nondescript employment office than the high-tech home of yet
another Net music startup.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the Mission Street site is the perfect symbol of the
challenges awaiting a company jumping into the Internet's latest
fad, online music.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of companies like Kick.com are setting up shop on every
virtual street corner at a dizzying pace, each hoping to stand out
from the crowd with technology that will capitalize on the
popularity of MP3s and Napster's maverick song-swapping program.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco and Silicon Valley have become hotbeds for Net
music startups, each hyping new technology that promises to
``revolutionize'' Internet music and the music industry, giving
consumers a less complicated and more legal way to find, review and
enjoy digital songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are excited about music,'' said Kick.com's Matthew
Skyrm, chief executive and co-founder of the 20-employee startup.
``That's one reason you see a lot of the best people at companies
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kick.com, ArtistOne.com and MuBu.com in San Francisco, along
with Gigabeat Inc. in Sunnyvale, Calif., are just some of the local
companies that have just launched or are close to launching their
Web sites and products.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just a local phenomenon. A company called
eMikolo.com, based in New York and Israel, last week unveiled the
eMikolo Entertainment System that lets users legally download
digital music, videos, books and other content.
</P>
<P>
   They are all trying to rise above the din already created by
only slightly older Audio Alley players like Listen.com, Liquid
Audio, Emusic.com, Vitaminic.com and, of course, the wildly
popular, legally embattled Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are excited about this, not just about MP3 piracy, but
they see the market is interesting,'' said Manish Vij, CEO of
Pointera, a Palo Alto, Calif., company that will launch today,
offering its own new ``legitimate file sharing'' program that
allows users to share all types of files, not just music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Napster has hit a nerve. Now (the question is) how do
we make money on this?'' said Vij, who is launching Pointera as a
new division of his year-old Internet music and video sharing site,
Spinfrenzy Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Field Already Glutted
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, though, say many of the Net music startups won't be
around to hear the answer because the field already may be too
crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of them are going to make it,'' said Malcolm
Maclachlan, media analyst for International Data Corp. ``There's
going to be a real contraction in the number of viable music
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the online music world was sparsely populated by
about a dozen companies straining to be heard in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   That was only about three years ago, when the MP3 music
compression format was gaining popularity among college students
but was not even on the radar screens of the $40 billion-a-year
recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with MP3 firmly planted in the pop-culture lexicon, there
are hundreds of such companies around the country, said Ric Dube, a
senior analyst at Internet and entertainment research firm Webnoize
Research of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Habits Hard to Change
</P>
<P>
   Fading fads like online health and online pet supplies were like
the tail wagging the dog, Dube said. They hoped to convince
consumers to abandon old habits and get their health tips or pet
supplies in a new way, through the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But online music has been an easier sell _ many consumers have
adopted the technology with ease, which is causing the music
industry to change its pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking example so far has come from San Mateo,
Calif.'s Napster Inc., the 1-year-old company behind a freely
distributed software program that allows users to find and swap MP3
files easily among themselves via an Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster program first spread like wildfire across college
campuses, but it's no longer unusual to find older Napster-ites
with a thousand songs stored on their computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   The program gained notoriety as some college campuses banned it
for taking up too much Internet bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   And the Recording Industry Association of America, representing
the biggest record companies, and individual artists Metallica and
Dr. Dre, have sued Napster, saying the shared songs violated the
nation's copyright laws. And Napster was also the subject of a
congressional committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The controversies have landed Napster in national headlines in
major publications, including the cover story of this week's
Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   A new report by Web research firm Jupiter Communications Inc.
said Napster users, who were posting a vast library of 55 million
music files, were a demonstration of ``the music industry's failure
thus far to satisfy online consumer demands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster is popular because that's where the content is,'' Dube
said. ``Our economy is based on supply and demand. That's `demand,'
not `pretty please.' ''
</P>
<P>
   More and More Believers
</P>
<P>
   The new bumper crop of startups believes that demand points to a
lucrative market ripe for companies that can make Net music easier
for consumers to use, while at the same time generate new profits
that will keep entertainment companies and artists happy.
</P>
<P>
   The Jupiter report projected that, by 2003, downloadable songs
will account for only 5.7 percent, or $146.6 million, of overall
online sales of music, including CD sales. But the report also said
Napster's success hints that a subscription-based model could boost
downloadable song revenues much higher.
</P>
<P>
   And since music itself strikes a chord across every demographic
slice of the population, executives at the new startups believe
that making money from online music is only a matter of finding the
right formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such an explosion of demand for music online,'' said
Erin Turner, one of three recent Stanford University business
graduates who formed Gigabeat.com, which launched last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many niche sites, it's becoming a marketplace of mass
confusion for the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gigabeat bills itself as a ``one-stop online gateway for music
fans,'' with Web-based programs to find downloadable music files
and Internet radio stations. A ``GigaSpiral'' tool allows users to
discover new songs and artists similar to the singers and music
they already like.

   Turner said she and her co-founders, Wilburt Labio and Narayanan
Shivakumar, understand their audience. She said the three met while
they were students at Stanford, and just like the audience they are
trying to reach, they were ``all music fanatics as well as Web
geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're part of the first generation that grew up with the
Internet as part of our daily lives, from school to work to play,''
Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   John Adams, founder of Imagine Radio, said his new company,
MuBu, has the edge over other new Net music companies because it is
steered by veterans of technology and the entertainment businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those smart MBA graduates don't respect the fact that there's
actually more to it than writing a business plan,'' said Adams,
whose company is shooting for a formal launch of its online music
technology later this month. ``We're not just one of those
Internet.com kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Kick.com's Matthew Skyrm believes his company knows what the
recording industry wants. On May 10, the company launched a beta of
its Kick.com Music Companion, a Web-based technology that will
allow music companies to deliver ``personalized'' news and
information directly to fans.
</P>
<P>
   Offering More Information
</P>
<P>
   The technology, for example, will recognize a music fan is
listening to a Smashing Pumpkins CD and automatically find upcoming
band concert dates, a discount on band sweatshirts or breaking news
on band members.
</P>
<P>
   ArtistOne.com, housed in an office in San Francisco's
tech-centric South Park area, launched its site May 15. It hopes to
give new and emerging musicians the chance to use downloadable
music to build their careers, which is a similar mission embraced
by other firms, like Garageband.com and Riffage.com.
</P>
<P>
   ArtistOne, which gives artists a 70 percent cut of sponsorship
revenues, is already up to about 500,000 unique users, CEO Michael
Moroney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all assume this is a market that is going to grow,'' said
Moroney, a former venture capitalist who wanted to start his own
company. ``Nobody expects this is going to be an industry that
peters out. This is the future of how people will get their
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how these new startups will fare in the future,
especially as the major entertainment companies such as Sony and
America Online-Time-Warner start to muscle in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are going to go away,'' Dube said. ``Even the
ones that do succeed, they won't succeed in their own names.
They'll be acquired and will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, while there's ``certainly too many out there for
them all to succeed, the more noise, the better it is for
consumers.''

 A'S WEB SITE A REAL HIT WITH BASEBALL FANS  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While the San Francisco Giants were building a
stadium, the Oakland Athletics were building a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Giants are selling out every game at their new
$319 million ballpark and are killing their cross-bay rivals in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   But the A's new and improved Web site has already generated more
than $1 million in revenue from tickets, licensing and merchandise,
and the team hasn't had to spend a dime.
</P>
<P>
   The A's have already brought home more than $300,000 in revenue
from online ticket sales this year, which by the end of May matched
the total generated from online sales during the entire 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as the airline industry has learned, the A's have found
the Web a good way to fill seats at the Network Associates Coliseum
that would normally go unsold.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, according to industry sources, the A's are getting
$667,000 from a five-year licensing agreement with ACS Sports.com,
the Baltimore company that's building up the Web presence of the
A's and eight other Major League Baseball teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have a top-of-the-line Web site,'' said David
Alioto, the A's vice president of sales and marketing. ``With the
proximity of the East Bay to Silicon Valley, it was really
important for the A's to be out on the forefront on that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the A's sold about 617 tickets online per week, about
21,000 for the season, said Jim Bloom, the A's director of
marketing and communications. Since April 1 of this year, when the
team's new redesigned Web site at  &LR; www.oaklandathletics.com &LR;  went
live, online sales have jumped to 1,800 a week and the average is
still climbing.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the A's group ticket sales have come through
the Web. And the team sold seats in four luxury boxes by offering a
Mother's Day special only through the Web site, Bloom said.
</P>
<P>
   The team's overall attendance isn't strong: Before this
weekend's three-game interleague series with San Francisco that
pulled in season-record crowds and included many Giants fans, the
A's drew 397,516 fans. That was only 16,208 more than at the same
point in 1999. In one embarrassing moment in May, the A's drew
about 6,836 fans on a day that their top minor-league team in
Sacramento had 14,111.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Giants played before sell-out crowds of 40,930
every game. Through 26 dates, the Giants drew 1,064,180 fans, a
whopping 501,712 more than at the same point last year at windy
3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing attendance for the two clubs, though, may be like
comparing apples and oranges because the lure of the new Pacific
Bell Park is responsible for the Giants' surge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Giants have also tapped the power of the Web. During
a special weeklong sale of single-game tickets in February, the
Giants sold 176,353 seats, 67,535 of them online, said Tom
McDonald, the team's senior vice president of consumer marketing.
</P>
<P>
   And about 55 percent of tickets that the Giants are releasing a
few days before each game, seats originally held for the league,
visiting teams or other reasons, are being purchased through the
team's Web site at  &LR; www.sfgiants.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the future,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   But with a far smaller season ticket base to rely upon, the A's
have to be more creative in marketing the team. Bloom said the Web
is proving to be that vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   So the team is using online newsletters, online chats with
players and expanded pre- and post-game broadcasting on the Web to
draw fans to merchandise and tickets.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend, the A's experimented with interactive
statistics tied to television broadcasts that allow fans to, for
example, instantly learn outfielder Matt Stairs' batting average
with runners in scoring position and two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Internet analysts have predicted pro sports teams will
increasingly find new sources of revenue from the Web, especially
from online ticket sales, and the A's are helping to lead baseball
into a new high-tech era.
</P>
<P>
   A report by online research firm Jupiter Communications Inc.
predicts that by 2003, fans will spend about $3 billion a year
online on sporting goods, apparel, footwear and, most of all, game
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are more games and more seats to sell in a season,
Major League Baseball has the most to gain of any of the four major
professional sports leagues, said Patrick Keane, Jupiter's senior
sports analyst. But he said the other three leagues _ the National
Football League, National Basketball Association, and National
Hockey League _ have been more aggressive on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball has really missed significant opportunities to do
things online,'' such as taking advantage of the Mark McGwire-Sammy
Sosa home run derby in 1998, to draw fans to team Web sites, Keane
said. ``Baseball is the slowest and most foolhardy of the leagues
to go online.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets have also had success selling online tickets,
according to Spiro Alafassos, ACS Sports' vice president of
content. Still, most baseball teams have been slow to use the Web,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a learning process for a lot of teams,'' Alafassos said.

BIOSCOPE: BIOTECH FIRMS GO TO BAT FOR PROPOSED DEFERRED
TAX  INCENTIVES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California Gov. Gray Davis has proposed
increasing the state's R&AMP;D tax credit from 12 percent to 15
percent, a boost that will please high-tech and other business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But to benefit from a tax credit, companies must make profits
and pay taxes. And of roughly 700 biotech firms in the Bay Area,
only a handful make enough money to take advantage of any tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   That's why biotech industry leaders will be looking to
Sacramento over the next few weeks, as Senate and Assembly leaders
decide whether to modify Davis's research and development
incentives to make them more useful to biotech startups.
</P>
<P>
   The forum for action will be the Assembly-Senate conference
committee on the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech execs are hoping lawmakers will sweeten the R&AMP;D pie in
one or two additional ways: first by lengthening the time companies
can carry forward their losses until they are profitable; and/or
letting money-losing companies sell their tax credits or losses to
tax-paying firms.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Ted Lempert, D-San Carlos, authored the first
proposal, which would let firms carry forward losses for 10 years.
Losses now expire after five to eight years, according to Cristin
Carty, a lobbyist for the California Healthcare Institute, an
industry group based in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Letting biotech companies deduct past losses amounts to a sort
of R&AMP;D credit. But execs say it often takes longer than five to
eight years to take a new drug from research, through clinical
trials and to the market, making this tax incentive worthless
because it expires before they get into the black.
</P>
<P>
   Lempert's bill, AB1774, passed the Assembly last week and
although it didn't clear the Senate, legislative rules allow it to
be considered as part of the budget mix.
</P>
<P>
   The second proposal, AB2328 by Assemblywoman Denise Moreno
Ducheny, D-San Diego, would allow money-losing biotech firms to
sell a portion of their R&AMP;D credits, as well as these same
operating losses, subject to various restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Ducheny's bill will also be included in the final conference
committee deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   But since trading tax credits would be a new idea for
California, it stands a lesser chance of making the final cut.
</P>
<P>
   Still, biotech execs are hopeful that even if the Ducheny
proposal gets axed, Lempert's legislation will make it to the
governor's desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to get something out of the state Legislature
that says it recognizes the long lead times of pharmaceutical
development,'' said CHI President David Gollaher.
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO ROAD? Many states would like a piece of California's
biotech industry, but Michigan takes the cake when it comes to
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Using funds set aside from its share of the tobacco lawsuit
settlement, Michigan is promising up to $50 million in matching
grants to firms that locate new research facilities in the
Wolverine State.
</P>
<P>
   The grant program is being coordinated by the Michigan Economic
Development Corp. in Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, lest you forget, is one of the frigid states bordering
the Great Lakes, bodies of water which thaw out each summer just
long enough so that billions of mosquitoes can breed.
</P>
<P>
   Companies receiving grants for relocating in Michigan will not
be allowed to use state funds to underwrite their bug repellent
expenses. But if you say you read of their offer in The Chronicle,
I'm sure state officials will be happy to provide complimentary
parkas emblazoned with the state's unofficial motto: ``If you don't
like snow, why did you move here?''
</P>
<P>
   BIO-X: Stanford University has begun to spend the $150 million
that Silicon Valley entrepreneur Jim Clark donated last year to
encourage experiments that combine biology with engineering and
computer science.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford has dubbed this interdisciplinary effort Bio-X, and in
announcing the first 17 research grants last week, university
authorities began spelling out how they plan to bring Clark's
vision into focus.
</P>
<P>
   After Clark made his gift, an anonymous donor kicked in another
$60 million to the Bio-X fund.
</P>
<P>
   The grants, which averaged $412,000 and totaled $7 million, will
support current and new projects including:
</P>
<P>
   -- Technology for tracking fluorescent dyes inside living
animals. Stanford pediatrician Chris Contag has created chemical
tags that can be detected through the skin, diminishing the need to
dissect experimental animals. This technology is being commercially
exploited by Xenogen, a biotech firm in Alameda, Calif. The
Stanford lab will presumably advance the state of the art.
</P>
<P>
   -- Creation of a new center to study the brain. How does a mass
of neurons create thought, speech, memory and experience? Answering
these questions will pull together specialists in instrumentation,
neuroscience, and a host of other fields.
</P>
<P>
   -- Developing a supercomputer visualization center. Clark must
love this. Creating realistic visualizations was the core of his
first business, Silicon Graphics. Stanford hopes to develop
techniques that would allow researchers to ``feel'' a single
molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford has set aside $120 million to construct a new building,
named for Clark, to serve as the nucleus of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, rival UC Berkeley is pursuing its own
interdisciplinary plan, which it calls its ``Health Sciences
Initiative.'' (Score one point for Stanford for the sexier
moniker.)
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley hopes to raise $300 million in private donations to
create new laboratories where physicists and chemists will rub
elbows with molecular biologists and mechanical engineers. One
modest donor has already contributed $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Such interdisciplinary efforts make sense given that modern
biology views living creatures as organic machines. They're built
of molecules instead of gears or wheels. They're run by genes not
software. But be they man or microbe, they're really just systems
to be taken apart, studied, repaired, perhaps even improved.
</P>
<P>
   So long as science views life as the ultimate tinker toy, why
not gather all the kids together in one room and see what they
dream up. It may be the next frontier in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   CROP STOMPERS: A bill that would increase fines for vandalizing
experimental crops has cleared the California Assembly and is
awaiting action in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Helen Thomson, D-Davis, wrote AB2510 in response
to a series of incidents in which vandals destroyed genetically
engineered crops being grown by University of California
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   None of the vandals has ever been arrested, in part because the
incidents hardly seemed worth investigating since the penalties for
roughing up plants have been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson's bill would allow the courts to fine convicted vandals
twice the value of the crop they destroyed, after factoring in the
scientific expertise and the time it took to create the seeds. As
for the damage done to the UC crops, that amount could be hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed the Assembly 67 to 6 and now awaits
action in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Thomson's office said if the bill clears the
Senate and is signed by the governor, it would make California the
first state to create special penalties for vandalizing genetically
engineered crops.

 TECH 21: MORE VIRUSES DUE _ ARE YOU READY?  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last week's Killer Resume menace turned out to
be a bit overblown, but in view of the ``success'' _ from a virus
writer's perspective _ of previous attachment-borne worms like
Melissa and ILoveYou, it's safe to assume that others, possibly
even more dangerous, will be showing up soon.
</P>
<P>
   So if you care about your data and your time, doing what you can
to safeguard your system from such threats should be a top
priority. Unfortunately, even an up-to-date antivirus program won't
necessarily protect you, because the attachments these new bugs
travel in look like legitimate files; only until they've begun to
do their damage can antivirus engineers provide updates that
identify and destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   And with the emergence of ``complex polymorphic'' versions _
viruses that change some of their attributes each time they
replicate _ it's getting harder and harder for the guys in the
white hats to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   That's why computer-security experts recommend extreme caution
about attachments _ and why I wish people would stop sending them
when they could just as well put what they have to say in plain
text in the body of their message.
</P>
<P>
   I've gone so far as to set up my copy of Outlook so it
automatically fires off a nasty reply whenever it receives a
message with a file attached. It reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an autoreply to all messages containing attachments.
In the wake of Melissa and the Love Letter, it should be obvious
that such files are a menace to life as we know it. Unless you've
made prior arrangements with me to send an attachment, please put
what you want me to see into the body of your message _ a simple
copy and paste will do the trick _ then remove the attachment and
send the message again. If you don't, I'm probably not going to
read the attachment. (I couldn't care less about your fancy
formatting, so don't worry about that getting lost.)''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up Outlook to deliver this message was so complicated,
it would take more space than I have to explain how I did it. If
you want instructions on how to make your own version, e-mail me
and I'll send you a step-by-step guide.
</P>
<P>
   A better solution, though, is probably to install Microsoft's
Outlook E-mail Security Update, a patch for the company's Outlook
98 and Outlook 2000 programs that is designed specifically to
reduce the danger from these e-mailed viruses. Unfortunately, the
update is late _ it was originally slated for release the week of
May 22 _ but it may be out by the time you read this. You can
download it, or at least read the latest on its status, at
 &LR; officeupdate.microsoft.com/2000 &LR;   &LR; /articles/out2ksecarticle.htm. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Don't delay _ you owe it to yourself, to everyone listed in your
address book and to the community at large to do what you can to
stop this threat.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER KIND OF SELF-DEFENSE: Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard (soon
to be Stanford) professor who has emerged as a leading authority on
the new legal challenges of the Internet Age, weighed in on the
privacy issue with an interesting op-ed piece in Wednesday's Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that he shares the skepticism I expressed here last
week about the strategy pursued so far by the Federal Trade
Commission and most privacy advocates in the United States: trying
to pressure Web site operators to post ``privacy policies''
explaining what information they collect and what they do with it.
</P>
<P>
   As he puts it, ``More words won't advance privacy in cyberspace.
Consumers will simply ignore the clutter.'' He points out that many
sites already comply with the demand for posted policies _ with
pages that explain that the site operator intends to use the data
it collects about you to its own ``maximal commercial benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   But while I argued for the kind of solution Europe has adopted _
strong, clear laws limiting what kinds of information companies can
collect and what they can do with it _ Lessig doesn't have much
faith in this approach, at least in the American context. (He
doesn't spell out why in the Journal piece, but he does in ``The
Architecture of Privacy,'' an interesting, albeit 2-year-old, draft
essay posted on his Web site _
 &LR; cyber.law.harvard.edu/works/lessig/architecturepriv.pdf. &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he focuses on the technical aspects of the problem and
possible technical solutions. The very design of the Internet, he
writes, ``makes it extremely easy for data about individuals to be
collected and profiled'' and ``extremely difficult for individuals
to know that this profiling and tracking is taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution to a code problem, Lessig argues, is a ``better
code.'' Specifically, he points to the Platform for Privacy
Preferences, or P3P, a standard under development by the World Wide
Web Consortium that establishes a framework for standardized,
computer-readable privacy policies ( &LR; www.w3.org/P3P &LR; ). According to
Lessig, it ``would make it easy for companies to explain their
practices in a form that computers could read, and make it easy for
consumers to express their preferences in a way that computers
would automatically respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the fact that the standard isn't even complete yet,
I'm not convinced it gets to the root of the problem. After all, it
would be even easier for companies not to collect, sell or trade
personal information at all; the trouble is that they want to, and
I think they have to be compelled not to. Even Lessig admits his
plan is no substitute for strong privacy legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I see a lot of merit in his ``code'' approach, especially
given that there's little prospect of effective legislation passing
anytime soon. But I'm more intrigued by developing a ``better
code'' that doesn't depend on the good will of Web site operators.
</P>
<P>
   One such program that sounds promising is OptOut, written by
Steve Gibson _ the same programmer whose Shields Up security page
I've recommended previously. It's not complete yet, but a free,
limited preview is available now, and the full program, which
Gibson will sell at a price he hasn't yet disclosed, is due July 1.
</P>
<P>
   OptOut targets only one aspect of the privacy problem, but it is
one of the scariest: software that uses your Internet connection,
without your knowledge or explicit permission, to send information
about your system or your activities back to a Web site that you
previously visited.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson calls it ``spyware,'' and it is apparently more common
than you might think. Gibson is building a database of such
software. OptOut is just a 31-kilobyte application, and at the most
basic level all it does is check your PC for the presence of known
spyware programs and give you the option of removing them.
</P>
<P>
   The main OptOut page is at  &LR; grc.com/optout.htm &LR; . While you're
there, don't miss Gibson's mini-essay on ``The Ethics of Anonymous
Surveillance for Profit'' at  &LR; grc.com/oo/ethics.htm &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   THE GATE IN YOUR PALM: If you live, work or play in San
Francisco (or Boston, Chicago, New York or Washington), and you use
a Palm handheld _ or you're looking for an excuse to get one _
check out some nifty new software scheduled for release today by a
company called Vindigo.
</P>
<P>
   Packaged in separate editions for each city, the software is a
directory of restaurants, stores, movies and clubs. Two versions of
the San Francisco package are available _ one with restaurant
listings from Zagat, the well-known survey-based rating service,
the other with comparable data from The Chronicle and SFGate.com.
Both versions have nightlife listings from The Chronicle and
SFGate, plus a shopping directory provided by an outfit called
Inshop.com.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, New Yorkers and Washingtonians can choose between
versions with restaurant data from Zagat or the New York Times or
Washington Post, respectively. The New York edition has been out
since late March.
</P>
<P>
   The programs require a Palm III or later, or an equivalent unit
from a Palm OS licensee, with a minimum of 300 kilobytes of memory
free. The San Francisco version I've installed, with data from The
Chron and SFGate, takes up 330 kilobytes.
</P>
<P>
   Vindigo provides lots of useful ways to search and sort the
data, and it lets you add your own note, but two features in
particular really grabbed me:
</P>
<P>
   -- You start by telling it where you are (or intend to be), by
picking two intersecting streets from alphabetical lists.
Thereafter, at least by default, it lists restaurants in the
categories you specify by their distance from you. (If you prefer,
you can sort by name, cost or rating.) And for any place you're
interested in _ restaurant, store, theater or club _ you can tap on
a tab labeled ``Walk'' and get step-by-step directions for getting
there from the intersection you picked.
</P>
<P>
   -- The data is updated every time you synchronize your Palm with
a Windows PC that has an Internet connection. (Support for the Mac
is due later this month.) That's especially valuable for movies:
Assuming you connect to your PC regularly, it always has up-to-date
info about what's showing where and when.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the Vindigo software is totally free _ by the time

that appear in your Palm _ when you're reading about a restaurant,
you might get an ad from a nearby competitor. That makes me a

   A company called Landware ( &LR; www.landware.com &LR; ) has been offering
a Palm version of Zagat restaurant ratings for 11 cities since last
summer, but it used to charge $29.95 per city for the Zagat data;
last week, probably in anticipation of the Vindigo release,
Landware announced that it's now offering data for all 11 cities
for what was the price for one.
</P>
<P>
   But the Landware offering still doesn't include entertainment
and shopping listings, it's not updated regularly and it doesn't
deliver walking directions.

 AMD ADDS SOME JUICE TO NEW ATHLON CHIP  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advanced Micro Devices will launch a new version
of its Athlon processor Monday that could put the chip back in
front of Intel's Pentium III in the high-end PC performance race,
at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The new Athlon, code-named Thunderbird, will be available
immediately at clock speeds between 750 megahertz and 1 gigahertz,
or 1,000 megahertz. Although AMD has been shipping Athlons at
similar speeds since March, the new ones will deliver better
performance in many applications because they incorporate 256
kilobytes of performance-enhancing ``Level 2,'' or L2, cache memory
directly on the chip.
</P>
<P>
   Previous Athlons came with twice as much L2 cache memory _ 512
kilobytes _ but it was located on separate chips, not on the
processor itself; that slowed down the processor's access to the
data and instructions stored in the L2 cache.
</P>
<P>
   Now that this memory is built into the chip, the chip will be
able to retrieve such information at full speed. In most situations
that makes overall performance faster, despite the smaller size of
the new on-chip cache.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's Pentium III processors have had on-chip L2 cache since
last October. That advantage enabled them to outperform Athlons
running at the same clock speed in many performance benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Athlon has a superior microarchitecture, but it wasn't
outperforming the Pentium III the way it should have,'' said Keith
Diefendorff, editor in chief of the Microprocessor Report, an
influential industry newsletter. ``In fact, AMD was getting its
clocked cleaned in a lot of benchmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   The off-chip cache was the biggest reason for this performance
shortfall, so the new design should fix most of the problem,
Diefendorff said. ``I don't expect any huge changes in market
share, but it should make AMD a little more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantage could be only temporary, though. In the fourth
quarter, Intel is scheduled to release a new version of the
Pentium, code-named Willamette, that will ``go clearly ahead in
clock frequency and maybe in overall performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunnyvale, Calif.'s AMD continues to produce some Athlon chips
with the older cache design, but will gradually switch over to the
new version, according to spokesman Byran Longmire. The transition
should be complete by the end of September, he added. The new
version will be identified in packaging and advertising by a yellow
starburst logo with the words ``performance-enhancing cache
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the Athlon has been ``very strong,'' but AMD is
keeping pace, Longmire said. The chip has brought the company new
business from several PC makers _ most notably Gateway _ because
Intel has been unable to meet demand for its Pentium III chips.
</P>
<P>
   In April, AMD reported its best quarter ever, including sales of
more than $1 billion and net income of $189 million, well above
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new Athlons will be made at an AMD plant in Austin,
Texas, but others will come from the company's new,
state-of-the-art production facility in Dresden, Germany. While
chips from Austin will, like traditional microprocessors, use
aluminum for their internal wiring, Athlons made in Dresden will
use copper instead.
</P>
<P>
   While that approach improves yields at high clock frequencies,
Diefendorff said, the advantage is only marginal with current
``.18-micron'' production technologies; the real benefit will come
over the next year or two, as the industry moves to .15- and
.13-micron processes.
</P>
<P>
   Intel isn't expected to begin producing copper-based chips until
sometime next year. AMD's head start, Diefendorff said, will give
it more learning time with the new material, which involves
significant changes in production technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, Intel is very, very good at these things,''
he said. ``I'm not betting it will be a problem for them.''

BELCHER CLOSE TO RETURNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The stalwart performance turned in by the
Anaheim Angels' bullpen in Sunday's 8-7 victory against the Dodgers
wasn't enough to shift questions away from the starting rotation,
which has had only two pitchers healthy for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   The starter closest to returning is Tim Belcher, who is
scheduled to come off the 60-day disabled list and make his first
rehab start for Triple-A Edmonton today. He is expected to make two
starts in the minors and may be ready to pitch for the Angels as
early as June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield and Scott Schoeneweis have been the only
healthy starters for the duration of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically lost our starting rotation, and we're slowly
rebuilding with Ken Hill, Tim Belcher and Jason Dickson getting
healthy,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``We're looking for them to
come back and contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   One starting pitcher the Angels aren't worried about is Jarrod
Washburn, who experienced tightness in his shoulder that forced him
out of his last start on May 29 after five innings. Washburn had a
poor outing against the Dodgers on Sunday, giving up seven runs on
eight hits and five walks, but his shoulder is fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no problem,'' Washburn said. ``It wasn't that bad. I
took some anti-inflammatory medicine and got some treatment, and
that knocked it right out.''
</P>
<P>
   Movin' on down: Second baseman Adam Kennedy was on a tear after
he joined the Angels at the beginning of the season, but his
numbers (.276, 4 homers, 30 RBI) have leveled off considerably.
</P>
<P>
   With Kevin Stocker's addition to the roster on June 2, Scioscia
saw the opportunity to move Kennedy, a Cal State Northridge
product, to the No. 9 spot in the batting order with Stocker taking
over the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rookie I think he was pressing a little bit, so we made
the decision to drop him down in the order and hopefully that will
help him relax,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said Stocker's higher on-base percentage (.386-.322),
along with his veteran status, made him a better fit for the No. 2
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Stocker said he's been No. 2 in the lineup less than 15 times at
the major-league level but did hit there regularly in the minors.
After Sunday's game, in which he scored the winning run, he said he
would bat in any position but feels confident about being No.2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an idea when I go up to the plate about what the
two-hole is,'' Stocker said. ``You have (Mo) Vaughn behind you and
(Darin) Erstad in front of you, which is a pretty good combination
to be sandwiched between. In certain situations I know I can take
pitches. With Mo behind me, guys are going to try to come after me
and I'd see more fastballs than if I was batting in the ninth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to put me in the four hole, that's fine.''

LAKERS GIVE L.A. QUITE A SCARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For their climactic matinee debate Sunday against the Portland
Trail Blazers, the Los Angeles Lakers had all the factors aligned
in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   They were playing at their gleaming new edifice, the Staples
Center, in front of a frenzied crowd emblazoned in gold ``I Love
LA'' tee-shirts supplied by a local television station.
</P>
<P>
   They had not lost three consecutive games the entire season, and
they were coming off two consecutive losses to the Trail Blazers in
this best-of-seven Western Conference championship series.
</P>
<P>
   They had the NBA's Most Valuable Players, Shaquille O'Neal on
their side, as well as Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Denzel
Washington, Samuel L.Jackson, Steven Speilberg, Dyan Cannon and
various other celebs set to give them vocal support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to win,'' said the Laker owner, Jerry
Buss, moments before game time as he sat serenely in his luxury box
suite. ``I felt nervous before the fifth and six games when we
could have clinched the series. But I feel calm today because this
team always wins when it has to.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Jerry Buss was right.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did win, as they were supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   They beat the Trail Blazers 89-84 to advance to the NBA finals
against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   But not before giving the entire Los Angeles basin one colossal,
gigantic, exasperating heart seizure/nervous
breakdown/hyperventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Whew!
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure ol' Doc Buss thought the Lakers would be struggling
mightily for the first 36 minutes---only to play some of the most
memorable basketball in their glorious history during the final 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, near the end of the third quarter when they trailed by a
71-55 score, the Lakers were on the threshold of enduring the
latest humiliation on an L.A. athletic scene that in recent years
has seen two NFL franchises, the Raiders and Rams, depart, two
baseball teams, the Dodgers and Angels, bumble and bumble, two
hockey teams, the Kings and Mighty Ducks, seldom qualify for the
playoffs, and one NBA team, the Clippers, become national
laughingstocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers had gone on an 18-2 spree during that period,
and the Lakers seemed destined to end their season in the same
disappointing manner they had the past three years since Shaquille
O'Neal joined the team.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as though the Lakers were going to suffer the most
bitter loss since that infamous Game 7 flameout against Bill
Russell and the Boston Celtics in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as though the Lakers were going to be victimized by
the dreaded L.A. Athletic Funk, as the Trail Blazers were doing the
impossible---making Shaquille O'Neal disappear for most of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is set up for Shaq in this game,'' said an
interested observer, Magic Johnson, beforehand. ``He'll have the
crowd on his side. This is the perfect time to prove his greatness,
and to prove that he belongs among the great players in NBA
history.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the game Shaquille O'Neal was reduced to being
nothing more than the tallest spectator at the Staples Center,
especially during that horrendous third period when he took only
two shots and scored nary a point.
</P>
<P>
   There were even some fans headed for the exit as that quarter
came to a conclusion, with the Laker reserve guard, Brian Shaw,
drilling a three-pointer to draw his team within 13 (71-58).
</P>
<P>
   But then a strange thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace, Scottie Pippen, Steve Smith and all those other
doughty Trail Blazers began missing shots, one after another, an
incredible 13 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers came storming back, as they have throughout a
season when they posted the best regular season record, 67-15, and
then scuttled Sacramento and Phoenix in the earlier playoff rounds
before coming up against the resilient Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw kept making three pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, the 21 year-old prodigy who recently gave his
Marina High fiancee a mere $100,000 engagement ring, continued to
be a whirlwind all over the court, as he scored points, grabbed
rebounds, handed out assists and energized his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, Shaquille O'Neal, silenced the previous three
quarters by Portland's double and triple teaming tactics, came
alive, making important baskets and free throws and grabbing vital
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   And, with 42 seconds left, with the Lakers holding a 4-point
lead (83-79), with the audience roaring wildly, with the Trail
Blazers stunned, Kobe Bryant lofted a pass above the basket toward
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   And Shaquille O'Neal, who has accomplished everything in the NBA
but win a world championship, who has had to live with the
can't-win-the-big-ones label that Wilt Chamberlain once had to live
with, grabbed the ball with one hand and slammed it ferociously
through the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' trauma was over.
</P>
<P>
   They had achieved a stirring comeback for the sporting ages.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had qualified for the finals for the first time since
1991 when they faced the Chicago Bulls, and they have a chance to
win their first NBA title since 1988 when they beat the Detroit
Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of fun out there,'' said Kobe Bryant after his
25-point, 11-rebound, 7-assist masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   But I doubt all those beleaguered L.A. fans had much fun until
that final period when the Lakers went on their glorious 31-13
spree to spare themselves wide-spread ridicule and spare their
followers a summer of terrible heartbreak.
