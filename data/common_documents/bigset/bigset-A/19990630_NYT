Raptors told no on Olajuwon deal
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JONATHAN FEIGEN &QL; 
All things considered, the Rockets just couldn't bring themselves
to trade Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with a chance to rebuild that might not come again,
the Rockets mulled the Toronto Raptors' offer of two lottery picks
plus Kevin Willis and Doug Christie in exchange for Olajuwon, a
12-time All-Star and franchise cornerstone. The Raptors were even
willing to tweak the offer almost any way they could.
</P>
<P>
   But after one last meeting Tuesday morning, the Rockets broke
off negotiations, with coach Rudy Tomjanovich unable to bring
himself to deal the player who had been so central to the success
of the only team for which either has been employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any deal involving Hakeem Olajuwon would be very difficult for
me to make, because I have an emotional tie to him,'' said
Tomjanovich, who confirmed there had been trade talks. ``That's
just the way it is. That's just the way I am. I believe in
(loyalty). We've been through a lot together. I would hope that
situation doesn't come along.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon said he would have opposed a trade and was relieved it
did not go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a great deal to me to finish my career in Houston,''
he said. ``It has been the whole story, from college to now, and it
seems this is a right way for it to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich and Rockets vice president Carroll Dawson
characterized the trade talks as typical of the business,
especially in the days leading up to today's NBA draft. But the
discussions with Toronto could be considered different from most
trade negotiations because they involved Olajuwon and were not
immediately dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said forms of Toronto's offer had been pondered for
almost two weeks, with variations including as many as 11 players
or draft picks. The transfer to the Rockets of Willis, Christie and
the fifth and 12th picks in today's draft were a constant
throughout the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer exactly the details of the deal,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``They were interested. It never got to do-or-die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was talk. It was never a concrete deal. I will admit there
was talk. There was strong interest there.''
</P>
<P>
   As late as 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, when conversations among Rockets
officials broke up, a definitive decision had not been reached.
</P>
<P>
   But with owner Leslie Alexander on the phone from New York,
Tomjanovich, Dawson and team vice president Robert Barr met at
Westside Tennis Club later Tuesday morning, and the decision was
made to end negotiations with the Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Olajuwon called Tomjanovich and was told the
trade would not be made. Toronto vice president and general manager
Glen Grunwald then announced that while there had been talks, the
deal was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached them about it,'' Grunwald said. ``They thought
about it but ultimately said no. The right package couldn't be
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich, however, did not blame the package for scotching
the trade talks. It was simply a matter of the Rockets not wanting
to part with the greatest player ever to wear their uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toronto was interested in Dream. There were talks. They were
told no,'' Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always talk,'' he added. ``That's just the way it is.
That's just the way of the league. Everybody has to do their job.
We have a department that listens to things. That's just business.
You have to do that. People are going to talk to you. We have no
control over what other people want. This thing is just talk. We
would not be doing our job if we did not listen to all kinds of
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a chance to talk to Dream and tell him this was not
a deal and how I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's Most Valuable Player in 1993-94 and the NBA Finals
MVP in 1994 and 1995, Olajuwon is the Rockets' all-time leader in
seasons of service, games, minutes, points, rebounds, steals,
blocked shots, free throws made, free throws attempted, field goals
made and field goals attempted. This past season, he averaged 18.9
points (making 51.4 percent of his shots), 9.6 rebounds and 2.46
blocked shots per game.
</P>
<P>
   And Dawson indicated he is still held in the highest regard
despite the fact Rockets officials considered potential deals with
the Raptors enticing because of the opportunity to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't make you unattached to somebody,'' Dawson said.
``I can't tell you how many times I've stood up for the national
anthem with the guy. I've spent the biggest part of my life with
this franchise, and he's been here 15 of those years. If you're a
human being, you're emotionally going to get attached.''
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday morning, after marathon meetings to consider every
piece of information available, that one sentiment made the other
considerations moot. It also sent the Rockets looking elsewhere for
ways to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do is look at all the options and consider all
options,'' Tomjanovich said. ``That's the draft, free agency and
trades. It's always been like that.''

NELSON'S GAMBLE APPEARS TO BE A WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He told us this draft was going to be a dry hole, and who are we
to doubt Don Nelson? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't answer that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' mad scientist stood at a microphone 12 months ago
and shrugged away his draft-night decision to trade away the team's
No. 1 1999 pick. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad draft next year,'' Dr. Nelsonstein predicted with breezy
certainty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there wasn't an amateur basketball player on the
Planet Earth who Nellie thought could help his woeful Mavericks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We laughed. Nelson drove off into the summer sunset, headed to
some beach or U2 concert. And we sat back and waited for the
Phoenix Suns to make the No. 1 lottery pick _ the Mavericks'
longtime dream one _ in the 1999 NBA draft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Except it didn't happen, did it? The Suns will draft ninth in
tonight's first round, which is exactly the limbo perch where the
Mavericks always seemed to end up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are no Tim Duncans on the draft lists. The player who
might well end up getting picked first, Lamar Odom, keeps dodging
doctors and job interviews. And at least five teams like tonight's
first-round pickings so much, they want out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be eight, maybe nine decent players,'' Nelson
said on draft eve. ``But it's a crapshoot.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was right _ 12 months ago. The draft stinks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Odom went to three high schools in four years, trying to stay
one step ahead of the registrar's office. He also performed the
seemingly impossible by getting booted out of Nevada-Las Vegas.
Then, he tried to renounce his decision to declare for the NBA
draft and return to the University of Rhode Island, where he
apparently seldom attended classes or took tests in the first
place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, good luck in Vancouver,'' university officials wisely
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Bulls general manager Jerry Krause has said that Odom
won't return his phone calls. The Charlotte Hornets had an
interview scheduled with Odom, and he neglected to show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Nellie said _ a crapshoot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Normally, he would be right there, rolling the dice. But due to
previous dalliances, Dr. Nelsonstein is out of playing chips.
Unless, of course, somebody wants to take John ``Hot Rod'' Williams
off his hands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quit laughing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nellie told us, and he was right. This year's draft is so
diluted by defections, only two seniors _ Utah's Andre Miller and
Miami of Ohio's Wally Szczerbiak _ are expected to be selected in
the first 13 picks of the draft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the defectors, Jonathan Bender, comes to the NBA straight
from his high school prom in the worldly capital of Picayune, Miss.
Another ``project,'' center Aleksandar Radojevic, could get drafted
in tonight's top 10 _ or next week by the Yugoslavian army. Yet
another expected high pick, Duke's Corey Maggette, couldn't even
crack his college team's starting lineup. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And these are likely first-round guys that the Mavericks weren't
going to get, anyway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, you've got to give the first round picks a
three-year contract,'' Nelson mused. ``That's why I wouldn't be
surprised if one of these years, some teams are just going to
decline to draft.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of those teams is very likely to be Team Nelson. The draft,
in its time-honored forms, seems to bore Dr. Nelsonstein. He would
rather be trading a cow for somebody's bag of beans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, this could have been the year when Nellie might have
wheeled and dealed his way to the top. The Bulls reportedly
wouldn't mind trading the draft's No. 1 pick. Even Nelson's phone
has been ringing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of first-round picks available,'' he said.
``There are a lot of teams trying not to draft in the first
round.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks will select seventh in the second round, 36th
overall, and then again at No. 40. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities were so varied and vague, Nelson declined to
invite any draft prospects in for closer scrutiny. Instead, he
suggests that the team's Nos. 36 and 40 picks may be dispatched to
Europe for feeding and finishing and, maybe one day, the NBA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That would probably be the best scenario for us,'' Nelson said
yesterday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't see himself being intrigued by any of the first-round
offers that have been floating around. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever want to say never,'' Nellie said, ``but it just
doesn't look like I'll be doing anything like that at this
point.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said the pickings would be slim 12 months ago. When we
scoffed, he shrugged and said the Mavericks were going to be so
improved, they wouldn't be a lottery team anyway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nelsonstein, as it turns out, was half-right. The operation
continues. &QL;

EDMONDS PLAYS WAITING GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Jim Edmonds wants to play this year. But the center
fielder, who had surgery on his right shoulder April 19, also knows
he might not be able to play until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had surgery they told me I might not play at all this
year,'' he said. ``I have to think about playing the next six or
seven years, not just this year.''
</P>
<P>
   While he knows he must be patient, he still wants to help the
1999 club. The team is last in the American League in a variety of
offensive categories, including runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds said the biggest concern with his shoulder involves
swinging the bat. But if he gets the OK to begin baseball
activities _ mid-to late-August at the earliest _ he plans to be
ready to join the lineup quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I stay (with the club) and take a lot of batting practice,
hopefully I'll get enough swings I don't have to stay long in a
rehab assignment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue will be where the team is in the standings. If the
Angels are out of the race, there's no reason for Edmonds to rush
back to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm in shape and ready to play, I want to play,'' he said.
``So we'll have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Swimming upstream: Right fielder Tim Salmon arrives at the
ballpark every day, does the rehab work on his sprained left wrist
and goes home.
</P>
<P>
   He was hitting .347 with seven homers and 25 RBI on May 3 when
he tried to make a sliding catch of Paul Konerko's sinking liner in
a game against the White Sox. The resulting wrist injury has kept
him out ever since, even though he thought he'd only miss a few
days at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past the point of frustration _ we're two months into
this,'' he said. ``But it's scarring, so that means it's healing.''
</P>
<P>
   That also means there's no reason to have surgery, though
there's still no telling when he'll be ready.
</P>
<P>
   How desperately do the Angels need him? Going into Tuesday's
game, the Angels hitting in the cleanup spot had a total of six RBI
in June.
</P>
<P>
   Small favors: At least the Angels have shortstop Gary DiSarcina
back. Even though DiSarcina went into Tuesday's game hitting only
.188 (3 for 16) and says it feels like spring training for him, he
is recognized as a team leader on the field and in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, he's still working on some things,'' manager
Terry Collins said. ``Defensively he's fine. He's getting his legs
in shape. I think he'll be OK when we come out of the (All-Star)
break.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina missed the first 68 games of the season with a broken
bone in his left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Hard times: Critics of Collins say he's never won anything as a
manager. But he's been close. In all five major-league seasons
(three in Houston, two in Anaheim), his teams have finished in
second place. That's why this year has been so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough, it's been very tough,'' he said. ``I've never
been in last place before. We've struggled, but you've got to climb
your way out of it. It's what we're going to do. You just keep
playing and playing and playing until there aren't any more
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: The Angels and Rangers finish their three-game series
tonight beginning at 7:35. Ken Hill (3-7, 4.97 ERA) will start for
Anaheim against Texas' Ryan Glynn (1-2, 7.46).

MONDESI DROPPED TO SIXTH IN ORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ When Dodgers right fielder Raul Mondesi was yanked
from the clean-up spot in Milwaukee in late April, he made his
displeasure known.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of one of his worst slumps, Mondesi again was
dropped from fourth in the order. But this time it wasn't to fifth.
For the first time since a pair of at-bats during the 1997 season,
Mondesi, who homered once in 96 at-bats heading into Tuesday's game
at San Diego, batted sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes during Mondesi's longest home run drought of the
season _ 58 at-bats. The swoon has dropped his average to .261,
though he still leads the Dodgers with 19 homers and 50 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's struggling,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said,
understating the obvious. ``I love the guy. But I don't think he's
hit a home run for three weeks and he's probably hitting under
.200. I can't take him out of the lineup, but I can move him.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros batted fourth. Mondesi's last homer came June 8
against Texas. He didn't want to talk about the drop in the order,
saying he said all he had to say on that April day. But he clearly
wasn't happy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Johnson won't sit by and watch a stagnant offense any
longer, especially since June is traditionally Mondesi's strongest
month. In the last five seasons, he's batted .318 in June, but so
far this month he's hitting .205 (18 for 88) with one homer, six
RBI and a .263 on-base percentage. This after Mondesi hit .264 with
eight homers and 17 RBI in May and .305 with 10 homers and 27 RBI
in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever mix works for the ballclub, that's what I care
about,'' Johnson said. ``I just want what works.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping it in the Park: Chan Ho Park and pitching coach Claude
Osteen talked in the hotel about what's been going on with the
right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   The topics weren't limited to Park's 19 home runs allowed, or
his 32/3 innings pitched in Sunday's start at San Francisco. They
also discussed Park's pitch selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going to hit him if he goes to the location he's
going to,'' Osteen said. ``A very small percentage of home runs
come off good pitches. It's not only bad pitches, it's bad
location.''
</P>
<P>
   Osteen said mechanics aren't the reason why Park is 4-6 with a
5.54 ERA, especially after watching him throw in the bullpen.
Osteen said Park throws on the side with pinpoint accuracy to all
areas of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Osteen offered the three-run homer J.T. Snow hit as a
perfect example of what's wrong with Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.T. Snow can be jammed, and the scouting report says that,''
Osteen said. ``But you can't jam anyone with two runners on with
the first pitch. Good hitters have to be set up before they go to
what I call the joy spot. He's thinking of the scouting report,
which is J.T. Snow can be jammed.''
</P>
<P>
   F.Y.I.: Todd Hollandsworth started in center field in place of
Devon White (stiff neck). It's Hollandsworth's third straight start
and fifth in six games.... In 74 games, the Dodgers have used 54
different lineups.... Sunday's game against the San Francisco
Giants, to be followed by fireworks, is sold out.... Brennan King,
the Dodgers' second pick in this year's amateur draft out of
Oakland High in Murfreesboro, Tenn., was named to USA Today's
All-USA high school baseball team.

PITCHING CHANGES IN WORKS; MECHE COMING UP FROM TACOMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ For months, the Mariners have held to one philosophy
on the subject of their coveted pitching prospects. They would not
part with a Ryan Anderson, Gil Meche or Joel Pineiro unless they
got a top young major-leaguer in return.
</P>
<P>
   But several factors might be changing that approach: the
performance of rookies Freddy Garcia and John Halama; the Mariners'
standing in the American League West race; and the impending
promotion of Meche from Class AAA Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the M's believe they already have identified
several young (and affordable) pitchers with big-league staying
power, but they might not be able to win the division without
another veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this type of trade, it all depends on who you're getting
back,'' said Woody Woodward, Mariners vice president for baseball
operations. ``I wouldn't rule out anything. If we're in the pennant
race after this tough road trip and we go into the All-Star break
right in it like we are, I wouldn't rule out anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But just because he could be more willing to part with a
prospect doesn't make it any more desirable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make it any easier, not from where I sit,''
Woodward said. ``It just shows me if you get the right young
pitcher, they can get the job done. You have to give them the
chance, and stay with them once in a while when they fail.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the plan with Meche, the Mariners' No. 1 pick in the 1996
draft, who will be promoted from Class AAA to start in Anaheim on
Tuesday. He will replace Paul Abbott, who will be moved to a set-up
relief role. Frankie Rodriguez will make a spot start in Abbott's
place Thursday in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Meche isn't the only pitcher coming. Left-hander Jordan
Zimmerman joined the team Tuesday and another 24-year-old lefty,
Damaso Marte, will be promoted Wednesday. Veteran left-hander Allen
Watson was released to make room for Zimmerman, and right-hander
Melvin Bunch is expected to be sent down when Marte arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Marte, who started 87 of his 104 professional games, will be
more of a long reliever while Zimmerman will be the Mariners'
left-handed specialist. Carrying only one left-hander, as the M's
have for much of this season, is hard to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is,'' said manager Lou Piniella. ``You use one for a
couple of innings, and now you don't have one the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche's arrival likely will mean the Mariners carry 12 pitchers.
If that happens, outfielder Charles Gipson would most likely be
sent down. Jay Buhner's status might be unchanged by then; Piniella
said the M's might wait until after the All-Star break to activate
the outfielder from the disabled list, where he's been with a
hamstring strain since mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   The progress of Meche has been one of the most pleasant
developments in the organization this year. During a rough road
trip in early May, when Piniella first floated the idea of bringing
up the Mariners' best prospects, Woodward was watching Meche pitch
at a Class AA game in Portland, Maine. He liked what he saw, and
soon Meche was promoted to Tacoma, where he has gone 2-2 with a
3.24 earned run average in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   His Monday start was scheduled to be a short one, which would
put Meche on schedule to make a final Tacoma start Thursday before
facing the Angels Tuesday. But a line drive off his right forearm
made it even shorter, and Meche left after 25 pitches. Woodward
said the forearm is fine, though the ball ricocheted to Meche's
left thumb, which is giving him trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The injury is not considered serious, and Meche's overall
performance has convinced the Mariners to give the 20-year-old a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the pitches to pitch up here at this age,'' Woodward
said. ``The only concern is not to bring him up before he's had
enough starts at triple-A.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche's poise, long considered one of his best assets, also
helped his cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has to go into it,'' Woodward said. ``It's more than on
the field, it's how a guy deals with everything around the big
leagues. That goes into it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Mariners keep trying to find the right mix of
pitchers, they clearly hope they're not done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're changing things around a little bit, with the idea of
giving our better young arms a chance,'' Piniella said. ``And we'll
continue to look for a little experience if we can find it.''

EAGLES CHAPTER IN WASHINGTON TOWN BEING SUED FOR EXCLUDING WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MAGGIE LEUNG AND JUDI HUNT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Liberty, truth, justice and equality _ those are the
Fraternal Order of Eagles' cornerstones. But how the Eagles define
equality _ gender equality, at least _ has provoked a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest Women's Law Center is suing the Eagles in Thurston
County (Wash.) Superior Court for refusing to let women become
voting members of the social and service club.
</P>
<P>
   Directly affected are the 53 women already in the chapter at
Tenino, which had its charter suspended. Tenino is about 10 miles
south of Olympia, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' national leadership defends its ban on women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delegates voted that way,'' Grand Secretary Robert Wahls
said by telephone from Columbus, Ohio. ``Most agreed that it (a ban
on female members) should remain _ that there's no need to change
it, because it's been that way for 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That tradition clashes with Washington state's law against
discrimination based on race, sex, national origin, religion and
disability, said Lisa Stone, executive director of the Northwest
Women's Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Eagles' leaders declined comment or were unavailable
Tuesday. But the organization's own legal advisory panel determined
in late 1995 that the Eagles were required to admit women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts have consistently upheld legislation designed to
prevent discriminatory membership policies in private clubs when
such policies are based solely on gender,'' the Eagles' Justices of
the Grand Tribunal found. ``Given these interpretations, our
fraternal laws must then yield to prevailing civil law.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Eagles let women become full members. That
change was short-lived, however. In 1998, delegates at the Eagles'
national convention in Spokane ignored the tribunal's opinion and
banned full memberships for women.
</P>
<P>
   That decision has set some Eagles' chapters against the national
leadership. In January, the international organization threatened
to revoke the charters of chapters that continued to admit women.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Tenino chapter's charter was suspended for
admitting women.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Tenino chapter President-elect Janet Tresenriter
promised to fight: ``What we're saying is they can't just decide
they don't want us anymore without facing a tough fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going into the year 2000, and it's silly for men to want
things to stay like they were in the 1800s. They can't keep women
in their place anymore. We won't stand for being second-class
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest Women's Law Center is suing on behalf of the
Tenino chapter, Tresenriter and several other female members.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three of the chapter's 720 members are women, Tresenriter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing, too, because six of them are officers,''
she said. ``If we weren't, those offices would be empty.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is shared by the Lion's Club, said Jim Knight, one
of its district governors. The Lion's Club started admitting women
about 10 years ago, and Knight is enthusiastic about their
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They filled a void in the membership,'' he said. ``They fill
many different jobs. They're extremely involved, capable and
helpful. I'd hate to see the Lion's Club organization without
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Lion's Clubs include female members, because membership
to the service organization is by invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are chapters where a lot of old-timers say, `We're not
going to have women at this Lion's Club!''' But some of them later
turn out to be the biggest supporters of female members, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, founded in 1898 in Seattle, has more than 1,700
chapters nationwide and in Canada. The organization, which includes
a women's auxiliary, raises money for charities and offers places
to socialize, including restaurants, bars and sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
   National and internationally, other social and service
organizations _ such as the Rotary Club, the Jaycees, the Elks _
include men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with slipping membership, some _ such as the Lion's Club _
have thrown open their doors. And courts have pried open doors at
others, such as the Jaycees and the Elks, which have lost
gender-discrimination suits in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   As for the legal ramifications of the national organization's
ban on women, the Eagles' leadership hasn't discussed it, Grand
Secretary Wahls said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said no other chapters are in hot water with the
leadership over female members. But the Olympia chapter, which has
eight women, recently had its charter suspended. The national
organization cited reasons other than membership.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Tenino and Olympia, five other area chapters have
female members _ two in Seattle and one each in South Whidbey
Island, Spokane Valley and White Center, south of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Olympia suspension, ``We're still open and business
is thriving at the restaurant and bar,'' said manager Nick Hewing.
``It was just ... a way of making us an example because we didn't
listen to orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewing said the Eagles suspended Olympia's charter on grounds
that the chapter was insolvent. ``But we're not insolvent, we don't
owe any money and most interestingly, they never sent us anything
in writing so we could prove it was our women members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest Women's Law Center suit seeks to revive female
membership, to protect the Tenino's chapter charter. The suit also
asked for unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is set for July 9 in Thurston County Superior Court.

HOME OFFERED AS PRIZE TO RAISE MONEY FOR INVESTIGATION OF SON'S
DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, Mo. _ Ducks parade by a still pond. A pair of mutts
playfully bound toward the water to stir up catfish. The view from
the back porch is the picture of tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Darrell and Arlyne Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too hard to stay here,'' she said. ``Too many
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Mitch Krupp, helped build their country home eight
years ago. When Krupp visited, he would start fishing long before
his parents, or the sun, would rise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Krupp died in a mysterious house fire in Winslow, Ark.
The Barneses buried his ashes under an oak tree on a hill
overlooking the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Now they hope their home will give them answers to Krupp's
death. They are giving away their house, 140 miles southeast of
Kansas City, in a contest. They want to raise money for legal bills
and an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   For $100, entrants can submit an essay about why they deserve
the house. The Barneses need 1,850 entries. So far, they have
received about 500, including several from Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is an unusual idea, born from desperation.
</P>
<P>
   On July 26, 1997, Arlyne Barnes received a call about 4 a.m.
Krupp's wife, Pam, said their house had burned. Pam said Krupp, 29,
could not be found.
</P>
<P>
   The Barneses raced to Arkansas. When they reached the house,
they saw nothing but ashes. The couple's van was a black shell.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fire, Pam had checked herself into a hospital
psychiatric ward. Pam told authorities that Krupp had been suicidal
and violent toward her. Authorities say Pam told them after the
fire that Krupp had warned of burning the house down.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell and Arlyne Barnes didn't believe her.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Arkansas have few answers. Krupp's death
certificate lists the cause as ``undetermined,'' not a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is still open,'' said Capt. Chuck Rexford of the
Washington County Sheriff's Department. ``I don't want to say any
more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   That answer doesn't satisfy the Barneses.
</P>
<P>
   They don't know exactly what happened, but they are confident
their son didn't kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   Their suspicions center on his widow, now Pam Worrell. They say
she showed no remorse and note that she remarried just weeks after
Krupp's death.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell has sued Arlyne Barnes, alleging defamation of
character. In her counterclaim, Arlyne filed a wrongful-death
lawsuit against Worrell.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are also fighting in court over Krupp's insurance
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Rexford told an Arkansas newspaper that he has not found enough
evidence to implicate any suspects. A county judge, in awarding the
insurance money to Worrell, said there wasn't enough evidence to
show she was responsible for Krupp's death.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell declined to be interviewed, but issued a statement that
expressed sympathy for Arlyne Barnes but added that ``her belief as
to the manner and cause of death is unsupported by evidence
collected by the law enforcement agencies and determinations by the
state Medical Examiner's office.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Barneses, who both receive disability payments, their
legal bills now exceed $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   With their debts growing, they found inspiration in a movie,
``The Spitfire Grill.'' In the film, the owners of a small-town
cafe raise money by holding a contest to win the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnes family decided to do the same. The Missouri attorney
general's office says the contest is legal, provided there is no
element of chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Barneses thought a contest would be easier than selling the
house, which they initially tried to do. They took the house off
the market after two months.
</P>
<P>
   They hoped the three-bedroom home, which includes an indoor pool
on a 25-acre tract, would have contestants flocking.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the best-laid plans don't work out,'' said Darrell
Barnes, Krupp's stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had to extend the deadline from June 15 until Sept.
15. Still, there is no guarantee they will get enough entries. If
they don't reach 1,850, they will return all entry fees.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy. A few years ago, owners of an Olathe coffeehouse
and a Mission cafe failed to attract enough contestants in similar
contests to win their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the Barneses' contest has created an unlikely side effect.
</P>
<P>
   Entrants are sharing their own tragedies, from terminal
illnesses to unsolved slayings. Others send inspirational messages,
including Bible verses and poetry. Several have entered creative
essays, such as a ``scrapbook'' with the entrants' photos pasted
over pictures of the house.
</P>
<P>
   One of the entrants, James Weese of Kansas City, grew up on a
farm outside Bolivar, Mo. His family lost the property when he was
a child.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Jerry, promised their mother that he would get the
farm back for her. He died in a house fire last year before he
could make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Weese entered the contest to win the house for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty sad. I'd like to help the (Barnes) family out
because it sounds like they need it,'' Weese said. ``I also want to
try to fulfill my brother's dream, since he couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One girl from Arkansas sent $3 and a sympathetic note.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I don't know you,'' the girl wrote in careful
penmanship, ``I can say that if it were at all possible, I would
take your grief upon myself to relieve you from it.''
</P>
<P>
   A panel of 12 local volunteers will judge the essays on
originality, sincerity, inspiration and desire. Essays can be no
longer than 500 words. The Barneses will have no hand in the
judging.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sorting the entries isn't easy. Arlyne Barnes files them
on her computer and keeps a packed cardboard box of papers in her
study.
</P>
<P>
   She has never doubted that the hard work is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you feel that first kick in your womb, unless you've felt
that, there's no way to explain it. Then you think of all the
memories: the first day of school, his first prom,'' Barnes said as
tears started flowing. ``Then to have your son handed to you in a
box, how can you just let that go?
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe it to him to do all I can.''

ONCE AGAIN, AREA RESIDENTS WRINGING OUT AFTER FLOODING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE LAMOY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The sunshine, moderate temperature and gentle
breeze Tuesday couldn't erase the destruction left by Monday's
heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   From western Kansas City, Kan., to eastern Kansas City,
residents mopped mud-caked floors and hauled ruined household goods
from damp basements.
</P>
<P>
   And the metropolitan area still wasn't getting an all-clear, as
weather forecasters predicted more rain Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If rain does fall, the conditions are ripe for more flooding,
said Mike Doll, a forecast meteorologist for WeatherData Inc. in
Wichita. ``The ground is pretty saturated,'' Doll said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the weekend should be dry but hot and humid.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, most people in flooded areas were more concerned
about what had already happened. In some areas, rage had supplanted
raging waters.
</P>
<P>
   Among those particularly upset:
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the Argentine area of Kansas City, Kan., who were
cleaning up for the second time in a year. Hard hit were about 30
homes immediately north of Argentine Boulevard between 34th and
42nd streets. The same area was deluged by rains Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``After October, our city officials told us they'd taken care of
everything and it would never happen again,'' said Joe Abarca,
standing among soaked carpets and muddy furniture in the front yard
of his house in the 1100 block of South 38th Street. ``It's like
we're here by ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the area of 40th Street and Oakley Avenue, who were
mopping their basements and repairing cars that had floated down
streets. Water flowing from three directions gathered in the
low-lying area Monday and overwhelmed the sewer system.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents complained that city officials, including City
Council members, had not returned their phone calls. Bettye Pearson
said she contacted several offices at City Hall before she found
someone who could help. The city's sewer maintenance division had
been scheduled to clean a drainage pipe near Pearson's home Monday,
but a city official said Tuesday afternoon that because of the
flood it would be two to three weeks before workers could get to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners along Southwest Boulevard in Kansas City, Kan.
Ruby Morlan, owner of Dagwood's Cafe, was hit for the eighth time
since 1977. She estimated damage at $5,000 from Monday's flooding,
which brought water about a foot deep into her establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Wyandotte County's Unified Government had paid
``lip service'' to help with the cleanup, she said, but in the end,
``We are left to clean up by ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Unified Government spokesman Don Denney said government workers
were doing as much as they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bridge collapse, a business collapse; we were
involved in numerous rescues; families have been displaced,''
Denney said. ``Now if we have neglected some people, it is
certainly not intentional. We are doing everything we can. It is
not something that can be resolved overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   For Southwest Boulevard business owners, a long-term solution
has been proposed. A $43 million flood-control project is awaiting
approval from Congress, said Michael Bart, chief of planning and
hydrology for the Kansas City District of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government would pay 65 percent of the cost, and the
two Kansas Citys would cover the rest. The corps has estimated that
Kansas City would receive about 70 percent of the benefits and
Kansas City, Kan., about 30 percent. Construction would be
concentrated mostly in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Unified Government Mayor Carol Marinovich declared
a state of emergency, allowing government crews to pump basements
and inspectors to work with homeowners to restore electricity. The
declaration doesn't guarantee state or federal emergency funds,
Marinovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heart can't do anything but go out to them,'' she said,
referring to flood victims. ``Water can be pretty vicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich said that officials were focusing on helping
residents clean up and had not begun talking about a solution to
the flooding along Argentine Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was one single cause,'' Marinovich said.
``When you have that much rain in a short time, you have
flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, officials said they had no plans to put a new
tax for flood-control projects on the ballot. In April, voters
defeated a proposal for an 18-month sales tax to raise $45 million
for flood control.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Kay Barnes said a proposed sales tax extension that
residents will vote on in November would generate about $29 million
for various flood control projects. The city is also poised to
begin a major catch-basin repair and replacement program, thanks to
a storm-water management fee that voters approved last November.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pogge, deputy director of the Water Services Department,
said the department's goal was to clean 14,000 catch basins this
year and get on a cycle of cleaning all catch basins _ about 33,000
_ every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Catch basins are the grates in the street or slots in the curb
through which storm water flows.

KC SCHOOL BOARD MOVES TOWARD CONSENSUS ON DESIGNATED LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANIKA WHITE AND PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Three Kansas City school board members said
Tuesday they would work cooperatively with superintendent-designate
Jay Edwards even though they were dissatisfied with the selection
process. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Edwards this
district will experience quality-based management,'' board member
Helen Ragsdale said at a news conference at the Board of Education
building, 1211 McGee St. Ragsdale called Edwards ``an individual
interested in making a difference in the lives of all children and
a leader committed to excellence.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale and board members Lee Barnes Jr. and Terry Riley called
the news conference. At an acrimonious meeting Monday night, those
three and board member Patricia Kurtz abstained on a vote to begin
contract negotiations with Edwards, a retired Air Force major
general and now general administrator of the Oklahoma Corporation
Commission. Kurtz said she abstained because she favored another
candidate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five board members voted to proceed with contract negotiations.
The board is scheduled to vote tonight on a proposed contract. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three board members said they called the news conference
because once news got out that Edwards was the board's choice for
superintendent, they were bombarded with questions from their
constituents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parents and community members, they said, were upset that a
potential superintendent had been named without community input.
Many also expressed concerns about Edwards' qualifications. Some
were worried that because he does not have a traditional education
background. Others wondered if Edwards had a commitment to seeing
African-Americans succeed. Nearly 80 percent of the school
district's population is African-American. &QL; 
Explaining abstentions &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the news conference began, Ragsdale said she, Riley and
Barnes did not want their comments construed as ``a racial
issue.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale said the three wanted to hire a superintendent who
would ``place a high value on the diversity of the students in this
community.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale said she abstained Monday night because she wanted
Edwards to answer a few more questions before she voted to move the
process along. She declined to elaborate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said that although Edwards was not his top choice among
the four finalists, he would work with Edwards if a contract were
approved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The three of us are professional people,'' Barnes said. ``We
can work with whomever we end up with.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Riley, when asked if he would vote to offer a contract to
Edwards, Riley said, ``It's a possibility.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be in the best interest of all of us on the board to
work collectively and collaboratively with whomever is selected,''
he said after the news conference. He declined to comment about why
he abstained. &QL; 
Diversity proponent &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People close to Edwards in Oklahoma City said the Kansas City
school community shouldn't worry about the superintendent-to-be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, their concerns are unfounded, and it's too bad
they don't know this man like I do. Jay is an individual who gets
things done, and extraneous issues don't cloud his vision,'' said
Bill Burnett, who worked under Edwards when Edwards was commander
of Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma. Burnett now oversees the
consumer services division of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said that when Edwards commanded Tinker, equal opportunity
was a high priority.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have a biased bone in his body,'' Burnett said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Burnett was hired as an engineer at the commission 18 years
ago, he was the only black person in management. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Edwards' first actions was to appoint Burnett and another
black man serving as interim division heads to permanent positions.
Those two became the first black full-time directors at the
commission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commission had a reputation for not hiring black people,
Burnett said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Jay has been herethat problem has gone away,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said the commission's most influential and complex
division is led by two black persons. The director and the deputy
director of the public utilities division are black. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said that when he was retiring from the service, he
recommended four possible replacements _ three white candidates and
a black candidate. Edwards chose the black person. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the folks in Kansas City are justifiably concerned
about someone white assuming that position,'' Burnett said of the
superintendent's job. ``I would (submit) that this is a
superintendent you will be trying to keep after three or four
years. I feel real honored to work for him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edwards will be in Kansas City today to meet with the
Desegregation Monitoring Committee. He will tour schools and meet
with select community groups on Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board members will hold a forum for the community to meet
Edwards at 7 p.m. Thursday at Central High School, 3221 Indiana
Ave. &QL;

H&AMP;R BLOCK ACQUIRES ACCOUNTING FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block Inc. on Tuesday announced an
agreement to acquire McGladrey &AMP; Pullen LLP, the nation's
seventh-largest accounting firm, in a transaction valued at $290
million.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction represents the largest acquisition in Block's
history and the largest takeover of an accounting firm by a
non-accounting firm in U.S. history, the two companies said.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, the transaction dramatically increases Block's
capacity to provide a wider range of services to small and
medium-size businesses across the nation. The purchase also will
allow Block to reach markets that aren't much served by its tax
preparation offices, security analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Block's preparers already fill out about 13 percent of the
income tax returns that taxpayers file each year, compared with 23
percent filled out by an estimated 46,000 certified public
accountant firms in the United States, according to industry
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Block had been negotiating with Minneapolis-based McGladrey
since February. Under the buyout terms, Block will pay $240 million
in cash and assume $50 million of McGladrey debt.
</P>
<P>
   Block and McGladrey intend to combine Block's financial muscle
with McGladrey's expertise at providing mostly medium-size
businesses a wide range of individually tailored financial and
consulting services that big CPA firms cannot economically provide.
</P>
<P>
   The combination ``significantly accelerates our shared strategy
of building an industry-leading firm,'' said Frank L. Salizzoni,
Block's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this solid foundation in place, we will continue to
expand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Block during the last 13 months has bought seven other small
regional CPA firms and a group of smaller specialty service
providers. They all serve primarily small and middle-size
businesses in Kansas City, Chicago, Indianapolis, Philadelphia,
Dallas, Baltimore and Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Two broadly similar competitors, American Express Co. and
Century Business Services, also have been acquiring or affiliating
with scores of local CPA and other firms across the nation, though
they don't yet appear to be going after precisely the same market
as Block, said Paul Mackey, a securities analyst with Buckingham
Research Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring McGladrey, however, vaults Block over those
competitors to sixth-largest among CPA firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is way beyond bookkeeping for the blue-collar crowd,''
Mackey said. More important, the transaction provides Block an
immediate national base, with international connections, in
enterprises where it barely had a toehold before the buying began,
Mackey said.
</P>
<P>
   McGladrey serves clients from 63 offices across the United
States, with links to 82 other independently owned CPA firms and
400 other firms in 75 countries.
</P>
<P>
   When the newest acquisition is fully integrated with the other
smaller firms Block has acquired, the operation will become known
as RSM McGladrey and have a national business services and
consulting network. The new network will have more than 470
managing directors in 70 offices and nearly 4,000 employees
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It extends the Block brand and helps gain recognition for the
company as a powerhouse in financial services,'' said Peter
Heckmann, analyst at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Block still intends to extend these business service and
consulting operations to the nation's 25 largest markets, Salizzoni
said, and ``we have a ways to go.''

BUSINESSES URGED TO INFORM, PROTECT TEENS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The National Youth Information Network wants
area businesses to protect teen-agers from harassment and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The network announced the Fair Treatment for Teens initiative at
a news conference Tuesday at the Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 youngsters trained in the program will begin today to
ask businesses in the urban core to participate. The first goal is
to get 200 pledges by July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, businesses will be asked to make a pledge to
inform youngsters about their rights as employees and their
obligations when buying on credit. The businesses also will be
asked not to take advantage of youths because of their age or
inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Participating businesses will receive a seal with a drawing of
three persons and the phrase, ``This merchant supports fair
treatment for teens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, you will see this as a signed trust between
businesses and young people,'' said Pat Schudy, president of the
National Youth Information Network.
</P>
<P>
   This is thought to be the first time a metropolitan community
has united to protect the consumer and employee rights of
teen-agers, Schudy said. Among those endorsing the program are the
mayors of both Kansas Citys, the Council of Mayors of Wyandotte and
Johnson Counties, the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, and
the Kansas City Kansas Area Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   An expansion of the program to suburban businesses is planned
for this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that by doing this, youth and businesses will have
better communications,'' said David Wu, 17, who has helped train
other teens.
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Treatment for Teens initiative was developed because
the National Youth Information Network is building a database for
its Youth Information Line of Kansas City and wanted a standard for
its referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Call (816) 561-6050 for more information about the National
Youth Information Network and the Fair Treatment for Teens
initiative.

ANGELS CAN'T KEEP UP WITH RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Monday will go down as the most discouraging night of
the Angels' season. One of the top 10, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The first-place Texas Rangers came to Edison Field looking
strangely vulnerable to the last-place Angels. The Rangers were on
a six-losses-in-nine-games slide and trying to digest the
undignified image of their 55-year-old pitching coach breaking a
hip rollerblading in the stadium parking lot. The Angels were on a
four-game winning streak more or less coinciding with the return of
shortstop and clubhouse conscience Gary DiSarcina and the overdue
announcement of manager Terry Collins' contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the start of the Angels' scramble back into the
American League West race after two months of weak hitting,
injuries and... more injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody, somewhere, dared to mention the possibility of a
three-game sweep, which would have put the Angels 3{ games out of
first, a stone's throw even if Todd Hundley were the thrower.
</P>
<P>
   And then reality hit Anaheim like a 500-foot home run as Chuck
Finley got brave and challenged the Texas hitters with fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   Nine to 1, Rangers out-machoed 'em again. Now they've outscored
the Angels here 34-4 dating back to the decisive three-game series
last September. Any wonder only 20,000 Angels fans show up for
these things?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of momentum, a lot of confidence going for us. We
thought we had a chance to make up some ground,'' Finley said after
losing to Mike Morgan, the craftier veteran, on Monday. ``Tonight
we got pushed back to the end of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon the Angels dressed for game 2 of the most
pivotal series of the midseason muttering about how Monday's was
just one game in 162.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have some like that,'' Collins said with a
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   But this was more than that.
</P>
<P>
   This was a loud reminder that there's a class standout in the
Angels' division _ and it's not the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' immediate task is to get out of dead last. Their
next job is to send a faith healer after right fielder Tim Salmon
(sprained left wrist, out since May 4) and center fielder Jim
Edmonds (right shoulder surgery, out since opening night); ``no
timetable'' for the return of either, according to Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Their next order of business should be to move the Rangers out
of the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Ballplayers are big on self-reliance, and in that spirit the
Angels will tell you that if they take care of their own game the
division title will take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   If they really think so, their eyes must be spinning too fast
after Monday's mugging to look hard at the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I see the Rangers, I wonder why this team isn't
(begin ital)more(end ital) than 10 games over .500, where they
stood before Tuesday night's game, and why they can't get past
round one of the playoffs, which the club with the most .500-plus
seasons (seven) in the AL this decade failed to do in '96 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of their batting order _ Ivan Rodriguez, Rusty Greer,
Juan Gonzalez and Rafael Palmeiro _ shames any opponent.
</P>
<P>
   If their nine hitters Monday and Tuesday duplicated their best
major-league seasons, they'd have a lineup averaging .307, 24
homers, 94 runs and 97 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez hit his first-inning homer off Finley with a swing as
casual as one of Fred Couples' warmups.
</P>
<P>
   It's frightening to think what these guys could do with a
complete team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we haven't been as consistent as we'd probably
like to be,'' said Todd Zeile, the Rangers third baseman who hit 31
homers for the Dodgers in 1997 before being bundled in the Mike
Piazza trade.
</P>
<P>
   The past 17 games have included two three-game winning streaks
and losing streaks of four, four and two games.
</P>
<P>
   More unfortunately, the Rangers are weighted down by their
infield defense and their starting rotation, in both cases the
league's worst.
</P>
<P>
   (The team was 43-33 after Monday; the bullpen was 17-3; you do
the subtraction.)
</P>
<P>
   Vulnerable? Yeah, the Angels might have thought so, catching
them as they have in the midst of a grinding month that finds the
Rangers playing 26 of 32 games on the road before the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Monday, Gonzalez's easy 2-iron, nine Rangers runs
against the Angels' putative ace, and the sight of fans fleeing
into the Orange County darkness after the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates had an encouraging word for those
Anaheim fans who might get the idea Texas is unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them to contact the Yankees fans _ 'cause we can't beat
(begin ital)them(end ital),'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, here in the West, Angels fans might be right. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NOT long after daybreak on another hot summer morning, Hakeem
Olajuwon touched the news that touches him and was burned.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the newspaper. He read the headline. And quite
suddenly, the breakfast of an ex-champion was a little harder to
swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised, of course,'' Olajuwon said. ``This is
something that I was definitely not expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Not after all of the games and all of the years and all of the
mountains he had climbed with the Rockets. To discover they had
been entertaining trade offers for him from Toronto for nearly two
weeks. To find out from the impersonal black ink on a page of
newsprint rather than a face-to-face meeting or a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common courtesy,'' he said. ``I think they owed me not to find
out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Rockets really didn't understand that after 15 years
with the same franchise and 18 years in the same city, it is about
more than just basketball and business. Maybe they really don't _
or can't _ comprehend that one of these well-paid hired guns can
make a connection to a community, and to its people, that does run
in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all that really matters in the end is not that Olajuwon
had to pick up the phone to call coach Rudy Tomjanovich to find out
what was going on, but that Rudy T did the right thing, the
absolutely right thing, and was the one who pulled the plug on a
potential trade because it pulled too hard on his own emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it. While the decisions on how to run the
basketball operations of the Rockets are always done by committee,
this was a deal that had the support in a simple majority to go
through. But it was Rudy T, living up to the words he preaches
about heart and family, who could not, would not, let it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the man that Rudy is, what is inside of him, the
principles that he stood up for in the end,'' Olajuwon said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hakeem is still not sure if the Rockets understand his own
feelings about the totality of his career, his own sense of dignity
and propriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a history, a tradition, a natural
conclusion,'' Olajuwon said. ``It all happened here. I can't
picture myself playing anywhere else. If anything, a trade would
have speeded up my plans for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the people making those decisions were
thinking. When I look at my career, it is not just the Rockets or
the University of Houston or the city of Houston. It is all
together as part of one picture. It merges together. There is a
rhythm, a right way it should go to the end of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always thought that my career would end like so many of
the great players of the past in the NBA _ Larry Bird, Magic
Johnson, Michael Jordan. One team. One city. One identity. That
means a great deal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It all reminds one of the line from Pete Gent's watershed sports
novel North Dallas Forty when Phil Elliott, the wide receiver, is
talking to his head coach: ``Every time I call it a game, you call
it a business. And every time I call it a business, you call it a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon hears the talk about the Rockets needing to get
something for him before he retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is looking at things on a small level,'' he said. ``It is
from that attitude that I feel betrayal. You want to get something
for me? Haven't I been giving for years?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to hear what Rudy told me (Tuesday), that he
wasn't going to talk to Toronto any longer. But I don't want to
hold them to some kind of an obligation. I want to be here if it is
good for the team, good for the city. I don't want them just doing
me a favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon is particularly surprised that the talk with Toronto
would grow in light of a lunch he had with Rockets owner Leslie
Alexander roughly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about things in general, and Les said that
everything was fine,'' he said. ``He asked me my impressions of the
team, and I told him that I did not think we needed drastic
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Les told me that day was about the rumors concerning
Scottie (Pippen). He assured me that the deal being reported of
Scottie going to the Lakers was not true, and I told him I was
happy to hear that. I believe Scottie will be more comfortable next
season. With him and Charles (Barkley) and myself back, I'm looking
forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has a new 2-week-old daughter, Aisha, whose name means
``to have a good life,'' and her father says he's doing just that
again, feeling strong and healthy for the first time in more than
two years and looking forward to regaining his rhythm and offensive
touch.
</P>
<P>
   He is not bothered by pain. He is not bothered by the shadow
cast by the 1999 champion San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had them beat bad over there, and we let them come back,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon is bothered by the constant whispers from within the
organization that he has lost his competitive edge, the drive that
delivered two titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you question my drive, you are questioning my character,
and I don't know what I've done in my career to have that happen,''
he said. ``You are questioning my pride. When you step on the
court, everything is gone, and all that matters is winning. I feel
that way in a pickup game. If somebody wants to say I don't have a
competitive drive, they should tell it to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been honest with the team, with the way I play.
What I know now is that last week I was in a meeting with Les and
the mayor, discussing possibilities for a new stadium, helping the
Rockets. And at that same time, the Rockets were talking with
Toronto about trading me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that is the business. But I always look forward to the
games, and I have always wanted them all to be in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   After so many years, a guy can still dream.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader, is no democratic
hero. His party, the PKK, is rightly regarded with suspicion by
governments the world over. His own role in the deaths of thousands
is hardly disputed, least of all by himself during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the death sentence passed on Ocalan Tuesday is no way for
Turkey to solve its Kurdish problems. On the contrary, it can only
make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving issues of morality and capital punishment to one side,
the death penalty will help Kurd extremists far more than it will
help the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Ankara can win applause from the voters _ always a
tempting option for any government _ by hanging Ocalan. For Turks,
the violence used by the PKK in recent years justifies any kind of
lethal revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Martyrs are, however, just what extremists need. The IRA
received a boost from the death in jail of Bobby Sands. Repression
rarely benefits the oppressor in the longer term _ as the example
of Kosovo has vividly demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan may merely be grandstanding when he suggests that
``thousands of people'' will carry out acts of terror if he is
executed. The general point is, however, valid. Margaret Thatcher
complained about ``the oxygen of publicity'' for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the oxygen of repression is much more powerful. Only
two years ago, Albanians in Kosovo supported peaceful means to
achieve change. But that gave way to widespread support for the
armed struggle of the Kosovo Liberation Army. In that respect,
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has become the patron saint of
the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is in danger of achieving the same aim. Turks aspire to
live peacefully in their own country _ a laudable aim. But their
government must understand that such an aspiration is easier to
fulfill if an attempt is made to understand the concerns of the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   The policies towards Kurds in recent years have been brutal.
More than 2,000 villages have been destroyed and two million have
been forced out of their homes, in an apparent attempt to counter
the Maoist dictum about villages being a friendly sea in which
guerrillas can swim like fish.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish fears about the creation of a Kurdish state are
understandable. There is obvious potential for regional instability
if millions of Kurds in Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran break away to
form a separate Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   State-sponsored violence is, however, no way to stop such
change.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has long complained about being treated like a pariah in
its attempts to join the European Union. And yet, the hanging of
Ocalan would only reduce its chances further.
</P>
<P>
   Spain and Britain _ to take two obvious examples _ have learned
that dialogue and flexibility reduce the power of political
violence more effectively than hordes of soldiers and armored cars.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey should not be afraid to learn those lessons. &QL;

governments the world over. His own role in the deaths of thousands
is hardly disputed, least of all by himself during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the death sentence passed on Ocalan Tuesday is no way for
Turkey to solve its Kurdish problems. On the contrary, it can only
make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving issues of morality and capital punishment to one side,
the death penalty will help Kurd extremists far more than it will
help the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Ankara can win applause from the voters _ always a
tempting option for any government _ by hanging Ocalan. For Turks,
the violence used by the PKK in recent years justifies any kind of
lethal revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Martyrs are, however, just what extremists need. The IRA
received a boost from the death in jail of Bobby Sands. Repression
rarely benefits the oppressor in the longer term _ as the example
of Kosovo has vividly demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan may merely be grandstanding when he suggests that
``thousands of people'' will carry out acts of terror if he is
executed. The general point is, however, valid. Margaret Thatcher
complained about ``the oxygen of publicity'' for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the oxygen of repression is much more powerful. Only
two years ago, Albanians in Kosovo supported peaceful means to
achieve change. But that gave way to widespread support for the
armed struggle of the Kosovo Liberation Army. In that respect,
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has become the patron saint of
the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is in danger of achieving the same aim. Turks aspire to
live peacefully in their own country _ a laudable aim. But their
government must understand that such an aspiration is easier to
fulfill if an attempt is made to understand the concerns of the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   The policies towards Kurds in recent years have been brutal.
More than 2,000 villages have been destroyed and two million have
been forced out of their homes, in an apparent attempt to counter
the Maoist dictum about villages being a friendly sea in which
guerrillas can swim like fish.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish fears about the creation of a Kurdish state are
understandable. There is obvious potential for regional instability
if millions of Kurds in Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran break away to
form a separate Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   State-sponsored violence is, however, no way to stop such
change.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has long complained about being treated like a pariah in
its attempts to join the European Union. And yet, the hanging of
Ocalan would only reduce its chances further.
</P>
<P>
   Spain and Britain _ to take two obvious examples _ have learned
that dialogue and flexibility reduce the power of political
violence more effectively than hordes of soldiers and armored cars.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey should not be afraid to learn those lessons. &QL;

   LIPLJAN, KOSOVO _ An insight into the influence and mentality of
the Yugoslav Army in Kosovo emerged Monday night when it was
revealed that Serbian schoolchildren in the province were being
taught how to lay mines and set booby traps.
</P>
<P>
   Pupils as young as 12 were being taught for several hours a week
on a range of defense and protection issues, including handling
explosives and grenades and shooting guns. The lessons were part of
the school curriculum and were compulsory.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the military training for children emerged after
British troops broke into two classrooms in a school in Lipljan, 10
miles south of the Kosovo capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The classrooms, which had been shut up with four-inch nails,
were full of equipment for hands-on training.
</P>
<P>
   Among the equipment were devices for measuring radiation and the
detection of biological and chemical weapons. There were also a
number of boxes of live rounds for automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be teaching this sort of stuff to cadets back in
Britain. We would not think it was appropriate,'' said Quarter
Master Ian Macfarlane, of the Royal Engineers, now stationed at the
school which has been taken over by British Forces as one of their
bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pupils here were being taught how to make mines, how to
lay them and how much cover they should be given once they had been
laid in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to suggest that the children here were being
taught anything about leadership or discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   The classroom contained piles of exercise books, filled with
childish writing and diagrams relating to bomb-making and the
breakdown of rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
   The pupils had written their names inside the front covers. In
one book, the pupil had carefully drawn a cutaway diagram of a
Yugoslav land mine showing how to lay and set the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other pupils in her class, the work had apparently not
been marked. The classroom also contained a number of text books
containing military doctrine based on a Soviet model.
</P>
<P>
   British forces, who will take the material away for further
examination, say the lessons were taught to all Serb school
children from the age of 12 upwards.
</P>
<P>
   Although the idea of children being taught about laying mines
might seem repellent in western eyes, most Yugoslavs would say
there was nothing strange or sinister about it.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav schools have taught children about military matters
since Tito's Communist takeover in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that all citizens _ even young ones _ should be
able to take an active part in the defense of the country if it was
attacked. The doctrine took on greater significance after
Yugoslavia broke with the Soviet Union in 1948, when a Soviet
invasion was expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a country where the army was extremely important,''
said Lt. Col. Robin Hodges. ``I think we were all shocked when we
came in and found all of this stuff. We would not think that
schoolchildren would need to know how to lay a mine; clearly here
they thought they did.'' &QL;

   Increasing numbers of firms are spying on their employees by
using a wide range of secret surveillance techniques, according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Companies can monitor their workers' e-mails and phone calls,
record conversations and film their every movement on video
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of firms snooping on employees was revealed Tuesday by
MSF, a British trade union.
</P>
<P>
   ``All employees should be aware that Big Brother is already
watching you,'' said the MSF's general secretary, Roger Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Davies, from the London School of Economics' computer
security research center, said: ``In the UK, employers can tap
phones, read e-mail and monitor computer screens. They can bug
conversations, analyze computer and keyboard work, peer through
CCTV cameras, use tracking technology to monitor personal
movements, analyze urine to detect drug use, and demand the
disclosure of intimate personal data.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies says that firms often justify surveillance on the grounds
of health and safety, customer relations or legal obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real purpose of most surveillance, however, is for
performance monitoring, personnel surveillance, or outright
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Dehn, of Public Concern at Work, said that calls to their
helpline showed that surveillance is a growing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several people have contacted us to say that they have found
video cameras hidden in smoke detectors. These discoveries
antagonize employees and undermine any sense of trust in the
workplace,'' says Dehn.
</P>
<P>
   The intrusive technology available to companies is remarkable. A
Japanese company has designed a toilet that can be used to analyze
employee's urine for drug or alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   According to the LSE's Simon Davies, a new software package, The
Ascentor, can scan e-mails and decide whether a message appears to
be about legitimate company business.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are increasingly restrictive about employees' use of
computer systems for personal use. Last week a British woman who
had used the company computer to surf the Internet for a vacation
package lost her case for unfair dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   At Rolls Royce in Bristol, England, an employee inadvertently
sent an ``inappropriate image'' _ pornography _ to the wrong
colleague, who then complained.
</P>
<P>
   A company investigation revealed an e-mail network on the
company system used for conveying risque material and jokes. Last
month 15 people faced disciplinary hearings. Five were sacked and
others were given written warnings. &QL;

NELSON'S GAMBLE APPEARS TO BE A WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He told us this draft was going to be a dry hole, and who are we
to doubt Don Nelson?
</P>
<P>
   Don't answer that.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' mad scientist stood at a microphone 12 months ago
and shrugged away his draft-night decision to trade away the team's
No. 1 1999 pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad draft next year,'' Dr. Nelsonstein predicted with breezy
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there wasn't an amateur basketball player on the
Planet Earth who Nellie thought could help his woeful Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   We laughed. Nelson drove off into the summer sunset, headed to
some beach or U2 concert. And we sat back and waited for the
Phoenix Suns to make the No. 1 lottery pick _ the Mavericks'
longtime dream one _ in the 1999 NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Except it didn't happen, did it? The Suns will draft ninth in
tonight's first round, which is exactly the limbo perch where the
Mavericks always seemed to end up.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Tim Duncans on the draft lists. The player who
might well end up getting picked first, Lamar Odom, keeps dodging
doctors and job interviews. And at least five teams like tonight's
first-round pickings so much, they want out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be eight, maybe nine decent players,'' Nelson
said on draft eve. ``But it's a crapshoot.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right _ 12 months ago. The draft stinks.
</P>
<P>
   Odom went to three high schools in four years, trying to stay
one step ahead of the registrar's office. He also performed the
seemingly impossible by getting booted out of Nevada-Las Vegas.
Then, he tried to renounce his decision to declare for the NBA
draft and return to the University of Rhode Island, where he
apparently seldom attended classes or took tests in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, good luck in Vancouver,'' university officials wisely
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Bulls general manager Jerry Krause has said that Odom
won't return his phone calls. The Charlotte Hornets had an
interview scheduled with Odom, and he neglected to show.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nellie said _ a crapshoot.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, he would be right there, rolling the dice. But due to
previous dalliances, Dr. Nelsonstein is out of playing chips.
Unless, of course, somebody wants to take John ``Hot Rod'' Williams
off his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Quit laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie told us, and he was right. This year's draft is so
diluted by defections, only two seniors _ Utah's Andre Miller and
Miami of Ohio's Wally Szczerbiak _ are expected to be selected in
the first 13 picks of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   One of the defectors, Jonathan Bender, comes to the NBA straight
from his high school prom in the worldly capital of Picayune, Miss.
Another ``project,'' center Aleksandar Radojevic, could get drafted
in tonight's top 10 _ or next week by the Yugoslavian army. Yet
another expected high pick, Duke's Corey Maggette, couldn't even
crack his college team's starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   And these are likely first-round guys that the Mavericks weren't
going to get, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, you've got to give the first round picks a
three-year contract,'' Nelson mused. ``That's why I wouldn't be
surprised if one of these years, some teams are just going to
decline to draft.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those teams is very likely to be Team Nelson. The draft,
in its time-honored forms, seems to bore Dr. Nelsonstein. He would
rather be trading a cow for somebody's bag of beans.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, this could have been the year when Nellie might have
wheeled and dealed his way to the top. The Bulls reportedly
wouldn't mind trading the draft's No. 1 pick. Even Nelson's phone
has been ringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of first-round picks available,'' he said.
``There are a lot of teams trying not to draft in the first
round.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks will select seventh in the second round, 36th
overall, and then again at No. 40.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities were so varied and vague, Nelson declined to
invite any draft prospects in for closer scrutiny. Instead, he
suggests that the team's Nos. 36 and 40 picks may be dispatched to
Europe for feeding and finishing and, maybe one day, the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would probably be the best scenario for us,'' Nelson said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't see himself being intrigued by any of the first-round
offers that have been floating around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever want to say never,'' Nellie said, ``but it just
doesn't look like I'll be doing anything like that at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the pickings would be slim 12 months ago. When we
scoffed, he shrugged and said the Mavericks were going to be so
improved, they wouldn't be a lottery team anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nelsonstein, as it turns out, was half-right. The operation
continues.

GONZALEZ VOWS HE WON'T GO TO ALL-STAR GAME AS A RESERVE
</HEADLINE>

By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Rangers outfielder Juan Gonzalez, upset at the
fans' voting and a previous snub by New York Yankees manager Joe
Torre, said yesterday he will not go to the All-Star Game this year
if he is selected as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is not happy that the fans in Cleveland have dominated
the voting for the starters, leaving him a distant fifth among
American League outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. led all AL outfielders in the latest voting
update with 1,752,313 votes, followed by three Cleveland
outfielders: Manny Ramirez (1,095,174), Kenny Lofton (965,148) and
David Justice (753,667). Gonzalez was a distant fifth with 493,038
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's incredible,'' Gonzalez said. ``It's a popularity game.
You don't see real justice in the All-Star voting. But fans in
Cleveland, they vote for their players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all right. Three days off will be good. My concern is
for my team and the game and my numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, last year's American League most valuable player,
should have a good chance of being chosen as a reserve by Torre.
The Yankees manager, who will be the AL All-Star manager, is
responsible for selecting the pitching staff and reserves, and
Gonzalez went into last night's game against the Anaheim Angels
hitting .313 with 22 home runs and 67 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez said he won't go even if Torre does selects him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to go if the fans pick me,'' Gonzalez said. ``But if
the fans don't pick me, I'm not going to go. I'm in the same
situation as 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez wasn't voted in as a starter in 1997, even though he
had won the MVP award the year before. He also wasn't happy that
Torre picked Yankees outfielders Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill
as reserves that year instead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had better numbers than both of them,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers Spanish broadcaster Luis Mayoral, a close friend of
Gonzalez's, said, ``Juan doesn't speak Shakespeare. But he is very
bright, and inside he has a lot of deep, silent pride. He doesn't
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   The AL starting lineup, as voted by the fans, will be announced
Monday. The reserves and pitching staff will be announced next
Wednesday. The All-Star Game is scheduled for July 13 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has been to only two All-Star Games in his career. He
was voted a starter last year when he hit .293 with 26 homers and
101 RBI in the first half. He was selected as a reserve in 1993.

BURKETT COMBINES ON ONE-HITTER FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Forget those flowers, cards and letters or the
customary box of chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   This will make pitching coach Dick Bosman feel better than
anything: pitchers who throw strikes and change speeds effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Bosman preaches that simple formula and John Burkett followed it
last night in the Rangers' 5-0 victory against the Anaheim Angels
at Edison International Field, with Burkett combining on a
one-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez provided the big blow offensively with a three-run
home run in the eighth inning off reliever Mark Petkovsek. It was
Gonzalez's fourth home run in his past five games.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, who seems to love pitching in Southern California, held
the Angels to one hit through seven innings. He walked one and
struck out seven, including Mo Vaughn three times, before giving
way to Jeff Zimmerman in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing. I really can't explain it,'' Burkett said. ``I
was out there tonight seeing things I haven't seen in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it feels like someone planted a new arm on me. I
have life on my fastball, and a sharp breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosman, who is in a local hospital with a fractured hip and
underwent surgery yesterday after an inline skating accident,
couldn't have asked for anything more. It was the same approach
Mike Morgan took in his complete game seven-hitter in a 9-1 victory
Monday against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett is 4-0 with a 0.58 earned-run average in his career in
Anaheim. He is also 6-3 with a 2.76 ERA at Dodger Stadium, 35 miles
up the road in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the smog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would have mattered who I was pitching
against tonight,'' Burkett said. ``I was hitting my spots,
executing my pitches, doing everything I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, Burkett has won two consecutive games since
returning to the rotation, reviving hope for the Rangers that their
Opening Day starter from last year is a viable starting pitcher
again.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Rangers have also taken advantage of the Angels'
offensive woes. The Angels have scored the fewest runs in the
American League this year, and injuries to outfielders Tim Salmom
and Jim Edmonds have played a large role in that slump.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels, heartened by the return of injured shortstop
Gary DiSarcina, had won six of seven coming into this series and
were starting to believe they could make a serious run at the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Angels pitcher Omar Olivares matched Burkett for three innings
before the Rangers broke through in the fourth. Olivares started
the trouble by walking Gonzalez to start the inning, then gave up
singles to Rafael Palmeiro and Todd Zeile to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens followed with a sacrifice fly to center to score one
run, and Roberto Kelly singled to center to give the Rangers a 2-0
lead. Zeile stopped at second on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton then hit a grounder up the middle, and DiSarcina
made a nice stop racing to his left. But his backhanded throw for
the forceout at second was low and behind Randy Velarde, rolling
away for an error. Zeile thought it rolled far enough away that he
could score, but Velarde recovered quickly and threw him out at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels stayed close until the eighth. But Mark McLemore
singled off reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa, and Rusty Greer drew a
two-out walk against lefty Scott Schoeneweiss. Angels manager Terry
Collins then tried the right-hander Petkovsek against Gonzalez. It
didn't work as Gonzalez hit a 2-1 pitch into the Angels' bullpen.

<P>
   Doctors and psychologists are bracing themselves for a rise in
millennium-related mental breakdowns as they report the number of
patients suffering from stress, panic attacks and depression linked
to the arrival of the year 2000 has doubled in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   They predict the figure will continue to rise as the condition,
described as ``Pre-Millennial Tension,'' becomes more acute as Dec.
31, 1999 approaches, with the danger of increased suicide rates and
family distress.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of technological chaos caused by the millennium bug _ the
danger that some computer programs, especially older ones, might
fail when the date changes to 2000 _ and religious associations of
the year 2000 with an apocalyptic event are the main reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentalist Christians, for whom the apocalypse is a firmly
entrenched belief, and members of extreme cults are most at risk,
but secular people are also suffering severe depression and anxiety
because of the warnings of possible technological collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome is confined mostly to the Christian world; for
Jews, Muslims, Hindus and other faiths the year 2000 has no
significance.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are acute in countries with mass associations of
strict religious groups, such as the United States and countries
subject to rapid social change, such as Russia and other Eastern
European nations.
</P>
<P>
   China is thought to have some 200 million evangelical Christians
while the Venezuelan government is talking to psychologists and
psychiatrists about the millennium bug ``in order to know how to
reach people in the right manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Cults and extreme religious sects have been predicting an
apocalyptic conclusion to the 20th century for some time. In 1993,
Branch Davidian leader David Koresh was killed together with 80
followers in a shoot-out at Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Another 12 people were killed when the doomsday cult Aum Shinri
Kyo launched a sarin nerve-gas attack in Tokyo in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems occurred 1,000 years ago, with debates within
Christian and druid circles about whether the world would come to
an end either on or around the 1,000th anniversary of Christ's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if something isn't really going to happen,''
said Martyn Shrewsbury, a British psychotherapist who has seen the
number of clients suffering from Pre-Millennial Tension double
since Christmas. ``If enough people really do believe it's true
then they'll act as if it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrewsbury receives up to 25 calls a week and treats 10 patients
a month. Some are from members of strict religious sects brought up
with a firm belief in judgement day, but many are people with no
religious leanings who have ``difficulty'' coping with the concept
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts an increase in suicides and greater domestic tension
within families before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the religious groups, and others, all the ingredients are
here right now,'' he said. ``There have been predictions of
business failures attributable to the millennium bug. We've heard
that health authorities and the police are cancelling all leave for
the period. If you are vulnerable and stressed then all these
things happening together may push you over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultural implications of the date 2000 may worry otherwise
rational people, said Shrewsbury. ``It's a date that has always
fascinated everyone. We worry that underneath it all that if the
technology goes up in 2000 we'll have to go back to being cavemen
and cavewomen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jehovah's Witnesses _ formed in the expectation that the end
of the world was due in 1914 _ appear to be unfazed by the
impending millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe the world system will come to an end but not
necessarily in the year 2000. Jehovah's Witness businessmen are
probably worried about their computers crashing,'' said a spokesman
for the sect. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Disney animated film `Tarzan' is at the top of the American
box-office charts, but you would hardly know it in the small town
of Tarzana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As the name strongly suggests, this modest community on the
western edge of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles is where the
legendary ape-man sprang from the imagination of his creator, Edgar
Rice Burroughs.
</P>
<P>
   So successful were the original Tarzan novels that they inspired
Burroughs to rename his property Tarzana Ranch and, in due course,
prompted the town to take the same name. But that is where all
local identification with the jungle hero stops.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Johnny Weissmueller look-alike statues, much less
any memorials to Edgar Rice Burroughs himself. And now that the
Disney movie is out, there is no tie-in merchandise in the stores
and not so much as a banner proclaiming Tarzana to be the film's
spiritual home.
</P>
<P>
   Even the local multiplex cinema is spurning the opportunity to
cash in on a splash of local color, advertising the film with no
more fanfare than its sister cinemas in Hollywood, or Westwood, or
Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple, if ugly truth behind this curious reluctance
to jump on the great American marketing bandwagon: Tarzana has
never been much fond of old Tarzan, and the feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   This was a town conceived and developed by hard-nosed real
estate speculators, one that remains far more attached to the
niceties of property values and middle-class living than to the
romance of a connection to the literary jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzana _ or Runnymede, as it was originally called _ was part
of the great land scam on which modern Los Angeles is based.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietor of the Los Angeles Times newspaper, General
Harrison Gray Otis, bought it on the cheap when it was still
pristine farmland, in the second decade of the century.
</P>
<P>
   He then sold it at a massive profit after the city fathers had
successfully stolen enough water from central California to develop
it as a residential suburb.
</P>
<P>
   It was General Otis's ranch that Burroughs bought in the early
1920s as he moved west from his native Chicago. He too had a sharp
business sense, making sure his literary creations were not just
copyrighted but trademarked too _ meaning that they would belong to
his estate in perpetuity.

   The Disney animated film `Tarzan' is at the top of the American
box-office charts, but you would hardly know it in the small town
of Tarzana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As the name strongly suggests, this modest community on the
western edge of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles is where the
legendary ape-man sprang from the imagination of his creator, Edgar
Rice Burroughs.
</P>
<P>
   So successful were the original Tarzan novels that they inspired
Burroughs to rename his property Tarzana Ranch and, in due course,
prompted the town to take the same name. But that is where all
local identification with the jungle hero stops.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Johnny Weissmueller look-alike statues, much less
any memorials to Edgar Rice Burroughs himself. And now that the
Disney movie is out, there is no tie-in merchandise in the stores
and not so much as a banner proclaiming Tarzana to be the film's
spiritual home.
</P>
<P>
   Even the local multiplex cinema is spurning the opportunity to
cash in on a splash of local color, advertising the film with no
more fanfare than its sister cinemas in Hollywood, or Westwood, or
Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple, if ugly truth behind this curious reluctance
to jump on the great American marketing bandwagon: Tarzana has
never been much fond of old Tarzan, and the feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   This was a town conceived and developed by hard-nosed real
estate speculators, one that remains far more attached to the
niceties of property values and middle-class living than to the
romance of a connection to the literary jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzana _ or Runnymede, as it was originally called _ was part
of the great land scam on which modern Los Angeles is based.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietor of the Los Angeles Times newspaper, General
Harrison Gray Otis, bought it on the cheap when it was still
pristine farmland, in the second decade of the century.
</P>
<P>
   He then sold it at a massive profit after the city fathers had
successfully stolen enough water from central California to develop
it as a residential suburb.
</P>
<P>
   It was General Otis's ranch that Burroughs bought in the early
1920s as he moved west from his native Chicago. He too had a sharp
business sense, making sure his literary creations were not just
copyrighted but trademarked too _ meaning that they would belong to
his estate in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   Whether through jealousy or personal friction, the townsfolk
never paid Burroughs another compliment after renaming their
community in his honor in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   The public library banned his books, with the excuse that Tarzan

   GREENWICH, CONN. _ America has an awful lot of shoreline,
enough, you would imagine, to give everyone a spot to plonk down
their deck chair and crack open the Igloo cooler on hot summers
days like these.
</P>
<P>
   You would be wrong. Nearly every oceanside state _ Oregon is the
loan exception _ allows private homes, associations and indeed
whole towns to section off beaches and headlands for the exclusive
use of residents and locals.
</P>
<P>
   One place more than any other has grown infamous for this
less-than-democratic practice and it happens to be the one in which
we live.
</P>
<P>
   It is Greenwich, Conn., a place that has perfected the art of
repelling the unwashed masses. (New York City is awfully near.)
</P>
<P>
   I remember the first week we arrived, setting out for a run in
the direction of the ocean in search of a seaside route. I never
got near the water. Every roadway was blocked by security posts and
barriers declaring ``Private, Residents Only.''
</P>
<P>
   I was angered then, but nowadays my feelings about such
obstacles are more mixed. The reason is simple and inexcusable: it
is called Greenwich Point, a beautiful finger of land that curls
out into Long Island Sound that only Greenwich inhabitants are
allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a 147-acre park with tranquil walks, a stunning view of
Manhattan 35 miles away and, best of all, a fine stretch of gently
sloping beach.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course we want it all for ourselves. And so, every
spring, we follow the town's instructions and apply for our little
beige beach passes.
</P>
<P>
   For $16 a season ($5 for children), the pass gives us access not
just to Greenwich Point but also on to the ferry that scoots out
twice an hour in high summer to the small island that belongs to
the town way out in the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   It too has a beach, an even better view of the city, soothing
breezes and, best of all, a grand little bar with draft beer and a
well-stocked jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   These passes, you will begin to understand, are somewhat
precious. True, we are allowed to take guests, as colleagues from
several rival British titles discovered to their pleasure (I hope)
when we barbecued lunch and sipped Buds on the island recently.
</P>
<P>
   But if your address is not in Greenwich and you have no friends
here to accompany you, you can forget about trying to share in such
sandy delights.
</P>
<P>
   It nonetheless came as a shock recently to read that our
inestimable police department had resorted to entrapping folk who
were attempting _ God forgive them _ to buy passes on the black
market.
</P>
<P>
   A black market in beach passes? Are you serious? Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   The sting was set in motion when an enterprising local of the
neighboring town of Stamford named Victor Consoli placed an ad in
the classifieds of our town newspaper, the Greenwich Time.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was a solicitation for beach passes ``for prof'l Stamford
cpl w/child. $100 + expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Consoli was quickly treated with a reply and invited to meet the
would-be vendor at our local McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   How was he to know that some Greenwich busybody had spotted his
ad and alerted the police or that the man who met him with a smile
and a handshake in the restaurant was actually an undercover cop?
</P>
<P>
   He duly handed over the $100 and then he got his surprise.
``That's when I advised him I was, in fact, a police officer,'' our
plainclothes hero later told the Time. ``He was more disappointed
that anything else. Disappointed and shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Consoli was also slapped with a $60 fine. His crime? Violating
some town ordinance that bars anyone who is not a town resident
from acquiring or possessing a beach pass.
</P>
<P>
   Consoli has not been answering his phone. Maybe he should.
Surely there is some Greenwich beach-lover with the heart to invite
him and his wife and child to tag along with them to the Point from
time to time? Perhaps I should be that person. (I do have a guilty
conscious about all this, honest.) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   While we are talking beaches, tourists on the Outer Banks of
North Carolina have been flocking to watch an engineering feat in
motion. Actually, it is the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse that is in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Painted with a barbershop black spiral, the 4,800-ton, 208-foot
tower is the largest and most beloved of all of America's aging
lighthouses. Wave erosion has left it precariously close to a
watery demise, however, and earlier this month, the National Park
Service began the delicate task of moving it half a mile inland.
</P>
<P>
   So far, all is well. Elevated onto wheels and a giant rail
track, it is being nudged away from the surf by hydraulic pistons
at the rate of about 70 feet a day. And the moving crew is
confident that by late summer, the lighthouse will be happily
bedded down on its new site.
</P>
<P>
   Big structures have been moved before, after all. Didn't that
large bridge I saw recently from an airplane window down in the
Arizona desert once span a river called the Thames?

   I was angered then, but nowadays my feelings about such
obstacles are more mixed. The reason is simple and inexcusable: it
is called Greenwich Point, a beautiful finger of land that curls
out into Long Island Sound that only Greenwich inhabitants are
allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a 147-acre park with tranquil walks, a stunning view of
Manhattan 35 miles away and, best of all, a fine stretch of gently
sloping beach.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course we want it all for ourselves. And so, every
spring, we follow the town's instructions and apply for our little
beige beach passes.
</P>
<P>
   For $16 a season ($5 for children), the pass gives us access not
just to Greenwich Point but also on to the ferry that scoots out
twice an hour in high summer to the small island that belongs to
the town way out in the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   It too has a beach, an even better view of the city, soothing
breezes and, best of all, a grand little bar with draft beer and a
well-stocked jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   These passes, you will begin to understand, are somewhat
precious. True, we are allowed to take guests, as colleagues from
several rival British titles discovered to their pleasure (I hope)
when we barbecued lunch and sipped Buds on the island recently.
</P>
<P>
   But if your address is not in Greenwich and you have no friends
here to accompany you, you can forget about trying to share in such
sandy delights.
</P>
<P>
   It nonetheless came as a shock recently to read that our
inestimable police department had resorted to entrapping folk who
were attempting _ God forgive them _ to buy passes on the black
market.
</P>
<P>
   A black market in beach passes? Are you serious? Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   The sting was set in motion when an enterprising local of the
neighboring town of Stamford named Victor Consoli placed an ad in
the classifieds of our town newspaper, the Greenwich Time.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was a solicitation for beach passes ``for prof'l Stamford
cpl w/child. $100 + expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Consoli was quickly treated with a reply and invited to meet the
would-be vendor at our local McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   How was he to know that some Greenwich busybody had spotted his
ad and alerted the police or that the man who met him with a smile
and a handshake in the restaurant was actually an undercover cop?
</P>
<P>
   He duly handed over the $100 and then he got his surprise.
``That's when I advised him I was, in fact, a police officer,'' our
plainclothes hero later told the Time. ``He was more disappointed
that anything else. Disappointed and shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Consoli was also slapped with a $60 fine. His crime? Violating
some town ordinance that bars anyone who is not a town resident
from acquiring or possessing a beach pass.
</P>
<P>
   Consoli has not been answering his phone. Maybe he should.
Surely there is some Greenwich beach-lover with the heart to invite
him and his wife and child to tag along with them to the Point from
time to time? Perhaps I should be that person. (I do have a guilty
conscious about all this, honest.) &QL;

<P>
   While we are talking beaches, tourists on the Outer Banks of
North Carolina have been flocking to watch an engineering feat in
motion. Actually, it is the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse that is in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Painted with a barbershop black spiral, the 4,800-ton, 208-foot
tower is the largest and most beloved of all of America's aging
lighthouses. Wave erosion has left it precariously close to a
watery demise, however, and earlier this month, the National Park
Service began the delicate task of moving it half a mile inland.
</P>
<P>
   So far, all is well. Elevated onto wheels and a giant rail
track, it is being nudged away from the surf by hydraulic pistons
at the rate of about 70 feet a day. And the moving crew is
confident that by late summer, the lighthouse will be happily
bedded down on its new site.
</P>
<P>
   Big structures have been moved before, after all. Didn't that
large bridge I saw recently from an airplane window down in the
Arizona desert once span a river called the Thames?

ENERGY EAST SEEN IN DEAL TO ACQUIRE CTG RESOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move signaling further consolidation in a deregulated
utility industry, Energy East Corp. is expected to announce
Wednesday that it will buy CTG Resources, the holding company for
Connecticut Natural Gas Corp., for about $355 million in stock and
cash, people close to the talks said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also assume $220 million in CTG's long-term
debt. Both boards approved the transaction Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Energy East, based in Ithaca, N.Y., is the parent company of New
York State Electric &AMP; Gas. It has been on a buying binge in the
Northeast recently, agreeing to buy CMP Group Inc., Maine's largest
electric utility, for $1.2 billion in cash and assumed debt two
weeks ago. In April, Energy East agreed to buy Connecticut Energy
for $617 million in cash, stock and debt.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of CTG Resources, based in Hartford, will expand
Energy East's operations in Connecticut, particularly in Hartford
and Greenwich, where CTG distributes and sells natural gas to about
142,000 customers in 21 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal's terms, 45 percent of the common stock of CTG
Resources will be converted into Energy East common stock valued at
$41 a share. The remaining 55 percent of CTG shares will be valued
at $41 a share in cash. CTG shareholders can elect whether they
want stock or cash, which will be divided up depending on how much
demand there is for each. CTG Resources will become a subsidiary of
Energy East.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction price represents a 15 percent premium to CTG
Resources' closing price Tuesday of $35.625, up $1.625, a new
52-week high. . Shares of Energy East fell 12.5 cents, to $26.125.
</P>
<P>
   Energy East was advised by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the
law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz. Legal counsel for CTG
Resources was Jones, Day, Reavis &AMP; Pogue.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition meshes with Energy East's strategy to become the
leading energy provider in the Northeast. Wes Von Schack, Energy
East's chief executive, has said that he is seeking more
acquisitions. And in a research report dated June 17, Steven
Fleishman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, agreed that earlier
acquisitions of Northeast-based companies _ like CMP Group _ were
strategically sound, although, he wrote, some appeared a bit
expensive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the land of the wealthy, dirt is king.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll through Jupiter Island, Fla., for instance. A
one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of waterfront fetches between
$2 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The house sitting on that dirt might be palatial, but that
hardly matters: On this island of exclusivity, houses come and go
with alarming speed. ``There are a number of houses going up right
now, and every single one of them will eventually be knocked
down,'' says Gene Albarelle, a local broker who deals in high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a speculator paid $1.65 million for an acre of ground
with a five-bedroom house on it. The house was immediately torn
down, and though its replacement has not yet been finished, the
owner is now asking $4.4 million for this small parcel of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jupiter Island is prime territory, removed by 574
feet of bridge from the strip-malled Florida mainland and situated
just 20 miles north of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 525 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   In the land of the wealthy, dirt is king.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll through Jupiter Island, Fla., for instance. A
one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of waterfront fetches between
$2 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The house sitting on that dirt might be palatial, but that
hardly matters: On this island of exclusivity, houses come and go
with alarming speed. ``There are a number of houses going up right
now, and every single one of them will eventually be knocked
down,'' says Gene Albarelle, a local broker who deals in high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a speculator paid $1.65 million for an acre of ground
with a five-bedroom house on it. The house was immediately torn
down, and though its replacement has not yet been finished, the
owner is now asking $4.4 million for this small parcel of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jupiter Island is prime territory, removed by 574
feet of bridge from the strip-malled Florida mainland and situated
just 20 miles north of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 525 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL;

   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL;

<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL;

   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL;

   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy
decision. The Maloneys of Greenwich bought a waterfront house in
nearby Riverside (No. 62) for $2.3 million and struggled with the
decision of whether to renovate or level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy
Maloney. ``And philosophically, they're not people to tear things
down. There's something that really bothers me about just razing
the place, and I keep asking, `Can't we use anything?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband and their architect finally convinced her
that building around the elements she liked would be more expensive
than replacing them, she hopes to salvage what she can: She
mentions a porthole window and a favorite faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Some architectural details, like the staircases, would not meet
current building codes even if they could be saved. ``You just
can't get away with some of these things anymore,'' she says
wistfully, ``even if you like them.'' &QL;

   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the market shows few
signs of slowing down. California has 76 towns on our list this
year, and next year looks just as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are initially forecasting an 8 percent decrease in home
sales,'' says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist with the
California Association of Realtors. ``And I hate to change a
forecast, but I think that sales this year are going to be
extremely strong. The biggest constraint on the market is supply.
When the market is this hot, there just isn't that much
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, says Bockman, the NAR economist, ``our numbers are
actually coming out ahead of where we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting the beginning part of the year to be strong
and then the second part of the year to tail off a little bit. We
expect to settle in for 1999 right around the same levels that we
had for 1998, and we may even end the year a little bit higher,
depending on how things go over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our forecasts is that mortgage rates are going to drop
shortly, and if this happens, we expect to see another glut of home
buyers hitting the market. All of those people who missed out on
the last opportunity will finally get off the fence and make that
purchase.'' &QL;

   Higher home prices? Smaller lots? Bigger houses? It takes a
historian to put these trends into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Jackson is a former chairman of Columbia University's
history department and an expert on suburbia who lives in Rich Town
No. 163 (Chappaqua, N.Y.). He makes the point that no matter how
expensive houses may seem ``they're still cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similar dwellings in Japan, Germany, France, or Switzerland
would almost certainly be more expensive, if they were available at
all _ and most likely they wouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have space,'' he explains. ``Both our land and our
construction costs are less expensive in the United States than
elsewhere. An acre of land in Japan would be an undreamed-of
luxury: nothing in San Marino (No. 72), Greenwich (No. 23), or even
Atherton (No. 3) could compare to it. In world terms, a million
dollars an acre is not an expensive price to pay.'' &QL;

BURKETT SHUTS DOWN ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ For a team that isn't supposed to have much pitching,
the Texas Rangers have come to town and pitched like Cy Young
himself the past two nights.
</P>
<P>
   One night after Mike Morgan's complete-game victory, John
Burkett _ who entered the game with one victory and a 7.20 ERA this
season _ threw seven shutout innings while allowing only one hit in
the Rangers' 5-0 victory before 22,274 at Edison Field on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is the (begin ital)Angels(end ital) the Rangers
were pitching against.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels went into Tuesday's game with the worst offense in
the American League, ranking last in runs, doubles, triples, RBI,
walks, stolen bases, slugging percentage and on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   It was Burkett's longest outing of the season, but that's not
saying much. Burkett (2-3) missed time with a shoulder injury and
spent some time in the bullpen. But following a two-out walk in the
third inning, Burkett retired the last 13 hitters he faced before
giving way to Jeff Zimmerman to start the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman pitched a perfect eighth and John Wetteland followed
with a perfect ninth as the Angels finished with a season-low one
hit, the final 19 batters of the game having been retired.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers pitchers were perfect for eight of the nine innings,
the only Angels baserunners coming in the third inning on a double
by Matt Walbeck and a walk by Darin Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' season-low for hits in a game before Tuesday was
three _ May 15 vs. Tampa Bay and June 19 at New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, after striking out for the third time in the seventh,
was booed as he walked back to the dugout. Erstad also struck out
three times, his hitting streak ending at eight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, the Angels were in it until Juan Gonzalez
smashed a two-out, three-run homer off Mark Petkovsek in the eighth
inning, turning a 2-0 deficit into a seemingly
impossible-to-overcome 5-0 setback.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring four runs in the first inning against the A's on
Sunday, the Angels have scored one run in their last 25 innings.
Going back to last season, the Rangers have now won five in a row
at Edison Field, outscoring the Angels by a combined 39-4.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Omar Olivares (6-6) sailed through the first
three innings, allowing two singles and a walk. But a walk to
Gonzalez leading off the fourth spelled trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro and Todd Zeile followed with singles, loading
the bases for Lee Stevens. Stevens hit a sacrifice fly to center
for the first run of the game and Roberto Kelly's bloop single to
right drove in another for a 2-0 Rangers lead.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares gave up two more hits in the fifth, but escaped. In the
sixth, a diving catch by Erstad in left field saved Olivares
because the next batter _ Royce Clayton _ hit a ground-rule double
to center. Angels manager Terry Collins had seen enough at that
point, lifting Olivares for Shigetoshi Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares, pitching on three days' rest, gave up two runs and
eight hits in 51/3 innings while making 89 pitches. It was the
fifth time in 15 starts he failed to go at least six innings.

WORLD CONFERENCE SPLITS ON CURBING POPULATION GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 10th and 11th grafs for updating, rewriting)  (bl)  
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With time running out, a 180-nation conference
struggling to repair a shattered consensus on limiting world
population growth was still divided Tuesday over issues ranging
from abortion and family planning to sex education in schools.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the conference is supposed to present an updated
action plan to a special session of the U.N. General Assembly. But
if the conference is still not ready, it may continue its
discussions in parallel with the General Assembly debate.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night a comparatively small group of conservative
Roman Catholic and Muslim developing countries, with strong support
from the Vatican, was blocking final agreement on several key
aspects of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago in Cairo, the countries meeting this week agreed
that the best way to curb population growth is not by setting
numerical targets and mounting birth-control campaigns. Instead,
they decided to try to improve the social status, education and
health of young women and men in the belief they will then limit
the size of their families.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called Cairo strategy is designed to let the world's
population rise from some 6 billion at present to 9.8 billion by
2050 and thereafter hold it at around that level.
</P>
<P>
   But difficulties arose last March when the nations who had first
agreed upon the Cairo strategy met at the United Nations in New
York to draw up an action plan for completing it.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives used this meeting to reopen key portions by
inserting language playing down family planning, restricting
abortion and asserting parental control over children's health and
sex education.
</P>
<P>
   While the composition of this group varies from issue to issue,
prominent members include Libya, Sudan, Morocco, Guatemala,
Nicaragua and Argentina as well as the Vatican.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Paying for the Cairo program is also problematic.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night the conference agreed to reaffirm earlier
pledges on financing the program, which is expected to cost $17
billion in 2000, rising to $21.7 billion by 2017.
</P>
<P>
   The pledges commit developing countries to pay two-thirds of the
total and the industrialized world the rest. But both are well
behind on their obligations so far. Industrialized countries, which
promised at Cairo to pay $5.7 billion a year, have contributed only
$1.9 billion a year on average so far. Developing nations, which
were supposed to pay $ 11.3 billion annually, have paid $7.8
billion a year on average, with most of that money being spent by
China, India, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Donors have done even worse, however. Their total contributions
are running at $1.9 billion a year, although at Cairo they pledged
to provide $5.7 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   After the April meeting failed to reach agreement the conference
was reconvened here last week. But Tuesday night it was still
divided on several important issues.
</P>
<P>
   For example, conservatives dislike a call for governments to
provide young people with confidential advice on contraceptives and
reproductive health care, demanding greater parental oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the services are not confidential, young people won't use
them,'' said Ardrienne Germaine, president of the International
Women's Health Coalition, a New York-based women's group.
</P>
<P>
   Also unpopular with conservative groups is a Mexican proposal to
encourage sex education in school curricula in order to promote
``responsible sexual behavior'' and to protect adolescents from
``pregnancy, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most nations in the world support the Cairo program,
the small conservative faction is able to exercise disproportionate
influence over the roughly 130 developing members of the United
Nations, because these countries try to vote as a bloc.
</P>
<P>
   And all members accept that an agreement that is primarily
intended to help the developing world reduce its growing population
will have little value if these countries do not formally endorse
it.
</P>
<P>
   By making improvements in the lives of young people the key to
population control, the Cairo strategy builds on the results of two
earlier major U.N. conferences.
</P>
<P>
   At their 1992 Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro, U.N.
members agreed that economic development must be environmentally
sustainable, thus acknowledging that the world cannot support a
ceaselessly growing population.
</P>
<P>
   Then at their Vienna human rights summit meeting the following
year, these same nations agreed that women have special human
rights, including the right to education and freedom from all forms
of sexual violence and abuse.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
If bench players were defined by roles such as the ones used in the
bullpen, Glen Barker would be the Astros' closer. He might not get
into as many games as his teammates, but when he appears, it's
usually because the game is on the line.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barker's legs and Craig Biggio's bat proved to be a winning
combination in the Astros' 5-4 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals
on Tuesday night at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio's two-out single off Manny Aybar in the eighth inning
scored Barker to break a tie, and Billy Wagner pitched a perfect
ninth inning to preserve the win. The Astros' season-high losing
streak ended at four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of cued it off the end (of the bat) and was fortunate
to find a hole,'' said Biggio, who was 2-for-5 with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Barker, easily the fastest player on the team, entered the game
as a pinch runner for catcher Tony Eusebio, stole second base and
scored on Biggio's line drive up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even see where the ball was,'' Barker said. ``I
didn't know if the shortstop was going to get to it or not. If it
got into the outfield, I knew I was going to score. It's a lot of
pressure, but that's my role. I knew that coming into the season.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to imagine Barker performing his role any
better. Tuesday's steal was his eighth as a pinch runner and his
10th of the season despite appearing in just 29 games. It also
marked the sixth time he has scored in 14 pinch-running
appearances. Five of those runs have either tied or won a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can fly,'' Eusebio said. ``We had to make that move (to get
Barker into the game). After losing four games in a row _ and
looking at the scoreboard and seeing the Reds come back in the
ninth _ we knew we needed this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds pitched well enough to get the win, and he would
have if not for a trouble spot in the eighth inning. Scott Elarton
allowed a pair of RBI singles in relief of Reynolds but became the
winning pitcher after Biggio's first RBI in six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK with me,'' said Reynolds, who allowed four runs on
six hits in seven-plus innings. ``We really need a win. It didn't
matter who got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Reds rallied for three runs in the bottom of the
ninth to beat Arizona on Tuesday, the Astros were not able to
reclaim sole possession of first place. Cincinnati leads by
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to start looking at the scoreboard,'' Astros
shortstop Ricky Gutierrez said. ``We just need to play the way
we're capable of playing. We needed that off day (Monday). We
looked like a whole new team.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Cardinals' two errors opened the door for the Astros'
decisive run. After retiring Richard Hidalgo to start the bottom of
the eighth, Aybar coaxed a chopper to third base from Eusebio.
Third baseman Placido Polanco, who had replaced Fernando Tatis to
begin the inning, tried to barehand the ball and couldn't come up
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Within a matter of minutes, Barker had swiped second base and
was waiting to be driven home.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Astros had only seven hits, they showed slight
signs of coming out of their recent funk. It didn't hurt that they
led off three innings with extra-base hits, scoring a run each
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some frustrating days,'' interim manager Matt
Galante said. ``This one wasn't explosive, but maybe it was enough
to get us started on our way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who notched his 18th save, was welcomed back to a
situation he hadn't seen in 10 days. That's how long it had been
since his last save situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear was pressing, because it had been awhile since
I was last in that situation,'' he said. ``We needed to get this
win. Maybe it will give us a boost.''
</P>
<P>
   A weekday crowd of 34,797 showed up for the first of Mark
McGwire's final three games at the Astrodome, but the only home
runs they witnessed from McGwire came during batting practice. He
was 1-for-4 with an RBI single in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros fell behind for the fifth consecutive game when Tatis
cranked a solo home run into the left-center pavilion in the second
inning. The Astros tied the score in the bottom of the inning when
Hidalgo led off with a double and scored on a groundout by
Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Grounders by Hidalgo and Bill Spiers also led to runs in the
third inning after Jeff Bagwell and Carl Everett led off with hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals pulled within 3-2 in the sixth when Joe McEwing
hit a leadoff double and scored on Edgar Renteria's single to
right. McEwing has hit in 20 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez's team-leading third triple led off the Astros' half
of the sixth, and Biggio's single up the middle reinstated the
Astros' two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds left the game after giving up back-to-back singles to
open the eighth. Elarton allowed run-scoring singles to McGwire and
Ray Lankford as the Cardinals forced another tie. They were only
the third and fourth (of 16) inherited runners Elarton has allowed
to score this season.

PADRES WIN 11TH STRAIGHT, BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Dodgers left the Bay Area, home to the X-Games,
winning two of three this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While fighting through traffic and what-not, they must've gotten
a peek at the wall-climbing competition because they clung on for
dear life through jams in the ninth, 10th and 11th innings.
</P>
<P>
   They fell in the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Jackson's RBI-single with none out in the bottom of the
12th lifted the Padres to a 4-3 win over the Dodgers in the opener
of a three-game series Tuesday at Qualcomm Stadium. The Padres tied
a club record with their 11th straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Davis led off the bottom of the 12th and reached on
defensive replacement Craig Counsell's error ranging to his left at
second. Carlos Baerga walked and Jackson singled just inside the
left-field line to win it. The Padres (36-38) have won five
straight against the Dodgers and six of seven against them this
season. The Dodgers (34-40) remain in last place in the NL West,
{-game behind Colorado. They had five hits off six San Diego
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Donne Wall (5-1) pitched the 12th and recorded the win. Mike
Maddux (0-1) entered the game in the 11th and had his first
decision of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement began in the top of the ninth when the Padres'
Ruben Rivera robbed Eric Karros of a homer. Then the Dodgers pulled
a great escape in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Magadan started the ninth off Alan Mills with a single to
right. Quilvio Veras tried to sacrifice the runner to second, but
Adrian Beltre couldn't come up with it. Mills did, and threw wildly
to first to allow the runners to move to second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens was intentionally walked to load the bases and Reggie
Sanders hit a soft liner to left that Gary Sheffield caught before
falling. Pinch-runner Woody Williams tried to score but was thrown
out when Beltre cut the ball and threw to catcher Todd Hundley for
the double play.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera flied out to center to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres again could have scored the winning run off Mills in
the 10th when Baerga doubled with two outs in the 10th. Jackson and
Phil Nevin walked to load the bases for the second straight inning.
But Veras grounded to second to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego had two runners on in the 11th but Maddux got Wally
Joyner to ground into a double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Three days into his plan to use Hundley three out of every five
days, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson called a valuable audible. He
wanted offense, preferably early, and he was willing to tempt a San
Diego team that stole nine bases the night before to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley homered with Eric Young on in the first, his fourth in
four games, and threw out a runner. He also had another caught, but
the ball was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said after Hundley homered twice in the Dodgers' win
Saturday at San Francisco that Angel Pena would catch Ismael Valdes
and Darren Dreifort because they're slower to the plate and don't
hold runners on very well. Hundley was to catch Kevin Brown, Chan
Ho Park and Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   But Valdes started against the Padres, and for six innings
pitched well before a few bad pitches, a bad hop and excellent
execution on the Padres' part allowed San Diego to rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers led 3-1 when George Arias and Jackson, who's
grounder took a huge bounce over the head of second baseman Young,
singled. With runners on first and second, pitcher Andy Ashby faked
a bunt and slapped an RBI-single through the vacated shortstop
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres tied it 3-3 on Owens' fielder's choice grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who had a no-decision and remains on a personal
five-game losing streak, allowed three runs on nine hits in seven
innings. He struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby returned from the disabled list to baffle the Dodgers last
week in Los Angeles, allowing one run on four hits while pitching
into the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   It took four pitches for the Dodgers to get to Ashby this time,
though there wasn't much afterward. Ashby allowed four hits in 72/3
innings.

PICTURE ROSY FOR POST-PRODUCTION JOBS IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Post-production entertainment work in Los Angeles
County amounts to nearly $7 billion annually and carries a
decidedly sunny outlook, a survey to be released today shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Entertainment Industry Development Corp.'s report also
showed local post-production companies employ well over 30,000
workers and boldly predicted that figure will expand rapidly as
digital technology takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   The report offers a notable contrast to recent gloomy forecasts
to traditional Hollywood work because of escalating runaway
production to cheaper foreign locations and tightened studio
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market for post-production services will grow
substantially in coming years, fueled by increasing international
demand and new digital platforms such as DVD,'' said the survey.
``The concentration of this industry in Southern California has
created a highly skilled, flexible and adaptable work force
well-suited to help lead the industry into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as a qualified pool of labor exists in the region, the
entertainment industry will remain deeply rooted here.''
</P>
<P>
   Post-production -- performed by hundreds of operations in the
San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and West Los Angeles -- consists of
the work that begins once filming stops, such as editing, visual
effects, sound mixing, titles and music. The report underscores the
massive contribution made by the post-production industry,
accounting for one-fourth of the $30 billion-plus spent annually
worldwide on entertainment production.
</P>
<P>
   Between 75 percent and 85 percent of the estimated $8 billion --
or about $7 billion -- in annual post-production revenues worldwide
remain in Los Angeles, according to EIDC Senior Vice President
Kathleen Milnes.
</P>
<P>
   Pockets of ``post'' business operate in New York, Chicago, San
Francisco, Texas, North Carolina and foreign locations, but Los
Angeles should dominate for the foreseeable future, Milnes added.
``Most of the time, producers have to come back to Los Angeles for
post-production even if they shoot elsewhere,'' she said, citing
the strong need for collaboration and resources in Los Angeles
County.
</P>
<P>
   The EIDC, which supervises permitting for much of the county's
location shooting, authorized the $80,000 report -- paid for with a
combination of city and state funds -- in order to spark interest
among job seekers and educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to demystify the industry, because it's going to
continue to need new employees as people retire and jobs change,''
Milnes said. ``We don't want to end up like Silicon Valley having
to import workers from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Economist Tom Lieser of the UCLA Forecasting Project agreed that
the expertise and variety of California's post-production
specialists has proved to be a powerful lure for producers and
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more of a premium being in Los Angeles for the post
work than there is for the location work because the pure costs of
feeding a crew and renting equipment don't loom so large for
decision makers,'' said Lieser, who recently estimated that
statewide entertainment jobs will grow by 10,000 to 200,000 by
2001. ``It's been my feeling we would remain the center of the
industry partly because things are changing so rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Milnes also said industry officials and executives have
expressed optimism about the growth of the post-production
business, which boomed in the past decade as digital technology
took hold in Hollywood. ``Post-production continues to be healthy
and follow a basic upward trend,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Atkin, executive director of the Visual Effects Society,
noted that post-production effects work has picked up by expanding
into areas outside of movies. ``It's not as feature-driven as it
used to be ... we're seeing a lot more in TV and commercials,'' he
added. ``The whole industry is constantly going through a change
and we're in the very little baby steps of where digital technology
is going.''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that although the major studios perform at
least half of the post-production work themselves, the industry is
highly fragmented with nearly 2,000 individual firms in California.
In Los Angeles County, for example, 91 percent of ``post houses''
have fewer than 20 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Milnes said growth has been taking place both amid the largest
operators, with firms like Burbank-based Four Media and Todd-AO
buying up smaller rivals, and at the entry level. ``There are all
kinds of niche companies popping up that specialize in areas like
audio restoration or smoke and fire,'' she said. ``You also see
midsized companies beefing up divisions as work comes in. There are
changes all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kutchaver, president of Burbank-based Flat Earth
Productions, noted that his company has survived and grown over the
past six years by focusing on growth on the edges of the business
such as providing special effects for ``Hercules'' and ``Xena.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest expansion in the industry has been in TV,'' he
said. ``There are only so many big feature projects and we've been
doing quite well by not grabbing for the big brass ring but six
smaller rings. So we always bought what we could afford and if we
need to work 10 times faster, we hire 10 more people.''

HOWS TO OPEN SECOND FOOD STORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A partnership of former Hughes Family Markets
executives will take its next step toward reviving the chain's
spirit today with the opening of a second HOWS Markets store.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say HOWS targets the same middle-class customers that
supported the Hughes chain, and the new company's leadership
includes Roger K. Hughes, the former chairman and chief executive
officer of Hughes Family Markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to some of our roots,'' said Mark Oerum, a
partner in the new company and a former Hughes vice president.
``We're just back at work and having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The 41,000-square-foot Santa Clarita store is the largest to
date for the HOWS Markets chain, which opened its first store in
Granada Hills in May. Officials say they hope to open another store
in Pasadena this August.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clarita store opens today at 19331 Soledad Canyon Road
at 7a.m.; a ribbon-cutting ceremony is planned for 10a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The new store is in a familiar area for the four former Hughes
executives _ Hughes, Oerum, David Wolff and Steve Strickler _ whose
last initials form the acronym HOWS.
</P>
<P>
   The site is across the street from a former Hughes store that
was converted into a Ralphs last year. The conversion occurred
after both chains were purchased by Portland-based Fred Meyer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a presence in Santa Clarita,'' said Oerum, who
was vice president of operations for Hughes. ``We think Santa
Clarita has the clientele we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   And locating near a former Hughes store could draw shoppers who
remember the chain.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clarita resident Virginia Petters said she was a longtime
customer at the former Hughes. She continued to shop there after
Ralphs took over the store, but she said she probably will move
across the street if HOWS can duplicate the Hughes model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always really liked Hughes,'' she said. ``I haven't
gotten used to the changeover (to Ralphs).''
</P>
<P>
   The new store's offerings include home delivery, organic
produce, fresh seafood and a large nutrition section with vitamins
and other natural-foods products.
</P>
<P>
   But HOWS officials say they want customer service to be their
biggest selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff said increasing consolidation in the grocery industry _
including the recently-approved merger between American Stores and
Albertson's _ leaves an opening for smaller operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that it's a good opportunity for the smaller company
to focus on quality and service,'' Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has had little trouble finding employees eager
to help it compete.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,500 people applied for about 130 jobs at the two stores,
and many applicants were veterans of other supermarket chains, said
Oerum.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby businesses say they already are feeling the benefits of
the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just from having cars in the parking lot, business has picked
up substantially,'' said James McDonald, store manager for
AutoZone, an automobile parts store located next to the new HOWS.
``The whole complex has picked up again.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

SWOON COMES EARLY FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ What did Yogi Berra say about the outfield shadows at
Yankee Stadium _ ``It gets late early out here''?
</P>
<P>
   Yogi should sneak a peek at Edison Field this week, when it has
gotten late so early, it feels like September in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are taking care of their late-season swoon before the
All-Star break this year, rolling over 9-1 Monday and 5-0 Tuesday
night against the Texas Rangers in what looks painfully like last
fall's American League West-deciding series sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure nobody's thinking about last year,'' losing
pitcher Omar Olivares said Tuesday night _ but if they're not,
their collective memory has failed as badly as their hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Dating back to those three losses, the Angels have been
outscored by the Rangers at Edison 39-4 and, pardon our own memory
lapse, it's hard to recall why everybody was so optimistic about
this series.
</P>
<P>
   Yet first-place Texas had come to town looking strangely
vulnerable to last-place Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were on a six-losses-in-nine-games slide and trying
to digest the undignified image of their 55-year-old pitching coach
breaking a hip rollerblading in the stadium parking lot. The Angels
were on a four-game winning streak more or less coinciding with the
return of shortstop and clubhouse conscience Gary DiSarcina and the
overdue announcement of manager Terry Collins' contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   This was to be the start of the Angels' scramble back into the
race after two months of weak hitting, injuries and... more
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody, somewhere, dared to mention the possibility of a
three-game sweep, which would have put the Angels 3{ games out of
first, a stone's throw even if Todd Hundley were the thrower.
</P>
<P>
   And then reality hit Anaheim like a 500-foot home run as Chuck
Finley unwisely tried to out-macho the Texas hitters with fastballs
Monday and Olivares lost his sinker Tuesday and the putative aces
of the Angels staff went down against journeymen Mike Morgan and
John Burkett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of momentum, a lot of confidence going for us. We
thought we had a chance to make up some ground,'' Finley said.
``(Monday) we got pushed back to the end of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday they showed they'd absorbed the loud message: There's a
class standout in the Angels' division and it's not the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   They banged out one hit against Burkett and two relievers, who
retired the last 19 Angels hitters. They got this kind of
leadership from Mo Vaughn: strikeout, strikeout, strikeout, on the
heels of Monday's fly ball, strikeout, double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is go after 'em again (tonight),'' Collins was
reduced to saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' immediate task is to get out of dead last. Their
next job is to send a faith healer after right fielder Tim Salmon
(sprained left wrist, out since May 4) and center fielder Jim
Edmonds (right shoulder surgery, out since opening night); ``no
timetable'' for the return of either, according to Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Their next order of business should be to campaign for the
Rangers' removal from the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I see the Rangers, which is when they play the
Angels, I wonder why this team isn't better.
</P>
<P>
   Why they aren't (begin ital)more(end ital) than 11 games over
.500, where they stand on the last morning of June. Why they can't
get past round one of the playoffs, which the club with the most
.500-plus seasons (seven) in the AL this decade failed to do in '96
and '98.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of their batting order _ Ivan Rodriguez, Rusty Greer,
Juan Gonzalez and Rafael Palmeiro _ shames any opponent.
</P>
<P>
   If their nine hitters Monday and Tuesday duplicated their best
major-league seasons, they'd have a lineup averaging .307, 24
homers, 94 runs and 97 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez hit his first-inning homer off Finley with a swing as
casual as one of Fred Couples' warmups.It's frightening to think
what these guys could do with a complete team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we haven't been as consistent as we'd probably
like to be,'' said Todd Zeile, the Rangers third baseman who hit 31
homers for the Dodgers in 1997 before being bundled in the Mike
Piazza trade.
</P>
<P>
   The past 17 games have included two three-game winning streaks
and losing streaks of four, four and two games.
</P>
<P>
   More unfortunately, the Rangers are weighted down by their
infield defense and their starting rotation, in both cases the
league's worst.
</P>
<P>
   Vulnerable? Yeah, the Angels might have thought so, catching
them as they have in the midst of a grinding month that finds the
Rangers playing 26 out of 32 games on the road before the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Monday, Gonzalez's easy 2-iron, nine Rangers runs
against Finley, and the sight of fans fleeing into the Orange
County darkness after the fifth inning. Then came Tuesday, and the
wonder that 22,274 came back for more.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates had an encouraging word for those
Anaheim fans who get the idea Texas is unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them to contact the Yankees fans _ 'cause we can't beat
(begin ital)them(end ital),'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Or tell them the unpleasant truth: That here at Edison Field,
where the shadows stretch all the way to autumn, they might be
right. &QL;

M'S WIN WITH (SURPRISE) PITCHING, DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The Mariners won a game Tuesday night in which
they did not have an extra-base hit, went seven consecutive innings
without a hit and got no hits at all from the first three batters
in their order.
</P>
<P>
   What's that old saying about pitching and defense winning games?
</P>
<P>
   The M's beat the Oakland Athletics 2-1 in 12 innings, getting
nine innings from a starter for the first time all year. They also
got three dominating innings from their bullpen, three double plays
and a clutch hitting-and-baserunning tandem from an unheralded duo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a good ballgame all the way around,'' said manager
Lou Piniella, whose team won for the first time this year without
benefit of an extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   John Halama went nine innings, allowing one run on eight hits.
But he was gone by the time Raul Ibanez drove in Charles Gipson on
a one-out single off T.J. Mathews in the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Gipson was running for Edgar Martinez, who singled to start the
inning for the Mariners' first hit since the fourth. He was
sacrificed to second by David Segui, the first sacrifice bunt for
the M's first baseman since 1995. Ibanez followed with a rope to
center that hung in the air a bit. Gipson never hesitated, charging
home for the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone else may not have read that ball that well, but he's a
great baserunner and he showed that tonight,'' Ibanez said. ``I
thought it was (a hit) at first, but it had a lot of backspin, and
it hung up a lot longer than I thought. Fortunately, Charles just
got a great read on it.''
</P>
<P>
   It made a winner of Jose Paniagua, who threw two scoreless
innings, walking none and striking out three, in relief of Halama.
Paniagua, who had been depending on his fastball too much in recent
weeks, changed his grip on his slider, and used the pitch
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa came on to close the 12th for his 17th save in 19
chances, overcoming a two-out, dropped pop fly by shortstop Alex
Rodriguez, who stared blankly into his locker after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's 12th-inning misplay had no bearing on the outcome,
but his first-inning highlight play did.
</P>
<P>
   Halama allowed a leadoff single to Tony Phillips, but was
quickly bailed out by a brilliant double play started by Rodriguez.
Miguel Tejada smashed a grounder up the middle, where Rodriguez
dove for it and _ in one horizontal motion _ shoveled it from his
glove to second baseman David Bell, who stepped on second and fired
to first for the second out. Matt Stairs popped out to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big save,'' Halama said. ``I didn't help myself by
falling behind 3-0, and it was a 3-1 count (to Tejada). I had to
come with a fastball, and I got it on the ground. Alex made the
dive and gets the double play. (Not making that play) could have
turned the whole tables around.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third, the A's loaded the bases with nobody out on a walk
and two infield singles. Phillips came up and hit a comebacker,
which Halama tossed home and Dan Wilson threw to first for a 1-2-3
double play. Tejada ended the inning with a fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and one out in the fifth,
Phillips grounded into an inning-ending double play, started by
Bell at second.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out of danger allowed Halama to last nine innings,
before being lifted in the 10th after 120 pitches. It was his
longest outing as a Mariner, and though he didn't get the win, the
rookie left-hander did lower his ERA to 2.85 in his seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always trying to get ground balls,'' Halama said. ``I
don't want to give up any pop flies. I always want to get ground
balls, especially when they've got runners on base to get the
double play ball. It says a lot for our ballclub that we're capable
of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners ranked second in the American League in double
plays coming into Tuesday's game, and now have 92 this year.
</P>
<P>
   The A's got their only run off Halama in the seventh. Jason
Giambi led off with a single, and Tim Raines negated the
ground-ball double play by sacrificing him to second. Catcher Ramon
Hernandez, making his major league debut, singled home Giambi
before Halama ended the inning by getting two fly outs.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Mariners had scored their only run off A's
right-hander Mike Oquist, who held them to five hits in a
season-high seven innings. The run came in the second, when Wilson
singled in Bell with two outs. The Mariners might have had more,
but Segui was thrown out stealing third during Wilson's at-bat.
Bell did take second on the play, putting him in scoring position
when Wilson rapped his hit up the middle.

DODGERS LOSE IN 12TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Dodgers left the Bay Area _ home to the X Games
_ after winning two of three last weekend against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While fighting through traffic and what-not, they must've gotten
a peek at the wall climbing competition because they clung on for
dear life through jams in the ninth, 10th and 11th innings Tuesday
night in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Then they lost their grip and fell. In the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Jackson's RBI single with none out in the bottom of the
12th lifted the Padres to a 4-3 win against the Dodgers at Qualcomm
Stadium in the opener of a three-game series. The Padres tied a
club record with their 11th straight win.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres (36-38) have won five straight against the Dodgers
and six of seven against them this season. The Dodgers (34-40)
remain in last place in the NL West, one-half game behind Colorado.
They had five hits off six San Diego pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Davis led off the bottom of the 12th and reached on
defensive replacement Craig Counsell's error at second base. Carlos
Baerga walked and Jackson singled just inside the left-field line
to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers second baseman Eric Young appeared disappointed at being
replaced defensively, though he wouldn't talk about it. But after
watching the Padres get plenty of breaks, he did address how the
Dodgers can do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play to win instead of playing not to lose,'' Young said.
``They played to win. First and second and the pitcher gets a hit
instead of bunting. That was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   That play _ Andy Ashby pulling back from a sacrifice bunt to
single past the vacated shortstop spot _ was prefaced by a bad-hop
grounder that turned a possible double-play ball into a single and
a first-and-second, none-out situation. Ashby's hit tied the score
3-3 after the Dodgers took 2-0 and 3-1 leads thanks to a Todd
Hundley two-run homer in the first inning and a run on a passed
ball in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the only huge play the Padres made. Center
fielder Ruben Rivera, who entered the game as a pinch hitter in the
bottom of the eighth, robbed Eric Karros of a homer in the top of
the ninth and Rivera again chased down a Dave Hansen line drive in
the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would think the pitcher would get a hit there?'' shortstop
Jose Vizcaino said. ``That's why they've won 11 in a row. Things
are going their way. Rivera, he just came in as a pinch hitter and
comes out and saved the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also didn't wilt despite wasting glorious chances,
beginning with the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Magadan began the inning off Alan Mills with a single to
right. Quilvio Veras tried to sacrifice the runner to second, and
Adrian Beltre couldn't come up with it. Mills did, throwing wildly
to first to allow the runners to move to second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens was intentionally walked to load the bases and Reggie
Sanders hit a soft liner to left that Gary Sheffield caught as he
fell. Pinch-runner Woody Williams tried to score but was thrown out
when Beltre cut off the throw and threw to Hundley at the plate for
the double play. Rivera flied out to center to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres again could have scored the winning run off Mills in
the 10th when Baerga doubled with two outs. Jackson and Phil Nevin
walked to load the bases for the second straight inning. But Veras
grounded to second to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego had two runners on in the 11th, but reliever Mike
Maddux got Wally Joyner to ground into a double play to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad-hop bounce on a ground ball that could have been a double
play, things like that,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``When you're winning like that, things fall in your lap.''

BURKETT STOPS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ For a team that isn't supposed to have much pitching,
the Texas Rangers came to town and pitched like Cy Young himself
the past two nights.
</P>
<P>
   One night after Mike Morgan's complete-game victory, John
Burkett _ who entered the game with one victory and a 7.20 ERA this
season _ threw seven shutout innings while allowing only one hit in
the Rangers' 5-0 victory Tuesday night before 22,274 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels went into Tuesday's game with the worst offense in
the American League, ranking last in runs, doubles, triples, RBI,
walks, stolen bases, slugging percentage and on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   It was Burkett's longest outing of the season, but that's not
saying much. Burkett (2-3) missed time with a shoulder injury and
spent some time in the bullpen. But following a two-out walk in the
third inning, Burkett retired the last 13 hitters he faced before
giving way to Jeff Zimmerman to start the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman pitched a perfect eighth and John Wetteland followed
with a perfect ninth as the Angels finished with a season-low one
hit, the final 19 batters of the game having been retired.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers pitchers were perfect for eight of the nine innings,
the only Angels baserunners coming in the third inning on a double
by Matt Walbeck and a walk by Darin Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have more problems with guys with good
changeups,'' said Angels manager Terry Collins, whose team fell 8{
games behind the AL West-leading Rangers. ``But I don't care who
you face on a nightly basis, you've got to go up with some kind of
a plan and try to carry it out. John Burkett went out with a plan
tonight and carried it out. We didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   After striking out for the third time, Mo Vaughn was booed in
the seventh as he walked back to the dugout. Erstad also struck out
three times, his hitting streak ending at eight.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have played the Rangers well the past two seasons
when the games didn't seem to matter much. But when the series was
played up, the Angels have disappeared. They've been outscored 14-1
in the first two games of the series, looking like a team that
can't handle pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a series you should get excited about,'' Vaughn
said. ``It's not a pressure-packed situation. It's something you
should enjoy being in. It's why I'm disappointed in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, the Angels were in the game until Juan
Gonzalez smashed a two-out, three-run homer off Mark Petkovsek in
the eighth inning, turning a 2-0 game into a seemingly
impossible-to-overcome 5-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had at least one baserunner in every inning and at
least one hit in every inning but the first and ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Omar Olivares (6-6) sailed through the first
three innings, allowing two singles and a walk. But a walk to
Gonzalez leading off the fourth spelled trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro and Todd Zeile followed with singles, loading
the bases for Lee Stevens. Stevens hit a sacrifice fly to center
for the first run of the game, and Roberto Kelly's bloop single to
right drove in another run for a 2-0 Rangers lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make things happen,'' Vaughn said. ``Just two
days ago we were playing solid baseball. I know I've got mechanical
problems right now that I have to work through. Overall, I don't
think we're looking past people. We know we've got to win games and
get ourselves back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since scoring four runs in the first inning against the A's on
Sunday, the Angels have scored one run in their last 25 innings.
Going back to last season, the Rangers have now won five in a row
at Edison Field, outscoring the Angels by a combined 39-4.

 &HT;    Welcome to the club, Columba
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Whenever I meet my chic friend outside
our favorite store, and she's putting a package in the trunk of her
car, I know she's just bought herself another outfit.
</P>
<P>
   I also know the package likely will remain in the trunk until
her thrifty husband is away from home. Only then will she take her
irresistible bargain into the house and tuck it in the back of her
closet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day or night, when she's looking especially fetching,
he will remark how wonderful she looks and ask the perpetually
predictable husband-to-wife question: ``Is that new?''
</P>
<P>
   Being truthful, she will reply, ``This has been in my closet a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied that his love is equally thrifty, he will feel so
proud that she can dress elegantly for every occasionwithout being
excessively extravagant like some of her friends. Both will be
happy.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend has a thing for shoes. Perhaps, as a child, she
suffered some trauma during the Second World War that causes her to
hoard shoes like they're going to be rationed again. Whatever the
cause, she buys more than she will ever wear. To shield her husband
from her addiction, she stores shoeboxes under the bed, in the
guest room, in the garage. So far, he seems oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you're probably thinking that these cases are classic
examples of wasteful wives deceiving clueless husbands, or female
fashion fanatics gone berserk. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is more profound than licentious economics or
ruthless deception. What we have here is a tacit agreement between
consenting adults not to communicate about the vagaries of women's
shopping, a concept most men can never fully grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Ever aware of this reality, I find myself in the unprecedented
position of defending a Republican governor's wife against the
slings and arrows of partisan, political criticism. I resent that
such pundits are smirking at the tribulations of Florida first lady
Columba Bush. In her defense, I urge that they get a grip and leave
the poor woman alone.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're one of the few people on the planet who hasn't
heard, let me explain. Columba Bush had the shopping spree to die
for: five days, alone, in Paris. She had hardly arrived back home
in Tallahassee, however, when the press dealt her the most taxing
embarrassment: It announced to the world how much the little woman
had spent shopping.
</P>
<P>
   While passing through customs at the Atlanta airport, Mrs. Bush,
a seasoned shopper and international traveler, did not declare, as
is required, all of her purchases abroad. U.S. Customs allows
travelers to bring $400 worth of merchandise into the country
duty-free.
</P>
<P>
   When her bags were searched, customs agents discovered clothing
and jewelry worth $19,000. The value was easily assessed since
receipts were in her passport. To the lady's credit, she quickly
wrote a check for the $4,100 fine, three times what she would have
been required to pay had she 'fessed up in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation coming out of the Governor's Mansion that I find
most credible is that her primary goal was to keep the amount of
her purchases from her hubby. Had she written a check for the true
amount, the governor might have known just how much of a spree it
was.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb says that he loves his wife and that what happened is
now a private matter between the two of them. For the first time,
the man has dealt with a controversial issue in a way I can relate
to.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mrs. Bush, her punishment is more than cruel. And not
just because of the triple fine or the humiliation of having her
indiscretion heralded around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's because, for the duration of her husband's political
career, she won't be able to say in response to a compliment: ``I
bought it in Paris.''

 &HT;    Drive-in rekindles childhood memories
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As the credits rolled on the new Tarzan movie,
the kids in the row in front of us at the Skyborn Cruise-In
clambered on top of the van, beat their chests and belted out a
lusty Tarzan yell.
</P>
<P>
   I nudged Jim and said with satisfaction, ``I have a feeling
we're not at Showcase any more.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't have stadium seating and 16 screens, but only at the
drive-in can you bellow the Tarzan yell. Only at the drive-in can
you pack the kids in the car in their PJs. Only at the drive-in can
you say what you like without being shushed. Only at the drive-in
can half the family fall asleep and snore with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   The cinemas can be comfortable, luxurious even, but going to the
drive-in can still be an event, an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   They seem so much a part of the landscape of another era, you
almost forget they're there. Until summer comes, the new Disney
movie arrives, and it's time for the drive-in.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you have to remind yourself to go. The typical
drive-in is a mom-and-pop operation, with a limited advertising
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get there, you wonder why you don't go more often. It's
a chance to relive your own childhood while creating memories for
your kids.
</P>
<P>
   Jim grew up in one of those draconian households where soda pop
and candy were not distributed liberally. Bedtimes and behavioral
codes were strictly enforced. The one exception: drive-in nights.
The Coke was put on ice, the candy bars packed, the popcorn popped
over the stove (none of that namby-pamby Microwave stuff) and
stashed in brown paper bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to the drive-in had a Christmas feeling to it,'' Jim
said, ``a feeling of something out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd get into his PJs and vow not to fall asleep, to make it
through the late-late feature. By the beginning of the second
feature, he invariably crashed in the back of the station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   There are those other drive-in memories, of course, which Jim
and I, high school wallflowers that we were, failed to take proper
advantage of. ``It was an adventure to go to the drive-in, even
more so on a date,'' recalled one friend. ``Being a Catholic girl,
I started much too late, but going to the drive-in turned into a
coming-of-age rite for some people.''
</P>
<P>
   The drive-in audience seems to be mostly families these days,
with a minimum of the passion-pit activity so common in my high
school years. A scientific survey of my high school-age baby
sitters confirmed my hypothesis: Kids may go together in groups,
but the drive-in is no longer a hot date ticket. Too many bugs, too
few screens.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, there is talk of a drive-in revival, but
local and national trends indicate otherwise. Two years ago, the
Belmont Auto Drive-In breathed its last, after 50 years in
business. Today, only the Dixie Drive-In, the Melody 49 Twin
Drive-In, the Skyborn Cruise-In near Fairborn and the Park Lane
Drive-in are left.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids told me they had never been to the drive-in. Maybe the
drive-in movie _ a tradition begun 66 years ago this summer in
Camden, N.J. _ will slowly go the way of the silent movie.
</P>
<P>
   I hope not. This summer, do your part to keep this piece of
Americana alive. Make one less trip to the multiplex and visit an
old friend.
</P>
<P>
   All in favor, give a Tarzan yell.
</P>

 &HT;    When nice gets us nowhere, we have to get mean
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I'm waiting on a call from my insurance
company. Day after day, week after week, month after month _ six
months in all _ I sit and wait for the right person to light up my
line.
</P>
<P>
   And after I complete these productive work days, I go home and
pick up the mail and listlessly go through letter after letter,
always in search of a long white envelope with an authentic
insurance-settlement check inside.
</P>
<P>
   I'm told my case, No. 98-100085, is a ``sticky one.'' I suspect
this is double-secret insurance company spy code for get lost.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I could quit my job and make our car accident my
full-time gig. Or I could marry Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   See, the real problem here is not that a young woman ran a red
light three days after Christmas and sent us flying across the
horizon. The real problem isn't even that she went to court and got
the ticket thrown out and now it's looking like her company doesn't
want to pay up.
</P>
<P>
   No, the real problem is that I can't get any answers being nice
so now I'm going to have to get mean. Nastiness, rudeness,
obsessive phone calling _ all of it gets results.
</P>
<P>
   Like now. Right here in this little spot, I wanted to tell you
about the number of people, like myself, who are sitting, waiting,
unhappy with the way their insurance claims have been handled. I
called the office of my insurance commissioner three hours ago, and
I still don't have what I need, even though I've been assured by
Patrick and Nina and somebody else that they've got what I need and
will give me what I need and will call me ``right back'' with what
I need. Still, no one's called but some guy who didn't like last
week's column. He was mean.
</P>
<P>
   Some people I know actually like these nasty consumer-rights
confrontations, most notably a certain ex-New Yorker who sits
opposite me at the office. This is a person who can get free Disney
World passes if he is not treated with the right color of kid
gloves at the podiatrist's office. In fact, his phone is ringing
right now, probably Michael Eisner calling to apologize about
something that didn't go quite right on the last Disney trip.
Meanwhile, my phone is silent.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, I thought perhaps the telephones at insurance
companies were equipped for only outgoing calls. I've heard of
weirder things. But then my dad had a little mishap with the Ford
LTD the other day, backed into some woman at the grocery store, and
the insurance company called my parents' apartment that very day.
Twice before dinner, and they eat at 4!
</P>
<P>
   If this lousy insurance claim is the worst thing that happens to
me all year, I'll be awfully lucky, I know. It's the bigger picture
that unnerves me. Shouldn't we be bothered by the fact that
niceness and politeness and sweetness don't get us anywhere any
more?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people write to me and tell me I'm too liberal.
Sometimes they write to say how brilliant I've become. This week,
though, I'd appreciate phone calls. Like I said, my lines are wide
open.
</P>
<P>
   Plus I want to practice my newfound meanness. On you.

 &HT;    The Hindenberg: What a young girl saw
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Thousands watched the last, slow dance
of the dirigible Hindenburg as it bobbed through the stormy sky
over New York City in the late afternoon of May 6, 1937.
</P>
<P>
   The pride of the Zeppelin Company's air fleet was already more
than 10 hours late completing its first flight of the season from
Germany, but the captain was in no hurry. He'd decided to circle
and wait for a break in the weather to ensure the sort of smooth,
pinpoint descent that had ended each of the Hindenburg's 10
previous flights to America.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of welcomers and sightseers waited southeast of the city
at the ship's destination, the U.S. Navy's air station at
Lakehurst, N.J. Among the eager greeters were the Enssle family of
nearby Roselle Park, including 13-year-old Eleanor.
</P>
<P>
   She was excited about the impending arrival of her uncle, Eugen
Schauble, an engineer in the Hindenburg's control room. He had
already purchased a ticket to bring Eleanor with him on the return
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Just as thrilling for Eleanor was the prospect of seeing the
airship's young cook, Alfred Groezinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was smitten the first time I saw him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She had seen the Hindenburg and its crew many times; her uncle
and several others often stayed at the family's home. The enormous,
rigid airship had become a familiar but still fascinating sight
along the New Jersey coast.
</P>
<P>
   Gleaming silver, with black swastikas towering on its upper and
lower tailfins, the Hindenburg looked like an enormous torpedo.
Filled with explosive hydrogen, it was just as deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Zeppelins, dirigibles _ by whatever name, passenger airships
were counterparts to the most luxurious ocean liners. Germany's
Hindenburg was the biggest, most powerful ever.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800 feet long, it is still one of the largest machines
ever to fly. It would dwarf a Boeing 727 (a mere 153 feet long) and
was not much shorter than the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   And it was hardly light, weighing more than 100 tons. Even so,
it held little more than 100 people, most of them crew. But it was
(ITALIC) fast (END ITALIC): The Hindenburg's four Mercedes-Benz
engines could propel it across the Atlantic at more than 80 miles
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   That made it the Concorde of its day, capable of making the
crossing in 2 1/2 days with a little help from the winds. That beat
the oceanliners below by nearly two days. It beat heavier-than-air
planes by two years; Pan Am didn't start the first regular
tran-Atlantic passenger service until 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindenburg's return flight was already booked, with many of
the 79 ticket holders planning to attend the coronation of
England's King George VI. Their bags were being weighed and sorted
for the expected midnight departure when the Hindenburg sailed into
view.
</P>
<P>
   A light rain swept across the field as the airship's nose
dropped toward the mooring mast. Passengers in the glass-lined
observation deck along the ship's belly waved to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ship could be secured and winched to the ground, it
burst into flames. The Hindenburg was engulfed in half a minute.
This is the scene recalled by young Eleanor Enssle, now Eleanor
Zarr of Palm Harbor, Florida:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy crew hustled about the huge mast as the Hindenburg
approached. I was so excited that I told my mother and father that
I was going to get as close as they would allow me to go with our
special passes. They laughed and said, 'OK.'
</P>
<P>
   They remained at the hangar while I ran, with many others, to a
spot very close to the landing area. When the Hindenburg came into
sight, everyone cheered and waved.
</P>
<P>
   The huge airship was almost standing still when the front lines
were dropped. At that moment, a muffled explosion could be heard.
Fire spread rapidly. Everyone screamed in panic, and people on
board began to jump from the windows.
</P>
<P>
   It was nighmarish. Burning debris began falling toward us. We
had to turn and run toward the hangar. The stench of burning flesh
was everywhere. Some of the passengers were running from the ship
with their clothing and hair on fire.
</P>
<P>
   I was screaming as I ran. I felt I would wake up in a minute and
find that it was all a terrible dream. I tried to find my parents
in this mass confusion, while Navy ambulances and fire trucks tried
to help where they could.
</P>
<P>
   As I looked back at the ship, it was a twisted skeleton melting
from the intense heat of the fire. People were still running from
the wreckage, some having jumped from quite a height at the front
of the ship, which had come down tail first.
</P>
<P>
   I finally found my parents near the hangar. My mother was
hysterical and my dad was crying. As some of the survivors were
ushered into the hangar, we spotted some of the crew members and
asked about my uncle. Several of them said they had seen him jump
from the cat walk around one of the engines as the ship began to
roll in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   One said he had run back into the ship to help. Another said he
saw him running in another direction in a confused state. We
searched frantically and waited for news about survivors, as
ambulances and fire trucks came from surrounding towns.
</P>
<P>
   Someone from the Navy suggested we go to the base hospital,
where the wounded had been taken. We found our car and started to
drive the long road to the hospital. People were running in every
direction. It was dark, and our headlights shone on a figure
wandering through the weeds at the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   My mother screamed: ``Stop the car. That's Eugen up ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, it was my uncle, in a state of shock. As soon as he
saw my mother, he started crying. We put him in the car and took
him to the hospital. That was a sight I will never forget.
Survivors were everywhere. Their conditions ranged from slightly
injured to severely burned. We saw so many of the crew we knew. It
was tragic.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that I learned Freddy Groezinger had survived, but
had burns and was already in another hospital. The doctors examined
my uncle. He had some burns on his face but was discharged in our
care. He was saved from severe burns by his tight, leather helmet
and leather jacket, which were singed black on one side.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to console him because he had lost so many of
his comrades, especially Willie Dimmler. Dimmler had taken his
place in the control room so that my uncle could go out on the
catwalk to look for us.
</P>
<P>
   It was from the catwalk that he jumped to the ground. He tried
to go back to the ship to help, but the heat made him turn away.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Eleanor's uncle recovered from his injuries and lived for
many years. Alfred Groezinger is still alive, in Germany. He and
Eleanor married other mates but remain friends and have visited
several times.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 64 of the 97 passengers and crew members escaped the
Hindenburg. Flights of its sister ship, the Graf Zeppelin, were
halted immediately while investigators from both sides of the ocean
tried to find the catastrophe's cause.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments continue. Some still suspect sabotage; others
blame lightning. Whatever the spark's source, every expert agreed
that hydrogen was the fatal ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even that is being challenged by research that suggests the
fire actually spread through the chemically treated cotton fabric
stretched over the Hindenburg's aluminum frame.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the Hindenburg's fiery end, advertisements hit
the papers along with the horrifying pictures.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first or greatest dirigible disaster: 73 died when
the U.S. Navy's Akron crashed in a storm in 1933; 46 died when
Britain's R-101 exploded over France in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   But public horror at film of the Hindenburg's near-instant
disintegration _ and the emotional, endlessly replayed account of
radio reporter Herbert Morrison (``Oh, the humanity . . . '') _
insured that it would be the last.
</P>
<P>
   The Zeppelin Company built a replacement for the Hindenburg, but
it never carried a passenger. It was turned into scrap during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   A short video clip of the Hindenburg fire, plus audio of the
radio broadcast, are posted on the World Wide Web:

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 1)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>
<P>
   q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that President Clinton mobilized
33,000 men and women in April during the height of the NATO-led air
campaign against Yugoslavia. I can't find anything supporting this.
What units were involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: On April 27, Clinton authorized the Pentagon to activate
33,102 members of the National Guard and military reserves. The
Pentagon had made the request that same day in order to enable NATO
to expand its air armada and quicken the pace of its attacks,
according to Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   The 33,102 was the ``ceiling'' number whose activation was
approved, said Lt. Col. Mike Miloy of the Defense Department, but
the number actually mobilized was ``about 5,000.'' While they had
reported and some were in the ``alert phase'' and preparing for
deployment, the air campaign ended. When that happened, Miloy said,
the need for them to be fully activated disappeared, so the full
33,102 never were deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation recently
granted $10 million to 32 people. How does one apply for such a
grant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Recipients don't apply. They're nominated for the awards by
anonymous talent scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The national anthem used to be sung before every Major League
baseball game. Why don't we see that anymore?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're referring specifically to televised games, viewers
don't see and hear the anthem because it's usually performed before
the station's telecast begins. But fans at the stadium sould see
and hear it. And at games involving the Montreal Expos or Toronto
Blue Jays, fans would be treated to ``O Canada'' as well as ``The
Star Spangled Banner.'' So if you're concerned about the anthem
being eliminated before every game, it hasn't been. You just don't
often get it on television.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that a Confederate submarine, the Hunley, was
found underneath the football stadium at The Citadel in Charleston,
S.C. How did it come to rest there?
</P>
<P>
   A: The wreckage of the Hunley, a nine-man sub built from an old
locomotive boiler, is under 30 feet of silt and water off the Isle
of Palms near Charleston. What was discovered under a section of
asphalt just inside the Citadel stadium's cinderblock back wall was
the burial place of some of the Hunley's crew members, who died in
an accident. The Hunley had three sets of crew members, and this
was the first. The bodies were believed to have been buried in
Charleston's old Confederate naval cemetery, which was abandoned in
the late 1940s when the city built the stadium that now is home to
the Citadel Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How well is Social Security prepared to deal with possible
Y2K problems?
</P>
<P>
   A: The entire process for providing benefits _ from calculating
benefits to making payments _ is ready for the century date change,
according to the Social Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, the Treasury Department's Financial Management
Service began to issue monthly Social Security payments on systems
that had been fixed and tested, the agency says. Financial
Management Service maintains systems that each year make 860
million payments on behalf of SSA, the Department of Veterans
Affairs, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies. All the
systems were found to be ``Year 2000 compliant,'' with independent
verification and documentation, according to the SSA.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Adams, assistant deputy commissioner for SSA systems,
expressed the situation in a practical way: ``SSA will make it. We
cannot manually issue 50 million checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is ``The General's Daughter'' a true story or a piece of
fiction?
</P>
<P>
   A: The novel is fiction, but author Nelson DeMille, isn't saying
if the story has any basis in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A Nike commercial shows Tiger Woods using a golf club to
bounce a golf ball several times between his legs, and then he hits
it. Was this a computer-generated stunt?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the real thing, with no trick photography, said Nike
spokesman Mike Kelly. Woods did it ``on the spur of the moment,''
Kelly said, bouncing a ball on a sand wedge and then hitting it
``about 200 yards.'' Kelly said the TV spot was filmed in just four
takes at a golf course in Orlando.

<P>
   Q: Walt Disney's old ``Song of the South'' is my husband's
favorite movie. I understand that it's not available for sale on
video in this country, but can be found on international markets.
Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1946 film _ beloved by some who consider it a classic,
but condemned by others for what they consider a false portrayal of
blacks in a romanticized plantation setting of the fictional Old
South _ isn't available from routine sources such as Blockbuster
(1-800-800-6767) or video suppliers on the Internet such as
www.bigstar.com and www.reel.com.
</P>
<P>
   However, versions of it are listed on the Internet as being
available for mail-order purchase from a source in Florida. Note
that a fan Internet site includes a message that people have
complained about sending in their money and not receiving their
order in a timely fashion, so buyer beware. If you want to order
it, here's where: Ol' Remus Collectibles, P.O. Box 7554, Ensley, FL
32534-0554. The cost is $30 for a copy in English with Japanese
subtitles (originally released on the Japanese market), or $40 for
English without subtitles (originally released on the British
market).
</P>
<P>
   A possible alternative if you're interested only in music is a
26-minute video, ``Disney's Sing Along Songs,'' which includes
``Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah'' from ``Song of the South.'' It's available
for purchase on the Internet _ www.bigstar.com is one source _ and
may be available for rental at video stores.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about some deaths in connection with the
arthritis medicine Celebrex? My doctor said there's nothing to it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Officials at the Food and Drug Administration have confirmed
a report in The Wall Street Journal that the painkiller has been
linked to 10 deaths and 11 cases of gastrointestinal hemorrhages
during its first three months on the market. Despite the deaths,
the FDA isn't raising an alarm for the drug, which has been taken
by more than 2 million consumers. Robert DeLap, director of an FDA
office for drug evaluation, said more research is needed before
coming to a conclusion about the safety of Celebrex, which is
manufactured by St. Louis-based Monsanto Co.'s G.D. Searle &AMP; Co.
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both the FDA and Searle indicated that the ``safety
profile'' _ meaning the ``adverse event reports,'' or reports about
deaths, bleeding and ulcers _ were not out of line when related to
the total of 2.5 million prescriptions for Celebrex filled in its
first 13 weeks on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a steak dinner resting on this. Was Helen Keller
known to be a Communist or socialist? I say she was, but my husband
says not.
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1998 book ``Helen Keller: A Life,'' by Dorothy Herrmann,
confirms your belief. Consider this passage: ``Keller was in fact a
militant socialist who wrote and spoke openly about issues such as
the labor movement, civil rights and birth control, as well as her
admiration for Marx and Lenin. She yearned for marriage and
children and remained bitter that her plans to elope with a young
socialist were thwarted by her family.'' T-bone, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give me an address or a Web site where I can reach
Gary Bauer, who is running for president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mail can be sent to the Republican presidential contender at
this address: Bauer for President Inc., 2800 Shirlington Road,
Suite 900, Arlington, VA 22206. The Web site _ www.bauer2K.com/ _
has information, or you can call 703-933-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A pit crew member at the Indy 500 was struck by a race car.
Do you have an update?
</P>
<P>
   A: Steve Fried, crew chief for rookie driver Robby McGehee, was
released from an Indianapolis hospital June 13. The Mentor, Ohio,
crewman was working in McGehee's pit early in the May 30 race when
he was struck from behind by driver Jimmy Kite's car, which had
been hit by another car whose brakes had failed. Fried was thrown
into the air and fell face first on the concrete, fracturing his
skull, right eye socket, jaw, left shoulder, several ribs, and
bones in his ear. His brain was injured and his lungs collapsed.
Medical workers said he wasn't breathing when they reached him, and
his heart stopped en route to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Fried, who has begun physical therapy, says he hopes to return
to work later in the Indy Racing League season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is George W. Bush, who is running for the Republican
presidential nomination, the Bush who was involved in a savings and
loan scandal some years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It was Neil Bush, one of George W.'s brothers, who was a
figure in the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in
Colorado. Silverado failed in 1988, costing taxpayers an estimated
$1 billion. Although Neil Bush never was charged with criminal
wrongdoing, he agreed to pay $50,000 in 1992 to settle a civil
lawsuit lodged two years earlier by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some $10 million in ``genius grants'' was just awarded to 32
people by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Do you
have any details about the MacArthurs and the source of their
fortune?
</P>
<P>
   A: The foundation, which has been making the grants annually
since 1981, doesn't use the word ``genius.'' It prefers to think of
them as grants to people who are ``exceptionally talented and
promising individuals.'' Recipients, selected anonymously, have
five years to pursue whatever interests they desire, with no
strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, a private, independent grant-making institution,
is based in Chicago. It was created in 1978 by John D. MacArthur
(1897-1978), who developed and owned Bankers Life and Casualty Co.
and other businesses, as well as considerable property in Florida
and New York. Catherine MacArthur (1909-81), his wife, held
positions in many of these companies and served as director of the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's largest foundations, it has assets of $4
billion and makes grants totaling more than $150 million annually
through two major integrated programs (Human and Community
Development, and Global Security and Sustainability) and two
special programs (General Program, and MacArthur Fellows).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are people working inside buildings exposed to as much ozone
as those outdoors? In other words, are air handling systems able to
remove ozone from the outside air?
</P>
<P>
   A: While some filters in heating and cooling equipment collect
particles and dust, a gas such as ground-level ozone _ the major
culprit in ``smog alerts'' _ likely would travel through the system
in a similar concentration to that found outdoors, according to
environmental protection officials.
</P>
<P>
   But while some ozone from outside does get inside, levels don't
remain high for very long because air conditioners constantly turn
over the indoor air. Also, ozone indoors attaches itself quickly to
walls, furniture and other objects, futher reducing its levels in
the air. People sensitive to high ozone levels outdoors gain
another benefit by staying indoors: They're likely not to be as
active as if outdoors. The more active a person is, the heavier the
breathing and the greater the chances of sucking in greater volumes
of ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any place I can rent or buy a video of ``With a Song
in My Heart,'' starring Susan Hayward, which was made years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to be patient _ and watchful of the cable channel
American Movie Classics _ if you want to see the movie anytime
soon. It's not for sale or rental in a videotape version.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a Song in My Heart,'' which also featured Rory Calhoun,
David Wayne, Thelma Ritter and Robert Wagner, told the story of
Jane Froman, a singer who in 1943 was seriously injured in an
airplane crash off Portugal while on a USO tour to entertain U.S.
troops overseas.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox, the studio holding rights to the 1952 movie,
hasn't released it on video, according to Debra Dodds of American
Movie Classics. AMC has shown the film in the past, but its
broadcast rights expired in October. The cable channel is
renegotiating with 20th Century Fox for future broadcast rights,
however, so you might be able to catch it again later. The best way
to follow AMC's schedule in advance is through its monthly AMC
Magazine ($12.95 for 12 issues; 1-888-262-4700).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several photos published recently showed NATO and British
vehicles in the Yugoslavia war zones with an inverted V on the
front. What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The inverted V has no symbolism other than its utilitarian
function of being one tool in distinguishing friend from foe in
combat, according to SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers
Europe).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that all cars sold in Canada have daytime running
lights, whereas in the United States the choices are limited, such
as to some Saturns and Buicks. Can I order a car from Canada or buy
one there and bring it back?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't need to go to that trouble. And why risk running
afoul of U.S. Customs? Nor do you need an after-market adaption.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive experts say you can achieve the same effect _ the
added safety factor of making your vehicle more visible to others
during the day _ by turning your headlights on as soon as you start
the engine. The headlights on many rental cars in the United States
automatically come on when the ignition key is turned, and some
imports, such as Volvo, also incorporate the feature.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It has been reported that bald eagles have been taken off the
endangered species list. Do you have more details? What does that
mean? Can we now hunt them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The status of bald eagles will change, but they still can't
be hunted. The Clinton administration announced plans May 6 to
remove nearly 30 once-rare bird, animal and plant species from the
government's official ``endangered'' list _ the bald eagle among
them _ declaring victory in staving off their extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Both the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon, which also was
removed, were pushed to the brink of extinction by the use of
pesticides. Eagles also were victims of ranchers and farmers who
killed them, believing them to be marauders targeting their
chickens and domestic livestock.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports that there now are
more than 1,500 nesting pairs of falcons. In 1998, wildlife
officials counted 5,748 bald eagles and said that probably was an
``undercount.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1940 law, the Bald Eagle Protection Act, continues to protect
the bald eagle and its cousin, the golden eagle, from hunting and
other direct harm. What will change, once the bald eagle is
officially removed from the endangered list, is that there no
longer will be federal rules protecting its habitat. Those habitat
protection rules are part of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Prior to the wedding of Prince Edward to Sophie Rhys-Jones,
it was speculated that Queen Elizabeth would bestow the title of
duke and duchess upon them. Instead, she made them earl and
countess of Wessex. What is the pecking order among British lords,
dukes, counts and others? Can one ``step up'' to a more desirable
title?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``pecking order'' starts, of course, with royalty (Queen
Elizabeth and her family). The highest heriditary title outside the
royal family is duke, ranking immediately below a prince, and above
a marquess. A marquess is a nobleman ranking above an earl (or
count), while an earl is a nobleman ranking above a viscount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepping up'' in title is rarely an issue, according to the
British consulate in Atlanta, although it has happened on occasion,
such as when Princess Anne was given the title princess royal for
her charitable work. But then she has royal blood anyway, so that's
not exactly ``moving up.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest son of a duke and duchess, incidentally, is a lord
with the rank of marquess, and younger sons and daughters are
called lords and ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the ``57'' refer to in Heinz 57?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just a slogan, hit upon by Henry John Heinz in 1896,
even though at the time his company (then known as Heinz &AMP; Noble)
made 60 products.
</P>
<P>
   The Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins says the famous
slogan came from a billboard Heinz had seen in New York referring
to ``21 Styles of Shoes.'' Heinz apparently believed that an odd
number would be more noticeable than 60, so 57 was chosen. The
Pittsburgh-based company, by the way, now makes more than 5,000
products.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We hear so much about automobiles putting pollution into the
air. Aren't aircraft at airports also a factor?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, aircraft are a ``significant contributor'' to ozone
problems, said Ronald Methier of the Georgia Environmental
Protection Division. Since many aircraft travel internationally,
their engines are subject to international standards rather than
those of the United States, which are more stringent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that a bronze casket used to carry
President Kennedy's body from Dallas to Washington had been dropped
into the Atlantic Ocean from a military plane years ago. This
information was just made public. Do you have any more details?
</P>
<P>
   A: The documents, released June 1 by the National Archives, said
the federal government was following the wishes of the Kennedy
family when it dumped the coffin into the Atlantic in 1966. Kennedy
family spokeswoman Melody Miller said the destruction of the casket
was appropriate and ``in keeping with the tradition of President
Kennedy's naval service and his love of the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, according to the documents, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy had
asked that the casket be released to the military for destruction,
saying, ``I think it belongs to the family and we can get rid of it
any way we want to.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18 that same year, an Air Force van picked up the casket
at the Archives and transported it to Andrews Air Force Base, Md.,
where it was loaded onto a C-130. To ensure that the coffin would
sink, three 80-pound bags of sand were put inside, metal banding
was wrapped around it, and it was placed inside a pine box which
also was wrapped with metal tape. The plane flew about 131 nautical
miles off the Maryland-Delaware coast, dropping the casket into
9,000 feet of water in an explosives dumping area.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that President Clinton mobilized
33,000 men and women in April during the height of the NATO-led air
campaign against Yugoslavia. I can't find anything supporting this.
What units were involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: On April 27, Clinton authorized the Pentagon to activate
33,102 members of the National Guard and military reserves. The
Pentagon had made the request that same day in order to enable NATO
to expand its air armada and quicken the pace of its attacks,
according to Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   The 33,102 was the ``ceiling'' number whose activation was
approved, said Lt. Col. Mike Miloy of the Defense Department, but
the number actually mobilized was ``about 5,000.'' While they had
reported and some were in the ``alert phase'' and preparing for
deployment, the air campaign ended. When that happened, Miloy said,
the need for them to be fully activated disappeared, so the full
33,102 never were deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation recently
granted $10 million to 32 people. How does one apply for such a
grant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Recipients don't apply. They're nominated for the awards by
anonymous talent scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The national anthem used to be sung before every Major League
baseball game. Why don't we see that anymore?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're referring specifically to televised games, viewers
don't see and hear the anthem because it's usually performed before
the station's telecast begins. But fans at the stadium sould see
and hear it. And at games involving the Montreal Expos or Toronto
Blue Jays, fans would be treated to ``O Canada'' as well as ``The
Star Spangled Banner.'' So if you're concerned about the anthem
being eliminated before every game, it hasn't been. You just don't
often get it on television.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that a Confederate submarine, the Hunley, was
found underneath the football stadium at The Citadel in Charleston,
S.C. How did it come to rest there?
</P>
<P>
   A: The wreckage of the Hunley, a nine-man sub built from an old
locomotive boiler, is under 30 feet of silt and water off the Isle
of Palms near Charleston. What was discovered under a section of
asphalt just inside the Citadel stadium's cinderblock back wall was
the burial place of some of the Hunley's crew members, who died in
an accident. The Hunley had three sets of crew members, and this
was the first. The bodies were believed to have been buried in
Charleston's old Confederate naval cemetery, which was abandoned in
the late 1940s when the city built the stadium that now is home to
the Citadel Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How well is Social Security prepared to deal with possible
Y2K problems?
</P>
<P>
   A: The entire process for providing benefits _ from calculating
benefits to making payments _ is ready for the century date change,
according to the Social Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, the Treasury Department's Financial Management
Service began to issue monthly Social Security payments on systems
that had been fixed and tested, the agency says. Financial
Management Service maintains systems that each year make 860
million payments on behalf of SSA, the Department of Veterans
Affairs, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies. All the
systems were found to be ``Year 2000 compliant,'' with independent
verification and documentation, according to the SSA.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Adams, assistant deputy commissioner for SSA systems,
expressed the situation in a practical way: ``SSA will make it. We
cannot manually issue 50 million checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is ``The General's Daughter'' a true story or a piece of
fiction?
</P>
<P>
   A: The novel is fiction, but author Nelson DeMille, isn't saying
if the story has any basis in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A Nike commercial shows Tiger Woods using a golf club to
bounce a golf ball several times between his legs, and then he hits
it. Was this a computer-generated stunt?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the real thing, with no trick photography, said Nike
spokesman Mike Kelly. Woods did it ``on the spur of the moment,''
Kelly said, bouncing a ball on a sand wedge and then hitting it
``about 200 yards.'' Kelly said the TV spot was filmed in just four
takes at a golf course in Orlando.
</P>
<P>

   Q: Some $10 million in ``genius grants'' was just awarded to 32
people by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Do you
have any details about the MacArthurs and the source of their
fortune?
</P>
<P>
   A: The foundation, which has been making the grants annually
since 1981, doesn't use the word ``genius.'' It prefers to think of
them as grants to people who are ``exceptionally talented and
promising individuals.'' Recipients, selected anonymously, have
five years to pursue whatever interests they desire, with no
strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, a private, independent grant-making institution,
is based in Chicago. It was created in 1978 by John D. MacArthur
(1897-1978), who developed and owned Bankers Life and Casualty Co.
and other businesses, as well as considerable property in Florida
and New York. Catherine MacArthur (1909-81), his wife, held
positions in many of these companies and served as director of the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's largest foundations, it has assets of $4
billion and makes grants totaling more than $150 million annually
through two major integrated programs (Human and Community
Development, and Global Security and Sustainability) and two
special programs (General Program, and MacArthur Fellows).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are people working inside buildings exposed to as much ozone
as those outdoors? In other words, are air handling systems able to
remove ozone from the outside air?
</P>
<P>
   A: While some filters in heating and cooling equipment collect
particles and dust, a gas such as ground-level ozone _ the major
culprit in ``smog alerts'' _ likely would travel through the system
in a similar concentration to that found outdoors, according to
environmental protection officials.
</P>
<P>
   But while some ozone from outside does get inside, levels don't
remain high for very long because air conditioners constantly turn
over the indoor air. Also, ozone indoors attaches itself quickly to
walls, furniture and other objects, futher reducing its levels in
the air. People sensitive to high ozone levels outdoors gain
another benefit by staying indoors: They're likely not to be as
active as if outdoors. The more active a person is, the heavier the
breathing and the greater the chances of sucking in greater volumes
of ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any place I can rent or buy a video of ``With a Song
in My Heart,'' starring Susan Hayward, which was made years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to be patient _ and watchful of the cable channel
American Movie Classics _ if you want to see the movie anytime
soon. It's not for sale or rental in a videotape version.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a Song in My Heart,'' which also featured Rory Calhoun,
David Wayne, Thelma Ritter and Robert Wagner, told the story of
Jane Froman, a singer who in 1943 was seriously injured in an
airplane crash off Portugal while on a USO tour to entertain U.S.
troops overseas.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox, the studio holding rights to the 1952 movie,
hasn't released it on video, according to Debra Dodds of American
Movie Classics. AMC has shown the film in the past, but its
broadcast rights expired in October. The cable channel is
renegotiating with 20th Century Fox for future broadcast rights,
however, so you might be able to catch it again later. The best way
to follow AMC's schedule in advance is through its monthly AMC
Magazine ($12.95 for 12 issues; 1-888-262-4700).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several photos published recently showed NATO and British
vehicles in the Yugoslavia war zones with an inverted V on the
front. What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The inverted V has no symbolism other than its utilitarian
function of being one tool in distinguishing friend from foe in
combat, according to SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers
Europe).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that all cars sold in Canada have daytime running
lights, whereas in the United States the choices are limited, such
as to some Saturns and Buicks. Can I order a car from Canada or buy
one there and bring it back?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't need to go to that trouble. And why risk running
afoul of U.S. Customs? Nor do you need an after-market adaption.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive experts say you can achieve the same effect _ the
added safety factor of making your vehicle more visible to others
during the day _ by turning your headlights on as soon as you start
the engine. The headlights on many rental cars in the United States
automatically come on when the ignition key is turned, and some
imports, such as Volvo, also incorporate the feature.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It has been reported that bald eagles have been taken off the
endangered species list. Do you have more details? What does that
mean? Can we now hunt them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The status of bald eagles will change, but they still can't
be hunted. The Clinton administration announced plans May 6 to
remove nearly 30 once-rare bird, animal and plant species from the
government's official ``endangered'' list _ the bald eagle among
them _ declaring victory in staving off their extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Both the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon, which also was
removed, were pushed to the brink of extinction by the use of
pesticides. Eagles also were victims of ranchers and farmers who
killed them, believing them to be marauders targeting their
chickens and domestic livestock.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports that there now are
more than 1,500 nesting pairs of falcons. In 1998, wildlife
officials counted 5,748 bald eagles and said that probably was an
``undercount.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1940 law, the Bald Eagle Protection Act, continues to protect
the bald eagle and its cousin, the golden eagle, from hunting and
other direct harm. What will change, once the bald eagle is
officially removed from the endangered list, is that there no
longer will be federal rules protecting its habitat. Those habitat
protection rules are part of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Prior to the wedding of Prince Edward to Sophie Rhys-Jones,
it was speculated that Queen Elizabeth would bestow the title of
duke and duchess upon them. Instead, she made them earl and
countess of Wessex. What is the pecking order among British lords,
dukes, counts and others? Can one ``step up'' to a more desirable
title?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``pecking order'' starts, of course, with royalty (Queen
Elizabeth and her family). The highest heriditary title outside the
royal family is duke, ranking immediately below a prince, and above
a marquess. A marquess is a nobleman ranking above an earl (or
count), while an earl is a nobleman ranking above a viscount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepping up'' in title is rarely an issue, according to the
British consulate in Atlanta, although it has happened on occasion,
such as when Princess Anne was given the title princess royal for
her charitable work. But then she has royal blood anyway, so that's
not exactly ``moving up.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest son of a duke and duchess, incidentally, is a lord
with the rank of marquess, and younger sons and daughters are
called lords and ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the ``57'' refer to in Heinz 57?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just a slogan, hit upon by Henry John Heinz in 1896,
even though at the time his company (then known as Heinz &AMP; Noble)
made 60 products.
</P>
<P>
   The Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins says the famous
slogan came from a billboard Heinz had seen in New York referring
to ``21 Styles of Shoes.'' Heinz apparently believed that an odd
number would be more noticeable than 60, so 57 was chosen. The
Pittsburgh-based company, by the way, now makes more than 5,000
products.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We hear so much about automobiles putting pollution into the
air. Aren't aircraft at airports also a factor?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, aircraft are a ``significant contributor'' to ozone
problems, said Ronald Methier of the Georgia Environmental
Protection Division. Since many aircraft travel internationally,
their engines are subject to international standards rather than
those of the United States, which are more stringent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that a bronze casket used to carry
President Kennedy's body from Dallas to Washington had been dropped
into the Atlantic Ocean from a military plane years ago. This
information was just made public. Do you have any more details?
</P>
<P>
   A: The documents, released June 1 by the National Archives, said
the federal government was following the wishes of the Kennedy
family when it dumped the coffin into the Atlantic in 1966. Kennedy
family spokeswoman Melody Miller said the destruction of the casket
was appropriate and ``in keeping with the tradition of President
Kennedy's naval service and his love of the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, according to the documents, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy had
asked that the casket be released to the military for destruction,
saying, ``I think it belongs to the family and we can get rid of it
any way we want to.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18 that same year, an Air Force van picked up the casket
at the Archives and transported it to Andrews Air Force Base, Md.,
where it was loaded onto a C-130. To ensure that the coffin would
sink, three 80-pound bags of sand were put inside, metal banding
was wrapped around it, and it was placed inside a pine box which
also was wrapped with metal tape. The plane flew about 131 nautical
miles off the Maryland-Delaware coast, dropping the casket into
9,000 feet of water in an explosives dumping area.

 &HT;    Gay devil, damned Ghandi: `Park' knows no limits
 &HT;    (EDS: Italics noted in story.)
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (ITALIC)BOOM! (END ITALIC)
</P>
<P>
   Hear that? That's the tasteless bar crashing to a woefully crude
new level. But what do you expect when you give the ``South Park''
creators 90 minutes (ITALIC) and (END ITALIC) an R-rating? That's
like letting a mischievous 5-year-old take over a day-care center_
the results won't be pretty, but they might be comical.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' will certainly please
die-hard fans. And on that criteria alone, the movie could be
considered a success.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, filmmakers Trey Parker and Matt Stone don't fall into
the trap of padding what's essentially a 30-minute cartoon.
Although the movie is laced with too many profanities, which grow
tiresome and annoying, the hilarious musical numbers and outrageous
sight gags are enough to keep you from checking your watch.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone know what their audience likes _ boorish,
foul-mouthed humor. Anything goes in the ``South Park'' world. And
``South Park'' doesn't just push the proverbial envelope, it shoves
it, kicks it and manhandles it.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone are nothing if not topical. Their four lovable
tykes_ Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny _ sneak into an R-rated movie,
the name of which we can't print. The film stars Terrence and
Phillip, two Canadian TV stars whose heads split in half when they
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the four kids love the movie _ and so do the other
kids in the small Colorado mountain town. But parents don't like
the effect it has on their children (they're _ gasp _ cursing at
their teachers!), so before you can say, ``Oh my God, they've
killed Kenny!'' the United States declares war on Canada and vows
to execute Terrence and Philip.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves plenty of time for gags. Brooke Shields, Conan
O'Brien, Winona Ryder and the Baldwin brothers serve as comic
targets. You'll also finally get to see what the mumbling,
hood-clad Kenny looks like. And when he dies, he goes straight to
hell, where the Devil is a caring, sensitive gay creature who's
sleeping with Saddam Hussein. We also learn that such folks as
George Burns and Gandhi have been damned forever.
</P>
<P>
   The film's funniest moments are actually the ``Beauty and the
Beast''-like musical numbers. There's Mr. Garrison teaching the
kids to use words such as ``buns'' and ``poo,'' Satan yearning to
live on Earth (``I could be up there and live without a care'') and
Cartman calling Kyle's mom a word that rhymes with ``witch.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the yuks, there's still something disturbing about
cartoon characters cursing as often as they do in ``South Park''.
After the initial shock value wears off, the crass comedic device
wears thin quickly.
</P>
<P>
   If you have young kids, you'd be wise not to take them to this
movie. If you do, you'll probably feel like the parents in ``South
Park'': You'll want to declare war on Parker and Stone.

   Ribs: Declare your independence from disappointing grill
offerings
</P>
<P>
   By Ann Heller
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Hugh Carpenter writes his rib rules in great big
print:
</P>
<P>
   The first one is: Never, NEVER boil ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Kline, who speaks for the National Pork Producers Council,
gives the same advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under no circumstances should you `parboil' ribs before
grilling. Parboiling robs ribs of flavor and is an unnecessary
step.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bruce Aidells, founder of the Aidells Sausage company and
co-author of ``The Complete Meat Cookbook,'' shudders at the
mention of parboiling, saying ``the result is stringy meat that
lacks juiciness and flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   The flavor, you see, goes down the sink with the water.
</P>
<P>
   So why do so many people do this?
</P>
<P>
   Because they want tender ribs. Now, that sets up an argument on
the issue of tenderness. The measure of doneness, says Kline, is
that the bone should wiggle.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the same thing as falling-off-the-bone tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what some folks love. Ribs so tender you can suck the
bones right out.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if that's what you want, there are ways to achieve it
other than boiling the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   And as people fire up the grill for the July 4 holiday, we're
here to tell you how to get tender, juicy ribs. We're not talking
sauces here. That's another story. We're talking technique.
</P>
<P>
   All the experts stress cooking the ribs slowly over indirect
heat. Whether using a gas or a charcoal grill, the process is the
same. The meat is ideally placed over a drip pan, with the coals
(or burners) to the side to provide the heat (though you can skip
the drip pan if necessary). Baby back ribs may be done in an hour
and a half, spareribs in two hours. Sauce is applied only the last
15 to 30 minutes to avoid scorching (sweet ingredients scorch
quickly).
</P>
<P>
   Kline has a technique to appease those who like ribs
extra-tender. After the ribs are fully cooked, wrap them in foil,
tuck them in a brown paper bag and seal it to let the ribs finish
cooking in their own heat. Let them sit for one hour. Don't worry,
food can sit out for up to two hours before it's risky to eat.
While the ribs rest, there's time to put the finishing touches on
the rest of the holiday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, author of the new Great Ribs Book(Tenspeed, $14.95),
suggests a variation of that trick. After the ribs have been
grilled, fully cooked and sauced, put them (naked, not in foil) in
a brown paper bag, meaty side up. Fold and staple the bag shut and
place it in a 140-degree oven for one hour. The ribs steam in the
bag. My added advice: Don't use a supermarket bag made of recycled
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Aidells, though he disparages the notion of parboiling ribs
(cooking them in boiling water), tolerates a second-cousin
technique _ precooking the ribs by poaching them in water that
never goes above a simmer.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like quibbling over a bubble, but keeping the
water temperature below 170 degrees (as opposed to the 212 degrees
of boiling water) assures tender ribs. Still, Aidells says, some
flavor leaches out. He'd rather prebake the ribs and finish them on
the grill.
</P>
<P>
   And for those with a standard-sized backyard grill and a
houseful of company on the holiday, precooking the ribs is the only
way to feed the group. Finish them on the grill in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we've settled that, it's on to the recipes. You get to
decide whether you want the ribs wet _ dripping with sauce _ or
dry, Memphis-style.

 &HT;    When precooking is the answer
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there are lots of people at the cookout, the only way to feed
them ribs off a standard backyard grill is to precook them and
finish them on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   But if you've sworn off parboiling the ribs, what are you going
to do? Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wrap seasoned ribs in heavy foil and precook them in a
300-degree oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Save any drippings that
accumulate to add to your sauce. The Pork Producers Council says
the ribs can also be pre-roasted uncovered in a shallow pan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Precook unwrapped ribs in a 200- to 250-degree oven for 2 1/2
to 3 hours. They will be fully cooked at this point but note that
food-safety experts quarrel with cooking temperatures that low.
</P>
<P>
   However you choose to precook them, finish the ribs over a low
fire on the grill, cooking enough to give them a light crust and
heat them through, anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes per side. Brush
with a sauce if desired.

 &HT;    That temperamental temperature
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's face it: Regulating the temperature of a charcoal fire is
a challenge, especially when food cooks for a long time. You have
to keep adding briquettes and play with the vents to regulate the
heat. Using an instant-read thermometer, tucked into the top vent
hole, helps keep track of the temperature, but readings don't go
above 300 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up indirect cooking on a gas grill is more precise. Here
are the instructions from the new ``Weber's Art of the Grill,
Recipes for Outdoor Living'' (Chronicle, $35):
</P>
<P>
   _ Preheat the grill with all burners on high.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adjust the burners on each side of the food to medium heat and
turn off the burner directly below the food.
</P>
<P>
   _ Place ribs on a rack set inside a disposable, heavy-gauge foil
pan.
</P>
<P>
   _ For long cooking times, add water to the drip pan to keep
drippings from burning.

 &HT;    Secret of great ribs is the rub, technique
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Chefs and grill experts who have been at it for
years put some pretty strange ingredients in their rubs and sauces.
For a backyard celebration when you just want to feed people,
nothing beats basic old-fashioned barbecued ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Even a novice can handle this recipe, though it does take time.
The magic ingredient is the simple rub. Some cooks baste the ribs
with a homemade pork broth or apple cider or vinegar spiked with
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, Tenn., the ribs are often served without a sauce in
order to appreciate the flavor of the meat and the dry seasonings.
The sauce, if any, goes on at the end or at the table.
</P>
<P>
   MEMPHIS-STYLE RIBS
</P>
<P>
   4 slabs pork back ribs or spareribs
</P>
<P>
   Memphis rub (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue sauce of your choice
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a medium fire in the grill, banking the coals to one
side or on either side of a drip pan.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the ribs with the seasoning, using 2 or 3 tablespoons per
slab. Place them on the grill in a single layer opposite the heat
source. Cover the grill and cook ribs slowly for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, wrap the cooked ribs in heavy aluminum foil and
place in a heavy brown paper bag. Let the ribs rest for an hour for
extra-tender ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Serve dry or with sauce on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The basic ingredients in this rub are suggested by the National
Pork Producers Council. The original did not include salt, which I
think is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   MEMPHIS RUB
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons onion powder
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chile powder
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   Mix all ingredients in a small jar. Store any excess in a sealed
jar in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   An even simpler Memphis rub comes from Melanie Barnard in ``The
Best Covered and Kettle Grills Cookbook Ever'' (HarperCollins). She
also offers her version of a sauce served along with Memphis ribs.
</P>
<P>
   EASY MEMPHIS RUB
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
</P>
<P>
   Combine salt and peppers. This makes enough to rub 6 pounds of
pork spareribs. She suggests refrigerating the seasoned ribs for 4
hours before cooking but return them to room temperature. She also
suggests adding soaked hickory chips to the coals while cooking the
ribs for 1 1/2 hours over indirect heat.
</P>
<P>
   RIB SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 cups
</P>
<P>
   2 cups bottled chili sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup ketchup
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon crushed hot red pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, crushed through a press
</P>
<P>
   In a medium nonaluminum saucepan combine the ingredients. Simmer
over medium-low heat until the sauce just coats a spoon, about 20
minutes. It can be used immediately or refrigerated as long as 1
week.
</P>
<P>
   If you have time to spare and are a purist at heart, try this
recipe from ``The Complete Meat Cookbook'' by Bruce Aidells and
Denis Kelly (Houghton Mifflin, $35). You do need a large, covered
kettle grill. Don't build a big fire. This is slow, low, smoky
cooking, and it requires attention to the grill vents to control
the heat level.
</P>
<P>
   SLOW-COOKED
</P>
<P>
   BARBECUED RIBS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 to 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   2 2 1/2- to 3-pound slabs of spareribs
</P>
<P>
   Spice Rub (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups presoaked wood chips or chunks, optional
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue sauce of your choice
</P>
<P>
   Rub the spice rub over both sides of the ribs, using 2 to 3
tablespoons for each slab. For best results refrigerate overnight,
loosely wrapped, but 1 hour at room temperature will do. If
refrigerated, bring to room temperature for 30 minutes before
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a covered barbecue for cooking. Light a mound of 20 to
30 briquettes on one side of the grate and open bottom vents fully.
Place a roasting pan (or aluminum pan) on the other side of the
grate and add 2 inches of water to the pan to provide moist heat
and catch drippings.
</P>
<P>
   If using chips, wrap the soaked wood chips in foil and punch
holes in the foil.
</P>
<P>
   Once the coals are covered with gray ash, lay the foil packet of
soaked chips on the coals. Put the rack on the grill and lay the
ribs on it over the drip pan so no meat is over the hot coals.
Cover the grill, with the lid vents about half open and opposite
the coals so the smoke is drawn over the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the temperature low is important. To check it, stick an
instant-read thermometer into a top vent hole, making sure that any
plastic parts are not in direct contact with the metal lid. Leave
the thermometer in place.
</P>
<P>
   For spareribs slow-cooked with a low fire, you want the
temperature to read 200 to 250 degrees; initially it can be higher,
but it should not exceed 300 and should drop to the lower range
within a half-hour. If not, partially close the lower vent to
decrease the heat. Regulate the temperature by adjusting the bottom
vent. But be sure not to close the vents entirely or the coals will
die out.
</P>
<P>
   Every 45 minutes turn the ribs over and switch their places on
the grill so that you alternate their exposure to the hotter edge
near the coals. If coals need replenishing, add another 5 to 10
briquettes. Another packet of chips can be added as well.
</P>
<P>
   Aidells says the entire process of cooking the ribs can take 4
hours, but if your heat stayed above 250 degrees for long, they
will cook in much less time. Start checking them after 2 hours
until you've become a pro. When they are ready, the ends of the
bones will be exposed, and the meat will begin to pull away from
the bone. If a rib bone is twisted, it should wiggle. If tested
with an instant-read thermometer, the meatiest section should have
an internal temperature of 165 to 175 degrees (because ribs are
fatty, they can be cooked to a higher temperature than other pork
cuts).
</P>
<P>
   When ribs are done, place on a baking sheet or platter and cover
tightly with foil. Wrap the pan with 10 to 20 sheets of unfolded
newspaper and let ribs rest for 20 minutes and as long as 1 hour
before serving.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to serve, heat the barbecue sauce. Slice the slabs
into individual ribs and brush with the sauce or serve them dry.
Serve with sauce on the side.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer baby-back ribs, use three 1- to 1 1/2-pound slabs.
</P>
<P>
   SPICE RUB
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chile powder
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 teaspoons cayenne (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons garlic powder or granulated garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground sage
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Mix all the ingredients in a small jar. Any leftover can be
stored for a couple months in a tightly sealed jar.
</P>

   Hugh Carpenter is a cookbook author whose name is permanently
linked to fusion cuisine. He was on the cutting edge with his first
book, ``Pacific Flavors `` in 1988. So it's no surprise that when
it comes to ribs, his come with California style exotic flavors,
and they are all shown off in his newest book, ``The Great Ribs
Book'' (Ten Speed, $14.95). It's full of ideas to celebrate the
independence of a country with roots that span the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his marinades are dependent on sweet ingredients such as
hoisin sauce and plum sauce that frankly might char over indirect
heat on the grill. These ribs might be better cooked in a
250-degree oven. Or use a basic rub and try his marinades as a
finishing glaze on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   This one pairs Southwest seasonings such as chipotle chiles with
toasted coriander seeds and peppercorns.
</P>
<P>
   CHIPOTLE-CORIANDER GLAZE
</P>
<P>
   Makes enough for 6 pounds ribs
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   8 cloves garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   4 small shallots, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 cup ketchup
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup molasses
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dark soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon orange zest, optional
</P>
<P>
   Toast the coriander seeds and peppercorns in a small skillet
over medium heat, cooking just until smoke begins to rise. Cool on
paper towels. Transfer to a spice grinder and grind finely (or
crush in a mortar and pestle).
</P>
<P>
   Mince the garlic and shallots in a food processor. Add the
ground spices and chipotle chiles and mince for 10 seconds. Add the
remaining ingredients and process until the mixture becomes a thick
paste.
</P>
<P>
   The paste can be mopped on the ribs after they have cooked on
the grill for an hour, or on oven precooked ribs. Baste the ribs
and turn several times.
</P>
<P>
   Or to try them Carpenter-style, slather the paste on uncooked
ribs and roast on a rack in a 350-degree oven for about 90 minutes.
For added moisture place a small pan of water at the bottom of the
oven.

 &HT;    Remove membrane to ensure tenderness
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rib experts agree: Ribs will always be tough unless you remove
the membrane that covers the bony side of the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Some markets buy ribs preskinned, but others don't, so flip that
slab over and scrutinize the underside. In his new ``Great Ribs
Book,'' (Ten Speed, $14.95) Hugh Carpenter tells how to remove it:
</P>
<P>
   _ Place the ribs, meaty side down, on a flat surface.
</P>
<P>
   _ Using your fingernail, loosen a little of the membrane along
the end of the last rib bone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grasp the membrane firmly with a paper towel (so the membrane
doesn't slip from your grip).
</P>
<P>
   _ Holding the ribs down with the other hand, pull the membrane.
If it doesn't pull away in one piece, repeat the procedure with the
remaining membrane.

 &HT;    Who can resist these South Park kids?
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those foul-mouthed miscreants from South Park say everything
they can't get away with on television in their big-screen debut _
and much, much more.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare to be shocked by the sheer amount of strong profanity in
``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'', including words you'd never
imagined, as creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone insolently wave
their middle fingers at the Motion Picture Association of America.
The pair apparently harbors a grudge against the prudish ratings
board for slapping Parker's benign porn spoof, Orgazmo, with an
NC-17.
</P>
<P>
   The MPAA-baiting ``South Park'' movie reportedly had to be
re-edited three times to avoid the same rating, which is death at
the box office. Despite the double-entendre subtitle's claim, two
minutes of footage was trimmed to secure an R, which will still
keep out teens without fake IDs.
</P>
<P>
   The animated comedy is defiantly crude and offensive. It's also
unrelentingly hilarious. The film's target, not surprisingly, is
censorship. What's most shocking of all is that it's a musical, and
a fairly ambitious one at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off to the movies we will go, where we learn everything that
we know,'' sing Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman (voiced by Parker and
Stone) in the film's opening number, Mountain Town, a send-up of
Belle's ode to her village in Disney's ``Beauty and the Beast''.
</P>
<P>
   The boys sneak into an R-rated movie featuring flatulent
Canadian comics Terence and Philip. Soon they and their third-grade
classmates are parroting the duo's vulgar dialogue. Kenny dies
attempting to emulate T &AMP; P's antics, on a bet from Cartman. Kyle's
moral watchdog mother (voiced by Mary Kay Bergman, who does most of
the film's female characters) leads outraged parents on what
becomes a nationwide crusade against profanity and all things
Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   With World War III brewing between the United States and Canada,
and Chef (Isaac Hayes) on the front lines as part of Operation
Human Shield, the kids from South Park form an underground
resistance movement. Meanwhile, down in Hell, Kenny must prevent
Satan and Saddam Hussein from launching the Apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   For all its rude irreverence, the South Park movie is oddly
prescient in its take on such current hot topics as checking IDs
for R-rated movies, the influence of media on youth and the United
States' role as the world's police force. Of course, it's all
played for side-splitting laughs, as when the adults implant a
V-chip under Cartman's scalp, Clockwork Orange -style, to prevent
him from swearing.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone slam countless celebrities, from Conan O'Brien
to the Baldwin clan. They are aided by a number of famous voices,
including George Clooney, Eric Idle, Minnie Driver, Dave Foley,
Brent Spiner and Beavis and Butt-head 's Mike Judge.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon cut-ups take a swipe at their own limited animation
style, yet the film's computer-generated Hell sequences are much
more impressive than those in the live-action Spawn movie.
</P>
<P>
   Most inspired are the off-the-wall production numbers,
highlighted by the rousing ``What Would Brian Boitano Do?'',
Satan's yearning ``Up There'' and the Les Miz -skewering ``La
Resistance''. That latter culminates in a clever, ``West Side
Story'' -inspired reprise of major musical themes.
</P>
<P>
   The film goes too far with its raw language and raunchy humor _
no matter how liberal your sensibility, you will be offended by
something _ but that is the point. ``Horrific depravity and
horrible violence is OK, as long as people don't say naughty
words,'' one adult says, purportedly quoting the MPAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' is Parker and Stone's
audacious and uproarious ``La Resistance.''

 &HT;    Even a great villain can't save this flick
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a good summer for comedic villains.
</P>
<P>
   Their sly and sinister ways _ salted with irony and a pinch of
self-deprecation _ have added much-needed zest to several
intentionally dumb movies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Evil was more amusing than Austin Powers in ``The Spy Who
Shagged Me'' _ or at least more outrageous. ``The Mummy'' had a
decent villain. Granted, he was a second-stringer, but weaselly
enough to be amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but when the villain is both a weasel and a wizard, then
you've got something. Even better when the baddie's played by a
real actor such as Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Branagh (''Henry V'') turns on his declamatory Shakespearean
voice in the wobbly ``Wild Wild West,'' opening today. But his
accent is pure, syrupy Southern. (The Brits do Dixie so (ITALIC)
extremely (END ITALIC) well.)
</P>
<P>
   Branagh plays Dr. Arliss Loveless, a literally sawed-off
Confederate veteran who wants to kidnap President Ulysses Grant and
force him to surrender the U.S. to a grab-bag of foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
   Out to stop him are our heroes James West and Artemus Gordon,
played by Will Smith and Kevin Kline, who alternate between being
super-slick and the Laurel and Hardy of the old West.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is based on the old TV series. It tries to take
advantage of the pairing in last year's Fourth of July weekend hit,
``Men In Black''. That comedy teamed the always likeable Smith with
a deliciously deadpan Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Director Barry Sonnenfeld's back for this flick, too, and Kline
is a wonderful actor and comedian. (He also plays a great President
Grant.) But the Smith-Kline duo doesn't mesh as well as
Smith-Jones, perhaps because they play rivals who come to like each
other. Their bickering and one-upsmanship are really old hat in the
movies _ or old Stetson, in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the dull ``Wild Wild West'' completely lacks the
originality of ``Men In Black''. The writing is limp, made worse by
a clutter of tiresome racial jokes and puns. There's a couple of
funny sight gags based on gadgetry, including one involving
magnetic collars. But the inclusion of sci-fi shtick seems
desperate. Dr. Loveless' gigantic ``tarantula'' looks like it was
made out of a kid's erector set.
</P>
<P>
   To shoot straight about this flick, it's simply not well
written.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves us with plenty of cornball action, a glimpse of
Salma Hayek in a corset_ and Dr. Loveless. Branagh's lines aren't
terribly clever, either, but the sight of him is a hoot. He putters
around in a wheelchair with a smoking chimney on the back. His
vaudevillian beard makes him look like Mandrake the Madman. His
eyes fairly twinkle when he's up to no good, which he's up to all
the time, even if his manners are perfect.
</P>
<P>
   He's comic relief, indeed. ``Wild Wild West'' proves that
``action-packed'' movies can be awfully listless. But at least this
one isn't Loveless.

 &HT;    Wild, Wild West: Bad, bad, bad
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Wild Wild West'' is a bad, bad movie.
</P>
<P>
   The big-budget film adaptation of the popular 1960s television
series about a James Bond-style 19th-century government agent
reunites ``Men in Black'' director Barry Sonnenfeld with that
film's star, Will Smith. The TV show's premise has been revamped to
suit Smith's wisecracking persona, as well as Sonnenfeld's visual
inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the sci-fi western lacks ``Men In Black'''s sharp
pacing and snappy script. The result is a ludicrous action-comedy
that's neither exciting nor funny. It might have worked as a
big-screen comic book for kids, but the film's high degree of
violence and sexual innuendo _ the first two scenes feature a
decapitation and some naked canoodling in a water tank _ make it
unsuitable for pre-teens.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have circulated for months that ``Wild Wild West'' was
wildly over budget, rising to a reported $160 million from its
original $105 million. The troubled production wrapped several
weeks behind schedule, and Sonnenfeld called the cast back for 10
days of re-shoots in April to add some physical comedy after the
film scored poorly with test audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The potential box-office behemoth _ which features a monstrous
80-foot-tall Jules Verne-inspired mechanical tarantula _ looks to
be this summer's Godzilla . It will open big based on the hype and
then drop off fast once bad word-of-mouth hits the street. The film
appears unlikely to make its bloated budget back during its
theatrical run, which would at least spare us from a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   The inane, threadbare story by brothers Jim and John Thomas _
four other writers are credited for the screenplay _ involves
post-Civil War federal marshals James West (Smith) and Artemus
Gordon (Kevin Kline) being thrown together by President Ulysses S.
Grant to track down diabolical genius Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth
Branagh), who has kidnapped the United States' top scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The two agents spend much of the film bickering over their
conflicting approaches to crime-fighting. It gets old real fast. As
Grant puts it, West tends to shoot first, shoot second, shoot third
and then if there's anyone left alive, ask a few questions. Gordon
is a self-styled master of disguise who invents all sorts of
futuristic gadgets that sometimes work, but always annoy West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon, I think you underestimate the convenience of a
pocket,'' West says after a notebook and pen pop out from his
sidekick's sleeves. Sonnenfeld and company certainly underestimated
the importance of a good script.
</P>
<P>
   The appalling low point in the humor comes when West, a black
cowboy, and Loveless, who lost his legs in the war, exchange rounds
of thinly veiled racial and amputee insults. Otherwise, the verbal
gags are pretty much limited to bad puns, like when West dispatches
a blade-handed henchman, saying, ``No more mister knife guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a few clever visuals, such as snipers emerging from
oil paintings and West being sling-shot beneath Loveless' train,
there's little of Sonnenfeld's usual playfulness. The giant
tarantula is a fairly impressive piece of computer-generated
imagery, but the film's blue-screen effects are rather obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Smith looks dashing in his western duds, although far too much
is made of his character's skin color. He slips in too many
contemporary phrases for a period piece _ calling one character
``butt ugly'' _ and simply isn't all that funny in the role.
</P>
<P>
   Kline, who earned an Oscar for A Fish Called Wanda, provides
paltry comic relief by dressing in drag and ranting incessantly.
Salma Hayek adds nothing more than her ample cleavage as Rita
Escobar, a buxom entertainer who comes between the agents. Branagh
sports a heavy drawl and chews up lots of expensive scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Wild West'' will be quickly run out of town.

   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I suppose I could quit my
job and make our car accident my full-time gig. Or I could marry
Florida's nsurance Commissioner, Bill Nelson. See, the real problem
here is not that a young woman ran a red light three days after
Christmas and sent us flying across the horizon. The real problem
isn't even that she went to court and got the ticket thrown out and
now it's looking like her company doesn't want to pay up. No, the
real problem is that I can't get any answers being nice so now I'm
going to have to get mean. Nastiness, rudeness, obsessive phone
calling _ all of it gets results. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ I gave my granddaughter, Mira, a video of
``The Nutcracker'' ballet for her third birthday a couple of days

yell. Only at the drive-in can you pack the kids in the car in
their PJs. Only at the drive-in can you say what you like without
being shushed. Only at the drive-in can half the family fall asleep

how much the little woman had spent shopping. (Jefferson, Palm

   HINDENBERG-EYEWITNESS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Thousands
watched the last, slow dance of the dirigible Hindenburg as it
bobbed through the stormy sky over New York City in the late
afternoon of May 6, 1937. The pride of the Zeppelin Company's air
fleet was already more than 10 hours late completing its first
flight of the season from Germany, but the captain was in no hurry.
He'd decided to circle and wait for a break in the weather to
ensure the sort of smooth, pinpoint descent that had ended each of
the Hindenburg's 10 previous flights to America. A crowd of
welcomers and sightseers waited southeast of the city at the ship's
destination, the U.S. Navy's air station at Lakehurst, N.J. Among
the eager greeters were the Enssle family of nearby Roselle Park,
including 13-year-old Eleanor. Eleanor remembers the events of that
day. (Kalajian, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at

</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that President Clinton mobilized
33,000 men and women in April during the height of the NATO-led air
campaign against Yugoslavia. I can't find anything supporting this.
What units were involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: On April 27, Clinton authorized the Pentagon to activate
33,102 members of the National Guard and military reserves. The
Pentagon had made the request that same day in order to enable NATO
to expand its air armada and quicken the pace of its attacks,
according to Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   The 33,102 was the ``ceiling'' number whose activation was
approved, said Lt. Col. Mike Miloy of the Defense Department, but
the number actually mobilized was ``about 5,000.'' While they had
reported and some were in the ``alert phase'' and preparing for
deployment, the air campaign ended. When that happened, Miloy said,
the need for them to be fully activated disappeared, so the full
33,102 never were deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation recently
granted $10 million to 32 people. How does one apply for such a
grant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Recipients don't apply. They're nominated for the awards by
anonymous talent scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The national anthem used to be sung before every Major League
baseball game. Why don't we see that anymore?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're referring specifically to televised games, viewers
don't see and hear the anthem because it's usually performed before
the station's telecast begins. But fans at the stadium sould see
and hear it. And at games involving the Montreal Expos or Toronto
Blue Jays, fans would be treated to ``O Canada'' as well as ``The
Star Spangled Banner.'' So if you're concerned about the anthem
being eliminated before every game, it hasn't been. You just don't
often get it on television.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that a Confederate submarine, the Hunley, was
found underneath the football stadium at The Citadel in Charleston,
S.C. How did it come to rest there?
</P>
<P>
   A: The wreckage of the Hunley, a nine-man sub built from an old
locomotive boiler, is under 30 feet of silt and water off the Isle
of Palms near Charleston. What was discovered under a section of
asphalt just inside the Citadel stadium's cinderblock back wall was
the burial place of some of the Hunley's crew members, who died in
an accident. The Hunley had three sets of crew members, and this
was the first. The bodies were believed to have been buried in
Charleston's old Confederate naval cemetery, which was abandoned in
the late 1940s when the city built the stadium that now is home to
the Citadel Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How well is Social Security prepared to deal with possible
Y2K problems?
</P>
<P>
   A: The entire process for providing benefits _ from calculating
benefits to making payments _ is ready for the century date change,
according to the Social Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, the Treasury Department's Financial Management
Service began to issue monthly Social Security payments on systems
that had been fixed and tested, the agency says. Financial
Management Service maintains systems that each year make 860
million payments on behalf of SSA, the Department of Veterans
Affairs, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies. All the
systems were found to be ``Year 2000 compliant,'' with independent
verification and documentation, according to the SSA.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Adams, assistant deputy commissioner for SSA systems,
expressed the situation in a practical way: ``SSA will make it. We
cannot manually issue 50 million checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is ``The General's Daughter'' a true story or a piece of
fiction?
</P>
<P>
   A: The novel is fiction, but author Nelson DeMille, isn't saying
if the story has any basis in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A Nike commercial shows Tiger Woods using a golf club to
bounce a golf ball several times between his legs, and then he hits
it. Was this a computer-generated stunt?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the real thing, with no trick photography, said Nike
spokesman Mike Kelly. Woods did it ``on the spur of the moment,''
Kelly said, bouncing a ball on a sand wedge and then hitting it
``about 200 yards.'' Kelly said the TV spot was filmed in just four
takes at a golf course in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Walt Disney's old ``Song of the South'' is my husband's
favorite movie. I understand that it's not available for sale on
video in this country, but can be found on international markets.
Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1946 film _ beloved by some who consider it a classic,
but condemned by others for what they consider a false portrayal of
blacks in a romanticized plantation setting of the fictional Old
South _ isn't available from routine sources such as Blockbuster
(1-800-800-6767) or video suppliers on the Internet such as
www.bigstar.com and www.reel.com.
</P>
<P>
   However, versions of it are listed on the Internet as being
available for mail-order purchase from a source in Florida. Note
that a fan Internet site includes a message that people have
complained about sending in their money and not receiving their
order in a timely fashion, so buyer beware. If you want to order
it, here's where: Ol' Remus Collectibles, P.O. Box 7554, Ensley, FL
32534-0554. The cost is $30 for a copy in English with Japanese
subtitles (originally released on the Japanese market), or $40 for
English without subtitles (originally released on the British
market).
</P>
<P>
   A possible alternative if you're interested only in music is a
26-minute video, ``Disney's Sing Along Songs,'' which includes
``Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah'' from ``Song of the South.'' It's available
for purchase on the Internet _ www.bigstar.com is one source _ and
may be available for rental at video stores.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about some deaths in connection with the
arthritis medicine Celebrex? My doctor said there's nothing to it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Officials at the Food and Drug Administration have confirmed
a report in The Wall Street Journal that the painkiller has been
linked to 10 deaths and 11 cases of gastrointestinal hemorrhages
during its first three months on the market. Despite the deaths,
the FDA isn't raising an alarm for the drug, which has been taken
by more than 2 million consumers. Robert DeLap, director of an FDA
office for drug evaluation, said more research is needed before
coming to a conclusion about the safety of Celebrex, which is
manufactured by St. Louis-based Monsanto Co.'s G.D. Searle &AMP; Co.
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both the FDA and Searle indicated that the ``safety
profile'' _ meaning the ``adverse event reports,'' or reports about
deaths, bleeding and ulcers _ were not out of line when related to
the total of 2.5 million prescriptions for Celebrex filled in its
first 13 weeks on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a steak dinner resting on this. Was Helen Keller
known to be a Communist or socialist? I say she was, but my husband
says not.
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1998 book ``Helen Keller: A Life,'' by Dorothy Herrmann,
confirms your belief. Consider this passage: ``Keller was in fact a
militant socialist who wrote and spoke openly about issues such as
the labor movement, civil rights and birth control, as well as her
admiration for Marx and Lenin. She yearned for marriage and
children and remained bitter that her plans to elope with a young
socialist were thwarted by her family.'' T-bone, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give me an address or a Web site where I can reach
Gary Bauer, who is running for president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mail can be sent to the Republican presidential contender at
this address: Bauer for President Inc., 2800 Shirlington Road,
Suite 900, Arlington, VA 22206. The Web site _ www.bauer2K.com/ _
has information, or you can call 703-933-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A pit crew member at the Indy 500 was struck by a race car.
Do you have an update?
</P>
<P>
   A: Steve Fried, crew chief for rookie driver Robby McGehee, was
released from an Indianapolis hospital June 13. The Mentor, Ohio,
crewman was working in McGehee's pit early in the May 30 race when
he was struck from behind by driver Jimmy Kite's car, which had
been hit by another car whose brakes had failed. Fried was thrown
into the air and fell face first on the concrete, fracturing his
skull, right eye socket, jaw, left shoulder, several ribs, and
bones in his ear. His brain was injured and his lungs collapsed.
Medical workers said he wasn't breathing when they reached him, and
his heart stopped en route to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Fried, who has begun physical therapy, says he hopes to return
to work later in the Indy Racing League season.

 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is George W. Bush, who is running for the Republican
presidential nomination, the Bush who was involved in a savings and
loan scandal some years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It was Neil Bush, one of George W.'s brothers, who was a
figure in the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in
Colorado. Silverado failed in 1988, costing taxpayers an estimated
$1 billion. Although Neil Bush never was charged with criminal
wrongdoing, he agreed to pay $50,000 in 1992 to settle a civil
lawsuit lodged two years earlier by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some $10 million in ``genius grants'' was just awarded to 32
people by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Do you
have any details about the MacArthurs and the source of their
fortune?
</P>
<P>
   A: The foundation, which has been making the grants annually
since 1981, doesn't use the word ``genius.'' It prefers to think of
them as grants to people who are ``exceptionally talented and
promising individuals.'' Recipients, selected anonymously, have
five years to pursue whatever interests they desire, with no
strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, a private, independent grant-making institution,
is based in Chicago. It was created in 1978 by John D. MacArthur
(1897-1978), who developed and owned Bankers Life and Casualty Co.
and other businesses, as well as considerable property in Florida
and New York. Catherine MacArthur (1909-81), his wife, held
positions in many of these companies and served as director of the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's largest foundations, it has assets of $4
billion and makes grants totaling more than $150 million annually
through two major integrated programs (Human and Community
Development, and Global Security and Sustainability) and two
special programs (General Program, and MacArthur Fellows).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are people working inside buildings exposed to as much ozone
as those outdoors? In other words, are air handling systems able to
remove ozone from the outside air?
</P>
<P>
   A: While some filters in heating and cooling equipment collect
particles and dust, a gas such as ground-level ozone _ the major
culprit in ``smog alerts'' _ likely would travel through the system
in a similar concentration to that found outdoors, according to
environmental protection officials.
</P>
<P>
   But while some ozone from outside does get inside, levels don't
remain high for very long because air conditioners constantly turn
over the indoor air. Also, ozone indoors attaches itself quickly to
walls, furniture and other objects, futher reducing its levels in
the air. People sensitive to high ozone levels outdoors gain
another benefit by staying indoors: They're likely not to be as
active as if outdoors. The more active a person is, the heavier the
breathing and the greater the chances of sucking in greater volumes
of ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any place I can rent or buy a video of ``With a Song
in My Heart,'' starring Susan Hayward, which was made years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to be patient _ and watchful of the cable channel
American Movie Classics _ if you want to see the movie anytime
soon. It's not for sale or rental in a videotape version.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a Song in My Heart,'' which also featured Rory Calhoun,
David Wayne, Thelma Ritter and Robert Wagner, told the story of
Jane Froman, a singer who in 1943 was seriously injured in an
airplane crash off Portugal while on a USO tour to entertain U.S.
troops overseas.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox, the studio holding rights to the 1952 movie,
hasn't released it on video, according to Debra Dodds of American
Movie Classics. AMC has shown the film in the past, but its
broadcast rights expired in October. The cable channel is
renegotiating with 20th Century Fox for future broadcast rights,
however, so you might be able to catch it again later. The best way
to follow AMC's schedule in advance is through its monthly AMC
Magazine ($12.95 for 12 issues; 1-888-262-4700).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several photos published recently showed NATO and British
vehicles in the Yugoslavia war zones with an inverted V on the
front. What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: The inverted V has no symbolism other than its utilitarian
function of being one tool in distinguishing friend from foe in
combat, according to SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers
Europe).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that all cars sold in Canada have daytime running
lights, whereas in the United States the choices are limited, such
as to some Saturns and Buicks. Can I order a car from Canada or buy
one there and bring it back?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't need to go to that trouble. And why risk running
afoul of U.S. Customs? Nor do you need an after-market adaption.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive experts say you can achieve the same effect _ the
added safety factor of making your vehicle more visible to others
during the day _ by turning your headlights on as soon as you start
the engine. The headlights on many rental cars in the United States
automatically come on when the ignition key is turned, and some
imports, such as Volvo, also incorporate the feature.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It has been reported that bald eagles have been taken off the
endangered species list. Do you have more details? What does that
mean? Can we now hunt them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The status of bald eagles will change, but they still can't
be hunted. The Clinton administration announced plans May 6 to
remove nearly 30 once-rare bird, animal and plant species from the
government's official ``endangered'' list _ the bald eagle among
them _ declaring victory in staving off their extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Both the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon, which also was
removed, were pushed to the brink of extinction by the use of
pesticides. Eagles also were victims of ranchers and farmers who
killed them, believing them to be marauders targeting their
chickens and domestic livestock.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports that there now are
more than 1,500 nesting pairs of falcons. In 1998, wildlife
officials counted 5,748 bald eagles and said that probably was an
``undercount.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1940 law, the Bald Eagle Protection Act, continues to protect
the bald eagle and its cousin, the golden eagle, from hunting and
other direct harm. What will change, once the bald eagle is
officially removed from the endangered list, is that there no
longer will be federal rules protecting its habitat. Those habitat
protection rules are part of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Prior to the wedding of Prince Edward to Sophie Rhys-Jones,
it was speculated that Queen Elizabeth would bestow the title of
duke and duchess upon them. Instead, she made them earl and
countess of Wessex. What is the pecking order among British lords,
dukes, counts and others? Can one ``step up'' to a more desirable
title?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``pecking order'' starts, of course, with royalty (Queen
Elizabeth and her family). The highest heriditary title outside the
royal family is duke, ranking immediately below a prince, and above
a marquess. A marquess is a nobleman ranking above an earl (or
count), while an earl is a nobleman ranking above a viscount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepping up'' in title is rarely an issue, according to the
British consulate in Atlanta, although it has happened on occasion,
such as when Princess Anne was given the title princess royal for
her charitable work. But then she has royal blood anyway, so that's
not exactly ``moving up.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest son of a duke and duchess, incidentally, is a lord
with the rank of marquess, and younger sons and daughters are
called lords and ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the ``57'' refer to in Heinz 57?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just a slogan, hit upon by Henry John Heinz in 1896,
even though at the time his company (then known as Heinz &AMP; Noble)
made 60 products.
</P>
<P>
   The Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins says the famous
slogan came from a billboard Heinz had seen in New York referring
to ``21 Styles of Shoes.'' Heinz apparently believed that an odd
number would be more noticeable than 60, so 57 was chosen. The
Pittsburgh-based company, by the way, now makes more than 5,000
products.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We hear so much about automobiles putting pollution into the
air. Aren't aircraft at airports also a factor?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, aircraft are a ``significant contributor'' to ozone
problems, said Ronald Methier of the Georgia Environmental
Protection Division. Since many aircraft travel internationally,
their engines are subject to international standards rather than
those of the United States, which are more stringent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that a bronze casket used to carry
President Kennedy's body from Dallas to Washington had been dropped
into the Atlantic Ocean from a military plane years ago. This
information was just made public. Do you have any more details?
</P>
<P>
   A: The documents, released June 1 by the National Archives, said
the federal government was following the wishes of the Kennedy
family when it dumped the coffin into the Atlantic in 1966. Kennedy
family spokeswoman Melody Miller said the destruction of the casket
was appropriate and ``in keeping with the tradition of President
Kennedy's naval service and his love of the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, according to the documents, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy had
asked that the casket be released to the military for destruction,
saying, ``I think it belongs to the family and we can get rid of it
any way we want to.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18 that same year, an Air Force van picked up the casket
at the Archives and transported it to Andrews Air Force Base, Md.,
where it was loaded onto a C-130. To ensure that the coffin would
sink, three 80-pound bags of sand were put inside, metal banding
was wrapped around it, and it was placed inside a pine box which
also was wrapped with metal tape. The plane flew about 131 nautical
miles off the Maryland-Delaware coast, dropping the casket into
9,000 feet of water in an explosives dumping area.

ADVERTISING: ACCOUNT REVIEW MOVES TO CYBERREALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A French company is bringing an Internet service to the United
States intended to assist in conducting account reviews online,
helping agencies hook up with advertisers and consultants seeking
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Maydream SA is introducing a Web site named Agency Preview
(www.adforum.com), a database that will include information about
subscribing agencies like credentials, client rosters, billings,
specialty services and awards. The site will also offer samples of
creative work that can include television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have already been capitalizing on the benefits
of interactivity for agency reviews by offering Web sites,
including Business Partnering International in Richmond, Va.
(www.agencyfinder.com) and Pile &AMP; Co. in Boston
(www.agencycompile.com). The role cyberspace is beginning to play
in how agency searches are conducted is indicative of the ways the
Internet is changing the way the advertising industry operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally bringing the agency search process in line with
the new technology,'' said Neil Kreisberg, executive vice president
and group director at Grey Advertising in New York, one of more
than 30 American and European agencies taking part in the start-up
of Agency Preview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the technological revolution in most of what we're
doing,'' he added, ``the way the process is being run now is pretty
archaic.''
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of the transformative nature of the Internet for
Madison Avenue include Web sites like www.adsgallery.com and
www.portfolios.com from Warp 10 Technologies Inc. in San Francisco,
which are meant to offer online showcases for the work of agencies,
graphic and Web designers, copywriters, photographers and other
creative talent, and online services for buying and selling
advertising space and commercial time like Adauction.com in San
Francisco and Adoutlet.com in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   One agency, Mann Bukvic Gatch Partners in Cincinnati, has even
put up a Web site (www.yourpitch.com) to compete for an account
placed in review by Screaming Media, a new media company in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising world is becoming more and more reliant on
global information,'' said Herve C. de Clerck, the founder and
president of Maydream, who goes by the fanciful title of dream
leader. ``Our goal is to connect advertisers, consultants and
agencies in an efficient manner, so that their new-business efforts
can be maximized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers don't want to waste time talking to agencies that
aren't right for them,'' he added, ``and agencies don't want to
waste time chasing business they will ultimately not win. And
consultants want to identify agencies they might have initially
overlooked _ or that might have conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 consultants, which help manage reviews,
participating in Agency Preview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe it's a plus,'' said Leslie Winthrop, managing
director at AAR/Bob Wolf Partners in New York, a consultant that is
part of the worldwide AAR consulting network.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have more information that's more easily accessible is more
cost efficient for the client,'' she added. ``And we can spend more
time with the agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants will pay $9,500 a year to have full access to the
Web site. Agencies will pay $2,000 a year to subscribe; in addition
to the data they can put up, they can also provide hot links to
their own Web sites, list e-mail contact information and offer
animated presentations.
</P>
<P>
   To oversee Agency Preview, Maydream, which is based in Boulogne,
France, has opened an American unit, Maydream Inc., in Hoboken,
N.J., where Rob Drasin is vice president for United States
marketing and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's something you don't read every day, ``Hoboken'' and
``France'' in the same sentence.

COMPUTER BRIEFS: A $199 COMPUTER; THE WHOOPS FACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer companies have long promised that computers would
someday be as easy to use as ordinary kitchen appliances, but so
far they have failed to deliver anything close.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Microworkz.com, a maker of low-price PCs in
Seattle, introduced a computer it contends is as easy to use as a
toaster oven and aptly named it the iToaster.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the device different is that it does not use Windows.
Instead, its operating system is a hybrid of Linux, the popular
public domain operating system, and the BeOS, an operating system
created by a former Apple executive.
</P>
<P>
   The result, says Rick Latman, chief executive of Microworkz, is
a combination word-processing, home-finance and Web-browsing
machine that has a graphic interface like Windows but is far
simpler to use.
</P>
<P>
   It does not replace a Windows machine, Latman said. It is for
people who cannot or do not want to use a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   At $199, it is also considerably cheaper than most Windows
machines except for Microworkz's own Webzter Jr. PC, which is
priced at $299.
</P>
<P>
   Latman said 10,000 iToasters would be available for purchase
directly from Microworkz.com beginning on July 15, and they will be
in retail stores by the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the iToaster cannot run standard software, nor can it
do complex computations.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons alone it may not find the ready audience that
Latman expects. It can, however, print to any Hewlett-Packard or
Epson Stylus printer, and it has a detached keyboard for word
processing, features which certainly improve its chances.
</P>
<P>
   Latman, who has sold tens of thousands Webzter Jr. machines and
is already taking orders for iToasters, envisions homes with an
iToaster in every room.
</P>
<P>
   To lift sales even before the selling has started, the company
is offering a discount: Starting this week, customers can pay
$19.95 a month for 24 months for a subscription to Microworkz's
Internet service and receive the iToaster free.

   ELIMINATING DATA FILES IS COSTLY FOR BUSINESSES
</P>
<P>
   Despite the havoc the Explore.exe and Melissa viruses have
wreaked on businesses over the last few months, a new survey shows
that there is a far bigger threat to data security lurking in
corporate America: You.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters Network International, a market research company,
said that the biggest threat to data security was, by far, computer
users accidentally deleting files. Call it the whoops factor.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 300 system managers released last week said
accidental deletions cause 30 times the data loss that viruses do.
</P>
<P>
   The survey said, much of the problem could be attributed to
ignorance: Many users are ill-informed about just how easy it is to
inadvertently delete a file or a set of files on a server.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that while nearly every computer has antivirus
software, few computers have protection to recover deleted files.
Losing data between backups is a huge fear among 54 percent of
system managers surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Daily backup, the most commonly used safeguard against data
loss, often fails entirely, leaving system managers without the
protection they thought they had.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of respondents said that backup device failure, along
with human error, makes backing up unreliable. Many times
individual computers are left out of backup schedules altogether.
</P>
<P>
   If the survey's dire revelations are true, corporations could be
losing more money in lost data than they previously thought, having
turned most of the attention to the threat of viruses.
</P>
<P>
   While estimates vary, some experts believe viruses cause more
than $500 million annually. (Melissa, which infected 19 percent of
the nation's large corporations, was responsible for nearly $300
million in data loss, according to the computer security company
ICSA.net.) That means accidental deletions could be causing U.S.
corporations $15 billion a year.

CHANGE IN INTERNET NAME REGISTRATION IS DELAYED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The protracted effort to introduce competition into
the lucrative business of registering Internet addresses has been
delayed for at least three weeks because of escalating tensions
among the Clinton administration, its handpicked successor for
running the global network and the government contractor that has
had a monopoly on the business.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is just the latest sign that the debate on the issue _
which has previously been confined largely to Internet insiders _
is quickly turning into a high-profile, high-stakes political game
of chicken, the results of which could lead to a dangerous tug of
war over what is essentially the Internet's telephone directory.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on the move to break up Network Solutions
Inc.'s hold on the business of registering the so-called domain
names that people use as Internet addresses in the popular
directories of .com, .net and .org. The company has had the
exclusive worldwide right since 1993 to assign Internet addresses
that end in any of those three-letter suffixes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in what was to be the final step in a decade-long
process of transferring control of the Internet to the private
sector, the Commerce Department created the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, to oversee the network.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN's charge was to open up the registration of Internet
addresses to competition. But the creation of ICANN and just about
everything its interim board has proposed have stirred opposition
and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The latest delay comes on the heels of a letter-writing campaign
by Ralph Nader and tax watchdog groups and an inquiry from the
chairman of the powerful House Commerce Committee, Rep. Thomas
Bliley, R-Va., questioning the actions and the authority of the
Commerce Department and ICANN. The potential fallout of the dispute
threatens both the centralized structure of the Internet and the
ability of ICANN to carry out its task.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great political theater,'' Michael Roberts, the interim
president of ICANN, said of the intense lobbying from both sides
that has moved to Capitol Hill and high levels of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said discussions about the dispute and its potential
effect on how the Internet operates have reached both the Pentagon
and the president's Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office.
</P>
<P>
   Those questioning ICANN say they are concerned that the interim
board is overstepping its authority. They have seized on the
board's refusal to hold open board meetings and its decision to
impose a $1-a-year fee on every domain name registered.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley sent blistering letters to Commerce Secretary William
Daley and to Esther Dyson, the interim chairwoman of ICANN, on
Tuesday. That was the same day a special congressional commission,
headed by Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, convened its first
meeting on Internet tax policy in Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley's accompanying news release offered a preview of the
potential political fallout that some fear could find its way into
the campaigns against Vice President Al Gore, who has positioned
himself as a champion of a tax-free, unregulated Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this ironic,'' Bliley said, ``just as Gov. Gilmore is
working hard with the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce to
encourage the growth of electronic commerce, ICANN is imposing a
tax on the Internet behind closed doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliley's letters ask for records and information about the
process used to select ICANN's interim board members and set its
$5.9 million budget, as well any analysis of its legal authority to
levy the $1 fee. The letters also seek information about statements
that ICANN officials made threatening to terminate the authority of
Network Solutions, a Virginia company, to register new Internet
addresses during its last meeting, in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   After that threat, Network Solutions began a full-scale lobbying
effort in Washington, seeking an investigation of ICANN. ICANN,
meanwhile, has accused the company of ``funding and otherwise''
fostering much of the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Although ICANN has since acknowledged that only the Commerce
Department has the authority to cut off Network Solutions' right to
register domain names, the company is also deadlocked with Commerce
officials over crucial details for opening its registry to
full-scale competition.
</P>
<P>
   One of five companies picked in April for the first round of
competition with Network Solutions, Register.com, has been
successfully registering names for several weeks. And ICANN and the
Commerce Department had hoped to open the system to more companies
on Friday. Instead, they announced the three-week delay, and people
close to the process said that they expected it to drag on even
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making sure that the technical bugs can be worked out to
ensure that the $20 million system that Network Solutions built
will run smoothly when multiple competitors come online, the two
sides remain deadlocked on key issues that were supposed to have
been ironed out months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The major question is who has rights to the Network Solutions
database that holds the information about who owns the more than 5
million registered domain names.
</P>
<P>
   They are also wrangling over how much the companies entering the
business will have to pay Network Solutions to administer the
central registry. Network Solutions also must reach an agreement on
terms under which it will recognize ICANN's authority. Network
Solutions has refused to sign the contract ICANN has developed,
saying it is overly restrictive and gives ICANN more power than the
administration intended when it drafted its plan for handing
Internet oversight to the private, nonprofit body.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, meanwhile, insists that if Network Solutions refuses to
compromise, the Commerce Department and ICANN could find another
company to take over administration of .com, .net and .org. But
that could not be done quickly or easily and would likely cause
some disruptions for Internet users and electronic commerce.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such a scenario could also force a split in the root of the
Internet, which is essentially the phone book of the Internet.
Roberts said ICANN was preparing to move the main root server for
the network from Network Solutions' headquarters in Herndon, Va.,
to California.
</P>
<P>
   But unless Network Solutions agrees to hand over the
corresponding data for that root, it might not immediately be able
to find all of the names that Network Solutions has registered.
That could create chaos on the Internet because computer users or
their Internet service providers would have to know the so-called
IP address of any site they wanted to visit or send e-mail to _ for
example, 204.177.154.13 instead of www.amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions, meanwhile, could continue running its own
root server, meaning that Internet service providers would have to
either choose between the roots, set up their systems to recognize
both or create their own roots.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Burr, a senior Commerce Department aide leading the
negotiations, said she remained optimistic that the problems would
be resolved without such drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we'll get there,'' she said on Friday. ``I
believe it is in everybody's best interest not to swing threats
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sure. A group of Internet technical experts
has begun talking about what the Internet might look like without a
central root system _ and without ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Auerbach, a video network developer for Cisco Systems Inc.
who has been involved in the Internet's engineering task force for
years, says he does not think a split root would be such a bad
thing. He said a split would essentially force Internet service
providers to create a competing list of directories, much as
telephone companies do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would result is that each of the root systems would try
to be more inclusive than its neighbors, and the net result would
be that they all end up being essentially the same as everybody,''
he said. ``The number to Fred's Barber Shop would still be the
number to Fred's Barber Shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a system, he said, could also allow Internet service to
cater to certain cultural or age groups, meaning they could set
their directories to keep their customers' Web browsers from
reaching certain sites that they might find offensive.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
With proper search utensil, you can locate any recipe 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Almost every good cook owns a shelf or two of
cookbooks. It's easy to recognize the best cookbooks on the shelf.
Those are the ones with grease spots and flour on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best library of cookbooks fails us from time to time.
There will be a recipe you can't find, or it'll be time to find a
new way to prepare an old dish. That's when it's time to browse the
world's largest library of recipes _ the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of great sites filled with recipes and _ with
most _ you can use the computer's ability to search for information
and keywords to go directly to the recipe you need.
</P>
<P>
   Our appetizer on today's culinary adventure is a site called
SOAR. That stands for the Searchable Online Archive of Recipes.
You'll find the site at soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/. This place
lives up to its name. While you can search for recipes by category
_ main dish, dessert and so on _ the real strength here is in the
search engine.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like a lot of people, you may not remember the formal
name of the dish you want to prepare, but you do remember the
ingredients. For instance, let's say all you know is that the
recipe used the Italian wine Marsala.
</P>
<P>
   Using Marsala as a keyword, the search turned up more than 100
recipes (you'll have to do your own search to find out exactly how
many of the 57,000 recipes in this database use Marsala) before I
stopped counting. There was Linguine Gamberini, Chicken Florentine,
Pork with Figs, Salmon Scampi ... the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The search even has a feature that helps poor spellers: You can
set it so that even if you spell Marsala as ``marsalla'' it'll find
the term. You can also use multiple search words, which is
especially handy with a database this size. You probably wouldn't
want to search, for instance, simply for ``beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ability to search is so important, let's take a look
at another recipe site with search features. This one is called the
Online Cookbook and is located at i99.com/cook/. You can search
this site by keyword, just like in our first example. However,
instead of the 100-plus recipes, a search for ``marsala'' here
turned up just six recipes. The difference seems to be that at this
site, you'll only get recipes with the keyword in the title. You
can also search an alphabetical index. So if you know the name of
the dish starts with a ``B,'' you can browse those recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site, the Culinary Cafe at www.culinarycafe.com/,
doesn't offer a keyword search. Instead, it uses a more
conventional approach. You select the category for the recipe _
cookies, cakes, main dishes, appetizers and so forth. For instance,
if you select the broad term of seafood, you'll go to a page where
you can then select recipes based on the type of seafood. It's a
more cumbersome process if you're searching for a specific recipe
but may be a handy method when you know that you want to prepare a
seafood dish but don't have a specific recipe in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The last stop on our search for the perfect recipe is at a place
called 1st Traveler's Choice Internet Cookbook at
www.virtualcities.com/ons/recipe.htm. The notion here is that the
recipes were gathered from famous restaurants, inns and hotels. The
search method here is the same as the one used at Culinary Cafe.
But there is a nifty feature that most cooks will appreciate. There
is a program on the page that helps you convert various measures.
So you'll be able to quickly find, for instance, that a half cup is
the same as 4 ounces, or 8 tablespoons, or 24 teaspoons, or 118 ml.
If you use a variety of cookbooks, including some from countries
that use liters and milliliters, then this will help you decipher
the measuring system.

BRAZILIANS TAKE TO THE WEB WITH UNCOMMON SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Pierre Schuermann, one of Brazil's Internet
barons, did not know things would develop so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Schuermann, 30, founded Zeek, a popular search
engine. Earlier this year, he sold Zeek to Star Media Network, a
company that was formed to seek out Internet opportunities in Latin
America, and became director of new business development in Brazil.
Then Star Media went public with a stock offering on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed of it all is amazing,'' Schuermann said in an
interview. ``I'm not sure when the 18-hour days are going to let
up.''
</P>
<P>
   They will probably continue for some time because Star Media is
facing competition from companies including Yahoo Inc., Microsoft,
America Online, Psinet and Telefonica SA _ that are jumping into
Brazil's portal war.
</P>
<P>
   The growing competition in Brazil among portals, the Web pages
people often use for information and links to other sites, may be a
preview of how large Internet companies will spread in other parts
of the non-English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perhaps the most competitive portal market in the
world at this time,'' said Osvaldo Barbosa de Oliveira, the head of
Microsoft's online operations in Brazil. Oliveira cited the entry
this year of the three largest portals, America Online, Yahoo and
Microsoft, plus competition from companies that provide
local-language content.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, companies like Telefonica of Spain are entering the
battle, as well as the Globo organization, Brazil's largest media
group.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's MSN was the first large foreign portal to establish
operations in Brazil, reaching deals with 19 Brazilian content
providers. Yahoo quickly followed with its own Portuguese-language
portal, opening an office in Sao Paulo this month, while America
Online, whose partner in Latin America is the Cisneros Group of
Venezuela, is expected to start operations this week.
</P>
<P>
   Making Brazil a priority is easy to understand. With a single
currency, set of borders and regulatory framework for nearly 165
million people, this country is an easier target for expansion than
the many Spanish-speaking countries stretching from Mexico to
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is another animal altogether because you get a huge
market with a common culture in one swoop,'' said Laura d'Oliveira,
the president of Sky3 in Hollywood, Fla., which specializes in
making corporate Web sites more profitable through online marketing
in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people using the Internet in Brazil grew 130
percent last year, making it Latin America's most wired nation,
accounting for half of the region's 6 million people on the Web,
according to International Data Corp. And despite a weak economy,
industry experts expect the number of Internet users in Brazil to
grow 60 percent to 100 percent over the next three years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those users pay rates for Internet access that are comparable to
those in the United States. The top two providers charge about $20
and $12 a month, respectively, for unlimited access. Others charge
a fee for a certain amount of time and then more for each extra
hour. For instance, IBM Brazil charges $23 a month for 30 hours of
access and $1.50 for each additional hour.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the growth in Internet use has taken place through the
efforts and innovation of local companies like Universo Online,
Brazil's largest service provider and portal, with 400,000
subscribers. Universo Online, which is owned by two large media
concerns, Grupo Folha and Grupo Abril, is known for imaginative
strategies like using live online ads to sell cars two years ago,
when such practices were rare anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although Caio Tulio Costa, the managing director of Universo
Online, declined to comment on speculation that the company had
been in takeover talks with a large portal company starting
operations in Brazil, he acknowledged that Universo Online was
close to selling a 10 percent stake to a new partner. And the
company has begun its own buying spree, with the purchase last week
of Miner Technology, a company in central Brazil that creates Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   While newcomers learn to compete with entrenched locals, the
portal war is taking place amid two bigger transformations. The
first is the invigoration of Brazil's telecommunications system, a
change that occurred after the nation's telephone monopoly was
privatized and opened to competition in 1998. That has increased
telephone and Internet access nationwide, something that is
expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the consolidation among Internet service
providers, or ISPs, a trend underlined by the recent purchase of
two leading providers by Psinet of Herndon, Va., catapulting Psinet
into the ranks of the country's five largest service providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By acquiring ISPs in Brazil, we're tapping into a market for
e-commerce that should grow by 75 to 100 percent over the next
couple of years,'' said Philippe Kuperman, head of Psinet's Latin
American activities. Though companies like Yahoo are largely in
search of advertising revenue, Psinet hopes to make money by
providing specific services to the corporate market.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar yet wider-reaching transaction, Telefonica bought a
controlling stake last week in Nutec, Brazil's second-largest
service provider and portal. Telefonica, already the biggest
telephone company in Brazil after gobbling up many parts of the
former state monopoly, bought Nutec to pursue its goal of being the
largest portal in the Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   Local news organizations speculated that Telefonica paid $500
million for Nutec, although people close to the transaction said
its value was considerably less.
</P>
<P>

   ``In the U.S. it's hard to find a friend who's not on the

Management and an expert on electronic commerce. ``I don't think
poverty should be that much of an obstacle as the price of PCs
falls.''

DeLorme's Topo USA knows its terrain well 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ DeLorme, the most prolific and diverse publisher of
digital maps, has produced a topographical map of the United
States, available in one whopping big DVD disk or by regions on
single CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   While I am no cartographic expert, Topo USA seems a remarkable
achievement; the entire United States _ all 50 states _ in
topographical detail on a single disk, with a full complement of
bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing thing about the maps is the available detail.
You can zoom in to a scale of 100 feet to 1 inch, with contour
changes shown at intervals of 20 feet everywhere but in Alaska,
where the maximum is 100 feet. I was able to determine the
elevation of my own house.
</P>
<P>
   You can search for a geographic point, a town or a street
address, and all are produced remarkably quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There is a set of tools for drawing on a map, and a mode in
which you can set up a hiking trip, complete with waypoints. All
this can be saved as a separate map and printed out in case you
aren't lugging your laptop with you.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you are lugging the laptop, the map will
work with DeLorme's Global Positioning satellite receivers to show
you exactly where you are at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   The normal view is top down with standard indicators of
elevation change. As you move the cursor across the screen, a
window on the left side contains boxes that constantly change to
show the latitude and longitude, and the elevation, of the cursor
location. Upon your order, the view will shift to a 3-D elevation
that can be controlled in terms of angle and rotation. It is not a
great rendering, but it gives a good idea of the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   You can change the regular cursor to a ``query cursor,'' so that
clicking anywhere on the map provides information on the specific
location. This is most useful, as the maps are not cluttered with a
lot of place names. Ponds of 4-5 acres loom like the Great Lakes at
maximum zoom levels. Many creeks that doubtless have names are
relegated to the status of ``intermittent stream,'' but you can't
expect everything, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Topo USA is full of pleasant surprises. I asked it to
find Ingalls in Oklahoma, expecting no response. But the program
cogitated for a couple of seconds and then presented me with a map
of north central Oklahoma and a label pointing to Ingalls.
</P>
<P>
   This was a surprise because Ingalls no longer exists. More than
100 years ago it was an outlaw town, and became the scene of one of
the most epic gunbattles in Western history when a couple of
wagonloads of U.S. deputy marshals tried to capture the Doolin
gang. Now, however, none of the buildings remains and it is largely
blackjack thicket, a piece of history gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Topo, however, and to my delight, when I asked the
``query cursor'' to report on the location, it came back describing
Ingalls not as a town, but as a locale.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a hiker, but I love maps and Topo USA is a treat. The
DVD is priced at a very reasonable list of $100.

Read up before lighting the grill 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first time you tried to fake your way through
being an outdoor cook, you may have ended up with oxymoron meat:
charred but raw.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been a site like Better Homes and Gardens Online's
Summer Cooking School around, you might not have had to settle for
take-out that night.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.bhg.com/food/grillschool/, takes you through the
basics _ how to pile the charcoal, how much lighter fluid to use
and how to light the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Reading it will save you the trouble, and expense, of squirting
lighter fluid on a hill of coals as if you were trying to douse a
flame rather than start one. Once lit, the coals are supposed to be
left to heat up for at least 20 minutes. Mine sat for about 10
minutes, which is why the chicken cooked a bit unevenly.
</P>
<P>
   Grill-master mistakes are not limited to the charcoal grill, and
neither is the Web site's instruction.
</P>
<P>
   A separate section explains how to light a gas grill (one hint:
leave the lid up) and how to cook on and clean a gas grill.
</P>
<P>
   The site is divided into six sections: gas grilling basics,
charcoal grilling basics, key techniques, flavor enhancers, handy
utensils and grilling books.
</P>
<P>
   Study to determine what cell phone does to brain
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered what holding a cell phone to your ear does to your
brain, but don't have time to hold it there for a few years to find
out?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at England's Bristol University have the time. A
mobile phone will be placed next to the ear of a model of a human
head for two years to study what high-frequency radio signals do to
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The July issue of Popular Mechanics magazine has that little
nugget. The magazine can also be reached online, at
www.popularmechanics.com.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the issue is a look at cell phones with Internet access
and a piece on how to goose your iMac so it is Windows-compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Ballparks.com offers a bit of sports-related nostalgia
</P>
<P>
   If you're a sports fan, stadiums and arenas are near-holy
places. If you're a sports fan older than 20, many of those
near-holy places are gone.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site called Ballparks.com is keeping the faith. The site,
www.ballparks
</P>
<P>
   .com, has photographs, trivia and details about old arenas and
ballparks from the major pro leagues of baseball, basketball,
hockey and football.
</P>
<P>
   For most ballparks, outdoor and indoor pictures are included.
The pages usually include interesting bits of trivia about each
stadium or arena. For example, who knew that Detroit's Tiger
Stadium has the only in-play flagpole in the major leagues?
</P>
<P>
   Even more worthwhile, the site has pictures _ sometimes
architectural drawings, sometimes construction images _ of new
stadiums and arenas, including Atlanta's Philips Arena and
Detroit's Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are links to official arena Web sites and official
ballpark Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bubbly artwork for the stars _ and you
</P>
<P>
   Now you, too, thanks to the Internet, can own what Lily Tomlin,
RuPaul, Rosanna Arquette and Frank Zappa's family own.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork of Allee Willis, a Grammy Award-winning Southern
California songwriter and artist, is selling really campy art under
the name Bubbles. You can see and buy her work at
bubblestheartist.com.
</P>
<P>
   Her paintings, which can be bought from the Web site, range in
price from $65 to $250.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers a catalog of Bubbles' work, searchable by items
in the painting. You can search by hairstyles or for ``paintings
with eyeglasses,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   As a songwriter, Willis wrote the theme song for the TV show,
``Friends,'' as well as ``September,'' which was performed by
Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire.
</P>
<P>
   The art of Bubbles the Artist is collected by Tomlin, Paul,
Arquette and several Zappas.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
If all else fails, think of the Web as tech support 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's the world's good fortune that I am not an airline
pilot or a brain surgeon. I learn best after making a horrible
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Microsoft sent me its Windows 98 Update, and I
installed it on my home computer. Everything seemed to go OK
through the installation process, but when the installation was
over, everything on my screen looked as if it had been drawn in
crayon. The colors were way off.
</P>
<P>
   So I clicked on the desktop screen with the right mouse button,
selected Properties and then selected the Settings tab to check the
video setup, since something was obviously wrong with the way
Windows set up my video card. Sure enough, Windows hadn't found the
driver (drivers are the small programs used by your PC to control
various devices such as modems, video cards, sound cards, scanners
and the like). So it installed a generic driver that comes with
Windows and _ as a result _ my computer could only work in its
lowest setting for graphics: 16-color mode. That's like trading in
your Ferrari for a used Yugo.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, I figured. I'll get the floppy disk that includes
the installation program for my Matrox video card. Then it's a
simple matter of opening up the Add/Remove Hardware icon in the
Control Panel folder, putting the disk in my A: drive and telling
the PC to use the video driver on the floppy.
</P>
<P>
   I moved back in September, and things are still in disarray. I
pawed through about 10 boxes of floppy disks _ found some that
contained copy for ads that I wrote back in the 1980s when I worked
for advertising agencies, found disks with old short stories I
tried to write, found everything but the disk for my video card.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the computer still worked fine in 16-color mode. I
could see the screen, and the modem still worked. So I popped over
to the Web site for Matrox, downloaded the drivers for my video
card and was back in business.
</P>
<P>
   That's lesson No. 1 today. The Web is an 24-hour tech support
center. If you need a driver or an update to a program you own,
check the Web first. Most often, you'll find the address for the
Web site in the printed material that came with the product. But
even if it isn't listed there, you can almost certainly find the
address by using one of the search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's move to lesson No. 2. If I had remembered this
lesson, I would have never needed lesson No. 1. Keep all your most
important disks _ the ones you'd need if you ever had to reinstall
Windows or if something goes wrong with your hard disk _ in one
spot. When you computer goes down, there's a natural sense of panic
anyway, and that's the worst time to start scattering the contents
of desk drawers around on a mad search. There will be times when
your computer won't work at all without the necessary disk, which
means you can't always depend on getting what you need from a Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson No. 3 caught me by surprise. When I finally found the
Matrox Web site I realized that, while I knew the name of the
manufacturer, I did not remember the specific model of video card
that I owned. Ordinarily, you could just pop over to the System
icon in the Control Panel folder and read the name under the
hardware section. But since Windows didn't recognize the card, that
option wasn't open to me.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't find the printed invoice that came with my computer,
nor could I find the manual for the video card. So that left me
with the option of opening up the computer to look on the video
card itself or tear into still another box of computer stuff.
Luckily, in this case Matrox has some generic drivers for idiots
such as myself _ these drivers work with all models of Matrox
cards.
</P>
<P>
   So my computer is up and running again. The new version of
Windows 98 is well-behaved. Things are in living color once again.
And I'm a little bit smarter.

Private technology leaders recognized 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a list for everything these days, and private
technology companies are no exception. The June issue of Upside
magazine lists what it considers the 100 top private technology
companies. The winners were picked, the magazine says, from some
1,000 contenders. Among those selected was Brocade Communications
Systems of San Jose, Calif. It makes fiber-channel switching
equipment used in digital networks. Another winner was Copper
Mountain Networks of Palo Alto, Calif. Copper Mountain makes a
technology that speeds up the digital telephone technology the Baby
Bells are trying to deploy.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   You can learn just about everything via computer these days, and
that includes music. Harmonic Vision, based in Evanston, Ill., has
released two computer CDs that teach kids the fundamentals of music
theory and how to read music. The CDs are called Music Ace and
Music Ace 2. The first program is for beginners, the second for
more advanced students. Each program retails for about $50. For
more information about the Music Ace CDs, check out the company's
Web site at www.harmonicvision.com. You can also download free
demos of the programs, which will work on both Macs and PCs, from
the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Edmark, a educational software company based in Seattle, has
released two new titles in its Thinkin' Things series. ``All Around
Frippletown'' uses the motif of a silly town to teach
problem-solving and logic. Edmark's second title uses a mystery
motif to teach the same skills in ``Sky Island Mysteries.'' Kids
help Inspector Cluestoe solve 14 mysteries. In doing so, they are
called on to gather information and draw conclusions. Each game is
available for either PCs or Macs and retails for about $30.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   There are tons of new developments in the Apple and Mac
community. A great way to keep up with all the changes is a Web
site called MacSurfer. It's a compendium of headlines and items
from the major Mac sites across the Web. Click on a headline, and
you'll jump right to the story. MacSurfer also maintains links to
sites that list software upgrades. You'll find MacSurfer at www
</P>
<P>
   .macsurfer.com.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the fastest way to look up information, but it does
work. Encyclopedia.com is a Web-based encyclopedia. You type in a
request in the search window, and the site presents a definition
and other information. You'll find this site at www

AIRLINES APPEAL RULING ON UNMARRIED PARTNERS LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The nation's largest air carriers have appealed
a federal court ruling that upholds key portions of the San
Francisco law that calls for companies to provide equal benefits to
unmarried partners of employees.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken ruled last month that
airlines flying in and out of San Francisco International Airport
must comply with certain mandates under the city's Equal Benefits
Ordinance, chiefly that when it comes to benefits, they must treat
their employees in domestic partnerships the same as those who are
married.
</P>
<P>
   That is the intent of San Francisco's ground-breaking Equal
Benefits Ordinance, which went into effect June 1, 1997, and covers
companies that do business with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Wilken excluded health and pension benefits from the requirement
for the airlines, saying only the federal government has
jurisdiction over those areas for the industry. But for other
perks, such as family and bereavement leave and flight discounts,
the law stands, she said. Other contractors outside the airline
industry must provide the same benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ordinance aims to fulfill in economic terms a promise
long-required in city contracts: that parties doing business with
the city not discriminate based on sexual orientation or marital
status,'' wrote Wilken, who is based in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines appealed the ruling Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are important policy issues for the airlines in terms of
who regulates the industry,'' said David Berg, a lawyer for the Air
Transport Association. The ATA, a trade organization for the
airlines, was joined by United Airlines and Federal Express in
suing to overturn the city law. Another contractor challenged the
law on moral grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Berg argues that local governments have no right to pass laws
that dictate how the airlines treat their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Aftergut, chief assistant city attorney and the lead
lawyer on the case for the city, said United Airlines seems to pick
and choose what local laws it chooses to follow. United, the
Chicago-base carrier that is owned by the UAL Corp., is the largest
carrier at San Francisco International Airport and has led the
fight against the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Jan. 11, 1999, United Airlines agreed to comply with Los
Angeles' living wage law,'' Aftergut said. ``Their spokesman said
they did so because the law was reasonable and it was in their
business interests to do so. Why isn't it reasonable and in their
business interests to provide these trivial-cost,
non-discriminatory benefits?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how the Los Angeles living wage law, which sets a
minimum wage for city contractors, is different from San
Francisco's equal benefits law, Berg said the domestic partners
ordinance would be more administratively cumbersome for the
airlines. And, he added, ``From our perspective, or at least maybe
from United's perspective, living wage, or minimum wage, is
somewhat different. There's a stronger argument that this is
historically an area that is regulated by local jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the recent emergence of the living wage movement, however,
minimum wage has been in the jurisdiction of the federal
government, although states have been allowed to set a higher
standard. Cities rarely got involved.
</P>
<P>
   United spokesman Matthew Triaca declined to comment on the
appeal ``because of the sensitive nature of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists are boycotting United because of its stance on the
domestic partners law.
</P>
<P>
   The law takes effect when contracts between a company and the
city are renewed. United got into the fray when it negotiated a new
contract for a maintenance and kitchen facility at the airport, a
contract the city has threatened to sever because of non-compliance
with the domestic partners edict. Wilken has issued an order
forbidding the city to take action against United for the time
being, pending further court action.

Security systems offer comfort 
By Karen Dean  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Say the words ``home security'' and what comes to
mind?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you envision a few simple deadbolt locks. Perhaps you
picture elaborate laser beams and infrared sensors that would put
the CIA to shame. Then again, your idea of home security may be
faithful Bitsy, the ankle-chewing Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you picture it, Americans are becoming more
security-conscious, and the home security industry is thriving.
According to the National Burglar and Fire Alarm Association,
Americans spent an estimated $14.8 billion on professionally
installed electronic security products and services in 1997 alone.
By the end of 1998, more than 20 percent of households were
estimated to be electronically protected.
</P>
<P>
   The reason seems to be that electronic protection works. Studies
have shown that homes without the benefit of security systems are
two to three times more likely to be burglarized than those
equipped with them. Since burglary is one of the least likely
crimes to be solved, with a rate of only 13.4 percent solved
nationwide, an alarm system may be a comforting solution.
</P>
<P>
   So you think you might want to join the wired brigade? Well, the
good news is that you won't have to cash in that 401(k) to pay for
the system. With prices ranging from $150 for a no-frills system to
upward of six figures for an intricate network of video,
multiple-entry monitoring and infrared sensors, there's a system
for just about every budget.
</P>
<P>
   Before you hop in the car to scope out what's available, take a
look around your house. The easiest and cheapest home protection
comes in the form of sturdy locks and window pins. Even with an
alarm, a thief has a few moments before police arrive, so securing
those entry points can go a long way toward keeping your property
in the house, where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of any effective security system is to deter, delay
and detect,'' says Officer Ginger Smith of the Gwinnett County,
Ga., Crime Prevention Unit. ``Visible decals and a good combination
of locks, sensors and audible alarms can make your home less
appealing to a burglar.''
</P>
<P>
   Security systems come in two basic forms: hard-wired versions
and battery-operated wireless systems. The hard-wired system links
the indoor sensors to a central control panel by wiring run through
the house. Wireless systems operate by tiny transistors contained
in the door and window sensors that send radio frequencies to a
main control box. During an attempted break-in, either system sends
a message from the sensors to the main control board, activating
the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   While many industry experts continue to feel that hard-wired
systems are more reliable, the wireless alternatives are gaining
popularity and may be more practical in homes without ready access
to interior wiring, such as in an unfinished basement.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding on any system, experts suggest you consider your
lifestyle and needs. Living with an alarm system requires
adjustments, like remembering to arm and disarm the alarm when
leaving or returning home. Children or indoor pets can make certain
alarms or motion sensors a nightmare to deal with, so you may need
a program with customizing options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many one-size-fits-all systems give a false sense of security
for the homeowner,'' says Jim Callahan of Ackerman Security. ``The
best choice is to have a trained consultant view your home with
you. The choice of options is still yours, but a professional
designer can make recommendations to best utilize the system for
your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Most alarm systems provide perimeter sensors that guard doors
and windows. You can then purchase additional sensors that offer
protection in case an intruder gets inside the house. Motion
detectors are often used to detect motion or heat changes in a
room, which trigger the alarm. Passive infrared motion sensors work
by detecting increases in temperature. But dual-technology sensors
are available that detect motion and heat simultaneously and may
reduce your risk of false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   When you finally decide on a system, you're not limited to
professional installation. The ``let me do it'' syndrome has
reached the security industry as well, and several local companies
offer products and advice for those willing to tackle the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``A knowledgeable do-it-yourselfer can often do as good a job as
many professional installers,'' says Craig Degrenier of
DeKalb-Gwinnett Alarm Co.
</P>
<P>
   A basic self-installed hard-wired system with control panel,
motion detector and three door-and-window sensors can be bought for
as little as $189, with extra window and door sensors for around $5
each and additional motion detectors starting at $30 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless components require a lot less effort to install and
about as much electronics knowledge as setting up a stereo. Place
your door and window sensors, set up for monitoring, and you're
ready to go. Plus, when you're ready to move, the system can be
packed up along with the dishes and taken to your new home.
Retailers such as Radio Shack, Home Depot and Lowe's sell the
wireless components, with prices starting at $150 for a console,
sensors for four doors or windows and a motion detector.
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution for budding do-it-yourselfers, though. Placing
the sensors correctly can make the difference between a
well-functioning alarm and one that consistently cries wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that magnetic contacts and motion detectors be
set and aimed accurately,'' says Bill Zelud, editor of Security
Distributing Magazine, an industry guide. ``Failing to place those
correctly can compromise the effectiveness of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you have made your choice _ hard-wired or wireless _ you're
left with the decision of whether to have the system monitored.
Monitoring is an optional cost, but many industry insiders feel
it's critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monitoring is the backbone and what makes the whole system
work,'' says Bruce Goldberg of Brinks. ``That's what guarantees a
quick response to your alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring company receives and verifies an alarm, then
notifies the appropriate law enforcement agency. With an
unmonitored audible alarm, you're relying on your neighbors to
finally get tired of hearing that noise and call the police. By
that time, your favorite VCR could be occupying the top shelf in
Bub's Pawn Palace.
</P>
<P>
   While many monitoring companies welcome self-installed
hard-wired systems, not all are so receptive. Many larger
companies, such as Ackerman, Brinks and ADT, will not monitor
systems that were not professionally installed because of concerns
regarding installation procedures or the risk of increased false
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring is also available for wireless components, with many
retailers offering services when you purchase your system. The
monitoring fees typically are $20 a month and up, often available
without a long-term commitment. But whether hard-wired or wireless,
shopping around in the competitive Atlanta market often results in
a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   Beside providing peace of mind, there may also be a bonus to
your wallet for having a home-security system. Many insurers offer
discounts up to 20 percent to policyholders with security systems.
However, monitoring or professional installation may be required
for the discount to apply, so check with your agent before spending
those savings.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever choice you make, the knowledge of an extra watchful
eye guarding your home and family can give you some added
assurances of safety. And give Bitsy a well-deserved rest.

Family photo album has gone high-tech 
By Omar Gallaga  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I have a cousin named Brianna whom, because of
work commitments, I wasn't able to see in person for a long time
after she was born.
</P>
<P>
   When she was about 2 years old, I opened my e-mail to discover a
huge, full-color photo of the baby sent by my parents. Immediately,
I got a breathless call from my mother. She wanted to make sure I
received the scanned photo, and of course, to comment on how cute
Brianna was. ``Que hermosa!'' my mom said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing my mother get excited about an infant isn't new, but
seeing her thrilled about a new piece of technology (in this case,
a scanner I'd lent her) is.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of other home users are getting excited, too, because PC
components like scanners, digital cameras, color printers and
editing software have dropped so far in price that even casual PC
users can turn their computers into photo editing studios.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just about price, although sub-$100 scanners and
ever-cheaper color printers have helped. The real reason why people
are turning to digital photos is that many users who only use their
computers for word processing or checkbook balancing have found a
killer application that is practical and truly useful.
</P>
<P>
   Digital photos are the culmination of several wants that
consumers have had and technological and pricing steps that are
fulfilling them. They are:
</P>
<P>
   _Storage _ Print photos decay, get lost, get torn up by angry
ex-spouses, get misfiled in family albums. The increasing size of
hard drives and the increasing number of storage options on PCs
(Zip drives, recordable CDs) make storing large numbers of large
photo files possible. Software makers like E-Book Systems have
created software like ``Digital Flip Album,'' which lets users
create slide shows and computerized photo albums.
</P>
<P>
   _Web development _ As more companies and individuals put up Web
pages, digital cameras and scanners have made it easy to turn
text-only Web pages into colorful, image-laden sites.
</P>
<P>
   _Easy mailing _ E-mail has made the near-instantaneous exchange
of data a reality. Being able to send photos to grandma with a few
clicks of a mouse button (provided she has an Internet account) is
a real-world, practical use for all the technology that the Intels
and Microsofts have been pushing all these years.
</P>
<P>
   _Easy transport _ Digital photos are pretty portable as it is,
with several dozen fitting on a single Zip disk, but future plans
are to make them even more so. Sony, for instance, has introduced
the Memory Stick, a plastic piece of memory that measures about the
size of a stick of gum. A memory stick will hold music, photos and
files and can transfer information between computers, digital
devices and even digital picture frames that can display an image
on a flat screen.
</P>
<P>
   _Photo editing _ Last week, Britain's new Earl of Wessex, Prince
Edward, had a royal photographer replace a glum-looking Prince
William from a photo of Edward's wedding with a happier image of
the young man using digital editing. While this may be a little
extreme, digital editing software can perform more simple tasks
like removing red-eye from photos, cropping a photo, erasing
smudges and spots on an image and even changing the background on a
picture. While it also makes it easier to doctor photos to suggest
alien abductions, photo editing can help correct problems in what
would otherwise be perfect pictures.
</P>
<P>
   _Quality and production _ The newer digital image products,
including mega-pixel digital cameras and high-resolution scanners,
produce much better-quality images than older models, which
sometimes produced grainy, pixelized pictures. A chief complaint
among early adopters was poor imaging, but as the technology has
improved, digital photos can now rival the sharpness and depth of
print photos. If that can be achieved without a stop at the
one-hour photo shop, consumers will find it more convenient.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that the digital revolution spells the end
of print photos, but print image giants like Kodak and Adobe have
been quick to produce software and Web sites that cater to home
users who want new ways to store and use photos.
</P>
<P>
   Archiving digital memories will continue to get cheaper and
easier, saving us more time and money to take photogenic vacations
that will end up in our PC scrapbooks.

VIOLENCE EXISTED BEFORE HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN BOESSENECKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At a high school in Littleton, Colo., two
teen-age boys randomly shot and killed 12 fellow students and a
teacher, then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   At a home in San Miguel, near San Luis Obispo, Calif., six young
men randomly attacked the 11 occupants. With guns, knives, and
axes, they killed them all: men, women and children. A pregnant
mother was stabbed to death; so was her unborn child. An old man
and three boys, ages 3 to 5, died with their heads split open. The
bodies were piled in a heap and set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   One of these events was in the news; the other, long forgotten.
The crimes were separated by 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton triggered
national soul searching. Blame has been pointed at everything from
assault weapons to computer games and violent films.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of such a tragedy, it is important that Americans
view the Colorado killings, as well as violence in general, in
historical context. It becomes plain that levels of violence in
modern America are infinitesimal when compared with those of the
Western frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The San Miguel massacre, one of the worst U.S. mass murders of
the 19th century, took place at the beginning of the Gold Rush. It
was an omen of bloodshed to come. The 49ers who rushed into
California created not just a new frontier, a new industry and a
new state, but a culture of extraordinary violence. The Gold Rush
saw rates of homicide never equaled in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The annual homicide rate in the United States in the late 1990s
is about 9 per 100,000 population.
</P>
<P>
   Between September 1850 and September 1851, 31 homicides were
recorded in the pueblo of Los Angeles, which then had 2,500
residents.
</P>
<P>
   As calculated on the modern FBI crime-rate scale, this is
equivalent to an annual rate of 1,240 homicides per 100,000
population.
</P>
<P>
   During the rest of the 1850s, Los Angeles County continued to
experience horrific homicide rates ranging from a low of 110 to a
high of 414 on the FBI scale.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the homicide rate in the Tuolumne County
mining camp of Sonora was 506 on the FBI scale. This was more than
50 times the current national rate.
</P>
<P>
   Many Gold Rush communities experienced astronomic rates of
homicide _ Monterey County, 333; Tuolumne County, 110; Nevada
County, 81.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco was relatively peaceful, with an average annual
homicide rate of 49, five times that of today.
</P>
<P>
   Computer games, violent films and assault weapons played no part
in Gold Rush violence. The causes were much more complex.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in industrialism led many young American men to leave
farms and villages to work in urban factories and mills.
</P>
<P>
   This caused fundamental breakdowns in social and family life,
and disrupted the time-honored master/apprentice system that had
previously provided for upward social mobility.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1830s and 1840s, a bachelor cult of masculinity arose.
</P>
<P>
   Young urban males, bored and uninspired by industrial labor,
rejected traditional values of work, sobriety and frugality.
</P>
<P>
   Without organized sports or recreational activities, young men
clustered in saloons, political clubs, militia companies and
firehouses. There they drank, gambled and battled each other in
violent defense of personal honor.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of these young Americans flooded into California in
1849 and after. In the mines they encountered gold seekers from
every corner of the earth: Mexico, South America, Europe and China.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic, religious, economic and political strife became
commonplace. During the first years of the Gold Rush there were no
courts, no police and no prisons, so every miner carried a pistol
or Bowie knife for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Men died by the thousands in brawls, mining disputes, bandit
raids, formal duels, riots and lynchings. On average, a California
resident of the 1850s was 17 times more likely to be murdered than
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Take heart, America. Things just aren't as bad today as we think
they are.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>

His study of Gold Rush violence, ``Gold Dust and Gunsmoke,'' was
published in April by John Wiley &AMP; Sons.)

Hey, candidates: Show a little life 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The presidential pregame show is already under way,
even though there's more than a year to go before the actual
election. In addition to political advisers and pollsters, the
candidates of the next millennium are also hiring gurus to design
Web sites that will engage voters, garner donations and keep the
media up to date on their latest campaign doings.
</P>
<P>
   As the trade magazine The Industry Standard put it, ``Move over
James Carville and Mary Matalin. There's a new breed of political
consultant out there, one that knows how to write (Web design code)
HTML.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, nobody's doing a particularly good job of online
campaigning. Despite some of the high-paid firepower employed by
some of the leading candidates, it appears the heavy artillery is
on hold. What we have now are primarily introductory Web sites,
offering information, travel agendas, speeches, slogans and secure
servers so Web surfers can make donations before hopping off to
eBay to bid on that Rocky and Bullwinkle vintage lunchbox.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's one bit of advice every political candidate and
his or her Web team must learn. Write it on a blackboard 500 times
if you must, just learn it.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is a visual, interactive medium. Yes, that's right,
in-ter-ac-tive. Remember, you are talking to people who are used to
posting book reviews on Amazon.com, complaining to Lands' End that
their weekly overstocks site has too many orange polo shirts and
clogging Yahoo! Finance message boards with hot Internet stock
tips.
</P>
<P>
   This is your chance to let people talk to you. Complain to you.
For heaven's sake, this is a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week town
meeting. Go for it. Post your best pictures. Provide excerpts from
your best speeches. Tell us when you'll be in our town. Ask us what
we care about. Maybe have us take a poll or two. Do something,
anything to make voters get involved with you and your Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In-ter-ac-tive. If you don't know what it means, ask one of your
college student volunteers. Then do it.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the presidential sites are wading into the Web waters
with so-so results. For example, Al Gore, self-described Net geek,
has a Web site that lives up to his reputation as a somewhat
less-than-colorful candidate. But as anyone who has seen the vice
president poking fun at himself with David Letterman knows, the
candidate does have a lighter side. Only pieces of it show on his
Web site, and as Ross Perot would say, ``That's just sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gore is online every day, the people who put his Web
site together might want to head back to the design studio for a
few pointers. The site posts Gore's speeches as just one long page
of plain text. No pictures, nothing, simply an endless stream of
pale blue text. Few political speeches are memorable barnburners
the ordinary citizen will want to read again and again. However, if
the candidate has a serious message to convey, pouring it onto the
Internet is not the way to do it. It's boring and doesn't give
voters much insight.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Town Hall section is the most interesting part of the
site, and he'd do well to put this kind of interactive feature on
all his pages, especially the ones with the deadly speeches.
Ordinary people ask questions, and Gore gives simple answers in a
chatty but dignified tone.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate could also learn a thing or two from the page
devoted to his wife, Tipper. The page is filled with pictures of a
smiling Tipper traveling the world, hugging children and jogging
with the Russian Olympic team. Should Gore win the election, Tipper
won't have the political influence of Hillary Rodham Clinton, but
here she's shown at her political and personal best.
</P>
<P>
   Another tip for aspiring presidential candidates: Register those
Web addresses early and often. Register every variation on your
name or campaign you can think of. Pay for it yourself. They're
only $70 each from Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you'll find yourself in the unfortunate situation of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose late entry into the online
campaign left plenty of room for a parody site, www.gwbush.com. The
site's not quite as funny as some of the parody sites that popped
up in 1996, but it is still official-looking enough to prompt the
governor, the apparent Republican front-runner, to file a legal
complaint against the site, which lampoons his personal life and
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be limits to freedom,'' Bush told The Dallas
Morning News. Not good. Definitely not good with those
free-speech-loving, anti-regulation Internet types. Taken out of
context, it could be upsetting to a whole lot of people who've
grown fond of the First Amendment over the last 210 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now has his own official Web site, www.georgewbush
</P>
<P>
   .com, which looks as if it were designed by the folks who did
the parody site. Also not good. However, it was the first bit of
online political excitement to date and a potential political
setback for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates all have miles to go before the Web becomes an
essential campaign tool. There's plenty of time to learn to use it
to its best advantage. It really does matter.

BAD APPLE VS. THE BIG APPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ My wife formed an exploratory committee, and we
headed to New York.
</P>
<P>
   We couldn't decide whether to vacation upstate or downstate, so
we did both.
</P>
<P>
   A New York campaign, even an exploratory one, travels on its
stomach, so my wife ate pizza at John's Pizzeria near Times Square
and pastrami at the Second Avenue deli.
</P>
<P>
   She dove into a platter of chicken wings at the Anchor Bar in
Buffalo and gingerly sipped a glass of Finger Lakes Chardonnay over
a bowl of watery hippie vegetables at the Moosewood Restaurant in
Ithaca.
</P>
<P>
   She even wore a New York baseball cap _ not a Yankees or Mets
cap, but a cap from the SoHo gourmet store Dean &AMP; Deluca. That's
the New York team Hillary Rodham Clinton probably knows best.
</P>
<P>
   We saw the first lady's Secret Service agents loading her
carpetbags into a Jeep Cherokee outside a hotel on Central Park
South.
</P>
<P>
   Later we saw Hillary Clinton on the evening news in a pink
pantsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ba-dup, ba-dum,'' sang my wife in Pink Panther tones. ``That's
it for Hillary. No pink pantsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not saying my wife is running against Hillary Clinton
and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for senator. But they're both
vulnerable, very vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary Clinton is elected, it's proof that New York has gone
soft, falling for all that ``it takes a village'' pap, and I don't
mean the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   And the man who made New York soft is Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square is clean and safe. The subways are clean and safe.
Giuliani has brought orderliness to muggings. In order to be beaten
up or shot, you have to fit a police profile.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where Giuliani put them, but midtown Manhattan is
completely homeless-less. The only shabbily clad people you see are
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers even say ``Have a nice day,'' and they aren't
reading from one of Giuliani's little etiquette cards.
</P>
<P>
   That old saying about New York no longer holds true. If you can
make it in New York, you still might not be able to make it in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   These were just a few of the things my wife and I experienced
while she was exploratorily campaigning in New York:
</P>
<P>
   _ In New York, you raise your hand and a cab pulls up. New
Yorkers won't even wrestle you for it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you raise your hand in San Francisco, a guy says, ``Now
give me your wallet with the other hand.'' If you want a cab, you
can apply to be a driver and meet the mugger faster.
</P>
<P>
   _ In New York, the subway trains and buses run constantly and
are air-conditioned. If there's any graffiti in New York anymore,
it must be in an art gallery somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ In San Francisco, the subways and buses never come, but the
whole town is air-conditioned and adorned with graffiti for your
trudging comfort and art- appreciation convenience.
</P>
<P>
   _ In New York, you can cross the street and the traffic stops
for you. In fact, traffic has been stopped since 1973, and nowadays
it's all trucks, people from New Jersey and cabs (which is why
they're so easy to hail).
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers have liberated themselves from cars, while people in
the Bay Area have hung tough, pretending they still can get up
enough speed to kill a pedestrian on Fourth Street at rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   While New York is going as soft as Noah's bagels, San Francisco
keeps making things tougher on people, plunking down ballparks
along commute routes and replacing parking lots with high-rises.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the San Franciscan won't wimp out and abandon the
automobile. The automobile is the Californian's birthright (or 16th
birthdayright), and San Francisco is still technically part of
California.
</P>
<P>
   You gotta be tough.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you gotta have a real mass transit system to get
drivers to wimp out and bail out. Will San Francisco give them that
mass transit? No way. They gotta be tough; as tough as a bus is to
find.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors have to be tough, too.
</P>
<P>
   You want Extreme Games? Those are easy, except for the extreme
lines to get into them. Every day is Extreme Games in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   We have extreme rents, extreme bad manners, extreme public
transportation, extreme parking, extreme homelessness, extreme
waiters, extreme Nokia noxiousness, extreme crime, extreme
outrageousness.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kinds of things that made the Big Apple great
before it went soft on us.
</P>
<P>
   Leave your heart in San Francisco? Forget it. We'll leave you
with a cardiac.
</P>
<P>
   If that Senate race doesn't work out, my wife isn't ruling out a
run for mayor of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Her message: Yo, New York. San Francisco is a badder apple than
you are.
</P>

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
With proper search utensil, you can locate any recipe 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Almost every good cook owns a shelf or two of
cookbooks. It's easy to recognize the best cookbooks on the shelf.
Those are the ones with grease spots and flour on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best library of cookbooks fails us from time to time.
There will be a recipe you can't find, or it'll be time to find a
new way to prepare an old dish. That's when it's time to browse the
world's largest library of recipes _ the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of great sites filled with recipes and _ with
most _ you can use the computer's ability to search for information
and keywords to go directly to the recipe you need.
</P>
<P>
   Our appetizer on today's culinary adventure is a site called
SOAR. That stands for the Searchable Online Archive of Recipes.
You'll find the site at soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/. This place
lives up to its name. While you can search for recipes by category
_ main dish, dessert and so on _ the real strength here is in the
search engine.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like a lot of people, you may not remember the formal
name of the dish you want to prepare, but you do remember the
ingredients. For instance, let's say all you know is that the
recipe used the Italian wine Marsala.
</P>
<P>
   Using Marsala as a keyword, the search turned up more than 100
recipes (you'll have to do your own search to find out exactly how
many of the 57,000 recipes in this database use Marsala) before I
stopped counting. There was Linguine Gamberini, Chicken Florentine,
Pork with Figs, Salmon Scampi ... the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The search even has a feature that helps poor spellers: You can
set it so that even if you spell Marsala as ``marsalla'' it'll find
the term. You can also use multiple search words, which is
especially handy with a database this size. You probably wouldn't
want to search, for instance, simply for ``beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ability to search is so important, let's take a look
at another recipe site with search features. This one is called the
Online Cookbook and is located at i99.com/cook/. You can search
this site by keyword, just like in our first example. However,
instead of the 100-plus recipes, a search for ``marsala'' here
turned up just six recipes. The difference seems to be that at this
site, you'll only get recipes with the keyword in the title. You
can also search an alphabetical index. So if you know the name of
the dish starts with a ``B,'' you can browse those recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site, the Culinary Cafe at www.culinarycafe.com/,
doesn't offer a keyword search. Instead, it uses a more
conventional approach. You select the category for the recipe _
cookies, cakes, main dishes, appetizers and so forth. For instance,
if you select the broad term of seafood, you'll go to a page where
you can then select recipes based on the type of seafood. It's a
more cumbersome process if you're searching for a specific recipe
but may be a handy method when you know that you want to prepare a
seafood dish but don't have a specific recipe in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The last stop on our search for the perfect recipe is at a place
called 1st Traveler's Choice Internet Cookbook at
www.virtualcities.com/ons/recipe.htm. The notion here is that the
recipes were gathered from famous restaurants, inns and hotels. The
search method here is the same as the one used at Culinary Cafe.
But there is a nifty feature that most cooks will appreciate. There
is a program on the page that helps you convert various measures.
So you'll be able to quickly find, for instance, that a half cup is
the same as 4 ounces, or 8 tablespoons, or 24 teaspoons, or 118 ml.
If you use a variety of cookbooks, including some from countries
that use liters and milliliters, then this will help you decipher
the measuring system.

Canvas combines graphics applications 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Canvas is the ClarisWorks of graphics programs. It
tries to integrate in one package all the elements of layout,
drawing and design.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tall order but, at least for beginners and intermediate
users, Canvas succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   But neither I nor most other reviewers would recommend this
program for pros and high-end graphics users. Professionals are
better off using Illustrator, Photoshop and Macromedia for the
specialized tasks these programs were created to do.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say Canvas is a bad program. On the contrary, it
has many strong features. Version 6.0, the latest, offers some big
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   No program, for starters, can combine vector and bitmapped
graphics as well as Canvas. It treats all types of graphic images
as objects, which you can mix easily.
</P>
<P>
   Another Canvas innovation is a technology called SpriteLayers.
This lets you layer various graphic objects, whether text, vector
or bitmapped, with full control over transparency.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive transparency feature is one called Channel
Mask. It lets you apply opacity variations using any of Canvas'
many paintbrushes. Just paint an area of a graphic to make it
transparent.
</P>
<P>
   With a graphics program, it's easy to get overwhelmed by
floating palettes. That was certainly true with earlier versions of
Canvas. But Version 6.0 has gone a long way toward cleaning up its
interface.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can customize Canvas' toolbar, adding just the buttons
and keyboard shortcuts of any feature used most often.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet is the docking bar, which appears just below the
toolbar at the top of the screen. You can drag any palette to the
docking bar, where it will appear for use. Just click on the
palette name, and it drops down for use.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements include a spelling checker and vastly
improved performance in terms of speed. Even large images can be
handled quickly now.
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, MacWorld magazine recommended that all current
Canvas users upgrade to Canvas 6.0, the first new version in three
years. ``The new transparency features and bitmap performance
improvements alone are worth the price,'' said the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Canvas, published by Deneba in Miami, retails for $350. An
upgrade is about $100 less. To learn more about the program, check
out the company's Web site at www.deneba.com.

ARRIVAL OF V-CHIP LETS PARENTS TUNE OUT UNWANTED TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By EUN LEE KOH   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The V-chip is here.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, televisions equipped with the device
have started appearing on store shelves. But some consumer groups
and parents foresee problems with the device that is being touted
as a tool for filtering unwanted programming from children's
television viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The V-chip will be in at least half of all new television sets
13 inches or larger on the market by Thursday, as required by the
1996 telecommunications act. By January, the device will be a
regular feature.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 million new television sets are expected to be sold
within the next 18 months, according to Representative Edward J.
Markey, the Malden Democrat who drafted the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few months, tens of thousands of V-chip TVs will be
in homes all across America. Within a year, millions and millions
of Americans will own one,'' said Markey's spokesman, David
Moulton.
</P>
<P>
   Even if new televisions come equipped with a V-chip, millions of
families still own TVs without the device, said Andrew Schwartzman,
president of Media Access Project, a telecommunications law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the V-chip in one TV doesn't prevent kids from watching
a TV in the next room that doesn't have one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Televisions that are not equipped with the device can be
upgraded with the purchase of a V-chip box.
</P>
<P>
   V-chips block out selected programs by reading the ratings based
on viewer age and content that flash on the screen during the first
15 seconds of a program. The technology for the V-chip to read the
electronic ratings works the same way that close-captioned
information is transmitted.
</P>
<P>
   All V-chips require an access code, usually a four-digit number,
to activate or deactivate the device. Based on the television
ratings, parents can choose to block certain programs through the
V-chip by entering the code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as you wouldn't tell anyone your ATM or calling-card PIN
number, you don't tell your kids the V-chip code,'' said Kathryn
Montgomery, president of Center for Media Education, a children's
advocacy group that has compiled a booklet to help parents
understand the V-chip. The pamphlet is available at
www.vchipeducation.org.
</P>
<P>
   However, several parents looking for television sets at one
store this week said they were not particularly interested.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelhadi El Tahir of New York, shopping with his two children,
ages 10 and 14, said although he agreed with the purpose of the
V-chip, he sees problems with the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blocking channels out will make children even more curious,''
El Tahir said. ``These days, children are more technically able,
and they'll find ways to get around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin James of Washington, who has a 4-year-old, said even if her
television was equipped with a V-chip, she would be reluctant to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you block out certain shows, there's always going to
be something that you missed,'' James said. ``You have to be like
God to catch everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Charren, a visiting scholar at the Harvard School of
Education and founder of Action for Children's Television, said she
believes parents will be more likely to use the V-chip after the
school shootings in Littleton, Colo., and the recent debate in
Congress about youth violence and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But Charren said the V-chip and the television ratings system
have their drawbacks. Because the V-chip, when activated,
automatically filters out programs based solely on the ratings,
certain beneficial shows could get censored, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Programs about the Civil Rights Movement or about war will get
flagged for violence,'' Charren said. ``But those programs are the
kind of things that parents might actually want their children to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Charren said the best way for parents to use the V-chip is to
talk to their children about the kinds of programs they want them
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``V-chip or no V-chip, only parents can take care of their
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   V-chip advocates say the device can be an additional tool to
help parents monitor their children's television viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The V-chip is not supposed to be a baby sitter,'' said Ann
Saybolt of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association,
which represents the TV makers. ``It's not a replacement for
parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take only a few years for these new televisions to
become a staple in American homes. According to the latest Census
Bureau statistics, 98 percent of all households have an average of
2.3 television sets each _ a total of about 223 million TVs. The
Center for Media Education estimates that about 25 percent of all
households purchase a new television every year.
</P>
<P>
   V-chip advocates attribute the initial hesitance of parents to
use V-chips on a lack of awareness. Federal Communications
Commissioner Gloria Tristani said many parents don't realize that
the technology is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we educate parents about the V-chip, they can't use it
to make educated choices for their children,'' Tristani said.
</P>
<P>
   In a random survey of 13 major electronics stores in the
Washington area, only one reported having customers ask about the
V-chip, and that was from a few shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Markey sent letters to top national
newspapers urging them to include both the age- and content-based
ratings in their TV listings.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of USA Today and the Boston Herald, most of
the nation's top-selling newspapers, including The Boston Globe,
carry only the age-based ratings, according to Markey. A Globe
spokesman said the editors are looking into the matter with the
syndicate that provides the daily listings to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make the ratings as familiar to the parents as
the Nike `swoosh' is to the kids,'' Markey said.

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. _ It was a bold experiment in cyberspace
finance, and at 11:30 one recent Tuesday morning, it was about to
be tested in the real market.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Schoch, business manager of the Lancaster, Pa., school
district, huddled around a computer screen with Louis J. Verdelli
and other advisers here, waiting to see if anyone would bid over
the Internet for $29.2 million of the district's bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes, then 10, went by without a bid. Schoch grew
apprehensive. Then, just as the noon deadline for the auction was
drawing near, the screen came alive. Offers appeared from as far
away as Utah.
</P>
<P>
   At last Schoch allowed a smile to crease his poker face. The
district's first Internet financing had succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The Lancaster auction was one small part of an accelerating
electronic revolution. The bond market is being dragged out of the
dark ages of fragmentation and opaque pricing, and thrown into a
fiercely competitive and still ill-defined future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a thick veil of secrecy in the bond market,'' said
Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management, a
fixed-income specialist in Los Angeles. ``It's one of the last
dinosaurs to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   By replacing old bonds with new through the electronic auction,
Lancaster will save $1.1 million, plugging an immediate budget hole
and allowing the city, the thrifty heart of Amish country, to avoid
raising taxes next year. Lancaster's advisers say the savings come
from the bigger market created by the Internet, which drew distant
underwriters who had rarely vied for Pennsylvania school bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the impact of that is to lower their interest
rates,'' said Verdelli, senior managing consultant at Public
Financial Management, the adviser who arranged the bidding on a
system run by a Pittsburgh-based creature of the Internet,
MuniAuction.
</P>
<P>
   Click-of-the-mouse bidding on new issues is a striking leap
forward from past practice in the bond industry. Like most issuers,
both municipal and corporate, Lancaster used to negotiate bond
deals with a single underwriter; in many places, bidders must still
show up in person to drop a written bid into the equivalent of a
ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   And the upheaval in the secondary markets, where dealers,
brokers and investors trade bonds after they are issued, is bound
to prove more profound. After all, some $350 billion of bonds and
other debt securities are traded daily, 12 times the volume on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Most stock trades are executed on exchange floors or through
NASDAQ's electronic dealer network, and each trade's volume and
price is immediately displayed to all. Not so with bonds, which
change hands much as they have for most of the century, mainly
through a patchwork of private channels. Bond trading on the New
York Stock Exchange is trivial, confined mainly to small lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever a market that needed liquidity and
transparency, it's fixed income,'' said Douglas M. Atkin, president
of Instinet. His firm, a unit of Reuters, operates the biggest
private stock-trading service for institutions. And later this
year, Instinet plans to start a dealer-to-dealer bond-trading
service, initially for United States Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   While there are big changes under way in the bond business, they
have attracted far less attention than the more advanced revolution
in stocks, where instantaneously available prices have made
possible a frenzy of speculative activity and driven even Merrill
Lynch to announce a plan for cut-rate commissions.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact could be just as far-reaching. Already, spreads _
the difference between the prices at which professionals buy bonds
and the prices at which they sell them _ are beginning to narrow,
eating into bond dealers' profits.
</P>
<P>
   So, naturally, the dealers, are trying to hold off the
electronic tide. And brokers, the middlemen between investors and
dealers, worry about survival in a world where investors have new
power.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in how bonds trade are not always visible to ordinary
investors, most of whom own bonds only through mutual funds. But
ruptures in the system tend to echo loudly.
</P>
<P>
   An example was the virtual paralysis of the market for any bonds
other than Treasuries in the latter part of 1998, when foreign
turmoil touched off a ferocious flight to quality. The Federal
Reserve found itself obliged to engineer a rescue of a big hedge
fund that had bet disastrously on historic relationships among
various types of bonds. Surging interest rates shook stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   But while prices of securities can move at the speed of light,
market structures have been slow to change, and then only under
duress, as when industrywide fixed commissions for stocks were
abolished in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Congress charged the Securities and Exchange
Commission with overseeing the creation of integrated markets for
both stocks and bonds. The bond part of the mandate has largely
been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But now the pace is picking up: Arthur Levitt, the chairman of
the SEC, is pushing bond market openness. And this month, the House
of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill that would direct
the commission to adopt rules for collecting and publishing price,
volume and other transaction data for corporate bonds and enforce
them within a year. (The measure has no Senate counterpart yet.)
</P>
<P>
   Initially, modernizing bond markets will benefit mainly
institutional investors, but consumers stand to gain indirectly
through their stakes in mutual funds, pensions and retirement
accounts. Taxpayers will gain in places like Lancaster that exploit
the new systems.
</P>
<P>
   And within a few years, retail customers are very likely to be
in possession of basic information about bonds like transaction
charges and meaningful market prices. Until now, ignorance has cost
them more than $20 billion a year, by one estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fixed-income investor is the odd-man out in the market,''
said Arthur F. Goat, a retiree in Short Hills, N.J. ``You're flying
blind.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominated by the giant dealers who benefit most from the status
quo, the Bond Market Association, the industry's chief trade group,
has lobbied hard to slow and restrict the modernization process.
The industry has pledged to improve transparency in the corporate
bond markets, but says it is concerned that the costs involved
might outweigh the benefits by impeding trading activity and
harming market liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   But, prodded by regulators and some in Congress to fill the
market's information vacuum, even the trade group sees the writing
on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic trading systems are rapidly becoming essential
tools in the portfolio and trading operations of both sell-side and
buy-side participants in the United States fixed-income securities
markets,'' the association's director of research, Andy Nybo,
acknowledged in his survey of 1998 industry developments.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the market's fragmentation, even professional
investors face serious disadvantages in trading corporate and
municipal bonds. To get a market price, they must conduct an
unwieldy and imprecise shopping expedition among a dozen or more
dealers, or rely on what one dealer tells them _ or, for less
active issues, fall back on what may be little more than a wild
guess.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors, who hold only 5 percent of corporate but
30 percent of muni bonds, have even less clout.
</P>
<P>
   In municipal bonds, for example, the best an individual investor
can do is to view the prior day's prices for the 1,000 or so issues
that may have traded, out of 1.4 million outstanding, on a Web site
run by the bond association (www.bondmarkets.com). Some of those _
there is no telling which _ are dealer-to-dealer prices unavailable
to ordinary investors.
</P>
<P>
   With comparison shopping so difficult, dealers can charge large
markups, especially on lesser-quality bonds, and generally get the
better of any bargain. Quoted prices can be all over the map.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, for example, different dealers were
offering Ford Motor Credit 5} percent notes due in February 2004 at
anywhere from $95.472 (yielding 6.9 percent) to $96.034 (yielding
6.75 percent) per $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price competition is at the heart of the free-market system,''
said Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, who heads a House subcommittee
that held a hearing on bond trading last September. ``And you can't
have true competition if people have a hard time figuring out
exactly what they're paying.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a big reason the industry has dragged its feet: dealers'
fear that the traditionally wide spreads in bond trading will
shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are living off the spreads, their profits are
going to come down,'' said Frank D. Korth, a portfolio manager at
the National City Investment Management Co. in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened, too, are the firms that advise issuers and
underwrite bond issues. ``The intermediaries are scared to death,''
said Myles Harrington, a founder of MuniAuction, the firm that owns
the system used in the Lancaster auction.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the company drew a $6 million investment from the
Carlyle Group, a private Washington investment firm whose
principals include former Treasury Secretary James Baker III and
Frank Carlucci, a former Defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   As with Merrill Lynch's belated decision to embrace online stock
trading, bond dealers are being forced to weigh what they would
lose in narrower spreads against the risk of losing business to
upstarts and the possibility that trading volume would rise if
investors found the market less treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   An early effort to breach the wall was Capitalink, J.P. Morgan's
1989 venture into direct sale of corporate bonds to institutional
investors, bypassing other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional bond market players howled. ``The competitive threat
Capitalink poses to our industry cannot be overemphasized,'' a
Merrill Lynch official, Richard Fuscone, wrote in a memo quoted in
a 1996 paper by Robert J. Kauffman of the University of Minnesota
and Arthur R. Kennedy III of Morgan. After Merrill bought an entire
issue of Deere &AMP; Co. notes at a dog-in-the-manger price to pre-empt
its trading on Capitalink, Morgan gave up.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Larry E. Fondren, an entrepreneur who ran a
sort of computer-dating service for insurance companies _ arranging
joint ventures and advising on mergers and reinsurance _ tried his
hand. He set up Intervest Financial Services, which allowed clients
to trade anonymously with one another and with dealers, and tried
to negotiate a deal to link it to computer terminals of Bloomberg
L.P., then on 60,000 clients' desks.
</P>
<P>
   Fondren struck a deal in 1995, but Bloomberg pulled the plug
after six months, partly relented, and then cut Intervest off for
good in 1998, said Fondren, who has filed a breach-of-contract
suit.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Fondren said Bloomberg told him it had acted at
the insistence of bond dealers, because clients were getting too
much price information.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bloomberg, which is partly owned by Merrill,
said that Intervest was dropped because of low trading activity and
that the allegations were groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill itself has had a change of heart since it helped thwart
Capitalink. ``Ten years ago, we did not believe electronic
distribution was in the best interests of clients or the
industry,'' said Timothy Gilles, a Merrill spokesman. But the
markets and technology have evolved, and Merrill now backs
electronic trading, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the concept is back with a vengeance. The Bond
Market Association says there are now more than two dozen
electronic systems for marketing or trading bonds. At the start of
1998, there were 11. ``It's a brave new world out there,'' said
Edwin McGuinn, president of Limitrader Securities, one dealer that
has hung out a cybershingle.
</P>
<P>
   Entrants in the electronic race include individual
entrepreneurs, banks, securities dealers, bond brokers and
information purveyors like Bloomberg and Reuters. Most focus on
attracting institutional buyers of bonds, whose high volume they
hope will make their systems viable.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a consortium of seven giant financial-services
companies announced a new trading system for dealers called
Brokertec.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the electronic systems are bulletin boards for
dealers to post offerings; final prices are set when trades are
consummated by phone. In a few cases, buyers and sellers see prices
on the screen at which they can count on executing a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Other systems bring dealers and institutions together for
real-time trading or periodic order-matching sessions, with
traders' anonymity a big selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the new-issue auction systems like MuniAuction,
which make possible innovations like permitting bidding on selected
maturities out of a series that formerly had to be bought in its
entirety
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, bidders see where their offers rank (though not their
rivals' specific bids) and are free to raise their bids repeatedly,
as some did in the Lancaster auction. In traditional auctions,
bidders get just one shot.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster's electronic auction of new bonds is one of about 200
such municipal borrowings since MuniAuction's first deal in late
1997. As for corporations, many now routinely market commercial
paper _ short-term i.o.u.'s _directly to investors, bypassing
broker-dealers, and there are systems being developed for selling
longer-term corporate debt this way.
</P>
<P>
   The government's Treasury Direct program allows investors with
as little as $1,000 to bid for new bills, notes and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But while the old methods are crumbling, the process is likely
to take several years _ and it may never make bonds as transparent
as stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Micah S. Green, executive vice president of the Bond Market
Association, told a House panel in March that he supported the
goals of the proposed legislation and said his group would soon add
to its Web site the previous day's dealer-to-dealer prices for 100
or so of the most active investment-grade corporate bonds. (The new
data are due to make their debut this week.)
</P>
<P>
   But he sought to persuade lawmakers that there were key
differences in bond and stock markets. For instance, he said, most
bonds do not trade actively: only 4 percent of about 400,000
corporate issues outstanding in 1996 traded even once that year. He
also contended that too much transparency could increase volatility
in thin markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revealing prices and trading volumes instantaneously could
hurt market liquidity,'' Green said, by, say, making it obvious
when someone was trying to unwind a large position piecemeal. He
asked Congress to choose evolutionary change, led by the private
sector, over government-mandated change.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever path is chosen, it is clear that the bond business is
galloping toward an automated electronic future with fewer
intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, ``if you wanted to sell a block of $10 million
in municipal bonds, you'd call up 20 brokers and ask them to give
you a bid,'' said Peter J. Allegrini, managing director of
Prudential Investments, who runs a portfolio of high-yield
municipals. ``Today, you plug your bonds into the Bloomberg and
press a couple of buttons, and the whole process is down to 15
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, perhaps one-third of trades in Treasury debt
will take place electronically, said F. James Claire, director of
taxable fixed-income trading for a unit of First Union Bank in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But if Claire's attitudes reflect those of many bond traders,
electronic trading will develop more slowly in markets for
corporate and tax-exempt bonds, where trading is thinner.
</P>
<P>
   There simply is no substitute in a decentralized market, he
said, for communicating by voice with the other players. ``You want
to be able to talk to a guy and hear noise in the background; you
need that color to hear what's going on,'' Claire said. ``You're
not going to get any color looking at the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, screen updates sometimes lag when trading
action heats up, and electronic screens do not leave behind as
solid a transaction record as do telephone calls, which are
routinely recorded.
</P>
<P>
   So much of Levitt's lament about the least-liquid sectors of the
bond market seems likely to linger. ``The sad truth,'' the SEC
chairman said, ``is that investors in the corporate bond market do
not enjoy the same access to information as a car buyer or a home
buyer or, dare I say, a fruit buyer. And that's unacceptable.''

PERSONAL COMPUTER AS PERSONAL JUKEBOX? NOT YET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Although members of the music and
electronics industries described standards announced on Monday as a
watershed for distributing music over the Internet, numerous
obstacles could very well prevent the personal computer from
becoming the jukebox and record store of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Still outstanding are meaty questions about what technology will
be used to deliver and protect copyrights of music sold online. And
while the consortium that is creating the standards, the Secure
Digital Music Initiative, represents the music, consumer
electronics and computer industries, it is not at all certain that
the makers of portable music players will comply with standards
that are being dictated largely by the interests of record labels.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is likely to leave consumers bewildered in the
coming months, even as electronics companies ramp up production of
the new players _ solid-state equivalents of today's portable
cassette and CD players _ in the hopes of making the coming holiday
season the first digital-music Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that with the preliminary release of new
standards for distributing music electronically, music companies
are ramping up for online sales of their recordings, as evidenced
by two disclosures on Tuesday from Bertelsmann, the parent company
of BMG Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   A Bertelsmann subsidiary, BMG Storage Media, based in
Guetersloh, Germany, which records audio CDs and video DVDs,
announced Tuesday a partnership with Intertrust and Reciprocal, two
U.S. companies that make technology for distributing music in
digital form while preserving its copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from BMG Storage Media said that starting next
quarter, the partners would test technology to print new CDs that
are compliant with the SDMI standard, which means the music cannot
be played on portable devices if the device's owner has not paid
for the music.
</P>
<P>
   This is not simple to accomplish. First, future CDs have to be
playable on existing CD players, which tend to be highly sensitive
to the way data are organized on a CD. Second, because the Home
Recording Act of 1992 allows anyone who purchases a CD to make a
copy for personal use, the protection technology will have to
distinguish between a recording device owned by the purchaser of
the CD and a device owned by someone else. As Intel and Microsoft
Corps. discovered this year, machines that attempt to identify
themselves or their owners on a network provoke angry outcries from
privacy advocates.
</P>
<P>
   On a different front, BMG, among the biggest of the record
companies, announced Tuesday that it would begin selling music over
the Internet in the fall. But, as is the case with other major
record labels planning online sales, BMG has yet to decide which
artists it will sell online, whether it will sell just singles or
entire albums, what prices it will charge and what technology it
will use to prevent illegal copying.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all good questions,'' said J. Scott Dinsdale, a
spokesman for BMG. ``We're going through that process right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, it remains to be seen how soon consumers will buy into
the online music revolution, given that it takes 10 minutes to
download a single song (more than 3 hours for a typical album)
using a standard dial-up modem, and the downloading process is
often fraught with technical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary SDMI standards _ set to be finalized within the
next month _ are meant to dictate the technical specifications for
portable digital players, hand-held devices that record and play
music on silicon circuitry called flash memory. The new players are
the center of a shift in musical products that many recording
industry veterans see as revolutionary because they enable people
to download music from the Net, organize it, easily erase it and
listen to it portably in CD-quality form.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the players are generating deep-seated fears
within the music industry of widespread piracy because the music
they record and play can be taken from commercial CDs or the
Internet and copied illegally. Under the standards announced on
Monday, these players eventually _ SDMI estimates about 18 months _
should not be allowed to play illegally copied music.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically what will happen is that the portable players will
read a piece of software code embedded in the digital version of
each song that tells the player whether making a copy is
permissible. Record labels have said they will start to encode each
song sold over the Internet with copyright protection information.
Within 18 months, the companies also intend to start encoding each
CD sold in a store with similar technology, known generically as a
digital watermark.
</P>
<P>
   But this technology is not yet perfected; numerous companies
have submitted proposals to the SDMI, but none has yet been chosen,
and it is unclear whether any single solution will accomplish the
task.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics assert that consumers who have already amassed a
sizeable library of digital music cannot yet be sure that in the
future digital players will be capable of playing recordings that
are not SDMI compliant. Howard Tullman, chief executive of
Tunes.com, a Chicago-based Web site that publishes thousands of
songs from unsigned artists and independent record labels, says he
worries that SDMI standards will lead to players that will play
only music that meets big record labels' stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have invested hours and hours or days taking their own
music collection and making it portable,'' he said. ``You can't
tell the person no, that's no good.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tara Lemmey, president of Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an online civil liberties group, said the organization
was exploring whether the SDMI standards might represent a
violation of antitrust laws or ``fair use'' policies that permit
the use of music and other media for education or aesthetic
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of SDMI said portable devices would be permitted
to play existing digital recordings _ most notably the thousands of
MP3 files now on the Net. They have said that even when portable
devices are in full compliance _when the final rules come into play
_ the devices will play all music unless the music itself contains
the protection software permitting it to be played only by a
copyright holder.
</P>
<P>
   That said, even SDMI officials _ and some of the 150 or so
technology, music and electronics companies in the consortium _ say
many of the questions cannot be answered until the final
specifications are approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The specifications are evolving to some degree,'' said Kurt
Ohlfs, business development manager for Diamond Multimedia, the
maker of the portable player called the Diamond Rio. But, he added,
with SDMI, ``you'll start to see more top-end content'' for sale
online by record companies.

POLITICAL POLLING FACES PITFALLS IN CYBERSPACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``OK Internet Brigade, let's get out there and
stand strong for Pat!'' That's the rallying cry on Pat Buchanan's
Web site, which urges his supporters to ``hit the on-line polls and
register your vote for PJB.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't view it as skewing the numbers, just getting out the
vote,'' said Bob Adams, a spokesman for the Republican presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But could such partisan efforts skewer bold plans to make the
Internet a major source of political polls for the 2000 elections?
</P>
<P>
   Already, one leading market research firm has announced plans to
measure next year's political races on the Internet, including
battles for the White House, Congress and governorships. Such
plans, however, are deeply troubling to other survey professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political polling on the Internet has absolutely no
validity,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the widely respected Pew
Research Center. ``It's a giant leap backwards because it allows
the squeaky wheels to have a greater say. Responsible people
shouldn't be doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pew recently compared its polling data with the results of
survey responses to the same questions posed on America Online.
More than half the people in the online survey disapproved of the
job President Clinton was doing. But two-thirds of those surveyed
by Pew on the phone approved.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping polls accurate as the industry moves into the Internet
age is even more of a challenge than the one posed by the last
technological leap, from door-to-door polling to telephones, which
occurred a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   In telephone polls, numbers are dialed at random. The results
are then weighted to accurately represent the national voting
population or a regional grouping. By contrast, Web pollsters must
deal with a self-selected group of volunteer respondents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it's clear that cyberspace dwellers are different
from the nation as a whole. One indicator is that, according to a
Georgia Tech survey released last month, the average annual income
of Web users is $57,300 _ more than $20,000 higher than the median
income of U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   Such criticism has not deterred Gordon Black, the chief
executive officer and founder of Harris Interactive. That's the new
name the venerable Harris market research firm adopted Tuesday,
when it announced a major reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, as a graduate student at Stanford, Black
recalls being barred by his teachers from using telephone surveys
because they were deemed unreliable. Now, he suggests, the same
prejudices plague the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply stated,'' Black said, ``the Internet is faster, cheaper
and more versatile than traditional mail, door-to-door and
telephony research methods. In fact, half of Harris Interactive's
watershed research during the past year are studies that could not
have been accomplished without the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, using an Internet database of just 1 million, the
Harris Poll Online accurately predicted 21 of 22 U.S. elections for
governor and senator in 16 states. By contrast, on average,
telephone polling units missed five of the 22 contests.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 2000, Harris plans to expand its database of
Internet users from the current 3.5 million people to as many as 10
million. With the expanded database, Harris says it will be able to
accurately discern trends among ever smaller segments of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly an empirical thing,'' said Jon Siegel, who
directs Harris' political efforts. ``It either works or it doesn't
work. We're going to be as honest about our methods and our results
as a newborn baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' Siegel added, ``it's a technology that's ready to
roll. If the Wright Brothers had waited, somebody else would have
flown first. Is what we've got a 747? No it's not. But I can assure
you that it will fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the American Association for Public Opinion
Research are not persuaded that Internet political polling is ready
for prime time. The group, meeting last week in Orlando, weighed
whether it should adopt a new survey rating system that would
require interviewers to tell the public and the media what
standards are being used to elicit results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't overstate the concern that people who practice
polling have about this,'' said Nancy Belden, a Washington-based
pollster who organized the Orlando discussion. ``It is more urgent
because of the proliferation of Internet polling.''

 Internet Mortgage, Credit Card Firms Trying to Cash In on Online
Success  
 By Sam Zuckerman   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, you joined the crowds online to trade stock. But are you
ready to take out a credit card or get a mortgage on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Karen Murphy and John Lee were. The Mountain View couple got a
loan from iOwn.com, a 3-year-old Web-based mortgage broker, to buy
a $310,000 house in North Berkeley, a purchase that closed last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Their verdict? They say Web surfing got them a super rate: a
7.25 percent fixed-rate loan for $248,000 that converts to an
adjustable loan after five years, with 1 percent of the loan amount
rebated at the close of escrow.
</P>
<P>
   But the lender they found through iOwn, First Nationwide
Mortgage, peppered them with last-minute questions and demands,
causing them to miss the financing deadline in their purchase
contract. Fortunately, the seller agreed to give them more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty nerve-racking,'' said Lee, a 31-year-old
Microsoft marketing director, about his mortgage. ``I feel
confident I got the best possible rate, and iOwn has a great
dedication to customer service. But they're still working out the
kinks.''
</P>
<P>
   That about sums up the current state of online borrowing.
Internet-only companies such as iOwn and credit card purveyor
NextCard say the Web offers great prices, broad selection and
unbeatable convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can literally customize the terms for you,'' said NextCard
chief executive Jeremy Lent.
</P>
<P>
   And online mortgage companies offer rate-comparison software
that lets borrowers find the best loans available on the market
with the features they want.
</P>
<P>
   But electronic-commerce experts say the Web falls flat handling
complicated transactions in which human beings, not computers, make
the final decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A mortgage is an example of a loan that has to be individually
underwritten for each customer. Those are tougher to complete
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit products go from simple to very complex,'' said Jay
Norman, a Chicago electronic-commerce specialist with the
consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``It's the less-complex
loans that best fit the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit card applications are simple because a few pieces of data
about employment, residence and income are all that's needed to
make a decision. NextCard says it grants approv

Home Depot improves website for advice-seekers 
By Patti Bond  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Do-it-yourselfers will find a heap of help on Home
Depot's remodeled Web site today.
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement giant was expected to launch a new version
of www.homedepot.com this morning. There aren't products for sale
yet, but the ramped-up site lays the groundwork for online sales
that will start in the fall, said Jeff Cohen, group president of
direct marketing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We`re taking the continuous improvement path with our Internet
strategy,'' Cohen said. ``The new site is a major step.'' Cohen
said the site will be updated every three to four weeks with new
features.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference is that the Web site, previously filled
with corporate and shareholder information, has been reworked to
target consumers looking for home improvement advice. The number of
how-to projects was doubled to 120, and each project includes
do-it-yourself steps that are animated with simple graphics that
can be downloaded quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The how-to pages, which include printable lists of supplies and
tools needed to tackle the project, will be a likely starting point
for Home Depot's first attempt at online sales, Cohen said. For
example, a consumer looking for tips on how to change a lock or
install a ceiling fan could have the option of buying a kit to do
so, he said. It's the first hint from Home Depot on what it might
sell online as the company works out pricing and shopping issues.
In the meantime, the supply lists should at least send consumers
running to their nearest Home Depot store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Projects are certainly the centerpiece of our Internet
strategy,'' said Cohen, who noted that the company opted not to
create a separate subsidiary for the electronic commerce venture.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance Warehouse, Home Depot's mail-order subsidiary in San
Diego, will process orders, phone calls and e-mail requests
generated by the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The new site contains twice the amount of information of the old
site, including new features such as paint and wallpaper
calculators that estimate the amount of materials needed based on
room dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the company's electronic commerce launch this
fall, though, may be one of the more significant aspects of its
strategy. Several competitors have already ventured into online
sales.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. recently started selling major
appliances and tools on www.sears.com. And Lowe's Home Improvement
Warehouse sells some tools and other branded products through
manufacturer's sites. Lowe's expects to start selling products on
www.lowes.com in late summer, said spokesman Brian Peace.

serious problems and may need a $3 million fix; kind of steep for a
bridge that cost less than $4 million when it opened in 1994; seems
the bridge, which sits on rockers to allow for expansion and
contraction, is being pushed by slippage in its abutments;
engineers fear the bridge won't be able to handle normal stresses
if it slips much more. Robert A. Cronkleton. Graphic, Photos.

   DRIVE. Whenever a car leaves the driveway at the Trigg house in
rural Gardner, Kan., chances are that 15-year-old Whitney Trigg
will be behind the wheel, with either her mom or dad riding
shotgun. If Whitney wants to drive by herself when she turns 16,
that's the way it has to be. Effective today, Kansas law requires
that 16- and 17-year-olds must have at least 50 hours of
adult-supervised driving experience to qualify for an unrestricted
license. Tom Perrin. 20. Photos.

 &HT;    For summer fun, invite the kids into the kitchen
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many busy parents have spent months planning activities to keep
children supervised and amused during the summer. Camps, water
parks, amusement parks, sports, countless day trips and logistical
concerns have been planned down to the micro-minute when the school
bell will ring again.
</P>
<P>
   With all that planning, it's possible that parents are
overlooking one of the most interesting activities of all _ and
it's right under our noses, and free. It's the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   So often the primary cook for a busy family just wants to get
the meal onto the table and tends to shoo pesky youngsters out of
the kitchen during the business of preparing a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Summer, when there is no homework and more leisure time,
presents an excellent opportunity to invite the kids into the
kitchen to share the wonders of preparing food, as well as some
first-class quality time.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, an Internet search for ``kids in the
kitchen,'' ``cooking with kids'' and ``kids' recipes'' yielded all
kinds of sites. Some were superficial, with an emphasis on ``fun''
and silly recipes for things like ``Monster Glop.'' With this
approach, a child could get the idea that the kitchen is just an
annex of Toys ``R'' Us instead of the place where one of the most
vital of human activities takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Imparting an appreciation of the kitchen and cookery should
start with letting children help in preparing real food for real
people. There'll be plenty of time for fun.
</P>
<P>
   Why not select a dish most children naturally love and then do a
little homework yourself?
</P>
<P>
   Take pizza, for instance. While they're helping shred the
cheese, you can tell them that genuine mozzarella cheese is made
from the milk of the water buffalo. This and other spellbinding
pizza tidbits can be found at www.ghgcorp.com
</P>
<P>
   /coyej/links.htm.
</P>
<P>
   While the kids are spreading the sauce, you can relate the tale
told at chefexpress.com/history.htm of how pizza got its colors. It
seems that Neapolitan pizza was just plain, flat peasant bread
until it caught the eye of Queen Margherita, who summoned baker
Raffaele Esposito to make some especially for her. To honor the
queen, he garnished the dough with the colors of the Italian flag _
red (the tomato sauce), white (the cheese) and green (basil) _
resulting in something like the pizza we know today.
</P>

artichokes to spinach, call up godzilla.eecs.berkeley

 &HT;    In summer, nothing's more pleasing than the classic combination
of sweet, crunchy baked goods and frozen delights
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mammaw had a charge account at Ragsdale's Grocery, the kind of
small-town corner store that sold everything from Sweetarts to
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for me and a clattering bunch of kids who lived on that
end of Kuttawa, that was where the school bus stopped. On many
sunny Kentucky afternoons, I'd rush into Ragsdale's, head straight
to the freezer chest, snatch up an ice cream sandwich and shout,
``Charge it to Mammaw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ragsdales were masters at keeping all the Mammaws and Mommas
straight, as evidenced by the stack of charge slips my grandmother
would sometimes present to me and my brothers with slightly stern
admonishments about spending.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to resist such a sweet reward after a tough day
at school. There's hardly a more classic, comforting combination
than cookies and cream, whether you dunk some warm chocolate chip
cookies into a tall glass of milk or munch on an ice cold sandwich
of soft chocolate wafers and smooth vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many people are probably more used to getting their
cookies and cream in one fell scoop _ many ice cream brands report
that the ``cookies and cream flavor'' is among their top five
sellers. But as we head into the high ice cream season (July is
National Ice Cream Month), we can't resist trying some new
combinations and reviving some old favorites.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a special treat for the holiday weekend, get the ice
cream maker cranking now on some white chocolate ice cream, and
then sandwich it between orange-flavored chocolate cookies and
freeze for a day or so. Dreamy.
</P>
<P>
   Or try old-fashioned ginger-molasses cookies with vanilla ice
cream (for an extra punch, spike the ice cream with ginger, too).
Break out the star-shaped cookie cutters for an Independence Day
flair.
</P>
<P>
   If you're expecting a crowd and want to get a head start, you
can do no better than the classic icebox cake, which marries thin
chocolate wafers with whipped cream. After a couple of days of
mingling in the refrigerator, you get a cake so heavenly that folks
will claim angels delivered it from above.
</P>
<P>
   With just a few assembly skills and a little imagination, you
can create your own combinations with your choices from the cookie
aisle and the ice cream freezer. There are so many great ice cream
flavors, from rich caramel dulce de leche to the funky Chunky
Monkey, that there's no end to the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   And they're so easy to assemble that you can have cookies and
cream ready and waiting in your freezer throughout the hot months
ahead. After all, the two go together like summer and fun.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK TREATS
</P>
<P>
   With all the choices available in grocery stores these days, the
list of possibilities for quick-fix cookies-and-cream concoctions
is as long as the grocery aisle. Just crumble your favorite cookies
and mix them into a complementary softened ice cream, then refreeze
until you're ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can make a cookies-and-cream milkshake: Pour a cup of
milk, two to four scoops of ice cream and two to four broken
cookies into a blender and give it a whirl.
</P>
<P>
   Or make your own ice cream sandwiches. We cruised the cookie and
ice cream selections at a couple of Atlanta-area grocery stores and
came up with these combinations just to get you started:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Archway Oatmeal Cookies with dulce de leche or pralines and
cream ice cream. These large, flat, soft cookies are the perfect
discs for sandwich making. Dulce de leche is the cool, new,
ultracreamy caramel flavor of the summer _ Haagen-Dazs, Breyer's
and Starbucks all have versions of it. Many praline-flavored ice
creams have crunchy, sugar-coated nuts, which will add extra
texture.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pepperidge Farm Chocolate White Chocolate Chunk Cookies with a
Godiva dark chocolate ice cream. The Pepperidge Farm chocolate
chunk cookies are nicely shaped and freeze well. Godiva has a new
line of chocolate ice creams that are as rich as you'd expect.
Together, these make a pretty high-class pair.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keebler's Fudge Stripe Cookies with Ben &AMP; Jerry's Chunky
Monkey ice cream. The fudge stripe cookies have an ideal thickness;
the only trick is to put the striped side on the inside of the
sandwich. The ice cream slips off the side that's all fudge. The
banana flavor in the Chunky Monkey, or other banana-flavored ice
creams, makes banana splits finger food.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gingersnaps with lemon sorbet or black cherry frozen yogurt.
Choose any brand of thick, old-fashioned gingersnaps and pair them
with a lemon sorbet or Mayfield's black cherry frozen yogurt for a
quick, refreshing and low-fat treat. This will quickly become a
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pillsbury's slice-and-bake Peanut Butter Cookies and milk
chocolate or fudge swirl ice cream. We especially like this combo
with Breyer's chocolate ice cream with fudge swirls.
</P>

   I don't know if there are enough rapturous words to describe
this pie, at least as far as this chocolate and coffee ice cream
lover is concerned. It's simple, should be made ahead, and is best
served with a light meal, because it's heavy. And heavenly.

   Chef Marcel Desauliners was inspired by the Good Humor
Creamsicle when he created these dream creams. Don't be daunted by
the lengthy directions; he's very detailed, but the methods are
easy and the effort well worth it for the white chocolate ice cream
alone. You may choose to use the orange syrup to taste. This recipe
makes mini-sandwiches _ if you want to make larger ones, divide
dough into three sections rather than six.
</P>
<P>
   For the ice cream:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup julienned orange zest
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces white chocolate, chopped in 1/4-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups whole milk, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   4 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   For the cookies:
</P>
<P>
   3 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut in 1-ounce pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced orange zest
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon orange liqueur
</P>
<P>
   For the ice cream: Heat the orange juice, 1/2 cup granulated
sugar and orange zest in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat.
When hot, stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring to a boil. Allow to
boil for 20 minutes until syrupy. Transfer to a 4-quart bowl and
cool in an ice-water bath to a temperature of 40 to 45 degrees,
about 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over
medium heat. With the heat on, place the white chocolate and 1 cup
of the milk in the top half of the double boiler. Use a rubber
spatula to stir until completely melted and smooth, about 7 to 8
minutes. Transfer the mixture to a 1-quart bowl and set aside until
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining milk, heavy cream and 1/4 cup granulated
sugar in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir to dissolve
the sugar. Bring to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   While the cream mixture is heating, place the egg yolks and the
remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer
fitted with a paddle. Beat on high 2 minutes. Use a rubber spatula
to scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat on high until
slightly thickened and lemon-colored, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Timing is
important. If at this point the cream has not yet started to boil,
adjust the mixer speed to low and continue to mix until it does
boil. If the eggs are not mixed until the point when the boiling
cream is added, undesirable lumps may form.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the boiling cream into the beaten egg yolks and whisk to
combine. Return to the saucepan and heat over medium-high heat,
stirring constantly. Bring to a temperature of 185 degrees, about 1
minute. Remove from the heat and transfer to a 4-quart bowl. Add
the melted white chocolate mixture and stir to combine. Cool in an
ice-water bath to a temperature of 40 to 45 degrees, about 20
minutes. When the mixture is cold, freeze in an ice cream freezer
according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer the semifrozen
ice cream to a 2-quart plastic container. Use a rubber spatula to
fold in the chilled orange mixture until thoroughly combined.
Securely cover the container, then place in the freezer for several
hours before assembling the ice cream sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   For the cookies: In a sifter combine the flour, cocoa powder,
salt and baking soda. Sift onto a large piece of wax paper and set
aside until needed.
</P>
<P>
   Place the butter, 1/2 cup granulated sugar and the brown sugar
in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on
medium for 4 minutes until fairly smooth. Use a rubber spatula to
scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat on high 2 minutes until
smooth. Scrape down the bowl again. Add the eggs, one at a time,
while beating on medium for 1 minute and scraping down the sides of
the bowl after each addition. Add the minced orange zest and orange
liqueur and beat on high 1 minute. Operate the mixer on low while
gradually adding the sifted dry ingredients until incorporated,
about 1 minute. Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber
spatula to finish mixing the dough until thoroughly combined.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the dough to a clean, dry, lightly floured work
surface. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions, and shape each
into a log approximately 10 inches long, 1 1/2 inches wide and 3/4
inch high. Tightly wrap each log in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the
logs for 4 hours until dough is very firm.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the dough from the refrigerator and discard the plastic
wrap. Use a sharp serrated knife to cut each log into 16 slices
1/4-inch thick. Arrange the slices on 4 nonstick baking sheets.
Bake the cookies on the top and center racks of the preheated oven
for 6 minutes until slightly dry in appearance, rotating the sheets
from top to center halfway through baking time (at that time also
turn each sheet 180 degrees). Remove the cookies from the oven and
cool to room temperature on the baking sheets, about 20 minutes.
The cookies may be stored in a tightly sealed plastic container
until you are ready to assemble the ice cream sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Place half the cookies on wax paper (makes cleaning
up a snap). Using a tablespoon, portion white chocolate orange ice
cream onto each of the cookies and then top with a second cookie.
Gently press, then smooth edges with spatula. Wrap 3 to 4 at a time
in plastic wrap. Then place all wrapped cookies in an airtight
container and freeze overnight. _ From: ``Death by Chocolate
Cookies,'' Marcel Desauliners (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $30)

   The Nabisco Famous Wafer Roll was so famous for so many years
that you won't find the thin chocolate wafers in the cookie aisle
but on the shelf near the ice cream and frozen foods where the ice
cream toppings are found. To be safe, buy two boxes of cookies,
because some break. This variation adds coffee and hazelnuts. It's
best sliced after 2 days in the refrigerator. Divine.

<P>
   1 3/4 cups heavy cream

   1 tablespoon instant espresso powder

<P>
   1/4 cup finely chopped, toasted hazelnuts for garnish
</P>

   1/4 cup crushed chocolate wafer cookie crumbs for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Lightly grease a 6-cup loaf pan. Line the pan with two pieces of
overlapping plastic wrap, allowing the excess to hang over the
edges of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, combine the cream, espresso powder and sugar. Whisk
until the cream holds firm peaks. Spoon about 2/3 of the whipped
cream into the prepared pan. Tap the pan firmly on the counter to
even the cream and eliminate any air bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at a short side (width) of the pan, arrange cookies in
the cream, standing them on their edge in a row like dominoes.
Stand them close together, leaving about 1/4 inch space in between
them. Do the same with a second row of cookies, slightly
overlapping the cookies from the second row with the cookies in the
first row. Continue until you run out of room.
</P>
<P>
   Press down on the cookies gently. Cover them with the remaining
cream. Smooth the cream with a spatula, gently pressing to make
sure any gaps between the cookies are filled. Tap the pan on the
counter several times to eliminate any air pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the cake with the excess plastic wrap and refrigerate at
least 24 hours, preferably 2 days. When ready to serve, peel the
plastic wrap from the top and gently tug on the plastic to loosen
the cake from sides of the pan. Set a cutting board on top of the
pan and invert the cake onto the board. Lift the pan off and gently
peel away the plastic wrap. Mix the hazelnuts with the cookie
crumbs and sprinkle over the top of the cake. Slice carefully with
a warm knife. _ From: Fine Cooking, June/July 1999

 &HT;    Ice cream sandwiches a little bite of heaven
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers or Humphrey Bogart and
Lauren Bacall.
</P>
<P>
   Some partners were made for each other, like cookies and cream.
Combinations like chocolate cookies and coffee-flavored whipped
cream or white chocolate ice cream and orange-flavored chocolate
wafers.
</P>
<P>
   We offer all sorts of possibilities for combining cookies and
cream below, including pie, cake and ice cream sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream sandwiches, in particular, can be a nice treat on a
hot summer day. They can be a little tricky to assemble, so our
best advice is to experiment until you get what you want.
</P>
<P>
   One idea is to simply spread slightly softened ice cream onto
cookies and sandwich. Gently press, smooth edges with a spatula,
wrap individually in plastic wrap and then freeze in an airtight
container.
</P>
<P>
   Some other ideas: Use a spatula to sculpt scoops of ice cream
into flat rounds approximately the same diameter of the cookies,
then freeze them into discs before sandwiching them between
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Or use a pastry bag to pipe softened ice cream onto flat sides
of cookies. Then wrap and freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Give it a try with some of these recipes below or with your
favorite store-bought cookies and ice cream.

<P>
   The next time the kids scream for ice cream, break out these
mint-and-chocolate-flavored ice cream sandwiches, named for a
famous cocktail. But these are even better.
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon each baking soda and salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups quick-cooking rolled oats
</P>
<P>
   1 quart (approximately) mint chocolate chip or mint chocolate
ripple ice cream
</P>
<P>
   1 square (1 ounce) semisweet baking chocolate
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   For cookies: In a medium bowl, sift together flour, cocoa,
baking soda and salt; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In mixer bowl, combine butter and sugar; beat until fluffy. Beat
in egg yolk. Add vanilla and mix to blend.
</P>
<P>
   Add flour mixture alternately with the water, blending until
smooth after each addition. Stir in rolled oats. Cover dough with
plastic film and refrigerate until firm (about 1 hour).
</P>
<P>
   With an ice cream scoop, place 15 mounds of ice cream onto
baking sheet. Flatten each with spatula to a 3-inch round. Freeze
ice cream until solid, 1 to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. On a lightly floured board or
pastry cloth, roll out dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Cut
out cookies with a 2 1/2-inch-diameter cutter. Transfer to
ungreased baking sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until cookies are barely firm when touched lightly, 8 to 10
minutes. Let stand on baking sheets for 1 to 2 minutes, then remove
to wire racks to cool.
</P>
<P>
   While cookies are cooling, melt semisweet chocolate with oil in
a small, heavy pan over low heat. Over half the cookies, drizzle
melted chocolate from the tip of a teaspoon or from a cone made
from aluminum foil or parchment paper. Set cookies aside until
chocolate is firm.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble sandwiches, place plain cookies, flat sides up, in
rows on a shallow-rimmed baking sheet. Place an ice cream round
atop each. Top each with a chocolate-drizzled cookie and press
together gently. Return to freezer until solidly frozen, 1 to 2
hours. Individually wrap sandwiches in foil; freeze for up to 2
months. _ From: Primary Color

<P>
   A takeoff on the classic chocolate wafer/vanilla ice cream
sandwich, these have been fancied up with chocolate and coffee
sauces for a special plated dessert.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons strong brewed coffee, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 pints good-quality coffee ice cream
</P>
<P>
   For the chocolate sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa, sifted
</P>
<P>
   For the coffee sauce:
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup brewed espresso
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Butter a 10-by-15-inch rimmed
baking sheet and line with parchment paper. Butter the paper and
refrigerate until the butter is firm, about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, melt the butter and chocolate over low
heat, stirring occasionally. Let cool.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, beat the sugar and egg until blended. Beat in
the coffee, vanilla and melted chocolate. Sift together the flour,
cocoa, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Stir the dry ingredients
into the chocolate mixture until combined. Spread the batter out to
the edges of the baking sheet in an even layer; smooth the top.
Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the center is just set but not
dry. Let the chocolate wafer cool in the pan for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Run a knife around the edge of the wafer. Cover the pan with a
cutting board and invert; peel off the paper. Let the wafer cool
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the chocolate wafer in half to form two 7 1/2-by-10-inch
rectangles. Spread the ice cream evenly on one of the rectangles
and cover with the other. Poke a few holes in the top with a fork
or a toothpick for decoration. Wrap the ice cream sandwich in
plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours. The ice cream
sandwich can be frozen for up to 2 days.
</P>
<P>
   For the chocolate sauce: In a small saucepan, melt the butter in
the cream and milk over moderate heat. Stir in the sugar and boil,
stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.
Remove from the heat and whisk in the cocoa until smooth. The sauce
can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Rewarm before serving.
</P>
<P>
   For the coffee sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the coffee
and sugar over low heat. Stir occasionally until sugar dissolves.
Increase heat to medium-high and boil for 5 to 8 minutes, until the
syrup is slightly thickened and coats the back of a spoon. Remove
from the heat; the sauce will continue to thicken as it cools.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, cut the ice cream sandwich into 8 triangles. Drizzle
the coffee sauce in a spiral on 8 dessert plates. Set an ice cream
sandwich in the center of each and spoon the warm chocolate sauce
on top. _ From: Food &AMP; Wine, September 1996.

JONES HAS AMERICAN TIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ The athleticism came from her father. Somehow
his talents as a baseball player translated into a strong soccer
star. At 5 feet 11 inches, Steffi Jones's powerful inherited build
is visible from a distance. Her thighs are exceptionally thick and
muscled. Her upper body long and lean.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by her physique alone, it seems clear Jones was born to
play soccer and destined to captain the women's national team in
one of the world's most soccer-crazed countries. She stands tall as
a model for the disciplined German side. She leads from her
position as central defender and organizes a squad lauded for its
orderliness and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in San Antonio, Ray Jones is one proud American
father.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Jones is the daughter of a black US serviceman
and blonde-haired, blue-eyed German. The national team
affectionately nicknamed Jones ``Schoko,'' a shortened version of
the German word for chocolate. Yet, her athletic build, dark skin
and close-cropped black curls that leave people disbelieving she is
related to her mother, Lilo Fields, remain the only traces of a
part-American past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all the way German,'' said Jones. ``My father is a US
citizen, but I'm still German because I grew up in Germany. I'm
proud to play for the German national team. I never got the chance
to play for the US so there's no way to be said what it would be
like if I'd play for them. I made it to the national team (in
Germany). It would have been fine if it had been the US team, but
it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   As if she needed to prove her German loyalties, Jones will carry
on a fluent conversation in slightly-accented English and then
abruptly stop and throw in a German word she does not know how to
translate. But the one-word reminders are not necessary. The fact
that German fans recognize the soccer star on the streets of
Frankfurt and her veteran position on the national team show that
she fits perfectly with the sports culture of her homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 Women's World Cup, Jones has anchored the defense in
ties against Italy and Brazil and a shutout victory over Mexico.
She showed her willingness to play physical soccer in the Germans'
tournament opener against Italy, commiting three fouls. Then
playing Brazil, the defender displayed her offensive touch,
notching her first goal of the tournament on her first shot and
only shot.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarterfinals against the Americans Thursday, Jones will
be charged with disrupting the American attack. She does not shy
away from the challenge, believing her team has players that can
match the US talent. However, the Germans must overcome
inconsistent play that saw them finish second in Group B behind
Brazil and put a 2000 Olympic berth in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of the outcome, the World Cup has brought Jones
closer to her father and not just in terms of geography. The
national television exposure given the tournament afforded Ray the
opportunity to watch his daughter play for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew that I was playing soccer, but I guess he didn't know
that it was in the Bundesliga, our highest league, and with the
national team,'' she said. ``For the first time, he sees me on TV
so it's probably difficult for him. We phone almost every day
because he sees the games. I've never phoned him as much as I have
in the last two or three weeks. I don't know if he's shocked at
seeing me in the World Cup, but he just told me that he's proud and
he's always thinking of me and how I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones hopes for a small family reunion before she returns to
Germany. At her request, two tickets _ one for her father and one
for her soccer-mad stepbrother Christopher _ are waiting at the
Jack Kent Cooke Stadium box office.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Jones now has a chance to see in person the athletic talent
he passed on.

NORTHERN LIGHT PRAISED BY USERS, CRITICIZED BY PUBLISHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Connecticut tax consultant Jeffrey Dexter, the convenience of
being able to search a database of trade magazines on the Internet
from his home office 24 hours a day, and pay only $1 to $4 for each
complete article, is ``terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend about $15 to $30 a month for articles in places like
Appraisal Journal and Journal of Real Estate Management, and the
cost per article is far less than if I had to subscribe to a bunch
of periodicals,'' said Dexter, who used to pay publishers as much
as $7.95 an article. Now he uses Northern Light Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But to Blaise Simqu, an executive vice president at Sage
Publications, Northern Light is a threat to his company's future. A
publisher of nearly 200 academic and professional journals, Sage
depends on annual subscriptions of $65 for individuals and up to
$240 for institutions. If a nonsubscriber can selectively print out
the full text of a Sage publication for a few dollars through
Northern Light, why subscribe to Sage?
</P>
<P>
   So Simqu has made sure Northern Light does not have access to
the Newbury Park, Calif., company's periodicals.
</P>
<P>
   These divergent views of Northern Light underscore why the
Cambridge-based firm has attracted so much attention: high praise
from users and e-commerce watchers, who say the company's research
engine is first-rate; and vociferous criticism from some publishers
who feel financially threatened by nonsubscriber access to the full
text of their magazines' articles.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Lexis/Nexis and Dow Jones Interactive, the most popular
corporate databases for newspaper and magazine article searches,
Northern Light is focused on doing detailed searches for small
businesses and consumers. Northern Light combines the search engine
features of a Lycos or Yahoo with an academic and professional
database similar to Lexis/Nexis.
</P>
<P>
   From its www.nlsearch.com site, Northern Light has combined
access to more than 150 million World Wide Web pages with a
sophisticated database of 6 million articles from 5,400 magazines,
newspapers, scholarly journals, newswires, and other periodicals.
The result is a single ``research engine,'' and a pay-as-you-go
database service.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Light, which was formed in 1995 and debuted on the
Internet in 1997, also offers information from Investext, a
compendium of Wall Street analyst reports on specific company
stocks. And this month it began offering a government documents
search site called usgovsearch.com that indexes more than 20,000
federal Web sites with more than 3.8 million individual government
and military Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to make government more accessible, the new site
enables the user to find information from immigration and banking
regulations to medical research and the status of legislation.
Created with the Commerce Department's National Technical
Information Service, the service costs $5 per day, or $30 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   Using Northern Light's research engine to find specific articles
and related Web sites is free. It is only when articles are
retrieved and printed out that the firm charges individuals and
small business owners up to $4 per article.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Light's most popular service is also its most
expensive. Investext, which contains Wall Street analysts' reports,
costs upward of $6.50 per page.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses can pay a flat monthly fee to use Northern Light for
more intricate searches, for which the results are grouped into
custom folders. And while Yahoo and other portals can perform basic
searches, Northern Light, which has a staff of librarians to help
organize the unwieldy and amorphous Web, specializes in more
advanced searches.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Light's database and organized results ``adds depth to
your Web searches and gives you more power than anyone else can
offer,'' according to PC magazine, which cited Northern Light as
the best tool for advanced searches.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other kudos for its sophisticated searching software,
Northern Light Technology (named after a famous 19th-century Boston
clipper ship) has attracted $35 million in a third round of
investments, from such big names as Reuters, Hewlett-Packard Co.,
and Times Mirror Corp., which publishes many newspapers including
the Los Angeles Times and the Hartford Courant.
</P>
<P>
   With the new funds, Northern Light plans to spend about $20
million on a nationwide print, radio, and television advertising
campaign this fall from Mullen, the Wenham-based ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Wide Web is as much a part of people's personal and
business lives that we want to be the first place they go to,''
said C. David Seuss, president of the 80-employee Northern Light.
Seuss was cofounder of Spinaker Software Co., one of the nation's
first children's educational software firms, which he sold in 1994
for $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Seuss, who would not discuss Northern Light's revenues,
acknowledges that the company's biggest success is Investext. The
company, he added, is preparing to offer on-line market research
studies, for a price tag of upward of $100 per full report. But so
far few of the major market research and consulting firms have
signed on.
</P>
<P>
   And some industry analysts question the company's financial
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, the idea that people will pay for each article
has limited appeal,'' said James D. Nails, senior analyst for
business information services at Forrester Research Co. in
Cambridge, Mass. ``Northern Light can establish a few niches, but
they won't knock off Dow Jones Interactive or Lexis/Nexis. Still,
they have a very good product in their research engine but I think
their business and distribution model holds them back.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Northern Light is quick to point out that it offers
more information sources than either Lexis/Nexis or Dow Jones,
there are some noteworthy omissions. For example, investor Times
Mirror Corp. offers the Hartford Courant through Northern Light but
not the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Northern Light has not signed up business periodicals
such as Business Week, Forbes, and Fortune, although it provides
links to each of their Web sites. Also missing are major trade
magazine publisher Cahners Publishing Co. of Newton, Mass., and the
influential New England Journal of Medicine and publications of MIT
Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get about $8 for each copywritten article accessed through
our Web site, and hardly anything through Northern Light,'' said
Janet Fisher, MIT Press associate director for journals publishing.
For each article purchased through Northern Light, the publisher
receives about 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said Northern Light gained access to some of their
periodicals, such as the quarterly Journal of Economics, through a
company that legally sells scores of journals to research libraries
and had the right to sublicense them.
</P>
<P>
   Seuss maintains he has had few complaints from academic
publishers, and is currently negotiating with Cahners. But he
acknowledges Northern Light could not come to agreements with
others such as The New York Times Co., which owns The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some publishers _ including those whose publications are
available through Northen Light _ view the firm as harmful to their
bread-and-butter business of selling subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who provides full-text articles over the Internet is
shooting themselves in the foot unless they control it from their
own Web site,'' said Mary Ann Liebert, publisher of Genetic
Engineering News, a 40,000 controlled-circulation biweekly and a
group of biomedical journals, the most expensive of which costs
$1,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Liebert maintains that only a handful of articles from each
issue are available on Northern Light, never the full text.
</P>
<P>
   And Simqu of Sage Publications said: ``Our financial model is
based on yearly subscriptions, which support a lot of people, and
for Northern Light to sell full-text copies of our journal articles
for a few bucks to nonsubscribers means we cannot continue
publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Seuss counters he is adding more publications each month and the
overall business is growing daily.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, users of the service depend on it, while corporate
librarians are effusive in their praise. At Fuld and Co., a
40-person competitive intelligence firm in Cambridge, Northern
Light is used to find very specific information. The company also
uses Lexis/Nexis, Dialog, and Dow Jones Retrieval.
</P>
<P>
   Said Helene Kassler, Fuld's director of library and information
services: ``No one company offers everything, so you still need to
use different search engines.''

WOMEN'S WORLD CUP IS WORLD CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the most overhyped and tedious sporting event in the
history of recorded civilization _ the National Basketball
Association playoffs _ has finally ended, we can direct our
attention to a genuinely interesting competition. I refer, of
course, to the ongoing World Cup of women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Before I start raving, let me make two things clear. One: While
I may indulge in the occasional condescending, misogynist slur
(See: ``Monistat Moment,'' below), I am not antiwoman. I am really
a gender-neutral misanthrope.
</P>
<P>
   Two: I am not rooting for the United States. They are a splendid
team, perhaps the most exciting professional sports franchise in
the country right now. Mia Hamm is as good as billed, if not
better, and the phrase ``supporting cast'' does not do justice to
the many genuine stars on the team with her.
</P>
<P>
   But my loyalties lie with the defending champions, the Lady
Herringheads from the Land of the Paper Clip. (See: ``I Married a
Norwegian,'' Feb. 16, 1994.) If I could have found a North Korean
flag, I would have been waving it at Foxborough on Sunday night.
And yes, I will be rooting for the stolid Lady Volkswagens from
Germany in their match against the Americans Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Those caveats aside, I haven't had this much fun since last
summer, watching the real World Cup. (Sorry . . . I warned you.)
There's nothing not to like about the women's game. It's fast, it's
skillful, and there's plenty of scoring to assuage the Yankee Goal
Whiners, e.g. ``It's soooo boring, they never score . . . '' The
stakes are high, and each team is playing hard. I have yet to see
an Alexi Lalas-level loafer/layabout besmirch the Women's World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Several commentators have opined that the women play cleaner,
and fake injuries less than the men. A Cup spokesman went so far as
to suggest that female players were more ``ethically evolved'' than
the men. What bosh. The game is plenty physical, and the women
writhe in affected agony after insignificant fouls with masculine
aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   Did you see Saint Mia give that Korean gal a shove in the back
on Sunday, while the ref's back was turned? That's what I call a
Monistat Moment. I should perhaps explain that Monistat and
Budweiser are the two primary sponsors of ESPN's soccer telecasts,
which you can watch without commercial interruption.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's the bottom line on women's soccer? Every so often,
Media Central issues ukazes on how to behave (Abstain!) or what to
think (Serbs _ bad!). The latest directive reads: Women's Sports
Have Arrived. This follows by about 18 months the diktat, Women
Enjoy Watching NFL Football, which proved to be totally false.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that women's sports have arrived on high school
and college campuses. At many schools, sports like women's
swimming, volleyball, basketball are 10 times more exciting than
the men's versions. I only wish I had a daughter to serve up to the
Stanford sports kombinat. In the professional arena, women's tennis
and figure skating have definitely arrived. There also seems to be
a great deal of attention paid to women playing golf, which is a
bourgeois leisure activity, and not, strictly speaking, a sport.
</P>
<P>
   Will women's professional soccer succeed here as a television or
stadium sport? No, it won't. Men's soccer hasn't yet found its
audience. As far as the women's game is concerned, men won't watch
it, and most women have better things to do than gawk at the TV for
hours on end. The local professional team draws an average of 1,400
spectators a game, which is what happens when Nike, Gatorade,
Budweiser, and Monistat aren't pouring mega-bucks dollars into
media promotions.
</P>
<P>
   So catch it now; it's the greatest show on earth. China plays
Russia for control of the Eastern Hemisphere Wednesday as Sweden
challenges Norway for control of the Scandinavian peninsula.
Thursday it's Brazil versus Nigeria _ the team that dares to play
without a defense! _ for control of the Southern Hemisphere, plus
USA versus Germany. And remember: Heia Norge!

ALBANIANS TOAST FALL OF SERB-OWNED HOTEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ It took a Manhattan bartender of Albanian
descent armed with a thick New York accent and a case of free
liquor to take over the Serb-controlled Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned hotel _ best known for its bad food, large
insects, and Serb paramilitaries hanging out in the lobby _ was the
latest battleground in the fight for control of the war-torn
capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A bizarre sequence of events that began with a hostile takeover
of the dimly lit hotel bar Sunday night ended Tuesday with a group
of American Albanians who fought alongside the Kosovo Liberation
Army announcing that a new board of directors controlled by ethnic
Albanians would run the hotel now that Serb forces _ and most Serb
civilians _ have left for Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ours now,'' Uk Lushi, 28, a member of the KLA's Atlantic
Brigade, a force of about 40 American Albanians, triumphantly
announced Tuesday after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo, seriously, it's like we liberated the place,'' said Lushi,
who led the takeover of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, about 100 ethnic Albanians would be allowed
to return to the jobs they were summarily fired from 10 years ago
when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic came to power.
</P>
<P>
   They, like tens of thousands of other ethnic Albanians in
state-run industries ranging from coal mines to universities, lost
their jobs as part of a long campaign by Milosevic to give Serbs
and Serbian interests preference in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The drab, filthy 367-room Grand Hotel _ now packed with about
400 reporters, photographers, television crews, and international
aid workers paying up to $150 a night _ has long been a dark symbol
of Serb domination over Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   For years before the war, a sign over the front door read, ``No
Dogs, No Albanians.'' The government-controlled media churned out
Serb propaganda from a second-floor suite. Serb intelligence agents
operated from rooms on a heavily guarded fourth floor.
</P>
<P>
   Menacing-looking Serbs in red jumpsuits with patches that read
``Society for Peace and Tolerance'' are usually reclining in broken
chairs sipping coffee in the lobby. KLA soldiers say many of the
men are members of the rogue paramilitary units that carried out
Milosevic's campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' against Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, the leader of a
murderous Serb paramilitary force and a convicted war criminal, has
long held a partial interest in the state-run company Sloga, which,
until Tuesday, ran the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear if the few remaining Serbs will be able to keep
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a job, but I'm afraid I'll be killed if I stay here,''
said Ivan Ivic, a Serb porter who said he would not return to work.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Yugoslav Army and paramilitary forces camped out
in the hotel's basement _ a dark den with disco-like blinking
lights, a pool hall, and a bowling alley. Investigators for the
international war crimes tribunal in the Hague are looking into
allegations that ethnic Albanian women were raped by Serb forces in
the basement, according to tribunal spokesman Paul Risley.
</P>
<P>
   A set of stairs descended into the underground maze of bars and
the bowling alley. An unclothed female mannequin lay on the floor.
The ``Bar Grand'' was ankle-deep in debris that included soiled
mattresses, camouflage uniforms, burned maps and army documents, a
black bra, a broken high-heeled shoe, reams of pornographic
magazines, and dozens of empty bottles of Jack Daniels and Johnny
Walker Red.
</P>
<P>
   The coup at the Grand Hotel began with a tense standoff Sunday
night between the Serb employees and the KLA representatives. A
spokesman for British peacekeeping forces said the hotel director,
a Serb, agreed to a meeting about who would control the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The director was invited to stay on in a four-member board of
directors that would include three ethnic Albanians, but he chose
to quit rather than work with them, said KLA members present at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA won the battle for control not by packing machine guns,
but free liquor. In a public relations stunt, they announced that
drinks were on the house. A crush of reporters stormed the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel director called British forces, who for awhile
tolerated the party with loud Albanian folk music. Serb bartenders
cursed in Serbian, and one smashed a glass on the floor. British
paratroopers with drawn machine guns surrounded the front of the
hotel and made it clear last call was 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was evil in that hotel,'' said Hairia Hussein, 45, an
ethnic Albanian thrilled to be returning to her job as a dishwasher
in the hotel restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting our jobs will be like independence day for us,'' she
said.

NEW PROSPERITY LURING MANY BACK TO IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND MADELINE GAUGHRAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a century, Ireland has served as a source of cheap
labor as starvation, political troubles, and unemployment drove
millions to the United States. Now, the tide of migration is
flowing back across the Atlantic as thousands of Irish natives and
some descendants of previous emigrants seek to participate in the
largest expansion in the island nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   In economic terms, the shift is as significant as the famines
that ravaged the island in the 1840s, said Boston College professor
Kevin O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in memory, Ireland is associated with
progress and prosperity,'' O'Neill said. Members of New England's
Irish diaspora who have returned tell of a newly energized society
where booming high-technology based businesses have transformed
Ireland's once-moribund economy into the so-called ``Celtic
Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround was a long time coming; Ireland was badly
handicapped by the separation in 1920 of Northern Ireland and its
industrial base. Central planning also cooled the economy and
emigration kept its population around 3 million from 1926 to 1971.
In 1988 and 1989 alone, double-digit unemployment prompted 131,000
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Now skilled workers are returning like never before. From 1996
to 1998, 88,000 people moved to Ireland, versus 55,000 who left.
mdOf those, 11,500 moved from the United States to Ireland while
8,400 moved the other way, data show. Unemployment is 6.4 percent
in Ireland, well below the European average of 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a real mood swing,'' said John McManus, formerly a
cash-management officer at Fidelity Investments in Boston who moved
to his native Dublin in February to become an electronic-commerce
consultant. ``We were always being told we're the poor man of
Europe, but now it seems like we've really got our act together.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus, 29, and friends who never left are members of a rising
yuppie class that supports chic new restaurants and Gap stores. The
Irish government hopes this same crowd will invest directly in
Ireland's future by buying shares in Telecom Eireann, the national
telephone monopoly, when it is privatized in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to an Ireland that ``feels like it's an equal to
the rest of Europe,'' said Francis Costello, a trade consultant who
was a top aide to former Boston mayor Raymond L. Flynn and to
former US representative Joseph P. Kennedy II.
</P>
<P>
   Those positions made Costello a prominent member of Boston's
Irish community, but now he too is in the process of moving his
family back to Ireland, where he grew up. He is drawn by what he
says is a new focus on business and trade rather than on the
difficulties Ireland suffered as a British colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gotten rid of a lot of psychological baggage,''
Costello said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists attribute Ireland's comeback to tax breaks
established 30 years ago aimed at drawing foreign investment; the
momentum for an end to the violence in Northern Ireland; and
Europe's drive to create a single market. For many US companies
seeking a foothold for doing business on the Continent, Ireland's
educated work force, relatively low wages, and familiarity with
American ways make it an attractive choice.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions attracted local companies, including
computer-storage maker EMC Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass. and
medical-instruments maker Boston Scientific Corp., to build
facilities in Ireland along with other major technology firms like
Microsoft and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable outcome: Exports accounted for 79 percent of
Ireland's gross domestic product in 1997, compared to 28 percent in
Germany and 11 percent in the United States. Those sales boosted
Ireland's gross domestic product by 9.1 percent in 1998, about
three times the growth rate of France. In 1997, Ireland's
per-capita GDP of $19,140 was larger than Britain's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a gazillion little high-tech companies there to work
for,'' said James McConnell, 38, currently a product manager for
Bostik Inc., a Middleton, Mass. adhesives maker. He plans to return
to Dublin for business school this summer and says he might stay
there.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the technology sector has also produced a feedback
effect: startup Irish companies are making their own investments in
the United States. Partly to lure more, Governor Paul Cellucci led
a trade mission to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the visit wasn't lost on many Irish business
executives, long accustomed to deferring to home offices in Boston
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has changed,'' said Annette Kennedy, vice president
for human resources at Trintech Worldwide in Dublin. Founded by
several Irish partners in 1986, the company lately has taken off on
sales of software for secure transactions over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has offices in California, Texas, and New Jersey and is
contemplating an initial public offering of stock, just like its
young American rivals in the Internet sector. Ireland works fine as
a business base, she says: ``We're considered the Silicon Valley of
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Irish company on the rise is Iona Technologies PLC of
Dublin, aided by board member John Cullinane, the Cambridge, Mass.
software entreprenuer. Cullinane recalls when he was introduced to
Iona in 1992 it was among a group of companies charging expenses on
credit cards to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Now Iona has annual sales of $84 million and employs 175 at an
office in Cambridge. ``Our executives live more in a plane than in
a country, but in the software industry I don't think it matters so
much where you're based,'' said Iona spokeswoman Sarah Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect Ireland can sustain its present growth rate, but
government economists still hope for annual expansion of five
percent through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest worry is inflation, partly because Ireland is
receiving billions of dollars in aid from the European Union for
infrastructure projects like roads. The Republic also cut interest
rates under the terms of the European Monetary Union, matching
programs in Germany and France where a priority is the creation of
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But in Ireland the problem is finding qualified people for open
positions. At an Irish government-sponsored job fair in Boston last
week, recruiters from 20 companies tried to fill 2,300 skilled
jobs, stressing intangibles like quality of life and retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The fair drew some like Tom Seaberg, a 46-year-old controls
engineer from Des Moines interested in returning to his family's
native land even if it means making a lateral career move. What's
the lure? ``It's beautiful country, and there are friendly
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the Trintech executive, worries that some job
candidates might be put off by the high cost of living in Ireland,
where income tax rates approach 46 percent. ``Some people might
have a romantic idea of coming to Ireland and it's not what they
expected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But relaxed immigration rules are also making it easier for
workers without Irish backgrounds to arrive, including Balkan
refugees, says Aidan Browne, a partner in the Dublin law firm of A
&AMP; L Goodbody LLP who represents clients in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, immigration could ease the pressure on wages and
enable Ireland's expansion to continue, Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go into any Dublin bar and most likely you'll be served by a
German or French kid,'' Browne said. ``The Irish are moving up the
value chain.''

TYCO INTERNATIONAL TAKES UNGLAMOROUS ROAD TO RICHES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The call came in the other day when Dennis Kozlowski was at work
in his two-story office building off a leafy New Hampshire road,
the modest kind of place you might mistake for the home of a
small-town daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was an update on the latest business prospect, but there was
nothing small about the idea of Tyco International buying Williams
Plc, the world's biggest maker of fire extinguishers. Discussions,
which appear to have stalled this week, were reported to be in the
$6 billion range.
</P>
<P>
   For all the modest appearances, this is business as usual for
Kozlowski, the chief executive who has built Tyco into a giant
conglomerate with unglamourous business interests across the globe
and even below the ocean's depths.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco, unofficially based in Exeter, N.H., has spent more than
$25 billion on an acquistion tear over the last two years. Today,
the low-profile conglomerate you may have never heard of or
confused with the toy company of the same name has a stock market
value worth more than those of Gillette Co. and Raytheon Co. put
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never started out with a game plan to be a $76 billion
company,'' said Kozlowski, referring to Tyco's stock value. ``But I
always envisioned one that had to grow ever year in order to be
successful and satisfy shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the combined revenues of Tyco's companies may reach an
annual rate of $25 billion by the end of the year and its army of
employees number about 80,000. Billions in cash flow from those
businesses fund many acquisitions, while others deals are paid for
in stock or borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   For all the scale of its businesses, Tyco's corporate operations
remain practically skeletal. The Tyco staff in Exeter numbers 70.
The company holds its annual meetings at law offices near Tyco's
official headquarters in Hamilton, Bermuda. Count the number of
shareholders, excluding insiders, at a Tyco annual meeting and you
may not need two hands.
</P>
<P>
   But shareholders have had little to complain about at Tyco, a
stock that has nearly quadrupled in the last three years. Kozlowski
has enjoyed rewards as well, including a compensation package last
year valued at as much as $74.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, Kozlowski's name was floated in press reports
as a possible chief executive candidate to succeed Dennis Picard at
Raytheon Co., where he is a director. It quickly became clear that
would have been a step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously his company was growing so fast he chose to not even
consider that,'' said Warren Rudman, the former U.S. senator from
New Hampshire and a fellow Raytheon director. ``Certainly we
thought he would have been a terrific candidate had he wanted to
become one.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyco was a conglomeration of many businesses long before
Kozlowski took over as chief executive in 1992, but its sprawling
empire has grown many fold through new acquisitions and internal
growth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Tyco's companies are organized into four operating groups
and all new acquisitions fit into one of those business lines. Some
could be called mundane but very profitable, like Tyco's group of
companies that make pipes, fittings, flow meters and other
equipment for industrial use.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco's fire and security services unit, the world's largest,
accounted for a third of operating profits last year. It includes
ADT, the big security company purchased two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's disposable and specialty product group, which
consists mostly of healthcare-related businesses like U.S. Surgical
Corp., accounted for another third of operating profits last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco's electrical and electronic components business contributed
only 19 percent of operating earnings in 1998 but has been the
focus on some of the company's biggest recent deals and its most
dramatic internal growth story.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco agreed to buy AMP Inc., the biggest maker of electronic
connectors, for $11.3 billion last November, outbidding hostile
suitor AlliedSignal Inc. Just last month, Tyco agreed to shell out
$2.87 billion for Raychem Corp., a big maker of electronic wiring
and tubing.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyco's most promising electronics venture of the moment is
rooted in a company it bought 25 years ago. The cable business
acquired in 1974 from Simplex Technologies is now laying fiber
optic lines across oceans to connect continents for expanding
telecommunications traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Business exploded this year and Tyco's companies have won
contracts for $2 billion of work in the last seven weeks alone.
``We saw more data being traferred to this fiber optic cable before
the Internet,'' said Kozlowski. ``Once the Internet came along, it
blew all all our projections away.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyco executes big acquisitions month after month by following
several rules without fail. The two big musts: never do a hostile
deal and cut costs aggressively so new acquisitions do not drag
down Tyco's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlowski got an up-close look at the wreckage hostile deals
create long ago, when he first joined Tyco and Joseph Gaziano was
running the company.
</P>
<P>
   Gaziano, one of the origial greenmailers of the 1970s, pursued
several hostile deals and ended up as the winning suitor for the
Ludlow Co. of Needham, Mass. after a two-year battle. He sent
Kozlowski in to run the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good people had migrated out of the company and we were
picking up the pieces,'' said Kozlowski. ``Hostiles never made a
lot of sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyco's ability to cut costs has been on display at AMP, where
managers had already identified up to $400 million in potential
cuts. Tyco quickly increased the target to nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One typical line item under scrutiny at AMP: the company's fleet
of aircraft at the disposal of executives and customers. ``Their
take was not to touch that,'' said Kozlowski. ``Our take was to get
rid of the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of go-go conglomerates is littered with companies
that stumbled at the pace or clobbered themselves by paying too
much. Many big Tyco shareholders think there is little chance Tyco
will do either in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be naive to assume there are no risks,'' said Dale
Dutile, an analyst at MFS Investment Management, which owns about
33 million Tyco shares. ``But they've clearly proven in the past
they are terrific negotiators, they are phenomenally good business
operators and they have a lengthy track record.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Kozlowski about comparisons sometimes made between Tyco and
the much larger General Electric Co. and he is flattered, but only
to a degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're growing our earnings at 50 percent a year and GE is
growing at something less than that,'' he said. ``We believe that
we have quite a few years to run out at way above average earnings
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozlowski believes more acquisitions, probably at the same pace
of about 10 per year, will continue for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no finish line,'' he said.

SHERIFF SEE LESSONS IN CHAING-GAN APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's the subject of protest letters by outraged human rights
activists from Australia to Sweden, and his controversial new chain
gangs have been rejected by a half-dozen communities in his home
county. His political opponents say he's exploiting a law-and-order
platform to reach higher office.
</P>
<P>
   But if his past is any sort of prologue, Bristol County Sheriff
Thomas Hodgson won't budge an inch. He fully intends to make his
jails the toughest in the land, controversy be damned.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Dartmouth and Freetown selectmen joined four other
Massachusetts cities and towns who don't want his inmates, wearing
red jumpsuits and chained and padlocked at the ankles, working in
their communities. Hodgson replies that there are plenty of other
towns willing to use the free labor, including Swansea, Taunton,
and Rehoboth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to do our work, and we are going to keep doing
it,'' he said. ``This is the right thing for the taxpayer, and
frankly, I am not going to apologize for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The chain gangs are simply the latest in a string of get-tough
jail reforms that have thrust the 45-year-old sheriff into the
media spotlight since he took office in the summer of 1997. And
some observers say that's exactly what Hodgson wants.
</P>
<P>
   As a Republican in decidedly Democratic country, Hodgson is
considered a rising star in the party, they say. Making headlines
by cracking down on inmates has positioned him as a contender for
higher statewide office, although he denies any interest in it.
</P>
<P>
   In a suit jacket, tie, and pinstriped shirt, Hodgson's work
attire hints more at his former profession _ bookkeeper and
consultant _ than his current job. But shortly after taking the
job, Hodgson had to deal with an escape attempt, inmate unrest, and
lawsuits surrounding decrepit conditions at the Ash Street Jail in
New Bedford, the country's oldest active jail.
</P>
<P>
   But Hodgson _ his sense of discipline shaped by Catholic
military school and years as a police officer in a Maryland resort
town _ said his reforms follow a straightforward mantra: Life is
hard, so jail should be harder.
</P>
<P>
   In Hodgson's world, inmates can't smoke. Televisions have been
banned in cells and the weight rooms remain padlocked. Inmates must
rise by 7 a.m. and have beds made by 9. Medical care isn't free.
Even a haircut costs $5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a place where you get a membership to a gymnasium and
a weight room,'' he says. ``If you want to smoke, if you want to
pick out your own breakfast cereal, stay in your community and
don't victimize people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, among them former sheriff candidates, have accused
Hodgson of tightening the screws to the danger point, practically
daring inmates to sue or revolt. Unfazed, Hodgson proudly points
out that defendants awaiting trial seek jail time elsewhere, while
some of his inmates want transfers out.
</P>
<P>
   But Hodgson said his reforms also include compassion. The work
crews are voluntary, the inmates have their own choir, and
incarcerated fathers can read to their children by mailing them
cassette tapes. Those who are motivated can study in Bible classes
or earn a high school equivalency diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics grudgingly praise Hodgson's efforts to make
inmates more accountable, toughen up jail life, and keep victims'
rights on the front burner. But he sometimes takes his beliefs too
far, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is he goes in the right direction, but then he
escalates and bites off more than he can chew,'' said Robert
Furtado of the Massachusetts Corrections Officers Federated Union.
``The guy is hard, ridiculously hard. The chain gangs set us back
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the voters of Bristol County's 16 towns and four
cities thought otherwise. Last November, Hodgson became the first
Republican in decades to win office in the largely Democratic
county. He does not face reelection until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   With 13 brothers and sisters, Hodgson had an ordinary upbringing
in Chevy Chase, Md., an affluent Washington suburb.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from a Catholic military high school in
Washington, Hodgson studied accounting at Xavier College in
Cincinnati, but soon grew bored. Within a year, he'd joined the
police department in Ocean City, a Maryland resort town of 7,000
whose summertime population swells threefold.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 6 1/2 years with the department, studied at the
Southern Police Institute in Louisville, Ky., and rose to acting
lieutenant, supervising crime prevention programs and the narcotics
division.
</P>
<P>
   His experiences on patrol helped develop the values he uses in
his current job: that defendants and inmates need to prepare for
life after jail, which means life behind bars must be regimented
and instill responsibility. He has conceded he is not ``the
inmates' first choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have senior citizens struggling on fixed incomes. We don't
want street criminals coming (to jail) for the winter,'' he said.
``We don't want to make it better on the inside than the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his passion for law enforcement, Hodgson quit the
department in the mid-1980s to work in the family travel business.
At the time, he said, the day-to-day grind on the job made him feel
like he was ``in a very negative world that skews your perspective
about people, which was contrary to my whole upbringing and
everything that I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson said he was still drawn to police work, a self-described
man of compassion who wanted to deal with ``the challenges of human
behavior every day. It is one of the most noble professions.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Hodgson took a job with an office supply company in
Quincy, Mass., then went to work for his brother-in-law's
accounting firm in New Bedford, Mass., where he first entered
politics. He ran succcessfully for City Council in 1988,
campaigning in a Democratic stronghold for law and order, and
against a needle exchange referendum that eventually was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   His law enforcement experience and public appeal as city
councilor caught the eye of then-Bristol County Sheriff David
Nelson, who hired him in 1994 as his assistant deputy
superintendent for investigations, where he oversaw, among other
things, internal affairs and the K-9 unit.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson was destined to become sheriff. Nelson, a Democrat,
resigned mid-term in 1997 after 13 years on the job. That June,
then-Governor William Weld picked Hodgson to complete Nelson's
term.
</P>
<P>
   His first day on the job exploded. An inmate escaped over Ash
Street Jail's 20-foot wall, but was captured while peering into
neighbors' homes. Hodgson added more razor wire to the top of the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, acting on a tip about another planned
jailbreak, Hodgson locked down the jail and called in the State
Police for a two-day shakedown. The raids yielded several makeshift
weapons and gear used for escapes.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson then ordered a 23-hour lockdown that lasted for months.
In response, prisoners rioted, threw feces at guards, smashed
porcelain toilets, and flooded the ancient cellblock. They spat on
Hodgson.
</P>
<P>
   But the crackdowns didn't end, and Hodgson's philosophy didn't
change. His party, and the people, began to take notice.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor has Hodgson, who is single, running for Congress next year
against US Rep. James P. McGovern, a Democrat in his second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt he is a rising star in the Republican
Party,'' said John Brockelman, executive director of the
Massachusetts Republican Party. ``Winning in Bristol County was
quite a feat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hodgson said he has no plans to run and does not face
reelection until 2004. ``I went out and campaigned for this job,
and told the people what needed to be done. I have an obligation to
fulfill that, since they elected me.''

LAWYER FOR NYC OFFICERS SAYS HE LOVES THE CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even for a lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg is a pretty
unpopular guy.
</P>
<P>
   Street protesters know him by sight and hound him as a
``racist'' or worse. Fellow lawyers have called him ``pathetic''
and ``reckless.'' A Daily News columnist recently denounced him for
peddling ``mud and fog . . . mischief and poison'' and declared
that he owes ``the whole city an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg has attracted this fire by serving as a defense
attorney in both of the high-profile police-brutality cases that
have set this city on an edge of racial tension unseen for nearly a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, Kornberg represented Officer Justin Volpe, who
halfway into his trial admitted that he did indeed shove a stick up
the rectum of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in a station-house
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, Kornberg is defending Sean Carroll, one of the
four officers charged with murder for firing 41 bullets at African
immigrant Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   At least as provocative as his pick of clients are his methods.
Before Volpe pleaded guilty, Kornberg told the jury that Louima's
injuries were inconsistent with ``nonconsensual'' sodomy and that
the feces on the bathroom wall contained another male's DNA,
suggesting, without explicitly stating, that Louima had been
wounded in an act of gay sex, not police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   After Volpe's guilty plea, which proved this suggestion wrong,
both Dennis Saffron, chief lawyer for the conservative Center for
the Community Interest, and the Rev. Al Sharpton _ who agree on
almost nothing else _ publicly reviled Kornberg for subjecting
Louima to ``a second rape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that Al Sharpton's come forward on this,'' Saffron
says. Sharpton's own famous accusation a decade ago _ that an
upstate district attorney raped Tawana Brawley _ set off some of
the city's bitterest racial tensions in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Sharpton was found liable for slander for his statement,''
Saffron went on, ``while the law holds Kornberg absolutely
unaccountable.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes too far to draw precise parallels: Sharpton meant to
stir things up, while any social repercussions from Kornberg's
remarks are byproducts of an age-old courtroom practice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the activist and the lawyer _ arguably, the city's most
provocative in their respective fields _ will hold much sway here,
these next several months, over the course of race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg's remarks have also reopened the question of how far a
lawyer should go in the pursuit of freeing a client.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Lieberman, former ethics commissioner for the New York Bar
Association, called Kornberg's tactics ``highly reckless.'' Russell
Gioiella, the lawyer for one of Volpe's codefendants who was
acquitted, called him a ``pathetic'' man who just wants ``to keep
his name in the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg, who soon turns 65, sat in his small, disheveled office
in Queens one recent afternoon and waved off the whole barrage of
attacks with a bemused sneer, as if he had been through worse.
</P>
<P>
   He said three doctors were lined up to testify in support of his
theory about Louima's wounds. The fact about the DNA came from the
FBI's file on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to jump from that to `gay sex,' that's their
leap,'' Kornberg said with a shrug. ``It's not my leap. I never
said that, directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he went on, ``I have a right, as a defense counsel, to
present to a jury, within the confines of the law, a reasonable
explanation of what happened, based on what doctors would have
testified to. Suppose that I didn't do that. Wouldn't I be remiss
in my duty?''
</P>
<P>
   He changed tack and advised Volpe to plead guilty after four
fellow officers testified against him.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg turned solemn when asked about the change of plea. ``I
regret,'' he said carefully, ``that my client in this case didn't
tell me the full story before the trial started.''
</P>
<P>
   If Volpe had told him the full story, would Kornberg have let
him go to trial? ``No,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg, a wry and voluble man, is a native New Yorker who
talks freely to the press and adorns his walls with tabloid
clippings about himself, including one that ranks him among the
city's 10 best criminal defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Kornberg made his first splash, 15 years ago, in the
Louima case of its day, but on the other side. In the course of
defending an alleged drug dealer, Kornberg produced evidence that
the police forced his client's confession by torturing him with a
stun gun.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg not only won his client a $600,000 settlement, but
sparked an investigation that resulted in the resignations of five
police commanders and the criminal conviction of three officers and
a sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Kornberg represented a huge
rapist-murderer, whom the tabloids nicknamed The Jolly Green Giant,
by arguing that he was genetically compelled to act violently. The
man was convicted, but the strategy, known as ``the XYY Chromosome
defense,'' has been widely emulated.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Kornberg has gained prominence for defending
police officers: one charged with possessing $3 million worth of
cocaine (acquitted), another accused of rape (sentence reduced),
and four officers charged with killing a car thief (three had
charges dismissed, the fourth was acquitted).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have one type of client; it's been cop, robber, cop,
robber,'' Kornberg said. ``I don't judge my clients. I represent
them. It's my job. Without me doing my job, you might as well take
away the judge, the jury, the prosecutors. It takes all of us to
play the game of court. Know what I'm talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gillers, professor of ethics at New York University Law
School, agrees. ``It's the defense lawyer's job to put evidence in
the best light, not necessarily the true light,'' Gillers said.
``Society gives him that job, and we excuse him from what would
otherwise be morally dubious acts.''
</P>
<P>
   This aspect of the job, Gillers added, can take ``a psychic
toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg waved away this notion. ``Nah,'' he said. ``I love
every minute of it. I love the challenge of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name his proudest achievements, he cited four jury
trials, involving police officers or firefighters, that ended in
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was special,'' he said, ``was the thrill in seeing the
audience, packed with cops or firefighters, cheering the jury's
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he confirming the charge, leveled by some critics, that
Marvyn Kornberg is, above all else, a showman?
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a showman?'' he scoffed. ``A guy who goes before a jury
and gets his point across? If that's the definition of a showman,
then I'm a showman and a darn good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether summing up a case, cross-examining a witness, or
spinning a verdict on courthouse steps, Kornberg has always had a
flair for the dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Drama lay at the heart of his interest in becoming a lawyer. The
revelation came when he was a teenager, the only child of a
drycleaner and a dress-shop saleswoman, living in a fourth-floor
walk-up in the Bronx. One day, he went to a movie called
``Boomerang!'' starring Dana Andrews as a lawyer who, in the final
reel, proves his client innocent of murder by pointing a gun at his
own head and pulling the trigger, to show that the alleged murder
weapon doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg still remembers vividly the suspense and exhilaration
of that climax. ``I saw that,'' he recalled, ``and I said, `That's
for me!' ''

GORE MAY WANT A NEW STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Massachusetts has been
the most politically fertile region in the country. The two have
raised more money per capita here than in any other state and
rolled up some of the largest victory margins.
</P>
<P>
   But for Gore, those good feelings seem to be sliding away _
seriously sliding away.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey taken by the University of Massachusetts shows
former US senator Bill Bradley has pulled even with Gore in a
presidential primary contest in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   The poll gives Gore 37.9 percent and Bradley 34.6 percent, with
10.3 percent undecided, among the 364 Democrats and Independents
who were surveyed June 23-28. The margin of error in the sub-sample
is plus or minus 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's stunning news for Gore, who only two months ago led
Bradley in a similar UMass poll by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What may be just as unsettling for Gore is that his slip comes
as Clinton's standing among Bay State voters has jumped by 10
percentage points since the Kosovo victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lou DiNatale, senior fellow at the university's McCormack
Institute, which designs the poll, said Gore seems to be in a
``free fall'' and is getting no benefit from the Clinton foreign
policy success. He said the results raise questions about the vice
president's strategy of separating himself from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is particularly bad news because it comes on the heels of
an upswing in Clinton's standing,'' DiNitale said.
</P>
<P>
   DiNatale said the good news for Gore is that the vice
president's slide is coming so early in the campaign. ``This is the
ideal time for Gore to bottom out,'' he said. ``It is early and
there is plenty of time for him to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, how does this all jibe with the findings of recent
national polls that show Gore holding a strong lead among
Democrats. A recent CNN/Time magazine poll _ taken at almost the
same time as the UMass survey _ gave him a 3-to-1 margin over
Bradley, or 64 percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   DiNatale said his survey of Massachusetts voters may, in fact,
have picked up an early trend that spells trouble for the vice
president and his strategy to distance himself from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fundamental assumptions of the Gore campaign is
that if he separates himself from Clinton, he should gain in the
polls,'' DiNatale said. ``But, with Massachusetts so pro-Clinton
there may be a downside to the strategy that the Gore campaign has
not fully thought out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's new strength in Massachusetts is not only
reflected in his trial heat with Gore. He also does better than
Gore in a race among general voters against Texas Governor George
W. Bush, the Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, Bush would beat Gore in Massachusetts by
43.4 percent to 38.3 percent if the election were held now _ a
significant victory margin for any Republican in a heavily
Democratic state. Bradley runs about even with Bush, getting 37.8
percent to Bush's 36.6 percent. In April, Bush led Bradley 40
percent to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 400 voters has a 5 percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's gain on Gore can be explained by the well-publicized
launching of his campaign several weeks ago. With campaign stops in
New Hampshire and Boston, Massachusetts voters were flooded with
positive images of the Texas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But what is impressive about Bradley's trial heat with Bush is
that he turned around the numbers in the face of the Texan's
high-profile events.
</P>
<P>
   Another indication that Bradley is gaining strength in
Massachusetts is that the former senator also has increased his
April lead over another GOP candidate, Elizabeth Dole. He received
42.8 percent to Dole's 26.5 percent, with 21.3 percent undecided.
Two months ago, he led Dole by only 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Again, that is not good news for the vice president. The survey
shows Dole does better against Gore, getting 31.3 percent to his
44.6 percent, with 13.1 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   What is so unsettling for Gore is that Massachusetts should be
among his strongest base. For example, Clinton got a 65.6 percent
favorable job rating, up from 57 percent in April. Another 67.3
percent approved of his handling of the Yugoslavian conflict and
nearly 70 percent say he deserves credit for the peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Has Gore made a strategic mistake that will play out nationally
for him? Given Clinton's uncanny ability to transform a crises into
higher poll numbers, Gore and his strategists may want to take a
closer look at what is happening in a state where the Clinton/Gore
team has for so long prospered.

COMPETING IN SENIOR GAMES, LIFE BEGINS AT 50 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sheila McKenna was growing up in Fairhaven, Mass., she was
a bona fide jock, playing basketball, volleyball, and softball. But
her name was never in the local paper, and her picture was there
just once, when her high school basketball team won the
Narragansett Girls' League championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now McKenna _ 40 years older and still a jock _ has four folders
full of newspaper clippings and certificates that brag of her
accomplishments. Her peers are not high school kids, though, but
people from age 50 and older who either want to rekindle their
athletic prowess or ignite it for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Their outlet is the National Senior Games Association.
Sanctioned by the US Olympic Committee, the Games have qualifying
state events every year, and National Senior Games every other
year. Since the Senior Games started in 1985, participation has
grown from 2,500 at the first National Games in 1987 to 12,400
expected this fall in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The summer games have 18 sports including track and field,
volleyball, racquetball, and swimming, as well as badminton,
shuffleboard, archery, and horseshoes. The first Winter Games will
be held next February in Lake Placid., N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Osgood is the assistant state coordinator of the
Massachusetts Games, which began in 1991. Earlier this month, he
said, nearly 900 people participated in 22 sports at Spingfield
College. And though the oldest member was racewalker George Conway
of Milton (age 96), the Games are not geared to the oldest senior
citizens, the longest retired, or the non-athlete.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is divided into age groups _ 50-54, 55-59, and
so forth. ``It's picking up now because the baby boomers have
turned 50,'' Osgood said.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood said his organization tries to spread the word though
councils on aging, recreation departments, senior centers, and an
ambassador program _ athletes telling others what it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna, a former former physical education teacher and coach at
Attleboro High, spent every weekend this month participating in
state Senior Games in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.
He will go to the nationals in Orlando, Fla., in October. She's
qualified in track events, basketball, and the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna, who works about 24 hours a week for a Hallmark dealer
in Attleboro, usually goes for a run at 5:30 or 6 in the morning,
runs with a coach on Thursday evenings, and goes to the YMCA a few
afternoons a week to play basketball with high school girls or just
practice free throws.
</P>
<P>
   So being sedentary is obviously not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, the adrenaline constantly flows, I've never been
one to just sit around,'' McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   When she was in high school, there was not even a rover position
on the basketball team (just three forwards and three guards who
stayed on their side of the court). At Bridgewater State, there
were no intercollegiate sports for women.
</P>
<P>
   She learned of the Senior Games in 1993 and got a group of
college alums together to form a basketball team. They won the
States, and qualified to go the Nationals, but McKenna was shut out
for being too young. She was 54, and the starting age then was 55.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna has since added track events to her repertoire, and runs
20 to 25 miles a week training for her 200-, 400-, 800-, and
1,500-meter runs. She'll compete in all of those in the nationals,
as well as the long jump and on a basketball team of women from
Connecticut (``I'm the token out-of-stater.'')
</P>
<P>
   While her times are not world records, they were good enough to
notch her a ninth place in the 1,500 and sixth in the 800 meters in
the 1997 nationals in Tucson, Ariz. Her best time for the 1,500 is
6:56 (world record for women 55-59 is 4:57.5), for the 800 is 3:24
(world record, 2:22), and 400 is 1:28 (1:04.5).
</P>
<P>
   McKenna is realistic about the physical limitations of a senior
athlete, noting that her husband, Jack, used to tell her ``good
luck'' before a meet. Now he says, ``good luck and don't get
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Once when she was playing basketball, she stepped on someone's
foot when she was driving a lane, and was in an air cast for two
months. When she was running the 400 meters in the nationals two
years ago, she pulled a hamstring, but had it taped so she could
compete in the 800-meter race the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing basketball in high school, my worst injury was a black
eye, on a jump ball from an elbow,'' she said, shaking her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mind of an athlete is still 18, but the body is almost
59,'' said McKenna, whose birthday is next month.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Burguess, of Wellesley, is an ``ambassador'' whose job is
to drum up support for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   But she said it's hard, in part because people think Springfield
is too far to travel to compete in the state games, or because they
think of playing bridge or traveling as better activities for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Burguess, 66, acknowledges that she ``was never a sportsminded
person . . . my school offered field hockey and that didn't appeal
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She started running three years ago ``to stay in shape,'' and
took up racewalking to join her mother, Estelle Frendberg, 86, who
participates in the Senior Games. But that turned out to be too
boring for Burguess, who now competes in the 100-, 200-, and
400-meter races, and high jump. She trains with triathlete Phyllis
Mays, also 66.
</P>
<P>
   Burguess, an administrator for the corporate comptroller at
Bose, has set her goal at improving her high jump of 3 feet, 6
inches, at which she placed third in the Nationals two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am stuck there, I'm platooned,'' she said. ``I'm thinking
big things, and want to get a trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenna's goal, meanwhile, is to add another sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really like to learn the shot put,'' she said. ``I don't
know, I just want a field event.''
</P>
<P>
   And like most of the other seniors involved in the Games, she
likes not just competing, but remembering how different it was when
she was introduced to sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``My basketball uniform in high school was my one-piece gym
suit, and my mother had to cut out felt letters and sew them on my
uniform,'' McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is a big deal for me.''

KERRY'S BIG LEAP FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If they gave a sort of SAT test to grade US senators on what
they know about issues, John Kerry might lead the pack.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute interview at the Globe on Monday, the junior
senator churned through two-dozen subjects with sure-footed ease.
The old Kerry _ cautious, tentative, carefully couched _ has given
way to a more confident and combative Kerry. Like Teddy, he's
effectively senator for life, or as long as he wants to be, and is
free to use the driver off the tee on any hole, no matter how
narrow the political fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget the perfidy, the callow crassness, of the
vote in the House on Kosovo,'' he said of the Republican
leadership-fueled 213-213 vote, which to Kerry, to me, and to
millions of others was a despicable political move to undercut US
servicemen by making it ``Clinton's war.'' Added Kerry: ``I think
that was a disgrace.'' While, of course, there were honorable
people opposed to the war, ``too many people were trying to dump
this on Clinton,'' and the withholding of congressional approval of
the NATO bombing campaign after its inception was contrary ``to the
best interests of the country,'' argues the decorated Vietnam
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Laboring as he does in the mammoth shadow of Kennedy Mountain,
the 36-year career of Edward M. Kennedy, Kerry's workaday life has
evolved into picking and choosing his spots. Kennedy's high-energy
staff and nearly four decades of service make Teddy's office the
first port of call for those trying to get the federal bureaucracy
to start or stop something.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, technology, and education, Kerry is making
substantive moves and is now secure enough to admit that he needs
more exposure to complex developments in such quick-changing worlds
as the Internet, where developments unfold at warp speed. Thanks to
a first-rate education (St. Paul's, Yale, BC Law) and a relentless
ambition backed up by a combative and skillful political talent,
Kerry climbed the greasy pole of Massachusetts politics to the
second-highest perch.
</P>
<P>
   He is not your basic warm and cuddly politician. His coolness
can approach frost with great rapidity, and his fellow pols do not
cut him the kind of slack allotted to more demonstrative
personalities. But there are none in the political game who do not
have a high regard for his acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry was an effective prosecutor in Middlesex County, a clever
politician as lieutenant governor, and when the Democrats were in
the majority, a highly effective investigator as chair of the
Senate subcommittee on narcotics and terrorism, subjects on which
he has written a respectable book.
</P>
<P>
   But in the current Senate he has no chairmanship, and the
prospects for Democrats regaining control in the next election are
not promising. Should lightning strike and Kerry get chosen, say,
as running mate to Al Gore, the Kerry record would be spread upon
the nation's spotty attention span.
</P>
<P>
   And a pretty good record it is. What surprised me as Kerry
fielded questions is how far up the Senate seniority ladder he's
already climbed. ``I'm 30th in seniority today, and I'll be 28th in
seniority next session, maybe 27th.'' Of course, with Teddy sitting
there at third in seniority (West Virginia's Bobby Byrd and South
Carolina's Strom Thurmond sit astride the Geezer Gallery), Kerry is
still well down the list. But he knows his onions, Senatewise. As
former governor William Weld discovered in their marathon skein of
televised debates (nine of them), Kerry's debating skills are not
to be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is learning the telecommunications business to discern the
appropriate role in regulating that pig pile. He's friendly with
Senator John McCain and respects the Arizona Republican's efforts
at campaign finance reform. Democrats, Kerry says, lost four or
five seats in the last two weeks of the 1998 campaign ``to money
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not starry-eyed about the Clinton administration's
sincerity in trying to salvage Medicaid and Social Security
compromises. He admits that ``the health care delivery system is in
chaos'' and needs a big fix. He suspects that his party won't
reclaim the Senate until after Democrats recapture the US House
(where a net gain of six would do the trick).
</P>
<P>
   Kerry opposes labor's protectionist proclivities but concedes:
``If the economy went down here, you'll have an instinctive
reaction in Congress toward protectionism.'' He sees the Internet
as a paradigm shift in the era's economics. ``My bet is we are on
an incredibly new economic curve _ and how do we tame the economic
impact of it?'' That spurs his emphasis on education as the gateway
to work force prosperity. He's for Gore for president, and would
not spurn, one suspects, an invitation to be Gore's running mate.
Al could do worse.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore decides he needs a bemedaled Northerner who can rattle
off speeches on complicated issues, debate with the best of them,
maintain cordial if not cozy relationships with union bigwigs, and
come to the party with no scandal or loose financial ends, Kerry
might have a shot at the big time.

ACERBIC PLAYWRIGHT KNEW THE PERILS OF `REFORM' POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When William Alfred, the professor and playwright, died in May
at 76, many theater-goers and generations of Harvard students
mourned this gentle man and his mischievously acerbic view of life.
Alfred was unusual among American intellectuals because of his
attitude toward ``reform.'' He was against it.
</P>
<P>
   His masterpiece for the stage, ``Hogan's Goat,'' takes place in
Alfred's native Brooklyn in 1890, where, in Fogarty's Saloon, the
tough old mayor, Ned Quinn, responds to demands from the Party of
Reform for his resignation:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Party of Reform''! Ah, yes, reform!
</P>
<P>
   A Lutheran lawyer with a flytrap mouth
</P>
<P>
   And a four-bit practice of litigious Swedes
</P>
<P>
   In a closet rank as rats down by the river!
</P>
<P>
   A lecherous broker with a swivel eye
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't trust with Grandma in a hack!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I once asked Alfred about the inspiration for ``swivel eye'' in
Quinn's diatribe. ``Theodore Roosevelt,'' he replied. ``My family
distrusted him and most reformers.'' T.R. at least accomplished
genuine, long-lasting changes in labor laws and other areas. His
imitators have debased the notion into a priggish defeatism. In
today's politics, ``reform'' is a synonym for distrust of the
people.
</P>
<P>
   At Manhattan's American Place Theatre in 1965, many in the
audience belonged to reform Democratic clubs still battling Tammany
Hall. They gasped at Quinn's gamy speech but were won over by a
lyrical script and a first-rate cast, some of whom found later
success in movies and television: Ralph Waite, Cliff Gorman,
Barnard Hughes, and Conrad Bain. A luminous young actress, Faye
Dunaway, played Kathleen Stanton, whose eloquent doubts about the
price of politics infuse the play with a power to make it worthy of
an overdue translation to film or cable television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like a theater that belongs to the whole people. And
by that I mean a theater where you can have complicated things
being talked about and yet not in complicated ways,'' Alfred once
said. ``I want the theater to have the force and attraction of
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred was a true populist, suspicious of the antipdemocratic
attitude behind the ``reform'' impulse. In ``Hogan's Goat,'' the
villain is a reformer. Today's Party of Reform offers a melange of
moral superiority and ambitious meddling, often peddled by the
fiercely naive and the criminally feckless. They evoke Walter
Bagehot's remark in 1879 that ``nothing is more unpleasant than a
virtuous person with a mean mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The term-limits putsch is aimed at punishing voters who do not
vote the way the lords of ``reform'' want them to. Those wishing to
``reform'' campaign finance by limiting money think voters are too
stupid to know which corporations have rented out candidates and
for how much.
</P>
<P>
   The special prosecutors and independent counsels who intimidate
and harass under the banner of ``reform'' carry writs from a
craven, buck-passing Congress that fears that Congress itself can
never properly exercise its duty of oversight, investigation, or
even (gulp!) impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1955 work, ``The Age of Reform,'' Richard Hofstadter
notes that ``early civic reform was tainted with nativism,'' citing
the observation of Lincoln Steffens that ``educated citizens of
cities said, and I think they believed . . . that it was the
ignorant foreign riff-raff of the big, congested towns that made
municipal politics so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, municipal politics is cleaner and less corrupt than that
practiced among the shady lanes and shady dealings of those
citadels of ``reform,'' the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred's background was working class. His mother was a
telephone operator and his father a bricklayer, who, after his son
gave him a tour of Harvard College, gave a common-sense judgment:
``I'm really impressed by the quality of the bricks used here.''
It's true. Well-laid bricks last longer than most reforms.

NEW PROSPERITY LURING MANY BACK TO IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND MADELINE GAUGHRAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a century, Ireland has served as a source of cheap
labor as starvation, political troubles, and unemployment drove
millions to the United States. Now, the tide of migration is
flowing back across the Atlantic as thousands of Irish natives and
some descendants of previous emigrants seek to participate in the
largest expansion in the island nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   In economic terms, the shift is as significant as the famines
that ravaged the island in the 1840s, said Boston College professor
Kevin O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in memory, Ireland is associated with
progress and prosperity,'' O'Neill said. Members of New England's
Irish diaspora who have returned tell of a newly energized society
where booming high-technology based businesses have transformed
Ireland's once-moribund economy into the so-called ``Celtic
Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround was a long time coming; Ireland was badly
handicapped by the separation in 1920 of Northern Ireland and its
industrial base. Central planning also cooled the economy and
emigration kept its population around 3 million from 1926 to 1971.
In 1988 and 1989 alone, double-digit unemployment prompted 131,000
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Now skilled workers are returning like never before. From 1996
to 1998, 88,000 people moved to Ireland, versus 55,000 who left.
mdOf those, 11,500 moved from the United States to Ireland while
8,400 moved the other way, data show. Unemployment is 6.4 percent
in Ireland, well below the European average of 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a real mood swing,'' said John McManus, formerly a
cash-management officer at Fidelity Investments in Boston who moved
to his native Dublin in February to become an electronic-commerce
consultant. ``We were always being told we're the poor man of
Europe, but now it seems like we've really got our act together.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus, 29, and friends who never left are members of a rising
yuppie class that supports chic new restaurants and Gap stores. The
Irish government hopes this same crowd will invest directly in
Ireland's future by buying shares in Telecom Eireann, the national
telephone monopoly, when it is privatized in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to an Ireland that ``feels like it's an equal to
the rest of Europe,'' said Francis Costello, a trade consultant who
was a top aide to former Boston mayor Raymond L. Flynn and to
former US representative Joseph P. Kennedy II.
</P>
<P>
   Those positions made Costello a prominent member of Boston's
Irish community, but now he too is in the process of moving his
family back to Ireland, where he grew up. He is drawn by what he
says is a new focus on business and trade rather than on the
difficulties Ireland suffered as a British colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gotten rid of a lot of psychological baggage,''
Costello said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists attribute Ireland's comeback to tax breaks
established 30 years ago aimed at drawing foreign investment; the
momentum for an end to the violence in Northern Ireland; and
Europe's drive to create a single market. For many US companies
seeking a foothold for doing business on the Continent, Ireland's
educated work force, relatively low wages, and familiarity with
American ways make it an attractive choice.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions attracted local companies, including
computer-storage maker EMC Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass. and
medical-instruments maker Boston Scientific Corp., to build
facilities in Ireland along with other major technology firms like
Microsoft and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable outcome: Exports accounted for 79 percent of
Ireland's gross domestic product in 1997, compared to 28 percent in
Germany and 11 percent in the United States. Those sales boosted
Ireland's gross domestic product by 9.1 percent in 1998, about
three times the growth rate of France. In 1997, Ireland's
per-capita GDP of $19,140 was larger than Britain's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a gazillion little high-tech companies there to work
for,'' said James McConnell, 38, currently a product manager for
Bostik Inc., a Middleton, Mass. adhesives maker. He plans to return
to Dublin for business school this summer and says he might stay
there.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the technology sector has also produced a feedback
effect: startup Irish companies are making their own investments in
the United States. Partly to lure more, Governor Paul Cellucci led
a trade mission to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the visit wasn't lost on many Irish business
executives, long accustomed to deferring to home offices in Boston
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has changed,'' said Annette Kennedy, vice president
for human resources at Trintech Worldwide in Dublin. Founded by
several Irish partners in 1986, the company lately has taken off on
sales of software for secure transactions over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has offices in California, Texas, and New Jersey and is
contemplating an initial public offering of stock, just like its
young American rivals in the Internet sector. Ireland works fine as
a business base, she says: ``We're considered the Silicon Valley of
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Irish company on the rise is Iona Technologies PLC of
Dublin, aided by board member John Cullinane, the Cambridge, Mass.
software entreprenuer. Cullinane recalls when he was introduced to
Iona in 1992 it was among a group of companies charging expenses on
credit cards to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Now Iona has annual sales of $84 million and employs 175 at an
office in Cambridge. ``Our executives live more in a plane than in
a country, but in the software industry I don't think it matters so
much where you're based,'' said Iona spokeswoman Sarah Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect Ireland can sustain its present growth rate, but
government economists still hope for annual expansion of five
percent through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest worry is inflation, partly because Ireland is
receiving billions of dollars in aid from the European Union for
infrastructure projects like roads. The Republic also cut interest
rates under the terms of the European Monetary Union, matching
programs in Germany and France where a priority is the creation of
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But in Ireland the problem is finding qualified people for open
positions. At an Irish government-sponsored job fair in Boston last
week, recruiters from 20 companies tried to fill 2,300 skilled
jobs, stressing intangibles like quality of life and retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The fair drew some like Tom Seaberg, a 46-year-old controls
engineer from Des Moines interested in returning to his family's
native land even if it means making a lateral career move. What's
the lure? ``It's beautiful country, and there are friendly
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the Trintech executive, worries that some job
candidates might be put off by the high cost of living in Ireland,
where income tax rates approach 46 percent. ``Some people might
have a romantic idea of coming to Ireland and it's not what they
expected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But relaxed immigration rules are also making it easier for
workers without Irish backgrounds to arrive, including Balkan
refugees, says Aidan Browne, a partner in the Dublin law firm of A
&AMP; L Goodbody LLP who represents clients in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, immigration could ease the pressure on wages and
enable Ireland's expansion to continue, Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go into any Dublin bar and most likely you'll be served by a
German or French kid,'' Browne said. ``The Irish are moving up the
value chain.''

WITH LIGHT TOUCH, PROGRAM HELPS YOUNG JEWS RENEW THEIR FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most daunting and worrisome challenges facing
American Jewish leaders is the large numbers of Jews doing little
or nothing to practice their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Though they celebrate important holidays like Yom Kippur or
Passover, many Jews are Jewish because of their heritage, not
because they are deeply committed to their faith.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs of hope: strategies and organizations
working to spur a religious revival among Jews and ensure the
future vitality of America's Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most successful is Aish Hatorah, an educational
program started in Israel that offers seminars on everything from
ethics to dating and takes a much less formal approach than the
typical synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that traditional synagogue services can seem
intimidating and rote, the program's founders say Aish Hatorah
tries to provide a more inviting and intimate setting, especially
for young, single Jews who find no compelling reason to join a
temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's look at the options Jews have,'' said Rabbi Eli Glaser,
director of Aish Hatorah's Boston branch. ``In elementary school
years you prepare to be a bar or bat mitzvah and once you're done
that's usually it. In college you've got Hillel. And then once you
have a family you join the synagogue. But the non-affiliation rate
among Jews between 25 and 40 is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bernten, 40, who has been a regular at Aish Hatorah's Boston
program since it opened four years ago, said the center is a more
comfortable place to absorb Jewish lessons than a synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more one-on-one than the synagogue and more
personal,'' said Bernten, who runs a travel agency. ``The rabbis
are regular people. You don't feel like they're up there on the
pulpit and you're down here. You really can talk to them without
feeling embarrassed about what you don't know. You can really
relate to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Aish Hatorah has become one of the city's most
successful Jewish education programs. Since it opened a center four
months ago, more than 2,500 people have walked through its doors.
It has 2,700 people on its mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the success has to do with the fact that it's a
completely different Jewish education than we're used to,'' Glaser
said. ``When I was growing up they taught us a lot of the what _
this is what we do _ but not the why. Why do we do this? What's the
point of keeping kosher or learning Hebrew? The typical Jewish
education does a lot more to turn people off than to turn them on.
It's very shallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Operating in more than 100 cities on five continents, Aish
Hatorah is at the core of the recent explosion of Jewish learning
and spirituality. In Los Angeles, Aish Hatorah has attracted
several Hollywood luminaries, including Jason Alexander, Elliot
Gould, and Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have used you in my life about 25 years ago,''
Spielberg said in a recent statement issued by Aish Hatorah.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser would not have chosen to become a rabbi if it were not
for Aish Hatorah. He discovered the program in 1990 when he was
visiting relatives in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he was a sportswriter for the Baltimore Sun and
before that he had been doing the same thing at the Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had grown up very secular and I didn't have much of a
connection to Judaism,'' Glaser recalled. But after attending a few
programs at Aish Hatorah, Glaser began to sense that Judaism,
despite its ancient roots, could have meaning for a Jew living in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was continuity to Jewish history and if I wanted to blow
it off I felt I was blowing off something significant, whereas
before I didn't really think it was that important,'' Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to America and his life as a sportswriter, but the
spiritual seed planted in Israel continued to grow and Glaser soon
grew dissatisfied with journalism. ``Writing about touchdowns and
three-point shots was just entertainment and I wanted to do
something more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Glaser returned to Israel, where he spent five years
studying to be a rabbi. He was ordained in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best decision in my life,'' he said. ``What we do
here makes a difference in people's lives. It's tremendously
fulfilling. This is a very dynamic place.''

</P>
<P>
   --The Pew Charitable Trusts has allocated more than $2 million
to study the impact of religion on the lives of America's newest
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churches, synagogues, and mosques have played and continue to
play an important civic, social, and cultural role helping
immigrants incorporate into American society,'' Pew officials said
in a recent statement. ``The importance of religion, however, has
often been downplayed compared to other social and economic
factors.''
</P>
<P>
   To help rectify the situation, Pew has awarded grants to the
University of Houston, New York University, the University of
Southern California, and the Social Science Research Council in New
York to examine the ties between religion and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   --Thanks to a New York-based Jewish organization, a few computer
clicks can allow people to experience Shabbat services from the
comfort of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald, director of the National
Jewish Outreach Program, ``Virtual Shabbat'' takes users on an
interactive tour of the prayers, rituals, customs, and songs
associated with Shabbat services.
</P>
<P>
   The newly released CD-ROM is an effort to use the latest
technology to try and motivate Jews to strenghten their religious
practices.
</P>

LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   She tips her Giants cap as she rounds third base, a mass of
strawberry blond curls flying free as she bows from the waist to
acknowledge the cheers of her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical gesture marks the last game and first grand slam
of one 8-year-old girl's debut season on the softball diamond. Even
her chronically indifferent big brothers look impressed.
</P>
<P>
   That my daughter is a ham comes as no surprise. That she is an
athlete continually astounds. In her freckled face and unruly
ringlets, I catch a glimpse of my childhood self. But there is
nothing of me to recognize in the power hitter who sails toward
home plate with a swagger as big as her smile.
</P>
<P>
   In this summer of Mia Hamm and the US women's soccer team, I
watch Katie's last glorious hit of the softball season and see the
single, unambiguous legacy of modern feminism. Battles yet may rage
at this century's end in the relentless culture wars about working
motherhood, glass ceilings, pay equity, and sexual harassment, but
the playing field, at least, has been won.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle of Higher Education reported last month that 40
percent of college athletes last year were women, 5 percent more
than the year before. What's astonishing is less the numbers than
the speed with which they were realized. In a single generation,
young women have gone from the cheerleading squad to the varsity
team, from the sidelines to the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was Congress and the courts, not the coaches, who
propelled girls onto the playing fields when Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972 mandated an equal allocation of
resources to women's sports at colleges that receive federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   No single antidiscrimination act has had such a dramatic,
measurable impact on the lives of girls and women.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's stars of the US women's soccer team, including the
irrepressible Hamm, were part of the first generation of American
girls who knew there would be a spot for them on a varsity team,
who knew they would be as eligible as their male classmates for an
athletic scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Talent did not immediately translate into opportunity, however.
It wasn't until eight years ago that there even was a World Cup
tournament in soccer for women. Hard to believe when you consider
the phenomenon of the US women's team this remarkable summer.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a million people have bought tickets to their
World Cup games. There were sellout crowds in Chicago and New
Jersey. There were 50,000 screaming fans in Foxborough at the
height of a heat wave. More than 1 billion viewers watch them on
television worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup for women has given our daughters role models on
the athletic fields who actually look like them, ponytails and all.
That's no small matter in my house where Katie's bedroom walls are
plastered with posters of last year's heroic boys of summer _
Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa and St. Louis Cardinals first
baseman Mark McGwire (the cherished pictures of the homerun kings
torn clandestinely from the pages of her brother's Sports
Illustrated for Kids).
</P>
<P>
   With the success of the US women's soccer team, female athletes
even are poised to reap some of the financial rewards long reserved
for men. Mia Hamm is a spokeswoman for more than a dozen companies.
She is the centerpiece of Nike's latest multimillion-dollar
marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Adidas, the world's largest manufacturer of soccer equipment, is
one of the sponsors of the World Cup tournament and is using
photographs of members of the US women's team in its
advertisements. Can beer commercials be very far behind?
</P>
<P>
   I was alone in front of the television set on a recent evening
when I first saw the Nike commercial featuring Mia Hamm and Michael
Jordan going one-on-one in a number of different sports to the
sound of a female voice singing ``Anything you can do, I can do
better . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come here, Katie,'' I called breathlessly to my daughter, who
had moved seamlessly from batting practice to shooting hoops in the
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, that's Mia Hamm with Michael Jordan in this commercial.
She's being treated as though she is as big a star as he is!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, so?'' asked the puzzled power-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Silly Mom. Imagine thinking that Madison Avenue could sell my
daughter something she already owns.

 TEXAS GOV. BUSH REACHES OUT TO CALIFORNIA'S LATINOS  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ In his first political foray into California,
George W. Bush raised the hopes Tuesday of Republicans eager to win
back the White House and collected millions of dollars for his
campaign _ but he failed to impress Jose and Marilu Hernandez at
the Del Mar Fair.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited three-day visit of the Texas governor _ the
runaway front-runner in the polls _ generated genuine excitement
among California Republicans, who haven't tasted victory in a
presidential campaign since 1988, when Bush's father, former
President George Bush, carried the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the younger immediately showed himself as a different kind
of Republican by distancing himself from a controversial California
proposition that antagonized minority voters, especially Latinos
who deserted the GOP in large numbers last year. ``We wouldn't have
had a 187 in my state,'' the Texas governor said of Proposition
187, the 1994 ballot measure that outlawed health, welfare and
education for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In his two campaigns for governor, Bush had broad support from
Latino voters _ something California GOP candidates have not
enjoyed recently. Dan Lungren, the Republican candidate for
governor last year, won only 20 percent of California's Latino
voters, about half the support Bush received from Latinos in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, between a breakfast fund-raiser in San Diego and a
lunch fund-raiser in Irvine, Bush tried out his distinctive style
of campaigning at the Del Mar Fair. He jumped on a stage at Plaza
de Mexico while a mariachi band played the classic ``Cielito
Lindo'` for a perfect photo op _ a setting dotted with pinatas and
colorful flags, and flanked by girls in jewel-colored Mexican
dresses and boys in giant velvet sombreros.
</P>
<P>
   And he briefly addressed the crowd in Spanish, although his
words were not as grammatically correct as those used by Democrat
Al Gore in his visit to California last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Es un gran honor para mi, de estar contigo,'' he said, with a
heavy accent. ``It's a great honor for me to be with you.``
</P>
<P>
   He then promised his campaign would leave no one behind, because
``no puedes leer, no puedes realizar los suenos Americanos'' _ ``If
you can't read, you can't realize the American dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   But although Bush's appearance piqued the curiosity of many
Latinos, he also left many skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez, who works for a property management firm, and
his wife, Marilu, surrounded by their six children, said they were
unconvinced. ``He didn't say much,'' Hernandez said. ``We all want
a better future for our kids, but he's going to have to visit us
more often.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Hernandez said he was a Republican, he said he still
wasn't sure that the GOP could be trusted because of issues like
Proposition 187. ``You give him the vote, and then, olvidalo _
forget it,'' Hernandez said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Another in the crowd, Jesus Garcia, a fair employee from San
Diego, who was sitting with his two teenage boys, said, ``I've
heard he's going to help us. He's promising a lot. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush spoke briefly at the fair, he gave longer speeches to
his donors. He raised $480,000 at breakfast, $400,000 at lunch and
$2.3 million last night at a dinner in Los Angeles. He expects to
raise $1 million more Wednesday and $450,000 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the strength of the Bush tidal wave was
evident among loyal Republicans and a few curious Democrats, even
eight months before the primary and with a packed field of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no turning back,'` Bush told the Irvine crowd of 400.
``I not only intend to win the primary, I intend to win California
in the general election, and I intend to become the next president
of the United states.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want our great nation to be prosperous, but prosperity must
have a purpose _ to make sure the American dream touches every
willing heart,'' said Bush, who made a fortune in the oil
exploration business and then as an owner of the Texas Rangers
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The mood for the California tour was set in tony La Jolla, where
nearly 500 big-money donors turned out for a $1,000-a-head
breakfast of fruit salad and yogurt with Bush at the Hyatt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipation was palpable as Bush entered the room to a
standing ovation, then hopped from table to table, delivering bear
hugs, pumping hands, posing for photos and grinning in response to
words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speeches to supporters contained few policy specifics but
instead painted a broad _ and often eloquent _ picture of
``prosperity with a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed an era of responsibility, educational reform and
``positive'' values in the White House, while promising ``to match
a conservative mind with a compassionate heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear dig at Vice President Gore, the Democratic
front-runner who once took credit for creating the Internet and has
pledged to ``keep the prosperity going,'' Bush said that Democrats
``no more invented prosperity than they invented the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of government is to create an environment in which
entrepreneurship can flourish,'' he said. ``We can be prosperous if
we can reduce the taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also promised to reach out to ``struggling families who
live on the outskirts of poverty'' and urged greater support for
churches in the fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government can hand out money, but what it cannot do is put
hope in our hearts,'' he said. ``This is done in churches and
synagogues and mosques, and charities that warm the cold of
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush mentioned foreign policy concerns only in general terms.
``This is still a world of terror and missiles and madmen, and we
are plagued by aging weapons and failing intelligence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``America must seize the moment,'' he added. ``We must lead.
Because our greatest export to the world is and always has been
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He received his strongest applause with his appeal to voters who
have grown tired of scandals in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be a president who sets a tone, an agenda,'` he said to
cheers. ``I will not use my office as a mirror to reflect public
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will make appearances in Los Angeles and Sacramento
Wednesday before attending a fund-raiser Wednesday night in San
Francisco. Thursday, he will be in Silicon Valley and Fresno.

HOW POPULATION POLICIES HAVE AIDED WORLD'S WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By RAMON G. MCLEOD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  The 1994 Cairo population conference called for a radical shift
in the international strategy for slowing the world's population
growth: Instead of focusing on birth control, improve the lot of
women and they will have fewer children.
<P>
   That strategy seems to be taking hold and will be at the center
of discussions Wednesday when the United Nations begins a three-day
special session to assess and update the Cairo accords.
</P>
<P>
   Birth control is still a large part of population reduction
strategies, particularly in the poorest of poor nations, but the
main emphasis at the conference will be on progress toward gender
equality, not birth control distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Cairo, the approach to family planning was a fairly
narrow concept. You tried to provide people with information about
having fewer children, make condoms and birth control pills
available, have population targets and so on,'' said Carl Haub, a
demographer at the Population Reference Bureau, a Washington, D.C.,
demographics think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was fine 25 years ago, particularly since so many
countries then had nothing at all; most of the developing nations
didn't even have clinics where people could get information,'' he
said. ``But this is a different time and this is a much, much
broader approach, one that goes right to the core of culture,
family life and the relations between men and women,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic reductions in world population growth were never
expected in the first five years after Cairo. Nevertheless, there
has been a modest decline in the rate of growth, though some of the
momentum for a slowdown predated the conference.
</P>
<P>
   There will still be 6 billion people on Earth by October and
world population is growing 1.33 percent annually, but that is down
from 1.46 percent in 1995. Demographers are beginning to predict
ever-slower growth.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the most likely scenarios show that there will be 8.9
billion people in the world by 2050. That is well below U.N.
estimates of 9.5 billion made in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth rates have come down, but no one should be complacent.
Ten billion people will still be living in the world in a few
decades and that is an extraordinary number,'' said Abubakar
Dungus, a spokesman for the United Nations population division.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in population strategy that was codified at Cairo was
born out of hard evidence from countries like Korea and Italy that
improvements in women's health, education, social status and
political power were typically accompanied by lower birthrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have now is an approach that starts with individual
women and recognizes that when women have real choices and
resources to make decisions about their lives and the lives of
their children, they will have fewer children,'' said Amy Coen,
president of Population Action International, a Washington, D.C.,
population research organization.
</P>
<P>
   Coen noted that when families have the confidence that their
children will survive, they tend to have fewer of them. She also
noted that in numerous surveys and studies of women in high
fertility countries show that women understand that fewer children
means a better life for them and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Gender equality was a major goal of the Cairo accords and since
then, 76 countries have reported taking significant measures on
gender policy and law, according to a United Nations survey.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.N. survey found that 54 countries have reported
new components and significant measures to improve reproductive
health. The most common of those, added to reproductive health
programs since Cairo, was the prevention and treatment of sexually
transmitted diseases, including AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointment of the post-Cairo era, and one sure
to be discussed in the U.N. sessions this week, has been the
failure of the developed nations to live up to the financial
promises that were made in Egypt five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, for example, needs to triple its current
funding from $600 million this year to $1.9 billion to meet its
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been battling with the Clinton administration since
1995 over population funding and, led by conservatives fearful that
U.S. money will be used for abortions, has cut population funding
by 30 percent during that time.  &LR;

CANSECO HAS STAR POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- You never know with Jose Canseco, who tends to
overlook the details. It still amuses Red Sox people, for example,
that when he played here, he used to refer to former Sox bullpen
coach Herm Starrette as ``Norm.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Canseco, speaking from Florida as a card-carrying
member of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, really didn't know Monday
afternoon that he was a runaway leader in the voting to be
designated hitter for the American League All-Stars July 13 in
Boston. And that another former Sox player, Wilfredo Cordero of the
Indians, was second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made the team yet,'' Canseco said. ``There's still
two weeks of voting left. And (ital) Wil Cordero (endital) is
second? What about Frank Thomas? Or Edgar Martinez?''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the voting ended Sunday. And while Canseco could
have rattled off any number of names that he thought warranted
inclusion on the team, he still wouldn't have come up with anybody
in the American League with slugging credentials better than the
ones he brings to Boston for a two-game set with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   And of the Three Amigos -- Roger Clemens, Mo Vaughn and Canseco
-- what were the odds that Canseco, who one day will be known as
the only member of the 500-home run club to play for five teams in
six seasons -- is the only one assured of a place among the
All-Stars?
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre, who will manage the AL Stars, has
said he's leaning toward taking Clemens, while Vaughn's triumphant
arrival in Anaheim is resembling an exile to Elba.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco, known in these parts as the Man Traded Straight-Up for
John Wasdin, is on pace for a Ruthian 60 home runs with the Devil
Rays, having hit 28 home runs in the team's first 76 games. He is
averaging a home run every 10 at-bats, a rate better than Sosa,
McGwire or Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   He is tied with Nomar Garciaparra and Shawn Green of the Blue
Jays for the most extra-base hits (42), and only recently was
overtaken by Griffey (.650) and Garciaparra (.642) in slugging
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he's cooled off drastically -- he's batting just .125
(5 for 40) in his last 10 games, striking out in exactly half (20)
of his 40 at-bats in that span. In a three-game set against the
Yankees, all Tampa Bay losses, he went hitless in 12 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did that happen?'' he asked, repeating a question. ``I was
facing Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte when he was on, and El Duque
(Orlando Hernandez). One, two, three.
</P>
<P>
   But now, two days before his 35th birthday, he's about to face
the Red Sox, the team against which he has hit more home runs (39)
than any other team in baseball, including three hit earlier this
season.
</P>
<P>
   And he won't be facing Pedro Martinez, whose next start isn't
scheduled until Friday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God,'' Canseco said. ``Is he the best in the game right
now? No doubt. He's just incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has such command of the strike zone. The most important
thing is the unbelievable movement on his fastball. It moves four
or five inches. A guy throws 95 miles an hour, with that movement,
that's indescribable. And his changeup probably moves even more. He
can throw any pitch any time he wants. It's a struggle just to get
a hit off him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I'm looking forward to going to Boston,'' he said.
``I've got a lot of fans in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really? While Canseco doesn't hear the type of vicious
catcalls still directed at Cordero, from the moment he steps on the
field here, he is the target of the kind of booing that marks him
as a villain in the WWF vein.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of treatment you'd expect for a guy with biceps
built to comic-book dimensions, has had fly balls go ``Boink'' off
his coconut and over the fence, and says things like, ``If I played
defense all the time, I'd have 500 home runs and 600 errors,''
which is what he said upon his return to Oakland earlier this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've always given them their money's worth,'' he said.
``I've always considered myself an entertainer. Fans pay good money
to be entertained. They want to be entertained, they want to see
characters. In that sense, I guess I've always done the job for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though he hit 46 home runs last season for the Toronto
Blue Jays -- No. 40 came last Sept. 6 off Pete Schourek of the Sox
-- no one really expected Canseco to assume his latest role, as
newest challenger to the exalted home run levels established by
Mark McGwire, his former Bash Brother in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco had been emphatic, earlier in the season, in saying that
no one any time soon would hit 70 again, unless it was McGwire
himself. And yet here he is, a week and a half before the All-Star
break, with an outside chance of being nearly halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even close,'' Canseco says when asked if he'll mount an
assault on 70. ``It's way too early to tell. For any kind of
chance, I'd have to keep up that same kind of pace after the
All-Star break. I always have had trouble staying healthy. To hit
70, too many things have to go right.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco is playing for a team in his home state of Florida for
the first time in his career. And while he's happy to be living in
St. Petersburg Beach, just a 10-minute ride from the ballpark, and
is just a three-hour ride from his family in Miami, the Tropicana
Dome hasn't exactly been kind to him. Of his 28 home runs so far,
only nine have come at home. Then there's the ball he hit into a
catwalk in the Dome that never came down and was ruled a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that the highest ball I've ever hit?'' he asked. ``I don't
know, how can you measure it? But it's right up there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the decade, Canseco used to routinely lead
everybody in the All-Star voting, the Griffey of his time. But
while he is a five-time All-Star, this will be his first trip back
in nearly a decade. His election kicks in a $50,000 bonus in his
contract, an incentive-laden $2 million deal that automatically
vests for next season at $3 million, plus incentives, if he reaches
500 plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   What he'd really like, he said, is an invitation to the home run
hitting contest the night before the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been in one in a long time,'' he said. ``It's going
to be really exciting for the fans. I can't remember where my last
one was, it's been so long, but I don't think I got the ball out of
the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whoever wins, because of the Wall, will be whoever
hits the most fly balls. On a certain day, any of six guys could
win it. Six different days, six different guys would win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have to be the biggest, strongest power hitter.
Griffey? Yeah, he'll be at a disadvantage, hitting lefthanded,
because it's longer to right field, but I'll guarantee you, there
are going to be a lot of long shots.''
</P>
<P>
   And almost certainly, some of them will be hit by Canseco, a
longshot in itself.

   Silicon Valley gained its biggest political victory ever
Tuesday, when Congress and the White House agreed on a law to limit
future lawsuits caused by year 2000 computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking protection from a potential $1 trillion onslaught of
lawsuits if computers malfunction because they can't recognize
years after 1999, high-tech powerhouses like Intel, Microsoft and
Sun had made passage of the bill their top legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he would sign the compromise bill, which
could be approved by the Congress and sent to him before the long
July 4 weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would delay the filing of Y2K lawsuits for up to
90 days, giving companies time to fix any problems. It would also
make it harder for consumers to bring and win Y2K lawsuits, and
would limit punitive damages in certain cases.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy the White House, which had threatened to veto earlier
versions of the bill, lawmakers agreed to changes that would make
it easier to pursue some class-action lawsuits and would increase
the damages that could be assessed against companies that act in
bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major statement that the Silicon Valley and the
high-tech community have a very, very positive impact on the
political debate,'` said Harris Miller, president of the industry
trade group Information Technology Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups remain adamantly opposed to the legislation,
saying it sacrifices consumers' legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a compromise, it's a complete surrender to the money
interests of the computer industry at the expense of millions of
consumers and small businesses,'' said consumer advocate Ralph
Nader.
</P>
<P>
   His colleague James Love, director of the Consumer Project on
Technology, was more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sucks; it's a total cave-in; it's terrible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which had previously passed the House and
Senate in slightly different versions, had become a political
football. High-tech firms, business groups and most Republican
legislators sought strong protection against Y2K lawsuits, saying
they could threaten the U.S. economy. But consumer advocates,
plaintiffs' lawyers and many Democrats, including President Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore, argued that the bill went too far to
protect big business.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders, along with chief lobbyists from the
opposing business, consumer and trial lawyer associations, met all
day Monday and Tuesday to fashion a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators met until about midnight Monday. Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., who acted as liaison between congressional
Republicans and the White House, was on the phone with Clinton
again at 1:30 a.m. going over more details.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise fell into place during the last 16 hours of talks
when both sides moved on the two stickiest provisions, said Marc
Pearl, general counsel and chief lobbyist for the ITAA.
</P>
<P>
   One issue was how liability would be allocated in cases with
multiple defendants. ``Deep-pocket'' firms like Intel and Microsoft
were worried about being forced to pay huge amounts of damages
beyond their share of responsibility for a problem, in cases where
co-defendants were unable to pay their shares.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise limits a company's penalty in joint cases to
twice the damages it caused if it acted in good faith. But if a
company acted in bad faith, it could be forced to pay triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients have been very concerned about the `deep-pockets'
problem,'' said Matthew Kreeger, attorney at Morrison and Foerster
in San Francisco, which represents both major hardware and software
companies and smaller startups. ``I think our clients will be very
satisfied with this compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The other issue concerned class-action lawsuits. The compromise
would allow defendants in class-action lawsuits seeking $10 million
or more in damages to shift the cases to federal court. The
previous House and Senate bills set that amount as low as $1
million. Business groups sought the limit to deter frivolous
class-action suits from being ``shopped around''' to find the
friendliest state court.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gore urged Clinton to veto the bill unless it offered
more consumer protection. Gore's stance unleashed a firestorm of
criticism in Silicon Valley even as the vice president was courting
the tech industry in his bid for the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, a spokeswoman for Gore said the vice president
wasn't quite ready to endorse the compromise bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're reviewing the final language as we speak,'' said
spokeswoman Melissa Ratcliff. ``The vice president has always
believed in a compromise that would balance all interests. It
appears that progress has been made, but until the final language
has been reviewed closely, the VP is going to reserve judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley lobbyists and corporations hailed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased that a compromise has been reached,'' said
Roberta Katz, president of the Technology Network of Palo Alto, a
political lobbying group formed by 140 top Silicon Valley firms.
``This issue was an important one, not just for the high-tech
industry, but for the country at large.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This really was a meaningful compromise,'' said Intel Corp.
spokesman Bill Calder. ``This was clearly one of the most
significant legislative items for the technology community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This compromise is good for both consumers and industry,''
said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Atherton. ``Fair and effective Y2K
legislation must provide some limits on Y2K suits while providing
redress for real damages. This bill does that, and I'm urging my
colleagues to support it.''

   FAIRFAX, Va. _ America's ultimate soccer mom is just getting off
work. ``Here,'' Joy Fawcett says, unwrapping her aching calf and
handing her 2-year-old daughter, Carli, a melting ice bag. ``Want
to water the grass?''
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett's 5-year-old daughter, Katey, is wandering around the
practice field at George Mason University, checking in with Aunt
Carla and Aunt Christie and Aunt Shannon. Just another sweaty day
at the office for their mother, who just happens to be the world's
best defender on the world's best women's soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett has been wearing a US jersey for a dozen years. She is
31, has a degree from Cal-Berkeley, has an Olympic gold medal, is
playing in her third World Cup, and is raising two kids. Mia Hamm
may be the role model for every 12-year-old female booter in the
land, but Fawcett is the role model for their moms, who get
exhausted just shuttling the Shocking Pinks back and forth to
matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, I can't believe you do this,'' they tell the Ultimate
Mom. ``How can you run all day and chase after these kids? I don't
know how you have the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is the easy time. Fawcett's husband, Walter, and
her parents have been in charge of amusing the girls while she's
been knocking around an assortment of Danish, Nigerian, and Korean
forwards.
</P>
<P>
   The challenging time was when Fawcett had her daughters with her
during the team's lengthy training camp in Orlando this winter. Or
two years ago, when Fawcett was playing for the national team,
coaching both the UCLA varsity and a youth club team, and juggling
a toddler and an infant.
</P>
<P>
   This time, for three weeks, all Fawcett has to do is play while
her family watches from the stands. Next year, when the team is
preparing for an Olympics halfway around the world, things will be
back to ``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Normal is lugging her daughters to Portugal. Normal is two-a-day
practices while a nanny minds the girls and Carla Overbeck's
2-year-old son, Jackson. Normal is Walter, who works for a small
California high-tech firm, flying in once or twice a month for
family time. Normal is nightly phone calls with the cellular being
passed around. Normal is checking out road towns for kiddie
amusements. ``We take them out to the parks and the pools,''
Fawcett says. ``We hit the malls. And I pack a lot of toys.''
</P>
<P>
   When the diversions wear thin, there are 19 surrogate aunts down
the hall who are happy to play a game of cards, read a book, or
discuss the intricacies of the 3-5-2 offense.
</P>
<P>
   Carli is vaguely aware of what her mother does for a living.
``You're going to kick a ball?'' she asks her mother. ``OK, as long
as you come back.'' Katey knows everyone by name and number. ``One
game, she was telling our nanny, `I think my Mom's benched today,'
'' Fawcett says.
</P>
<P>
   Slim chance of that. Fawcett has started 140 of the 144 matches
she's played since she joined the team as a Cal sophomore. She was
back training a week after giving birth the first time _ and
nursing in the locker room between halves. Fawcett, her teammates
testify, is a workhorse who never seems to run down.
</P>
<P>
   After Fawcett took a year off following the 1996 Olympics to
have her second child, she came back and played more minutes than
anybody else on the team. There was no question that she would
stick around for a third World Cup this summer. And Fawcett is
planning on taking a second run at Olympus next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The love of the game,'' Fawcett muses. ``If I didn't love to
compete and be a part of this team, I wouldn't do it. And if there
was ever a time when I thought I was hurting my family or my
relationship with my husband, I wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the absences and distances haven't been stressful,
particularly this year. ``My husband is very open about his
feelings, about missing us, hating for us to be away for so long,''
Fawcett says. ``But he also understands that this isn't forever.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times, she concedes, when a straight 9-to-5 job looks
damned attractive. ``Just go in there and be out,'' Fawcett says.
``It'd be nice just to be a mom for a while. And it'd definitely be
more simple.''
</P>
<P>
   But the World Cup comes once a quadrennium, and by the time it
comes back to the States, Mama Joy will have hung up the cleats.
This is the time for ice bags and nannies, for cell phones and
playing in front of 78,000 people in Giants Stadium with ABC's
cameras rolling. And for serving as a role model to soccer moms
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three kids, and I said I couldn't play soccer,'' a
thirtysomething mother was telling Joy Fawcett Tuesday afternoon.
``Now I don't have an excuse anymore.''

AFTER 2-YEAR BATTLE, NATION'S FIRST OPENLY GAY AMBASSADOR IS 
 SWORN IN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ San Francisco philanthropist James Hormel was sworn
in Tuesday as the first openly gay U.S. ambassador, culminating a
nearly two-year Senate confirmation battle that elevated his
nomination to an obscure Luxembourg posting to a high-profile fight
over gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   A small contingent of religious conservatives, who led the fight
to block Hormel's nomination, held one last press conference
outside the State Department, calling the heir to the Hormel
meat-packing fortune a ``homosexual poster boy'' who is unfit to be
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a crowd of some 200 friends, relatives, supporters, gay
activists and officials _ including Hormel's partner, Tim Wu, his
former wife, Alice, and her husband, Jim Turner _ gathered for a
champagne reception in the gilded and marbled Benjamin Franklin
Room overlooking the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we send a message that neither race nor creed nor
gender nor sexual orientation should be relevant to the selection
of ambassadors for the United States,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright declared after administering the oath of office
to Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those glorious days when the nice guy finishes
first,'' she added, to a roaring cheer.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusually large and celebratory swearing-in, attended
by a large press contingent and dozens of supporters who flew in
from San Francisco. Most ambassadorial oath-taking passes with
little notice, the press is seldom admitted and the secretary of
state rarely presides.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel thanked the Clinton administration and his congressional
supporters for refusing to back down from his nomination. ``What an
incredible privilege it is to be standing before you today,''
Hormel, who remained largely silent during the controversy, told
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Paying frequent tribute to his family, Hormel noted that the
Bible used for his oath was inscribed by his father in 1901, and
that one of his daughters wore her grandmother's dress for the
swearing-in.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Luxembourg as a steadfast U.S. ally ``where thousands
of Americans lost their lives'' liberating the tiny European
principality in 1944 and 1945. Hormel noted that General George
Patton was buried there.
</P>
<P>
   Referring several times to ``the challenging times'' of his
confirmation fight, Hormel expressed gratitude for the support he
said he received from all parts of the country, saying his favorite
was a letter from a 93-year-old grandmother who wrote: ``I have
prayed to live to see this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Edward
Kennedy of Massachusetts, who tried unsuccessfully to push Hormel's
nomination to a Senate vote, lauded Hormel as a highly qualified
appointee who was opposed only because he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Jim's appointment, we open a door,'' Feinstein said, ``that
this country is prepared once and for all to put aside bigotry and
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nominated by President Clinton in October 1997, Hormel was never
confirmed by the Senate. Applying a long-standing Senate
prerogative, three conservative Republicans _ James Inhofe of
Oklahoma, Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and presidential candidate Bob
Smith of New Hampshire _ put a ``hold'' on his nomination to
prevent a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said Tuesday that she had rounded up 61 votes to break
the holds and confirm Hormel, but Majority Leader Trent Lott
refused to schedule a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any honorable question about his (Hormel's)
qualifications to be ambassador,'' Kennedy said, calling opposition
to the nomination ``irresponsible and unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton finally made the appointment during the Senate's
Memorial Day recess, taking advantage of a constitutional provision
that allows presidents to install nominees when the Senate is not
in session.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Susan Leal, who joined dozens of other
local supporters at the reception, flew in on the red-eye to
attend. ``I wouldn't have missed this for the world,'' Leal said.
``He's been through an incredible ordeal. He is a person who has
served his community in San Francisco and who wants to serve his
country and is qualified to do so, and the only reason he was
stopped is because he is gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe had made one last-ditch effort several weeks ago to
protest the appointment, threatening to hold up all pending Clinton
nominees, including Larry Summers as Treasury Secretary, unless
Clinton promised not to make any more recess appointments without
first notifying the Senate. Clinton agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old Hormel served as a former assistant dean of the
University of Chicago law school and delegate to the U.N. Human
Rights Commission. He is a prominent San Francisco philanthropist
who sits on the boards of the symphony and the Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been a generous contributor to Democratic candidates
and gay causes, helping to found the Human Rights Campaign, the
nation's largest gay advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly the entire Washington office of the Human Rights Campaign
attended the reception. Executive Director Elizabeth Birch called
Hormel's swearing-in ``tremendously historic because a very
important barrier was removed'' to high-level government
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives warned that Hormel would use his
ambassadorship to Luxembourg, a grand duchy with a population that
is barely half of San Francisco's, to promote a ``gay agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the Traditional
Values Coalition, opponents focused their objections on Hormel's
sponsorship of a section in the San Francisco Public Library that
is devoted to gay literature. Hormel's critics held him accountable
for the section's selection of sexually explicit material,
including references to pedophilia, although he was not involved in
the selection of the content.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon said Hormel steadfastly ``refused to denounce pedophilia
and incest and we are still outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's press conference, Sheldon displayed pictures of the
Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a group of transvestites from San
Francisco who dress as nuns. ``These are people who mock Christians
and engage in outrageous anti-Christian bigotry,'' Sheldon said.
``Mr. Hormel seems to think they're appropriate and funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon accused gay activists of using Hormel as a ``homosexual
poster boy to say, `Please accept us.' We say you can dress James
Hormel up in high-society acceptance, but he promotes standards
that are not acceptable'' to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said that Sheldon ``should find an opportunity at some
point to celebrate fairness and nondiscrimination and lift herself
out of bigotry.''

   ``Test''
</P>
<P>
   Test. Aum Fidelity. 5 tracks. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this volatile New York quartet rip and roar, a listener
might be reminded of the old gospel song that warns of ``the fire
next time.'' Test, a guerrilla musical collective that has honed
its extraordinary dynamic range by gigging for spare change in
Manhattan's subways, rises to the apocalyptic occasion on its debut
disc. Recorded live and on the cheap in a Brooklyn loft, this
hour-long performance is thrillingly explosive, yet also defies the
truism that free jazz is a lot of unstructured noise.
</P>
<P>
   Almost criminally unknown and underrated, multi-reedists Daniel
Carter and Sabir Mateen could be urban legends on leave from a
Thomas Pynchon subplot. Such colorful fantasy shatters, though,
when they begin to act as twin lightning rods, surging with
sometimes convulsive bursts of raw energy. In the tradition of
1960s jazz giant Eric Dolphy, Carter and Mateen also have a keen
sense of lyrical and harmonic balance. It's what allows their
contrasting lines to flow with the organic logic of a spiraling
double helix. Bassist Matt Heyner and drummer Tom Bruno sustain the
flexible pulse that underwrites the concept's inherent risks. And
any group that dares both a flute duet (``Alen's Flight
Preparation'') and a boisterous call-and-response sermon (``What R
U Going To Due?'') is taking risks. Test pulls it off: This is one
of the best albums of the year.

``Chante's Got a Man.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chante has more than that. Three albums into her career, her
soprano is still a wonderful, spiraling instrument. Unfortunately,
it plummets to the redundant depths of the opening track ``If I
Gave Love.'' Which is _ what? _ producer Rodney Jerkins' third or
fourth reworking of his first No. 1 hit, Brandy and Monica's ``The
Boy Is Mine.'' Things pick up when Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis apply
a formula that works on ``Easy,'' a ballad reminiscent of such
patented Jam &AMP; Lewis heavy-breathers as Janet Jackson's ``Funny How
Time Flies.'' After that, it's all cooing, candlelight, and only
occasionally, something meaningful.

 &HT;    All-stars pay homage to Gram Parsons' genius
 &HT;    By Eileen M. Drennen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gram Parsons came of age among the swampy mysteries of
Waycross and left this world in a crematory bonfire in the desert
near Joshua Tree National Monument, fitting bookends for the
subversive country sound he forged between 1968 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   This collection, which pairs a disc of all-star covers with a
second disc of the originals, is a neatly devised appreciation of
what Parsons called his ``cosmic American music,'' a marriage of
Appalachian and blues, gospel and honky-tonk, pop and soul that
gave birth to country rock. Though he played briefly with the Byrds
and co-founded the Flying Burrito Brothers in the late '60s, he's
most revered for ``GP'' and ``Grievous Angel,'' the early '70s
albums he made on his own, before overdosing on morphine and
tequila at the age of 26.
</P>
<P>
   Co-producer Emmylou Harris, his most simpatico harmonizer,
partner and keeper of the flame, adds her vocals in duets (with
Beck on ``Sin City'' and Sheryl Crow on ``Juanita'') and backup
harmony and pairs his lovely but lonely songs with the right
singers. Hear how Cowboy Junkies vocalist Margo Timmins slows down
Parsons' sparkly ``Ooh Las Vegas,'' turning his exuberant ode to
the crystal city into an echoey vapor trail, thick with '90s
weariness.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks don't alter the heartsick lament ``Hot Burrito 1''
much in terms of arrangement, but there's a strength in Raul Malo's
voice that makes it completely different from Parson's nakedly
needy original. Rustic country angel Gillian Welch is just the
ticket for the high lonesome mountain sound of ``Hickory Wind,''
and Elvis Costello's trembly croon turns the lights way down low on
the achy ``Sleepless Nights.''

 &HT;    Pretenders still swagger like punks
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To borrow a plot line from ``Austin Powers,'' the Pretenders
lost their mojo right around 1986, the year they released the album
``Get Close.'' Band leader Chrissie Hynde and her cohorts had
always been fans of the pop hook _ ``Brass in Pocket'' and ``Back
on the Chain Gang'' are paragons of radio-friendly songcrafting _
but they balanced the hummable hits with an aggressive edge.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Get Close'' sounded disturbingly toothless, and on
subsequent releases, Hynde has relied all too often on easy,
eager-to-please melodies. (The icky 1994 power ballad ``I'll Stand
By You'' had to be a career low point.)
</P>
<P>
   On ``Viva El Amor!'' the band displays some of its old swagger.
Much of the album has a loose, raw feel, and Hynde's lyrics are
wonderfully sassy: ``Bail me, jail me but they're never gonna nail
me _ pharmaceutically,'' she sneers on the pro-pot rocker
``Legalise Me.'' On the leadoff track, ``Pop Star,'' Hynde laments
``they don't make 'em like they used to.'' But the Pretenders have
done just that.

 &HT;    `Paths of Glory' marked the road ahead of Kubrick
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``The Thin Red Line'' and ``Saving Private Ryan'' in
stores, video renters have a choice between two powerful anti-war
films. But there's another one worth a look, re-released this week
on VHS and DVD along with other films celebrating the work of the
late director Stanley Kubrick. (His final film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
opens July 16.)
</P>
<P>
   His 1957 drama, ``Paths of Glory,'' not only put him on the map
as a filmmaker, it established some of his signature directorial
touches: the restless tracking shots, following characters through
dirty trenches or glistening marble corridors; the close-up of
faces racked with emotion. And for all its cumulative power,
``Paths'' maintains a precision and chilliness that marked the rest
of Kubrick's films.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Douglas plays Col. Dax, a French criminal lawyer turned
officer in World War I, who gets the order from Gen. Mireau (George
Macready, in an overripe, villainous performance) to lead his men
on a suicidal charge against a German stronghold called the
Anthill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthill'' is a perfect, ironic name for the target, since the
movie demonstrates how easily lower members of the military
hierarchy get stomped, like bugs. When the offensive against the
Germans fails, Mireau and his colleague Gen. Broulard (Adolphe
Menjou) demand that an example be set. Three men are selected,
supposedly at random, to be tried for cowardice. In the words of
Broulard, ``There are few things more fundamentally encouraging and
stimulating than seeing someone else die.''
</P>
<P>
   Dax volunteers to defend the trio before the tribunal. More
travesty than trial, the procedure allows no character witnesses,
and mention of the soldiers' past honors and efforts are
inadmissible. It's such an obvious railroad job, Dax says, ``There
are times when I'm ashamed to be a member of the human race, and
this is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick delights in contrasting the foxhole realities of the
fighting stiffs with the pampered, oblivious world of their
commanding officers. Most of the movie unfolds in and around a
chateau. The mansion, whose every arch and ornament seems built as
a tribute to man's alleged enlightenment, serves as counterpoint to
the film's depiction of civilized savagery.
</P>
<P>
   When we first encounter Mireau and Broulard, the generals aren't
discussing strategy but the tastefulness of the carpeting. While
the three condemned soldiers shiver their last night away in a dank
stable, the officers waltz with their wives to an orchestra. As he
butters a bit of pastry, one general happily says, ``The men died
wonderfully.'' Though ``Paths of Glory'' never breaks from
realistic conventions, its critique of the military mind-set
foreshadows Kubrick's wild, Cold War masterpiece, 1964's ``Dr.
Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick caps ``Paths of Glory'' with a coda set in a makeshift
pub: A terrified German girl (Susanne Christiane, who would become
Kubrick's second wife) is forced to sing before jeering French
soldiers. The tense moment turns into a scene of melancholy beauty
as the sound of the girl's voice unlocks the memories and tears of
the tired men. Sentimental, yes, but also moving.
</P>
<P>
   More than four decades after its release ``Paths of Glory''
remains a rigorous and unsettling statement against the strategic
inhumanity that can erupt during wartime, even among supposed
allies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Thin Red Line'' (R) _ Less a war movie than a meditation
on life, death, love, hate, man and nature. Terrence Malick puts
his unmistakable stamp on the drama of an Army division's struggle
to capture Guadalcanal from the Japanese during World War II.
Fueled with voice-overs, gorgeous images and sudden violence, it's
superbly strange, an epic that feels intimate but distant at the
same time. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Still Crazy'' (R) _ A brilliantly acted comedy with poignant
undertones. Twenty years after giving in to factions, jealousies
and divine intervention, a fictional '70s British rock group named
Strange Fruit attempts a reunion tour. The movie is both a
celebration and an elegy, telling us that rock 'n' roll dreams die
hard. The ensemble cast is terrific, with Bill Nighy a standout as
the lead singer. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Hi-Lo Country'' (R) _ Woody Harrelson, Billy Crudup and
Patricia Arquette form a love triangle in this uneven but absorbing
drama set in the fading West in the years after World War II.
Arquette is miscast, but director Stephen Frears (``The Grifters'')
is an expert at building tension that you know just has to erupt.
Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Varsity Blues'' (R) _ James Van Der Beek plays a high school
football player in this insulting mix of beery teen humor and
rampant sexuality. It simultaneously ridicules its small-town
characters while insulting audience intelligence. That's some
accomplishment. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Mighty'' (PG-13) _ Kieran Culkin's mighty mite is just
one plus in this fine family film that is down to earth and magical
at the same time. Culkin is an undersize genius suffering from a
degenerative illness who bonds with a lonely 13-year-old giant
(Elden Henson) with self-esteem problems. The strong supporting
cast includes Sharon Stone, Harry Dean Stanton, Gena Rowlands and
Gillian Anderson. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Outside Ozona'' (R) _ The characters in this story about a
band of strangers driving through the desert at night are as
superficial as the blue eye shadow and pink lipstick that star
Penelope Ann Miller has to wear. The writing never rises above
homespun philosophizing, such as ``Sometimes you're the windshield,
and sometimes you're the bug.'' Watching this, you'll sympathize
with the bug. Grade: C-

 TEXAS GOV. BUSH REACHES OUT TO CALIFORNIA'S LATINOS  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ In his first political foray into California,
George W. Bush raised the hopes Tuesday of Republicans eager to win
back the White House and collected millions of dollars for his
campaign _ but he failed to impress Jose and Marilu Hernandez at
the Del Mar Fair.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited three-day visit of the Texas governor _ the
runaway front-runner in the polls _ generated genuine excitement
among California Republicans, who haven't tasted victory in a
presidential campaign since 1988, when Bush's father, former
President George Bush, carried the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the younger immediately showed himself as a different kind
of Republican by distancing himself from a controversial California
proposition that antagonized minority voters, especially Latinos
who deserted the GOP in large numbers last year. ``We wouldn't have
had a 187 in my state,'' the Texas governor said of Proposition
187, the 1994 ballot measure that outlawed health, welfare and
education for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In his two campaigns for governor, Bush had broad support from
Latino voters _ something California GOP candidates have not
enjoyed recently. Dan Lungren, the Republican candidate for
governor last year, won only 20 percent of California's Latino
voters, about half the support Bush received from Latinos in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, between a breakfast fund-raiser in San Diego and a
lunch fund-raiser in Irvine, Bush tried out his distinctive style
of campaigning at the Del Mar Fair. He jumped on a stage at Plaza
de Mexico while a mariachi band played the classic ``Cielito
Lindo'` for a perfect photo op _ a setting dotted with pinatas and
colorful flags, and flanked by girls in jewel-colored Mexican
dresses and boys in giant velvet sombreros.
</P>
<P>
   And he briefly addressed the crowd in Spanish, although his
words were not as grammatically correct as those used by Democrat
Al Gore in his visit to California last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Es un gran honor para mi, de estar contigo,'' he said, with a
heavy accent. ``It's a great honor for me to be with you.``
</P>
<P>
   He then promised his campaign would leave no one behind, because
``no puedes leer, no puedes realizar los suenos Americanos'' _ ``If
you can't read, you can't realize the American dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   But although Bush's appearance piqued the curiosity of many
Latinos, he also left many skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez, who works for a property management firm, and
his wife, Marilu, surrounded by their six children, said they were
unconvinced. ``He didn't say much,'' Hernandez said. ``We all want
a better future for our kids, but he's going to have to visit us
more often.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Hernandez said he was a Republican, he said he still
wasn't sure that the GOP could be trusted because of issues like
Proposition 187. ``You give him the vote, and then, olvidalo _
forget it,'' Hernandez said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Another in the crowd, Jesus Garcia, a fair employee from San
Diego, who was sitting with his two teenage boys, said, ``I've
heard he's going to help us. He's promising a lot. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush spoke briefly at the fair, he gave longer speeches to
his donors. He raised $480,000 at breakfast, $400,000 at lunch and
$2.3 million last night at a dinner in Los Angeles. He expects to
raise $1 million more Wednesday and $450,000 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the strength of the Bush tidal wave was
evident among loyal Republicans and a few curious Democrats, even
eight months before the primary and with a packed field of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no turning back,'` Bush told the Irvine crowd of 400.
``I not only intend to win the primary, I intend to win California
in the general election, and I intend to become the next president
of the United states.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want our great nation to be prosperous, but prosperity must
have a purpose _ to make sure the American dream touches every
willing heart,'' said Bush, who made a fortune in the oil
exploration business and then as an owner of the Texas Rangers
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The mood for the California tour was set in tony La Jolla, where
nearly 500 big-money donors turned out for a $1,000-a-head
breakfast of fruit salad and yogurt with Bush at the Hyatt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipation was palpable as Bush entered the room to a
standing ovation, then hopped from table to table, delivering bear
hugs, pumping hands, posing for photos and grinning in response to
words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speeches to supporters contained few policy specifics but
instead painted a broad _ and often eloquent _ picture of
``prosperity with a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed an era of responsibility, educational reform and
``positive'' values in the White House, while promising ``to match
a conservative mind with a compassionate heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear dig at Vice President Gore, the Democratic
front-runner who once took credit for creating the Internet and has
pledged to ``keep the prosperity going,'' Bush said that Democrats
``no more invented prosperity than they invented the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of government is to create an environment in which
entrepreneurship can flourish,'' he said. ``We can be prosperous if
we can reduce the taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also promised to reach out to ``struggling families who
live on the outskirts of poverty'' and urged greater support for
churches in the fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government can hand out money, but what it cannot do is put
hope in our hearts,'' he said. ``This is done in churches and
synagogues and mosques, and charities that warm the cold of
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush mentioned foreign policy concerns only in general terms.
``This is still a world of terror and missiles and madmen, and we
are plagued by aging weapons and failing intelligence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``America must seize the moment,'' he added. ``We must lead.
Because our greatest export to the world is and always has been
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He received his strongest applause with his appeal to voters who
have grown tired of scandals in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be a president who sets a tone, an agenda,'` he said to
cheers. ``I will not use my office as a mirror to reflect public
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will make appearances in Los Angeles and Sacramento
Wednesday before attending a fund-raiser Wednesday night in San
Francisco. Thursday, he will be in Silicon Valley and Fresno.

 &HT;    `Rushmore' scales comedic heights
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old scholarship student at Rushmore Academy, Max
Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) devotes himself to every
extracurricular activity offered: martial arts, the debate team,
beekeeping, whatever. He's very proud of his fencing skills. And he
runs the school's theater club, directing a gritty stage version of
``Serpico'' or, better yet, a Vietnam drama complete with live
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   But then his crush on an elementary school teacher (Olivia
Williams) takes precedence over these things. And when middle-aged
tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray, in brilliant sad-sack form) also
falls for Williams, Max declares war.
</P>
<P>
   This wonderfully eccentric comedy is the second film from
director Wes Anderson (``Bottle Rocket''). Unfolding in a parallel
universe removed from the ``reality'' of other high school movies,
it creates its own sort of dream logic, finishing off with the
generous shapeliness of a Shakespearean comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Its vision of romantic fulfillment manages to be both tongue in
cheek and heartfelt. The movie captures the heady solipsism of
being a teenager, the time when anything seems possible, and love
feels like a matter of life and death.

 Kaiser CEO Warns About Drug Errors  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 180,000 hospital patients die each year from errors or
complications arising from the use of prescription drugs, the head
of the nation's largest HMO warned yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   David Lawrence, chief executive of Oakland's Kaiser health plan,
called such deaths ``the number one public health risk in the
United States, ahead of tobacco, alcohol, drugs or guns.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments came yesterday in a speech to biotech industry
executives at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas
Business School.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lawrence, the current death rate from drug errors
in hospitals is the equivalent of two 747 jumbo jets crashing every
three days, and killing all their passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into a hospital, you should be safer than when you
step onto an airplane,'' Lawrence said, adding that, statistically
speaking, the average patient is not.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence said biotech and drug industry executives had to share
the burden for lessening this accident rate. In the past,
drugmakers figured they had done their jobs when they performed
safety tests to win approval for a new drug. Lawrence said they
need to do more to educate physicians in the proper use of drugs,
and to warn them of the possible consequences when several drugs
are taken together.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence made clear in an interview after his speech that it's
mainly up to hospitals and medical professionals to make the
systematic changes that could prevent three-quarters of the
accidental deaths that now occur.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence gave an example of a preventable error. A doctor may
prescribe a 1 percent solution of a drug. A health care worker
mistakenly adds a zero, and overdoses the patient _ and no one
double or triple checks before the wrong dose is administered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most errors are not caused by stupidity, incompetence or
neglect, but by system failures that allow them to occur,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, who plans to repeat his safety warnings in a
forthcoming speech to the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.,
said the health care industry needs to study how airlines improved
safety. He said the key is not the post-crash investigations we
read about, but the fact that pilots and airline workers are
encouraged to report accidents that they narrowly avoid _ without
fear of losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from the near misses that one learns the most,'' Lawrence
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Lawrence elaborated on Kaiser's recent
decision to postpone a plan to close its hospital in Oakland and
transfer its patients to nearby Summit Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lawrence, the delay was meant to give Summit more
time to get ready for Kaiser's patients, and had nothing to do with
an ongoing antitrust investigation of Summit. State and federal
regulators are considering whether Summit's proposal to merge with
the Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley would create an East Bay
hospital monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not changing course,'' Lawrence said. ``We're committed
to going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence also said Kaiser has no plans for further retrenchments
in the wake of its recent decisions to sell money-losing health
plans in North Carolina and the Northeast. Last year Kaiser sold
its operations in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In all three regions, Kaiser had consistently lost money and saw
no way to reverse the trend, Lawrence said. He added that Kaiser is
``doing well'' in its remaining operations in Ohio, Colorado,
California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Atlanta and metropolitan
Washington.

WILD WILD WEST 
Directed by: Barry Sonnenfeld 
Screenplay by: S.S. Wilson &AMP; Brent Maddock, Jeffrey Price &AMP; Peter
S.Seaman 
Starring: Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Salma Hayek,
Ted Levine, Bai Ling, M. Emmet Walsh 
Running time: 107 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (action violence, sex references and innuendo) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The strongest recurring image in ``Wild Wild West'' is a huge
clanky iron tarantula picking its way across the Utah desert on
delicately pointed steel girder legs, en route to bringing down the
government of Ulysses S. Grant, resonating in ways you wish the
rest of the movie did. There are several things that turn ``Wild
West West'' into a surprisingly watchable comic strip, including
shipshape performances by Kevin Kline and Will Smith, but nothing
that matches the vibe quotient of its primary piece of heavy metal.
</P>
<P>
   It's a 19th-century cartoon equivalent of the imperial walkers
of ``The Empire Strikes Back.'' It also taps shrewdly into
America's boundlessly utopian view of technology. The gusto in the
film's steam-powered contraptions foreshadows the 20th century's
faith in electricity and, now, computers. Devise the right machine,
extend frail human limbs with it, and the world is yours, or can
be. It's a view that neatly underpins Kenneth Branagh's bad guy, a
leeringly maniacal Confederate general who means to reverse the
Civil War. Even though the lower part of his body was blown away in
a bomb blast, his top half scoots around on a little steam-powered
platform. Assisted by a trio of buxom henchwomen, he does nasty
things in a big way _ which includes his amusingly over-the-top
Southern accent.
</P>
<P>
   Kline's equally resourceful inventor, who also happens to be a
US marshal, is the good wizard. Like Branagh, he's forever pulling
levers and pushing buttons that open trap doors and otherwise stand
the world on its head, thanks to his ingenious and resourceful
tinkering. He has outfitted a train with gadgets and whizbangs that
James Bond would have loved, but that Will Smith, his reluctant
partner, hates, unless they do things like popping concealed guns
into his hands. You will by now have guessed that this is yet
another reluctant buddy movie, with Smith as the man of action.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, after all, is as close a guarantee as movies can get of
money in the bank after ``Independence Day'' and ``Men in Black.''
This film hasn't the pizazz of the latter or the scale of the
former, but it's cleverer and speedier than you think it's going to
be, given its period and its hardware. What he's given here is a
blueprint more than a role, a stereotype more than a character.
Nevertheless, he fills it with take-charge panache. Kline, one of
film's most reliable and most underrated actors, as usual fills his
role with crisp moves and the kind of keen-edged profiling his
classical training makes delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Salma Hayek, as the distressed beauty both chase, is largely
wasted, but brings flashes of vitality to the few moments in which
she's able to outrun the cliches that tie her hands as no manacles
of Branagh's evil lunatic can. There's little in ``Wild Wild West''
that's likely to be mistaken for content. It's flapdoodle, pure and
simple. But it's flapdoodle that's more smartly paced and easier to
take than the trailer had led me to expect, even if the lumbering
assemblage of girders, gears, boilers, and scrap metal at its heart
seems a perfect metaphor for the current antithesis of light
entertainment known as the summer movie.

 AtHome Speed Cap Angers Subscribers  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
ExciteAtHome, the Redwood City company that sells high-speed
Internet access over cable TV lines, has been quietly imposing
limits on how fast customers can send data over the Internet.
<P>
   The company, which advertises speeds up to 100 times faster than
a traditional modem, has begun imposing an ``upstream cap'' that
affects the speed with which e-mail or files can be sent from a
user's computer.
</P>
<P>
   The limit is part of an ExciteAtHome internal strategy called
ONadvantage, which caps ``upstream data'' at 128 kilobits per
second. That's still more than twice as fast as 56.6K dial-up
modem, but significantly slower than the 225 Kbps to
1-megabit-per-second speeds AtHome users pay for. For instance, a
1-megabyte file _ such as a 30-slide PowerPoint presentation _
would take four to eight seconds to transmit at speeds of 1
megabit. At 128 Kbps, that same file would take about 62.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Rosenberg, vice president of marketing for
ExciteAtHome, said the cap was implemented to stop a small number
of customers who were hogging bandwidth and making it harder for
other customers to get fast Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The cap, which was discovered when an internal AtHome memo was
leaked to an AtHome Internet users group, has sparked an outcry
from subscribers who say they feel cheated out of the
lightning-fast speeds that AtHome promises. The memo also shows
that AtHome instructed its customer service representatives to
avoid telling customers about the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair that they sold me something and now
they're going to take it away,'' said Martin Blackstone, an AtHome
subscriber in Orange County's Tustin Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   An upstream cap of 128 Kbps was instituted in Fremont last
December after bottleneck problems, but the cap now is going to be
rolled out to all AtHome communities across the country, according
to the memo.
</P>
<P>
   Download speeds _ which affect how fast customers can access Web
sites and receive information from the Internet _ are not affected
by the cap.
</P>
<P>
   According to the memo, ONadvantage _ which stands for Optimized
Network Advantage _ was instituted to help ensure the speed of the
overall AtHome network.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome said it is trying to protect subscribers against
``certain customers'' who are ``abusing the network'' by running
servers out of their homes, thus hogging bandwidth. By operating a
server, a customer could host Web sites, something AtHome's
subscriber policy forbids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer than 1 percent of our customers do things that are
precluded by our Acceptable Use Policy, like run servers,''
Rosenberg said. ``That takes up a disproportionate amount of
upstream bandwidth and lowers the speeds for the average
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   AtHome's speeds are affected by how many people use the service
at a given time. Customers access the Internet by using a cable
modem that sends and receives information via cable TV lines.
AtHome contracts with various cable TV providers across the country
to sell the service. In the Bay Area, it operates through TCI
Cable.
</P>
<P>
   Cable TV lines serve an entire neighborhood, however, so instead
of a dedicated cable for each user, between 500 to 1,000 users can
connect to AtHome's service via the same fiber-optic line.
Customers split the bandwidth, so the more people using the
service, the slower it goes.
</P>
<P>
   The upstream cap is the latest attempt by AtHome to handle its
growing volume of subscribers. In the three years since it was
launched, AtHome has signed up more than 460,000 customers. While
that amount is far less than the company originally anticipated it
would have by now, AtHome has disclosed in financial filings that
its network has had trouble accommodating large numbers of users at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   To help keep the network running smoothly, the company
previously placed a 10-minute limit on the TV-quality video its
customers can download off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome's latest cap has rankled customers who say they enjoy the
service but are upset with the company's decision to continually
impose limits and hide it from subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The internal AtHome memo instructs customer service employees to
avoid telling customers about the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best ONadvantage explanation is to avoid talking about it
to begin with _ if possible,'' the memo states. ``ONadvantage
should be kept low-key in the eyes of the subscriber. Ideally, the
customer will experience the advantages of ONadvantage program
without ever knowing it existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg said the company never meant to conceal the cap and
said all AtHome customers should have been alerted through an
e-mail from their cable provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of the document was not to hide in any clandestine
manner the activities which we're implementing,'' Rosenberg said.
He added, ``Ninety-nine percent of our users will get better
service after the upstream cap.''
</P>
<P>
   But some customers are getting slower service, and several
AtHome subscribers who contacted The Chronicle said the limit has
interfered with their attempts to send certain files, such as
PowerPoint presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've certainly noticed a slowdown in upstream,'' said Dave
Roznar, an AtHome customer in Portland, Ore. ``Plus, if you hit the
upload cap, your download speed slows, too, so it can take forever
to check e-mail or look at news.''
</P>
<P>
   Roznar, who's been a subscriber for more than a year, said the
company's handling of the situation is unacceptable. He said
customers, who pay $40 a month for the service plus a $150
installation fee, should have been consulted before the cap was
imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather that they didn't impose a cap at all because, quite
frankly, all their talk of being up to 100 times faster than a
traditional modem is not true and this just slows it down even
more,'' Roznar said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Shklar, vice president of marketing for San Mateo's Keynote
Systems, which tracks Internet performance, said that while 128
Kbps is below cable modem speed, most users who are just sending
e-mail and surfing the Net probably won't notice the cap. Only
those are trying to send large files or operate their own servers
would bump up against it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the data flows downstream. In standard interactions
with Web sites, there is very little flowing upstream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some customers question the timing for the cap. AtHome has
talked about rolling out a program called AtHome Professional,
which would allow customers to pay extra for additional bandwidth
so that they can transmit data at faster speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Blackstone, who hasn't gotten the cap yet, but expects to see it
soon, said he understands that AtHome is trying to protect the
network's speed. However, he said, all customers shouldn't be
punished just because a few people may be misusing the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't kindergarten. They are punishing people who have
paid $150 to get this installed and have done nothing wrong,''
Blackstone said. He said he'd rather pay a little extra per month
than have AtHome limit how fast he can send files.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been happier if they said, `We messed up. We
didn't plan our bandwidth appropriately, so we're going to charge
$10 more per person and give you the same speeds,''' Blackstone
said. ``To do it this way is ridiculous. We're paying for speeds
we're no longer getting.''

 Venture Firm Plans Big Boost For AltaVista  &HT;     By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Online venture firm CMGI Inc. yesterday said it will buy an 83
percent stake in Palo Alto-based AltaVista, Compaq Computer's
powerful but lightly marketed Internet search engine, for $2.5
billion in stock and debt.
<P>
   The deal had been in the works for some time and intensified
after Compaq quashed plans to spin off AltaVista. CMGI plans to
meld AltaVista into its portfolio of 40 Web companies, including
financial site Raging Bull, in a bold move to create an online
behemoth rivaling Yahoo and Excite &LR; Home.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, the world's largest PC-maker, will continue to bundle
AltaVista in its machines.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista is the Internet's 10th-most popular site, with 10.7
million visitors per month, according to MediaMetrix in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, CMGI, of Andover, Mass., CMGI will own most
of Alta Vista, a Palo Alto company. Compaq will receive a
16.4-percent equity stake in CMGI, making Compaq its largest
outside shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI shares rose $12.63, to $110.31 yesterday, while Compaq rose
$1.06, to $23.38.
</P>
<P>
   The search engine sale hardly surprised industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has stumbled revamping its distribution strategy and
digesting last year's buyout of Digital Equipment Corp., which had
previously acquired AltaVista. Earlier this month, Compaq it &LR; 
 &LR; warned of a second-quarter loss from pricing pressures.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI executives estimate sales generated by AltaVista will
nearly double the $168 million that CMGI collects from its other
dot.com properties.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call yesterday, CMGI CEO David Wetherell said
Compaq spent only $1 million this year promoting AltaVista. He said
CMGI and Compaq will plunk down $50 million each marketing
AltaVista over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The AltaVista acquisition marks a major shift in strategy for
CMGI, which has financed Internet startups such as No. 3 search
service Lycos, and reaped big dividends when those companies went
public or were acquired. CMGI made a cool $1 billion from the sale
of GeoCities, in which it held a 28 percent stake. Yahoo acquired
GeoCities for $4.05 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI intends to spin off AltaVista in an initial public stock
sale at a date soon to be set, Wetherell told the Associated Press.

 Women-Owned Firms Seeing Huge Growth  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Women-owned businesses continue to grow faster in numbers, revenues
and employees than businesses in general, according to a new study
of the top 50 U.S. metropolitan markets.
<P>
   During the past seven years, the number of women-owned
businesses nationwide jumped 42 percent, to 9.1 million, stated a
report issued by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners
and Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women-owned businesses grew approximately one-and-a-half times
faster than for businesses overall over the past seven years,''
said NFWBO spokesman Bruce Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The study measured the number of women-owned firms in each
market, their revenues and their employees. It also measured the
growth rate in each of these categories for each market.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco ranked 17th in a category that averaged number of
women-owned firms, employees and revenues. It ranked only 27th in a
category that measured average growth rate in these three
categories.
</P>
<P>
   During the past seven years, the number of women-owned
businesses in the San Francisco area increased 36 percent, to
91,000.
</P>
<P>
   The number of employees at San Francisco area women-owned firms
grew 131.4 percent since 1992, to 345,000. Nationwide, employment
at women-owned firms grew 108 percent over the same period, to 27.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, revenues of women-owned firms in the San Francisco
area jumped 157 percent, to $54.2 billion. In all 50 markets,
revenues increased 132 percent, to $3.6 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland area ranked No.20, with 91,900 women-owned firms,
250,200 employees and $36 billion revenues. The San Jose area
ranked No.32, with 60,500 firms, 172,200 employees and $24.8
billion revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In the growth rankings, the Oakland area ranked No.21 and San

SIMPLE YET SOPHISTICATED TEXAS TALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MY GRANDFATHER'S FINGER 
By Edward Swift, with photographs by Lynn Lennon. 
University of Georgia Press, 246 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Edward Swift was a little boy living in the Big Thicket of
east Texas, he saw Maria Tallchief dancing ``The Firebird'' on a
television set his uncle Frank may have stolen. This fired in him a
desire to be a ballerina, despite his grandmother's observations
about how a ballerina looked like a ``bitch hiking up her legs.''
When his mother went into Woodville to shop, young Eddie Jr. would
follow behind, en pointe, in his ballerina outfit _ a T-shirt,
moccasins stuffed with old nylons, and a green wool skirt.
</P>
<P>
   This apparition excited a lot of comment in east Texas, as it
would just about anywhere, but Eddie Jr.'s mother, Pearl, took it
all in stride. And years later, Swift's latest book exacts sweet,
hilarious revenge. Nobody in Woodville was in any position to cast
the first stone _ and in fact nobody anywhere would be.
</P>
<P>
   A common human problem is that every person likes to think that
he or she is the norm from which the universe departs at its own
peril. The lesson of this book is that every individual is an
eccentric, and normality is a figment of the imagination. Swift's
sympathy goes out to everyone who refuses to submit to an arbitrary
notion of normality.
</P>
<P>
   Swift's own family was chock-full of unusual people. When his
grandfather lopped off his finger with a machete when out at work
in the logging business, Eddie's aunt Coleta pickled it in a little
green jar and used it to terrify children into good behavior; the
little green jar with the pickled finger in it became and remains a
family heirloom and talisman. (A photograph of it appears on the
last page of Swift's book.)
</P>
<P>
   Swift's uncle Frank had a weakness for painted women who reeked
of cigarettes, bourbon, Listerine, and Evening in Paris; one of
them confessed to Eddie Jr. that she made her living as a
``stripteaste artist.'' ``The very sound of the word produced such
excitement I could hardly speak. I was sure that I was an artist
too, but I had no idea what kind. How I admired Jean for knowing
exactly what kind of artist she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the eccentrics in the Big Thicket were in the family,
not by any means. Hardy Cain escaped from his wife to make violins
he could barely play in a fallout shelter called Rapture's Heights.
``When walking through the woods, he often came upon a tree with
music trapped inside it.'' Mrs. Margaret Woodcock liked to go to
the city dump to collect old sacks of other people's letters,
``which she read and reread with the greatest interest.'' Sister
Louise Owens, costumed in an old wedding dress which billowed out
of the windows of her VW Bug, traveled from church to church to
give her dramatic reading, ``The Samarian Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   These people, and dozens of others, pass through the pages of
``My Grandfather's Finger,'' a series of interlocked
autobiographical essays. Many of them were originally written as
newspaper magazine articles. It is unclear whether the 39 pictures
by Lynn Lennon were commissioned by the newspaper or by the
University of Georgia Press, but they are sensitive and memorable.
Occasionally Swift's effort to produce the last-line ``kicker''
that newspaper editors love shows. But in every other respect,
Swift's essays transcend their genre because of the simplicity and
sophistication of his art, his economy of means, his sense of time
and place, and the precision of his ear in hearing and notating the
melody of common speech. ``For a long time, Mother felt that Carole
Lombard had hung the moon.'' Or ``I'm not so sure Eva Gay enjoyed
hearing this, but she heard it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Swift was different himself, and felt the difference,
even if he couldn't articulate what the difference was, he
understands the differences of other people, even the people who
were closest to him, and therefore the hardest to understand. Like
his mother: ``I can tell you what she was all about. Quite simply,
she was about sadness. She was about transcending sadness with
laughter. She was about the language, how she heard it, and how she
spoke it. It was music. She was like a soprano singing Rossini. The
second time through she embellished the line. She tried never to
repeat herself, not even her embellishments, but of course, she did
repeat herself, she repeated herself constantly; still she never
stopped trying for something new the second time around. That's
what she was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be obvious to readers of Swift's novels _ especially
``Splendora,'' ``Principia Martindale,'' and ``Mother of Pearl'' _
how his childhood and adolescent experiences fed into and nurtured
his art. Many people yearn for exotic escape; Swift did too, at the
Fain Theater, where he sold popcorn and where Randolph Scott's
low-slung belt and Debra Paget left indelible impressions on him,
``especially when she was forced to jump into an active volcano in
order to appease the gods.'' But something far more exciting lay
right in front of Edward Swift's nose, and he has had the sense to
recognize it. He found a way to make his childhood nurture his
whole life.

 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON  
 GROW A BUSINESS/PETER SINTON  &HT;     Analyzing a Career Change 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
I am a clinical psychologist who has been practicing for over 40
years and wish to make a career change to organizational
psychologist. My next step is to market myself and I don't find
that easy. I welcome any ideas how to proceed.
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Networking may be an overused word, but that is a place to
start.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Crandall, a Tiburon author of eight business books
including ``Marketing Your Services: For People Who Hate to Sell,''
suggests contacting trade associations in the field you are about
to enter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, get in touch with the American Society for Training
&AMP; Development (www.astd.org), which has more than 70,000 members,
publishes tons of information about professional development and
hosts conferences. If you attend a local chapter meeting, you can
mingle with other consultants as well as company human resources
specialists who might be interested in your expertise.
</P>
<P>
   You might also check out the Society for Human Resource
Management (www.shrm.org), which also has local meetings, and the
Institute of Management Consultants (www.imc.org.au).
</P>
<P>
   Besides schmoozing, you should probably read a few books on
marketing. IDG Books and its ``For Dummies'' line has several on
starting a small business, with applicable chapters on marketing.
Entrepreneur's Magazine and a bunch of other publishers have
similar books.
</P>
<P>
   To make further contacts and win free publicity, Crandall also
recommends writing guest columns or articles for trade publications
or the growing array of online magazines that are hungry for
content. You might also offer yourself as a guest expert on a radio
show.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to specialize in training or testing employees or
consulting services for management, you might call the human
resources department of target customers and offer to give a free
lunchtime seminar or question-and-answer session about stress
management or other workplace issues. Demonstrating your expertise
might pave the way to a professional relationship or win you
referrals.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget your clients and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you are changing fields, Crandall notes that many of
your current or previous clients might run organizations that need
a human resources specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Or they know those who do.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than call everyone who might have faith in your
competence, send out letters to let them know you are moving from
working with individuals to working with organizations. Tell them
how much you appreciated working with them and how much you would
welcome new leads.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Negotiating With the IRS
</P>
<P>
   Q: &LR;   &LR; I am a sole proprietor and am about $10,000 behind in
paying my 1998 federal taxes. What advice can you offer on how my
small business can put off paying or strike a bargain with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: The first thing experts say is not to slide into more
difficulties by failing to pay your estimated quarterly tax
payments this year. ``Make sure you don't fall behind another
year,'' advises tax consultant Carolin Petersen. ``You don't want a
domino effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, conduct a good cash-flow analysis of expenses and profits
and figure precisely what you can afford to pay per month to get
out of your tax debt. Then approach the IRS and make your own
proposal; do not wait for the IRS to approach you.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, who has run her tax mediation business from Lodi since
1981, knows a thing or two about dealing with the feds. She was the
first woman special agent for the IRS Criminal Investigation
Division in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Often the IRS is willing to negotiate a payment arrangement over
the phone. ``They're increasingly willing to work out installment
agreements and not file liens so long as taxpayers come to them
with a feasible plan to pay off their unpaid taxes in 36 to 48
months,'' Petersen said. In some cases, the IRS might even stretch
payments to five years, but be ready to show your financial
statements and projections.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, if you could pay $300 a month for 36 months, you
would basically be paid off. (Interest charges will run 8 percent
per year on unpaid taxes and there is not much you can do about
that.)
</P>
<P>
   The IRS typically sends out four notices of nonpayment, one
every five weeks, and then a certified notice demanding payment in
30 days. Rather than wait, Petersen advises calling the IRS
toll-free number (800) 829-8815.
</P>
<P>
   If you are assertive and adept at negotiating, Petersen suggests
you might call the IRS yourself to work out a repayment schedule.
You can also deal with attorneys, CPAs and consultants, but that
can be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Again, be sure to pay your estimated quarterly tax payments. If
you fall behind, the IRS can use that as a reason to declare you in
default of any back taxes payment agreement.
</P>
<P>
   I presume you are $10,000 behind on your personal tax payments,
not payroll taxes. The feds will not negotiate installment payments
on unpaid payroll taxes, and if you fall behind a single quarterly
payment on your payroll taxes, the IRS is likely to send out a
revenue officer. ``If you don't pay promptly, they'll shut you
down'' said Petersen. ``Never bleed payroll taxes to pay personal
taxes first.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also has an ``Offer in Compromise'' that allows
taxpayers to negotiate a reduction in back taxes. But Petersen says
it is an expensive, complex exercise that can take nine to 18
months to arrange and is economical only for companies that owe
$30,000 to $1 million or more.

PLEASED TO BE IN ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This summer's rock reunions just keep coming: Bruce Springsteen
and the E Street Band, the J. Geils Band, Foreigner, Motley Crue,
Bad Company, and more. It almost seems like a master plan to have
everyone descend at once into sheds and arenas across the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very interesting, isn't it?'' says Paul Rodgers, lead
singer with Bad Company. ``But I can assure you that it's entirely
coincidental on our part. I'd hate to have people think, `Oh, look,
these other groups are getting together, so Bad Company is doing
it, too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, Bad Company was the least likely to reunite,
at least with its original lineup. Members hadn't played together
in 20 years _ the most extended absence of any of this summer's
reunion acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a farewell tour that has been a long time coming,''
says Rodgers, 49.
</P>
<P>
   There was a watered-down version of BadCo that played sheds in
the late '80s and early '90s, but the Original Bad Company, as the
revived group is called, features Rodgers and Simon Kirke (both
formerly of the band Free), Mick Ralphs (formerly of Mott the
Hoople), and Boz Burrell (formerly of King Crimson). They were the
all-star nucleus that enabled Bad Company to rule rock radio in the
'70s with such hits as ``Feel Like Makin' Love,'' ``Shooting
Star,'' ``Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy,'' and ``Can't Get Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But they stopped performing in 1979, after having risen to
arenas such as Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were exhausted, and there was a lack of inspiration,''
Rodgers recalls during a recent phone interview from the road.
``The death of (Led Zeppelin drummer) John Bonham also really
affected me. . . . And I wanted to stay home with my family for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers has since made six solo albums (the sixth comes out in
the fall) and was part of a short-lived band, the Firm, with
Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, in the '80s. Then, two years ago, the
original members of Bad Company met in London at the funeral of
Peter Grant, who had managed Zeppelin and Bad Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time since we broke up that we had been in
the same building together,'' says Rodgers. ``We knew we also had
to get together to discuss various catalog matters eventually. One
thing led to another, and I said to Mick, `What would really be
interesting is if we put out an anthology and put new material on
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That happened with the recently issued ``Original Bad Company
Anthology,'' which has the above-named hits, plus four new tracks _
two written by Rodgers and two by Ralphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the feeling that this isn't just a nostalgia trip, that
there's a sense of the band moving forward,'' says Rodgers, who
still refers to this as a farewell tour but admits, ``You can never
say never.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The band has a definite chemistry that is uniquely Bad
Company,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers feels the band's blues-based songs are still relevant,
especially ``Shooting Star,'' about becoming a rock burnout. Yet,
he also retains a personal investment in many songs, which helps
explain why he's agreed to this reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sing `Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy,' I realize that it's still
a rock 'n' roll fantasy to stand up there,'' he says.

 Retired Timber Goes Back to Work  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
You don't have to go to virgin forests to find old-growth timber.
You can find it at the Port of Oakland, abandoned airfields in San
Francisco's Presidio and old warehouses in Fremont.
<P>
   Architects, interior designers and homeowners are discovering
the beauty, environmental cachet and increasing availability of
``reclaimed'' wood.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a new word in building circles to describe the
phenomenon: deconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1950s, when bulldozers became the popular way to tear
down old buildings quickly and waste was not a major worry, taking
buildings apart piece by piece was the way things were done.
</P>
<P>
   Now the environment is a major concern, and there has been a
revival of businesses that take buildings apart by crowbar to save
the timber rather than turn it to rubble. About the only drawback
is that it is time- and labor-intensive process and the final
product is not necessarily cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, EcoTimber of Berkeley expects revenues from its
reclaimed timber sales to climb from about $100,000 last year to
$500,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company currently has embarked on the largest local harvest
of urban lumber at the recently closed Naval Fleet Industrial
Supply Center in West Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   In an innovative collaboration of businesses, government and
social service agencies, Oakland's Youth Employment Partnership is
putting 150 high school dropouts and welfare recipients to work
tearing out more than 2 million board feet of timber at six World
War II-era warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   The salvaged old-growth redwood and Douglas fir is being
remilled and marketed by EcoTimber.
</P>
<P>
   The company started out in 1992 importing hardwood from
certified well-managed forests. Because that market was relatively
small, the company branched into selling redwood and other products
from second-growth forests, then added salvaged timber to its
product line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reclaimed wood provides the same benefits of old-growth timber
and alleviates pressure on virgin forests and overflowing landfills
at the same time,'' said Jason Grant, co-founder and marketing
director of EcoTimber. This year, reclaimed timber will account for
close to 15 percent of the company's anticipated $4 million in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   One customer is outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia, which uses
salvaged Douglas fir for store fixtures. ``There's no need to chop
down new timber when there's plenty to be had through
deconstruction,'' said Peter Noone, director of new store
development for Patagonia. ``And the rustic character of the
reclaimed wood works with the image we want to present.''
</P>
<P>
   Old warehouses and other urban buildings are not the only source
of reclaimed wood. So are dead or damaged trees removed from city
streets, parks, back yards, old orchards, even river and lake
bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   EcoTimber sells tongue-and-groove flooring salvaged from red
elms that used to grace the streets of Sacramento. Toppled Monterey
cypress trees in Golden Gate Park similarly have been turned into
usable lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Tiller used such cypress planks to make a deck in the
Berkeley hills. ``I like the fact that it was windfall,'' said Ian
MacLeod, who designed and built the project. ``It did not involve
cutting down new trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Imperfections and nail holes are often perceived as ``character
marks,'' according to EcoTimber's Grant. ``It's wood with a story
behind it.'' Old-growth timber also has tighter grain, fewer knots,
and is harder and more stable than plantation-grown stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not necessarily cheap. Reclaimed lumber, especially
premium grades, often costs as much as or more than new product.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. At the old Naval Supply Center in
Oakland, the total budget to tear down all six warehouses is about
$4 million, including $2.9 million in welfare-to-work and other
grants. It also will take more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Each crew of 40 Youth Employment Partnership trainees and a
five-person staff will take more than four months to dismantle each
sprawling warehouse, pull out the nails and sort the lumber. By
contrast, a six-person demolition crew could do the job with a
bunch of bulldozers in about three weeks at a quarter of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   However, about $500,000 worth of timber will be reclaimed and
resold from the total project. In addition to saving landfill and
forests, the program addresses a host of inner-city social and
economic problems, according to Chris Thomas, director of
deconstruction for YEP's welfare-to-work program.
</P>
<P>
   Pay starts at $6.50 an hour for the disadvantaged youths
participating in the program. There are raises and bonuses for
completing training in forklift operation, lumber identification,
career planning and other skills. Child care, transportation and
general education classes also are part of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of hard work,'' said Michelle Davis, 20. ``But I
always wanted to get into construction and I've learned to cut pipe
and work a forklift.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawntell Chavis, 22, said she likes getting $7 an hour and
gaining experience in lead paint abatement and other skills.
</P>
<P>
   Before EcoTimber got involved, most of the salvaged timber at
the Port of Oakland was shipped overseas to Chile and Scotland,
where it went into pubs and other construction.
</P>
<P>
   There can be problems using reclaimed timber as framing
materials because many jurisdictions require that it be regraded.
That costs time and money. However, there is growing interest in
the material for rustic flooring, paneling and exposed interior
beams.
</P>
<P>
   At EcoTimber's yard in Berkeley, hand-hewn beams from barns go
for as much as $15 a linear foot. Old oak flooring goes for $6 a
square foot, compared to $3.50 for new oak.
</P>
<P>
   EcoTimber is committed to building a broader market for
reclaimed wood. So are several other Bay Area businesses. They
include:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Beyond Waste _ Started five years ago, this Cotati company has
salvaged former Army buildings at Crissy Field in the Presidio and
private warehouses in Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   CEO Pavitra Crimmel got the idea for the company when she was an
employee at another Sonoma County nonprofit called Garbage
Reincarnation and saw a lot of good wood going into the local
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized we could help save the environment while creating
jobs,'' she said. Even though it takes longer to take a building
apart piecemeal, she suggests it may not delay a project if
builders and developers plan ahead. For example, in many cases
builders can begin work on a demolition permit while awaiting final
approval of a building permit.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of Beyond Waste's $150,000-a-year business is
reclaiming lumber. The company recently received a $50,000 grant
from San Francisco to help it solicit more deconstruction bids in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Building Resources _ This division of San Francisco Community
Recyclers sells about $180,000 a year of salvaged doors, windows
and an increasing amount of recycled timber. It has worked with
Beyond Waste, taking apart buildings in the Presidio and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Caldwell's _ This San Francisco salvage yard started in 1956 and,
despite the onslaught of bulldozers at that time, focused more on
preserving than wrecking. Partner Rob Caldwell, the founder's son,
said 35 to 40 percent of revenues come from reclaimed lumber and
about 95 percent of the company's jobs are done by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Often Caldwell's gets the materials for free. Besides salving
their conscience, owners save substantial landfill costs, which can
run up to $900 for a large truckload.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Black's Farmwood _ Michael Black, who grew up on a tobacco farm in
Ohio and worked as a carpenter in Marin last summer, started this
company in San Rafael in January. He got the idea after his
grandmother told him she planned to burn down her long-abandoned
150-year-old barn.
</P>
<P>
   Black salvaged the beautifully weathered white oak siding (which
sells at EcoTimber for $4.50 a foot). He also took apart six other
barns in Ohio with a crowbar, chain saw and truck. He has since
hired a supplier in the East and is expanding in the West.

KAREKIN I, ARMENIAN PATRIARCH, DIES AT 66
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (nk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Catholicos Karekin I, the spiritual leader of Armenian Orthodox
Christians worldwide, who faced the enormous task of reinvigorating
his ancient church after the fall of Soviet Communism, died Tuesday
at his pontifical residence in Echmiadzin, near the Armenian
capital, Yerevan. He was 66.
 &HT;    The cause of death was throat cancer, for which he received
treatment in the last year in New York, said a spokesman for the
Diocese of the Armenian Church of America.
 &HT;    An Oxford-trained theologian fluent in English, French and other
languages, he held the title Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of
All Armenians, with a flock of more than six million.
 &HT;    Head of one of the world's oldest churches, he was a leading
exponent of ecumenism among Christians and was well known among
church leaders in Europe, the Middle East and the United States.
 &HT;    In March, returning to Armenia from New York, he stopped at the
Vatican, where he and Pope John Paul II made plans for the pope to
visit Armenia in July. As Karekin's health deteriorated during the
spring, the pope tried to schedule a private visit this month but
called it off because of his own health problems.
 &HT;    Karekin became head of the Armenian Apostolic Church in April
1995; he was the first such leader elected in centuries within an
independent Armenia.
 &HT;    The nation, with a population of about 3.5 million, had emerged
only four years earlier after seven decades of rule by the Soviet
Union. Even before the Soviet domination of the present republic,
Armenia was often divided up and ruled by countries including
Russia, Turkey and Syria.
 &HT;    Karekin was the 131st in a line of church leaders stretching
back to St. Gregory the Illuminator, who converted King Tiridates
III of Armenia in 301. Christianity became Armenia's official
religion a decade before the conversion of the Roman Emperor
Constantine.
 &HT;    Along with churches in Egypt, Syria, Ethiopia and India, the
Armenian Church belongs to the branch of Orthodox Christianity that
did not accept the definition of Christ's nature as human and
divine promulgated by the Council of Chalcedon in 451.
 &HT;    He visited the United States in May 1998 of last year to help
celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Diocese.
 &HT;    In an interview then, he said he faced three major challenges in
revitalizing the Armenian church: overcoming the negative
influences of Soviet-sponsored atheism, persuading Armenians that
Christianity is a way of life and not simply an ideology, and
persuading them that faith offers spiritual and moral sustenance.
 &HT;    The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general-secretary of the National
Council of Churches, who met several times with the catholicos,
recalled him as unaffected and considerate. During a visit to
Echmiadzin, she went to early morning prayers and saw him beckon
her to stand beside him.
 &HT;    ``I know you don't know the language _ I'll translate for you,''
Ms. Campbell recalled him saying.
 &HT;    ``That just amazed me,'' she said. ``He never saw himself as too
lofty to be a teacher when you needed help.''
 &HT;    Karekin was born Neshan Sarkissian in Kessab, Syria, on Aug. 27,
1932. After graduating from a seminary in 1952, he was ordained a
celibate priest and took the name Karekin in honor of an earlier
church leader.
 &HT;    He studied at Oxford from 1957 to 1959, served as a seminary
dean and then became an aide to Catholicos Khoren I, head of the
Catholicate of Cilicia, a self-governing see within the Armenian
church. He was also sent as an observer to the Second Vatican
Council.
 &HT;    He became a bishop in 1964 and an archbishop in 1973 and later
was elected Catholicos Coadjutor of Cilicia, to succeed Khoren I.
After Catholicos Khoren died in 1983, Karekin made visits to the
Vatican, the Church of England, European Protestant churches and
the Coptic Church of Egypt.
 &HT;    As head of the separate Cilician see, he was seen as a long shot
to succeed the Armenian Apostolic Church's long-reigning head,
Vasken I, who died in 1994. But after favorable statements were
made by Armenia's president, opinion began to shift toward him and
he was elected in a gathering of 400 church delegates.  
 
 BC-OBIT-BIRD-NYT  
 VERE BIRD, 89, WHO LED ANTIGUA TO INDEPENDENCE  
 (bl)  
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vere C. Bird, a child of the slums and a Salvation Army drummer
who carried the Caribbean island of Antigua to independence and
then sired the family dynasty that has led and dominated the
country ever since, died June 28 in the capital, St. Johns. He was
89.
</P>
<P>
   At his death after a long illness, the Caribbean News Agency
quoted his son, Lester Bird, who is also his successor as prime
minister, as saying, ``He raised us and produced us to continue in
his footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear from the context if he meant Antiguans generally,
or himself and his brothers. In fact Vere Bird had done both,
changing the political and social destiny of the island and
becoming what native Antiguan writer Jamaica Kincaid described as a
family patriarch ``who thinks that the government is his own
business.``
</P>
<P>
   Despite drug and gun-running scandals that touched his family
and government, Bird was regularly returned to office until he
retired in 1994, paving the way for his son. At his death, his
oldest son, Vere Bird Jr., was the agriculture minister while a
younger one, Ivor, a former Cabinet member who has been tainted by
scandal, directed the family-owned radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Vere Cornwall Bird Sr., who was born in a ramshackle shanty and
never went beyond grammar school, was a large, athletic and
powerful man with a preacher's voice and a sharp tongue. As in the
case of so many who were to become leaders of independent Caribbean
states, he first tasted power and attained prominence as a labor
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of his popularity among the 65,000 citizens on the
islands of Antigua and Barbuda was established in the early 1940s,
when these dots in the leeward chain were sugar-producing colonies
ruled from London and dominated by planters.
</P>
<P>
   Like Norman Manley and Alexander Bustamante in Jamaica, Eric
Gairy in Grenada and Dr. Eric Williams in Trinidad, he used
organized labor to confront both the planters and the colonial ties
that maintained their power. As president of the Antigua Trades and
Labor Union, he led sugar cane workers in strikes for higher wages
during World War II. He also pressured plantation owners to turn
over plots and home sites to the sugar harvesters who had been
their tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The union soon branched off into the Antigua Labor Party and in
the late 1940s, Bird won his first election to what was then still
a colonial legislature. In 1951, when universal suffrage was
introduced, the party led by Bird won every seat in Parliament, a
feat it would regularly repeat. In 1981, when Antigua became fully
independent, he became prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as tourism replaced the sugar production as Antigua's
economic mainstay, Bird's record of nationalism and populism seemed
to pay increasing dividends to his person and to his family.
According to Franklin W. Knight, a historian at Johns Hopkins and
the author of ``The Caribbean,'' Bird became one of the ``unusual
number of charismatic, caudillo-style politicians'' produced in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiguan political opposition charged that under the Birds'
rule, the island became a haven for international con men; in
recent years, U.S. government agencies have identified Antigua as a
key transit point for South American cocaine bound for Europe and
as a money laundering center. Ms. Kincaid, whose memoir ``A Small
Place'' dealt with growing up in Antigua, described the place in
this later period as ``a monument to rottenness.''
</P>
<P>
   Several scandalous revelations lay behind the criticisms. In May
1990, a court in Tel Aviv indicted an Israeli officer on charges of
illegally shipping assault weapons to Vere Bird Jr. in order to
have them forwarded to the members of the Gacha drug cartel in
Columbia. When islanders responded with protests and signs
proclaiming ``The Birds Must Go,'' the younger Bird resigned his
Cabinet post as minister of public works, but no charges were filed
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years earlier, a Canadian company called Space Research
owned by Gerald Bull was permitted to test howitzers on the island.
After a newspaper that was later shut down by the government
reported that the company was shipping arms to the white minority
government of South Africa, Space Research quietly withdrew. In
1990 Bull was in the news again when he was shot to death in
Belgium, where he was reported to be working on a gigantic cannon
for Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Ivor Bird was fined $75,000 after being caught with a 25
pound shipment of cocaine as he boarded a plane at the airport
named for his father. The following year U.S. officials expressed
concern about the arrival on the island of what they described as
organized crime groups from Russia, reportedly involved in money
laundering, drugs, arms sales and extortion. Another scandal
involved efforts by the ruling family to sell off the sands of a
highly unusual pink beach.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such embarrassments, Bird countered with speeches
reminding residents of the time when the only work available was
backbreaking labor of cutting cane and when drinking water came
from dirty ponds. He would make these speeches into his 80s,
accompanied by his wife, Lydia, his daughter Lisette, and his sons,
who also included Curtis, a lawyer, and Roswald, a teacher. His
household also included a mistress named Cutie Francis.
</P>
<P>
   His body will lie in state at Antigua's Parliament.

<P>
   HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. _ Marshall Wayne, who displeased Adolf
Hitler by winning gold and silver medals in diving in the 1936
Berlin Olympics and was later shot down over Italy fighting the
Nazis, died June 16. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   He died at Pardee Hospital in Hendersonville after suffering a
cerebral hemorrhage while working on a book at home, said his
sister, Dever Antes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had met Ernest Hemingway and had wanted to write stories
like Hemingway's for a long time,'' said Ms. Antes, also of
Hendersonville.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Antes said her brother spoke with Hitler and the Nazi leader
was very displeased with Wayne for winning the gold medal in the
platform diving competition. Wayne also won the silver medal in the
3-meter springboard diving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler wanted his man from Germany to win it, so he wasn't too
happy at all seeing my brother win,'' Ms. Antes recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She said the family lived in Miami close to a pool where Wayne
did most of his practicing. He excelled at diving in high school
and at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   While serving in World War II as a colonel in the Army Air
Forces, Wayne's plane was shot down in Italy and Italians helped
Wayne get to a British Aid Station and then to England for surgery.
The fall from the plane had torn ligaments and tendons in his leg,
Ms. Antes said.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Wayne became a Pan American Airways pilot, and
retired as a captain in 1972, the same year he moved to
Hendersonville.
</P>
<P>
   His love for the Olympics landed him a spot on the 1996 Atlanta
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic torch was making a run through town and Wayne was
invited to take part in the ceremony,'' Ms. Antes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was wearing a fake medal around his neck and when
he climbed out of the car downtown, someone shouted, `Hey where'd
you get that medal?' And Marshall said, `From the '36 Olympics in
Berlin.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his sister, Wayne is survived by his daughter,
Marilyn Wayne of San Pedro, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne's other daughter died a couple of years ago, Ms. Antes
said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Backstreet Boys recently paid a visit to the
MTV studios here, they attracted so many teen-age fans, it created
gridlock in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   According to MTV approximately 9.5 million viewers tuned in to
watch the band's live appearance over the next five days.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, this super hot pop group will play 46
shows in 34 European cities this summer. Now who wants to dress The
Backstreet Boys?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger, BCBG and Versace are among those already
wardrobing the band. Not to mention Sears, the presenting sponsor
of the band's 50-city North American tour, September through
December 99, which plans to dress them in its private label, Canyon
River Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is there's a whole slew of hot, up-and-coming
bands that have Backstreet Boy potential and are just waiting for
the right brand, designer or retailer to come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sponsorship is all about the hot new bands,'' said Barry
Blevins, fashion director at Rolling Stone. ``Designers today are
trying to link up with any musician they can, but it's the new and
up-and-coming artists who are hip and reach that youth market.''
</P>
<P>
   But the relationships are often difficult to manage and
maintain. Giorgio Armani had a six-year relationship with Ricky
Martin, but when Martin became an overnight sensation in the last
few months (Time magazine cover, ``Today'' show appearances),
Armani moved quickly to reinforce the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what it means to actually dress a band is given to a
variety of interpretations. Lots of people may claim to be
providing clothes, but the musicians are fickle so there's no
guarantee they'll ever wear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of these musicians won't wear a certain product
on stage, so actually trying to dress them is futile,'' said Dick
Baker, ceo of OP.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baker is spending $4 million to link his brand to music.
The way he's doing it, however, is by sponsoring the actual music
event. This summer, OP is working with Spin magazine to advertise a
sweepstakes for consumers to win an all-expense-paid trip to any
summer concert of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a lot to choose from with artists like Britney
Spears, Lauryn Hill, N' Sync, Sugar Ray and the Goo Goo Dolls all
scheduled to tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely teen music and pop acts that will be cleaning
up from coast to coast this summer,'' said Alan White,
editor-in-chief of Spin. ``It's not necessarily boom time in the
music industry, but music is still selling. With this wave of
exploding teen acts, it will be a good year for the record
business.''
</P>
<P>
   White added that a good year for music also means a good year
for fashion and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The designers are eager and the artists are in a position to
pick and choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there's one designer who has positioned himself as the
leader of the trend, it's Tommy Hilfiger. He dubbed 1999 ``The year
of music'' and said musicians are one of the best sources of
fashion information in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baker: ``Tommy is the best at it. He invented fashion and
music.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baker added that Hilfiger also has the budget to make the
relationships happen. This summer Tommy Jeans is the presenting
sponsor of Britney Spears' 48-city North American tour (June 28 to
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5), providing all her outfits for appearances on- and
offstage and tying in retail contests where consumers can win free
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sponsorship of the tour will also include Tommy
Jeans signage on all concert tickets and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Girl, the fragrance, will be sponsoring the Lilith Fair,
the all-women concert that will tour nationwide from July 8 to Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andy Hilfiger, vice president public relations of
Tommy Jeans, 75 percent of this year's marketing budget for Tommy
Jeans is allocated to music.
</P>
<P>
   An exclusive sponsorship, like the one Tommy Jeans has with
Spears, is a deal coveted by most brands, but also one that's tough
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill, for example, has not only worked with brands like
PNB for the Billboard awards, but was most recently outfitted
exclusively by Levi's for her first international tour and is
frequently dressed by Armani.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spin's White, the competition to dress Hill is
fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to simple arithmetic _ how many Lauryn Hills are
out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that giants like Armani, Levi's and Hilfiger own the
category. BC Ethic, a $25 million streetwear company, is dressing
such hot groups as Barenaked Ladies and C Note. BC Ethic's
relationships don't involve signed contracts and the company makes
a point of not shipping unsolicited clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not chasing music stars,'' said BC Ethic's Jim Huber.
``I'm communicating with them at an equal level. The only way I'd
be involved with a band is if they actually like the product. I
think it's kind of arrogant just to send out free trunks of
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeans giant Levi's takes a different approach and is involved
with over 200 music sponsorships this year. According to Joe
Townsend, manager of music sponsorships at Levi's, the company's
main focus this summer is music marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is one of the most important ways for us to reach our
target consumer,'' he said. ``A relationship like the one we have
with Hill is repositioning us as a brand that consumers like. Over
the next 18 months, as we look for new and original musicians,
consumers will see Levi's as cool and different.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is linking up with three of this summer's hottest bands,
the Goo Goo Dolls, Sugar Ray and Fastball, sponsoring the Levi's
'99 Fuse tour. The 43-date tour will feature a medley of
up-and-coming bands and deejays who will perform on multiple stages
and in tents, creating a festival-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is the only sponsor of the tour. Levi's is also
sponsoring hit recording artist Jamiroquai, designing an exclusive
wardrobe for his summer tour which begins on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Other jeans companies stepping into the music scene this summer
include Wrangler, which is dressing hit country music star George
Straight both on and offstage, DKNY Jeans, which recently sponsored
the Z100 Zootopia concert in New York in conjunction with
Bloomingdale's, and Diesel, which dresses many musicians including
Ricky Martin in its Style Lab collection.
</P>
<P>
   For many urban brands, like Karl Kani, Ecko Unlimited and Fubu,
music marketing is essential to building a brand. It was LL Cool
J's support of Fubu, for example, that helped introduce the brand
to mainstream consumers when he wore it on MTV and for many other
public appearances. LL Cool J. is now the of official spokesperson
for Fubu.

   ``It's definitely teen music and pop acts that will be cleaning
up from coast to coast this summer,'' said Alan White,
editor-in-chief of Spin. ``It's not necessarily boom time in the
music industry, but music is still selling. With this wave of
exploding teen acts, it will be a good year for the record
business.''
</P>
<P>
   White added that a good year for music also means a good year
for fashion and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The designers are eager and the artists are in a position to
pick and choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there's one designer who has positioned himself as the
leader of the trend, it's Tommy Hilfiger. He dubbed 1999 ``The year
of music'' and said musicians are one of the best sources of
fashion information in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baker: ``Tommy is the best at it. He invented fashion and
music.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baker added that Hilfiger also has the budget to make the
relationships happen. This summer Tommy Jeans is the presenting
sponsor of Britney Spears' 48-city North American tour (June 28 to
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5), providing all her outfits for appearances on- and
offstage and tying in retail contests where consumers can win free
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sponsorship of the tour will also include Tommy
Jeans signage on all concert tickets and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Girl, the fragrance, will be sponsoring the Lilith Fair,
the all-women concert that will tour nationwide from July 8 to Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andy Hilfiger, vice president public relations of
Tommy Jeans, 75 percent of this year's marketing budget for Tommy
Jeans is allocated to music.
</P>
<P>
   An exclusive sponsorship, like the one Tommy Jeans has with
Spears, is a deal coveted by most brands, but also one that's tough
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill, for example, has not only worked with brands like
PNB for the Billboard awards, but was most recently outfitted
exclusively by Levi's for her first international tour and is
frequently dressed by Armani.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spin's White, the competition to dress Hill is
fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to simple arithmetic _ how many Lauryn Hills are
out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that giants like Armani, Levi's and Hilfiger own the
category. BC Ethic, a $25 million streetwear company, is dressing
such hot groups as Barenaked Ladies and C Note. BC Ethic's
relationships don't involve signed contracts and the company makes
a point of not shipping unsolicited clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not chasing music stars,'' said BC Ethic's Jim Huber.
``I'm communicating with them at an equal level. The only way I'd
be involved with a band is if they actually like the product. I
think it's kind of arrogant just to send out free trunks of
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeans giant Levi's takes a different approach and is involved
with over 200 music sponsorships this year. According to Joe
Townsend, manager of music sponsorships at Levi's, the company's
main focus this summer is music marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is one of the most important ways for us to reach our
target consumer,'' he said. ``A relationship like the one we have
with Hill is repositioning us as a brand that consumers like. Over
the next 18 months, as we look for new and original musicians,
consumers will see Levi's as cool and different.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is linking up with three of this summer's hottest bands,
the Goo Goo Dolls, Sugar Ray and Fastball, sponsoring the Levi's
'99 Fuse tour. The 43-date tour will feature a medley of
up-and-coming bands and deejays who will perform on multiple stages
and in tents, creating a festival-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is the only sponsor of the tour. Levi's is also
sponsoring hit recording artist Jamiroquai, designing an exclusive
wardrobe for his summer tour which begins on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Other jeans companies stepping into the music scene this summer
include Wrangler, which is dressing hit country music star George
Straight both on and offstage, DKNY Jeans, which recently sponsored
the Z100 Zootopia concert in New York in conjunction with
Bloomingdale's, and Diesel, which dresses many musicians including
Ricky Martin in its Style Lab collection.
</P>
<P>
   For many urban brands, like Karl Kani, Ecko Unlimited and Fubu,
music marketing is essential to building a brand. It was LL Cool
J's support of Fubu, for example, that helped introduce the brand
to mainstream consumers when he wore it on MTV and for many other
public appearances. LL Cool J. is now the of official spokesperson
for Fubu.

   NEW YORK _ When the Backstreet Boys recently paid a visit to the
MTV studios here, they attracted so many teen-age fans, it created
gridlock in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   According to MTV approximately 9.5 million viewers tuned in to
watch the band's live appearance over the next five days.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, this super hot pop group will play 46
shows in 34 European cities this summer. Now who wants to dress The
Backstreet Boys?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger, BCBG and Versace are among those already
wardrobing the band. Not to mention Sears, the presenting sponsor
of the band's 50-city North American tour, September through
December 99, which plans to dress them in its private label, Canyon
River Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is there's a whole slew of hot, up-and-coming
bands that have Backstreet Boy potential and are just waiting for
the right brand, designer or retailer to come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sponsorship is all about the hot new bands,'' said Barry
Blevins, fashion director at Rolling Stone. ``Designers today are
trying to link up with any musician they can, but it's the new and
up-and-coming artists who are hip and reach that youth market.''
</P>
<P>
   But the relationships are often difficult to manage and
maintain. Giorgio Armani had a six-year relationship with Ricky
Martin, but when Martin became an overnight sensation in the last
few months (Time magazine cover, ``Today'' show appearances),
Armani moved quickly to reinforce the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what it means to actually dress a band is given to a
variety of interpretations. Lots of people may claim to be
providing clothes, but the musicians are fickle so there's no
guarantee they'll ever wear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of these musicians won't wear a certain product
on stage, so actually trying to dress them is futile,'' said Dick
Baker, ceo of OP.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baker is spending $4 million to link his brand to music.
The way he's doing it, however, is by sponsoring the actual music
event. This summer, OP is working with Spin magazine to advertise a
sweepstakes for consumers to win an all-expense-paid trip to any
summer concert of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a lot to choose from with artists like Britney
Spears, Lauryn Hill, N' Sync, Sugar Ray and the Goo Goo Dolls all
scheduled to tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely teen music and pop acts that will be cleaning
up from coast to coast this summer,'' said Alan White,
editor-in-chief of Spin. ``It's not necessarily boom time in the
music industry, but music is still selling. With this wave of

The way he's doing it, however, is by sponsoring the actual music
event. This summer, OP is working with Spin magazine to advertise a
sweepstakes for consumers to win an all-expense-paid trip to any
summer concert of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a lot to choose from with artists like Britney
Spears, Lauryn Hill, N' Sync, Sugar Ray and the Goo Goo Dolls all
scheduled to tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely teen music and pop acts that will be cleaning
up from coast to coast this summer,'' said Alan White,
editor-in-chief of Spin. ``It's not necessarily boom time in the
music industry, but music is still selling. With this wave of
exploding teen acts, it will be a good year for the record
business.''
</P>
<P>
   White added that a good year for music also means a good year
for fashion and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The designers are eager and the artists are in a position to
pick and choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there's one designer who has positioned himself as the
leader of the trend, it's Tommy Hilfiger. He dubbed 1999 ``The year
of music'' and said musicians are one of the best sources of
fashion information in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baker: ``Tommy is the best at it. He invented fashion and
music.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baker added that Hilfiger also has the budget to make the
relationships happen. This summer Tommy Jeans is the presenting
sponsor of Britney Spears' 48-city North American tour (June 28 to
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5), providing all her outfits for appearances on- and
offstage and tying in retail contests where consumers can win free
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sponsorship of the tour will also include Tommy
Jeans signage on all concert tickets and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Girl, the fragrance, will be sponsoring the Lilith Fair,
the all-women concert that will tour nationwide from July 8 to Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andy Hilfiger, vice president public relations of
Tommy Jeans, 75 percent of this year's marketing budget for Tommy
Jeans is allocated to music.
</P>
<P>
   An exclusive sponsorship, like the one Tommy Jeans has with
Spears, is a deal coveted by most brands, but also one that's tough
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill, for example, has not only worked with brands like
PNB for the Billboard awards, but was most recently outfitted
exclusively by Levi's for her first international tour and is
frequently dressed by Armani.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spin's White, the competition to dress Hill is
fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to simple arithmetic _ how many Lauryn Hills are
out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that giants like Armani, Levi's and Hilfiger own the
category. BC Ethic, a $25 million streetwear company, is dressing
such hot groups as Barenaked Ladies and C Note. BC Ethic's
relationships don't involve signed contracts and the company makes
a point of not shipping unsolicited clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not chasing music stars,'' said BC Ethic's Jim Huber.
``I'm communicating with them at an equal level. The only way I'd
be involved with a band is if they actually like the product. I
think it's kind of arrogant just to send out free trunks of
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeans giant Levi's takes a different approach and is involved
with over 200 music sponsorships this year. According to Joe
Townsend, manager of music sponsorships at Levi's, the company's
main focus this summer is music marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is one of the most important ways for us to reach our
target consumer,'' he said. ``A relationship like the one we have
with Hill is repositioning us as a brand that consumers like. Over
the next 18 months, as we look for new and original musicians,
consumers will see Levi's as cool and different.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is linking up with three of this summer's hottest bands,
the Goo Goo Dolls, Sugar Ray and Fastball, sponsoring the Levi's
'99 Fuse tour. The 43-date tour will feature a medley of
up-and-coming bands and deejays who will perform on multiple stages
and in tents, creating a festival-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's is the only sponsor of the tour. Levi's is also
sponsoring hit recording artist Jamiroquai, designing an exclusive
wardrobe for his summer tour which begins on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Other jeans companies stepping into the music scene this summer
include Wrangler, which is dressing hit country music star George
Straight both on and offstage, DKNY Jeans, which recently sponsored
the Z100 Zootopia concert in New York in conjunction with
Bloomingdale's, and Diesel, which dresses many musicians including
Ricky Martin in its Style Lab collection.
</P>
<P>
   For many urban brands, like Karl Kani, Ecko Unlimited and Fubu,
music marketing is essential to building a brand. It was LL Cool
J's support of Fubu, for example, that helped introduce the brand
to mainstream consumers when he wore it on MTV and for many other
public appearances. LL Cool J. is now the of official spokesperson
for Fubu.

   STERN-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ Can the New York architect Robert
A.M. Stern, famous for replicating old-money architecture right
down to the eyebrow dormers, shed his gray shingles to become a
hipper, populist educator in tune with the restless talents of
tomorrow? When Richard C. Levin, the president of Yale University,
announced last fall that he had appointed Stern, who calls himself
a modern traditionalist, as the new dean of the Yale School of
Architecture, the news roiled the design community. By Julie

   SCHULTZ-FURNITURE (Barto, Pa.) _ Most people look at a lettuce

``What would you think of that color on a chair?'' Richard Schultz,
a furniture designer, asked, pointing to the bright floppy head
sticking out of the ground in a vegetable garden fenced by tall
wire tangled with wild purple roses. A chair in the garden is apple
green, last month's flavor, which the designer chose by walking
into a local paint store with an apple in his hand, picked from the
tree behind his studio. By William L. Hamilton.

   HOUSE-FACADES (Undated) _ It's not just athletes who are on
steroids _ American houses are using chemicals to bulk up. In the
last two decades, home exteriors have undergone a stylistic shift
with flat facades giving way to columns, pediments and textured 3-D
details like quoins, keystones and dentil cornices. How can people
afford to build so many houses with opulent facades? The answer, in
many cases, is that they used a polystyrene foam covered by a
synthetic spray-on stucco _ a construction method that allows
builders to do more for less. But some experts contend that this
approach may cause serious problems down the road. By Fred

<HEADLINE>
`WILD WEST,' MILD AT BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Men in Black'' was a triple scoop of school's-out giddiness:
hip, funny, casual about plot and not overawed by its special
effects.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Wild Wild West,'' the same actor-director team shoots
again, and misses by a Hollywood mile. These pictures need a light
touch and a lot of attitude, but this time you can hear heavy
breathing in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Like the '60s TV series that inspired it, ``Wild Wild West''
counts on a loony premise to carry it off. It was a spy spoof full
of gadgets and attractive women, which was common enough at the
time, but the setting was the American West, post-Civil War era.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sleek modern equipment, these secret agents used
wooden and brass gizmos powered by steam, a la Jules Verne, which
made the show unique and caught the public's eye (it ran four
seasons).
</P>
<P>
   The movie offers affable Will Smith as Jim West, the more
two-fisted of the show's secret-agent duo. West's buddy is Artemus
Gordon (Kevin Kline), a prissy inventor and master of disguise who
fights with brains instead of guns. Kline is nice casting _ his
Gordon has refinement and wit missing in the impulsive West. And
Smith thrives in a team: ``Men in Black'' worked partly because he
could riff off the deadpan demeanor of co-star Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the chemistry isn't here, and it's probably more the fault
of the roles than the actors, who seem game enough. The TV Jim West
(Robert Conrad) was rough, ready and studly, and not much else.
This would seem to give the filmmakers plenty of room to make
something interesting out of the role, but other than playing off
the racism endemic to the Old West, they don't. So Kline is left to
operate in a vacuum, which he can do _ but you can't help feeling
that a nice opportunity's been muffed.
</P>
<P>
   There's the slimmest excuse for a plot here, but in classic
blockbuster fashion it only serves the bare purposes of bringing
the main characters on screen and justifying the special effects.
</P>
<P>
   West and Gordon are assigned by President Ulysses S. Grant to
find out why America's top scientists are being abducted. The
answer is a conspiracy headed by a die-hard supporter of the
recently defeated Confederacy, the grotesque Dr. Arliss Loveless
(Kenneth Branagh), who wants to assassinate the president and divvy
up the country. Branagh sports an elaborately trimmed beard and
chews the scenery _ why not? _ and gets another chance to fool
around with the Southern accent he used in ``The Gingerbread Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Salma Hayek also is on hand, in a role that openly tweaks the
general uselessness of the female ``love interest'' in this kind of
buddy film.
</P>
<P>
   OK, this is supposed to be the big July 4 Will Smith
extravaganza, but the real star is The Tarantula, a huge, walking
contraption that's a combination tank, personnel carrier and weapon
of destruction _ all shaped like a colossal spider. It's Loveless'
invention, and it's intended to bring the United States to its
knees. As this monster clanks across the Western desert, the
special-effects team is in heaven. (The other chief gadget is the
handsome train car assigned to the two agents that's full of
elaborately silly gimcracks and weapons.)
</P>
<P>
   Director Barry Sonnenfeld, who began his career as a
cinematographer (and employs the outstanding Michael Ballhaus in
that role here), relishes loving attention on the look of the film,
an off-kilter vision of 19th-century luxury. He showed a nice
satirical touch in ``The Addams Family'' and its sequel, but he
can't seem to get anything going here _ it's like an Artemus Gordon
contrivance that won't quite work.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters: It's summer, and you already can hear kids
on the street singing the movie's hip-hop theme song (performed by
Smith). It's all about marketing, and this picture needs it.

R-rated, libidinous songs; or any assortment of jibes aimed at
women, racial minorities, gays, organized religion or the disabled.
Now take those elements and multiply them by, oh, say a thousand.
Now you might have some idea of what to expect from the network's
new spinoff film, ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut,'' the most
unapologetically offensive movie to ever come out of Hollywood. And
did I mention it's also hilarious? By TODD CAMP. Story will move in
``e'' entertainment category. &QL;

   FILM-WILD WEST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Anyone who bothers to complain about ``Wild, Wild
West'' because of its African-American star _ Will Smith plays
James West, essentially the first Secret Service agent _ misses the
point. The original series didn't exactly radiate historical
accuracy either. And never has a star seemed to enjoy himself so
much as Smith. His uncomplicated sunniness makes him look as if
he's never missed a night's sleep in his entire life. And he's so
contemporary he might as well be the only cowboy on the range to
carry a cell phone and a pager. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story will move
in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL;

<P>
   VAN ZANDT-CD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Master songwriter and Fort Worth native Townes Van
Zandt died in 1997, but his music lives again today with the
release of ``A Far Cry From Dead,'' a collection of rerecorded
versions of favorites such as ``Pancho and Lefty'' and ``To Live Is
to Fly'' assembled by his widow, Jeanene, and respected Nashville
producer Eric Paul. The 13-track CD also includes Van Zandt's final
composition, the chilling ``Sanitarium Blues.'' By DAVE FERMAN.

   CHAPMAN-TEXAS AT LARGE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ The Fourth of July is a big time in Sanderson, always
has been. There will be an antique car show, rodeo, baseball
tournament, American Legion barbecue, old settlers' reunion and a
street dance. ``We call it a concert so the Baptists will come,''
Terrell County Judge Dudley Harrison said. But there will be more
than just fireworks at this year's celebration. This is the year
that Sanderson begins its comeback. Maybe. By ART CHAPMAN. Story

   UNDATED _ In his hugely successful cookbook ``A Cowboy in the
Kitchen,'' author and Reata executive chef Grady Spears writes:
``Back when I was punching cows, if you'd told me I was going to be
a chef someday, I would have doubled up in laughter and fallen off
my horse.'' Don't look for Spears to be on horseback any time soon.

   UNDATED _ Just what we need: unionized doctors. Actually, we
already have some _ about 40,000 doctors belong to various unions,
according to the The New York Times. But when the American Medical
Association voted last week to promote unionization on a national
scale, the 290,000-member doctors' group opened the door to ...
well, it opened the door to a patient's worst nightmare. By BILL

<P>
   Kids shouldn't have all the fun this weekend. Jolly up the
festivities for the grown-ups with some upscale takes on childhood
summer favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Add a splash of tequila to the Popsicles, some white wine to the
lemonade, and have yourself a sparkling Fourth. And don't forget to
run through the sprinklers.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Cool comforts
</P>
<P>
   Popsicle: Invented by 11-year-old Frank Epperson when he left a
mixing stick in a glass of juice on a windowsill. In 1922, he
introduced the Epsicle and, wisely, later changed the name to
Popsicle.
</P>
<P>
   Granita: A classic frozen mixture of water, sugar and liquid
flavoring such as fruit juice, wine or coffee. Ices are stirred
often while freezing to yield a granular texture.
</P>
<P>
   Sorbet: Smoother than a granita but lighter and softer than a
sherbet; sorbets never contain milk.
</P>
<P>
   Sherbet: A combination of water and sweetened fruit juice. It
can also contain milk, egg whites or gelatin. It's heavier than
sorbet but lighter than ice cream.

<HEADLINE>
`SOUTH PARK': BIGGER, LONGER AND SILLIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a while, Trey Parker and Matt Stone seemed like a couple of
alpha males with a broken funny bone. Parker's flaccid porn lampoon
``Orgazmo'' and the duo's participation in ``BASEketball'' (they
starred), didn't exactly court brilliance. And their Comedy Central
animated series, ``South Park,'' had a spiteful elan that longevity
had been tamping into redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker and Stone's intrepid, shockingly indispensable and,
yes, take-no-prisoners hysterical ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and
Uncut'' has a crafty focus and ultimately a genius the equivalent
of walking into a glass door. Who knew it was there?
</P>
<P>
   As television, ``South Park'' was Parker and Stone's calling
card, and it only grows weary as it finds itself in a TV-censor
headlock, reiterating its agenda to bust convention's chops while
getting mired in some pretty standard fare of its own. Funny as it
often is, the show, about four kids and their eponymous Colorado
town, rarely has had the offensive scope and pointed verve of the
inaugural ``Spirit of Christmas'' short that launched ``South
Park'' into the subconscious of thousands via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Crass, reactionary, shallow, the show was a diabolical
``Peanuts'' _ or an anti-``Simpsons,'' a series whose unsinkable
wit made Parker and Stone look like a couple of trigger-happy
button-pushers interested in seeing what their brand of juvenilia
could get away with next.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, it was their warm-up for the facetious bloodletting that
is ``Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' a wicked musical satire that
manages to nestle itself smack in the midst of the censorship vs.
First Amendment debate that chews it up and spews it out as pop
culture detritus.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing _ not Saddam Hussein, not the Baldwin brothers, not even
Gandhi _ is sacred or safe. The film's fire-breathing gets under
way in the snowbound Dr. Suess-y opening number (written by Parker
and Hollywood schmaltz composer Marc Shaiman, who gets an
impossible make-over and animated cameo as the piano accompaniment
for the chintzy emcee Big Gay Al).
</P>
<P>
   The show's bite-size, middle-school regulars _ Cartman, Stan,
Kyle and Kenny _ are elated to see their heroes Terrance and
Phillip's ``R''-rated foray into big-screen flatulence. Terrance
and Phillip's show gives the boys the revelation that will drop
their jaws and change their lives: Compulsive swearing. Soon every
Brian Boitano-loving 12-year-old in South Park has busted into an
outrageous foul-language freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   TV characters have had to become movie characters to shift the
bad-influence argument from television to film. It's a shrewd,
awesome indictment of the faux malleability of young minds that
explodes into a war between South Park's youth and their irate
parents led by Kyle's mother, Sheila Broflovski. The adults are
looking for someone to blame, so they aim their contempt at Canada,
Terrance and Phillip's home.
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon ensues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' is a seismically satiric grab-bag
of artifacts, allusions, current events and kitsch that, unlike the
virtually plotless ``Spy Who Shagged Me,'' is dumped into the
film's three fine-tuned acts. Along with co-writer Pam Brady,
Parker and Stone have imagined the film, which Parker directs, as a
taloned Gilbert and Sullivan-mock-Broadway musical with a libretto
taut enough to make you renew belief in people breaking into song.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it works here not only because it's absurd but
because it's a brand of levity that serves as a respite from the
apocalyptic war being fought over Canada's American infiltration.
</P>
<P>
   The parents coalition strategizes to have Terrance and Phillip
electric-chaired in the midst of Big Gay Al's USO execution
extravaganza. Residents of South Park enlist in the Army to
obliterate the Canadians. ``Canada Sucks'' burnings are held _ and
even Canadian popster Alanis Morissette gets tossed in as tinder.
The kids, meanwhile _ led by Gregory, an urbane ``Les Miz'' reject
_ want to end the government practice of loading millions of
Canadians onto trucks and moving them to internment camps.
</P>
<P>
   This is merciless, but Parker and Stone use cynical insanity to
mock the misfired righteousness that obstructs common sense and
good parenting. How many mothers would jump at the chance to insert
an electro-shock V-Chip inside her potty-mouthed son, as Mrs.
Cartman does to Eric? It's just that much easier to let the
government wash your kid's mouth out with soap than to do it
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   One of the elements often overlooked about ``South Park'' is its
multitextured, arts-and-crafts look, which is key to its
subversiveness. On a big screen, laid out in all its homemade
pop-collage glory, ``South Park'' is a bracing aberration. It's a
world with the dimensional width of a portable ant farm. The
inhabitants look as if they were conceived from a still life done
on a Technicolor Etch-a-Sketch with an assortment of Peanuts and
Fisher Price roly-poly people for models. Parker and Stone use
their movie as an opportunity to imbue ``South Park'' with computer
effects that jab at movie digitalization.
</P>
<P>
   They kill Kenny early, and his afterlife is spent in a hell that
looks like the cover art of any metal record come to Satanic life.
His face still swallowed by his hood, Kenny, of course, remains his
construction paper-and-cardboard self now living in
computer-generated-imagery hell. It's a stark contrast to his
Colorado home. In hell, he's lorded over by a muscle-bound Satan
and his sexed-up paramour, Saddam Hussein, a magazine photo imposed
on a drawn body.
</P>
<P>
   The lovers are plotting to take over the world amid the first
amendment hells-a-poppin' on Earth. Theirs is a ridiculous,
astonishingly civil send-up of gay relationships.
</P>
<P>
   We learn that Satan's a closeted Samaritan in a joyless romance
who's been brainwashed to accept his evil role just because he
happens to be the devil. Parker and Stone have made the Lord of
Darkness the most developed, recognizably human gay character I've
ever seen in a Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's terrifying to think that ``South Park'' would have
something inspiring to sing about the gay lifestyle _ or figure
skater Brian Boitano, for that matter _ when the image machine is
content to keep the stereotypes rolling off the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no shame in finding supreme brilliance in a movie
peopled by a clique of vulgar friends who curse with more skillful
abandon than some hip-hoppers can rap.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone have given us scathing but optimistic savagery.

A COWBOY IN LA _ AND ON THE AIRWAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his hugely successful cookbook ``A Cowboy in the Kitchen,''
author and Reata executive chef Grady Spears writes: ``Back when I
was punching cows, if you'd told me I was going to be a chef
someday, I would have doubled up in laughter and fallen off my
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for Spears to be on horseback any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Reata restaurants, prosperous in Fort Worth and Alpine,
Texas, will be joined in September by a third on Rodeo Drive in Los
Angeles. Spears' cookbook, a well-written and illustrated
compilation of Reata and Trans-Pecos recipes, will be joined by two
other Spears works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cowboy Cocktails'' will be a collection of western drinks and
bar food. It is expected out in February. ``The Great Steak Book,''
full of beef recipes, grilling instructions and marinade recipes,
is expected in May.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough to keep the onetime cowboy out of the
saddle, he will soon begin production on a 26-week TV cooking show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is kind of weird,'' Spears said. ``I never did think about
doing a television show until I met Torri Randall in Los Angeles.
She asked me if anyone had asked about doing a TV show, and when I
told her no, she asked if I was interested. I said, `I guess.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Randall has produced several TV cooking shows for public
television and became interested in Spears after seeing a copy of
``A Cowboy in the Kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, she got the book for Christmas and loved it,''
Spears said. ``Now we are in pre-production, and it's been crazy. I
never even thought about doing this. It's like the book _ I never
thought about doing that either.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that planning is under way, Spears has become excited
about the project. Every segment of the cooking show will be shot
on location. That means someone's ranch, and that means Spears will
feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a set,'' he said. ``Sets are really
sterile; you have the same kitchens, the same things around you.
This is going to be on different ranches.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall has been in Texas to scout locations. Obviously, some
segments will be shot at Al Micallef's picturesque CF Ranch in
Alpine. Micallef is co-owner of the Reata group.
</P>
<P>
   Local rancher and horsewoman Kit Moncrief has offered her ranch
as a location, and ``they are really excited about that,'' Spears
said. ``Their minds are just kind of running. Everybody has been so
helpful; we're going to have more things to shoot than we ever
thought about.''
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour shows will be shot in February, weather
permitting. Spears said the shooting will probably take at least a
month and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do things related to the cookbook,'' he said.
``Actually, we'll feature recipes from all three books. We'll have
segments on `Chuck Box Secrets,' things like seasonings, blends and
sauces.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he never really thought of doing his own TV series,
Spears has done quite a bit of television. ``The more you get in
front of the camera, the more comfortable you get,'' he said. ``I
think shooting on locations will be easier than a studio. You don't
get bored with it. There is always something new.''
</P>
<P>
   The new series, also called ``A Cowboy in the Kitchen,'' will
crowd an already busy schedule for Spears.
</P>
<P>
   Spears will shepherd all of the events from his home in Texas.
He says he has no intentions of moving his base.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to LA, after about four days, I'm ready to come home
to Texas,'' he said. ``I'll never leave Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sample of Spears ingenuity from ``A Cowboy in the
Kitchen'' ($29.95, Ten Speed Press):

onion, peppers and garlic. Saute until the vegetables are wilted
and the catfish is cooked through, about 5 minutes. In a large
bowl, combine the cooked fish and vegetables, mayonnaise, chives,
cilantro, mustard, crumbs, egg, zest, salt, and pepper. Form the
mixed ingredients into 10 3-ounce patties. Pack the mixture fairly
tight so it will stay together while cooking. Set aside on a plate.

   Heat the peanut oil in a pan until smoking slightly. Dust each

Remove the cakes and drain them on a paper towel-lined pan. Serve
hot.

SAYING IT IN PIXELS, ROUND 2 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Digital cameras are getting better and faster and cheaper at a
motor-drive pace. A year ago the price of megapixel cameras, so
called because they capture images made up of more than a million
picture elements, fell below $1,000 for the first time. Now we are
seeing the first 2-megapixel cameras in the same price range, and
the best one so far is the Nikon Coolpix 950.
</P>
<P>
   The Coolpix 950 is available from several web-based retailers
for about $800. The camera is in demand among serious amateur
digital photographers not only because of its excellent image
quality, but also because it allows greater control over shutter
speed, contrast, image quality, brightness and metering _ features
that make the rest of us appreciate the simplicity of
point-and-shoot cameras. But fear not: the Coolpix 950 can also
turn out superior shots without requiring a lot of twiddling.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the camera is so good overall that its handful of
flaws stand out in sharp contrast, and become more vexing. And
because it is the first digital camera that I have seriously
considered as a replacement for my ancient but beloved
35-millimeter Leica, the Coolpix 950 may have inadvertently
persuaded me that I may not want a digital camera after all _ or at
least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   But first, let's focus on why the new Nikon is so good. For
starters, it takes sharp, detailed pictures. Like all other digital
cameras, it records the images not on film, but on a silicon sensor
called a charge-coupled device, or CCD. The Coolpix 950 has a
half-inch CCD that can capture 2.1 million pixels.
</P>
<P>
   With digital cameras, the difference between a shot captured at
2.1 megapixels and one at, say, 1.6 megapixels, is more apparent to
the printer than to the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lowest-cost, sub-megapixel digital cameras today
gather enough picture information to make a decent 4-inch by 6-inch
print, but with any size larger than that the image begins to break
up because often there are not enough pixels to fill the area. As a
result, the cheaper digital cameras are used mainly for instant
photography where image quality is not paramount, or for small
pictures like head shots for an employee data base, or pictures of
the new baby for a web page.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first megapixel cameras boasted that they had
sufficient resolution to make a decent 8-by-10 print, but not all
of them did. The new Nikon and other 2MP cameras pass the 8-by-10
test easily. (If you do not anticipate printing such large
pictures, you may be happier with a less-expensive megapixel camera
like the excellent Kodak DC-265.
</P>
<P>
   The Coolpix 950 is just a bit too large and heavy to fit
comfortably in a pocket, but it feels solid and secure in the hand.
With its two-piece, hinged design, and a swiveling lens unit, it
does not look like a conventional camera. One can frame and focus
the shot through the lens in the view-finder, or on a 2-inch color
liquid crystal display on the back.
</P>
<P>
   The camera stores its images on a matchbook-sized Type 1 Compact
Flash card. The card that comes with the Nikon holds 8 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   And here is where some little things about the Nikon began to
annoy me. Eight megabytes is a very stingy amount of storage for a
2-megapixel camera. While one can reduce the image quality and size
to fit more shots on the card, most people who spend this kind of
money for a 2MP camera will want to shoot at the top
(1,600-by-1,200 pixels) resolution with minimal image compression.
Doing so limits the number of shots that can be saved on the basic
card, to 16 shots at normal compression, which causes some loss of
image quality, or even just 1 shot with no compression. After that,
the card has to be emptied by discarding shots or transferring them
to a PC.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to buy a larger-capacity card, but a 64-megabyte
Type 1 card costs $160 or more. Or, Nikon could have added a
slightly larger Type II slot, which would have enabled the Coolpix
950 to use IBM's expensive but clever new 340MB Microdrive. But it
didn't. And it placed the Compact Flash card slot on the bottom of
the camera, which means that to change memory cards, tripod users
have to break down and then set up their shots all over again.
</P>
<P>
   And to transfer the images to a computer, Nikon includes only a
serial port cable, which is agonizingly slow. It should have used a
faster USB port, or an even faster IEEE 1394 (Firewire) port.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikon eats batteries like a goat, going through a set of
double-A alkalines in about a half hour. So, if you plan to spend
the day shooting pictures, you should also plan to pick up a couple
of sets of rechargeable nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries
(about $10 for a set of four, plus $8 or so for a recharger). For
indoor work, an AC power converter is a must. Instead of standard
equipment, however, it is a $59 option.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the Coolpix 950's many positives (image quality,
feature set, zoom lens, superb macro focus, and so on) far outweigh
its negatives (occasionally poor low-light focusing, battery
gluttony, limited memory, port problems, et cetera).
</P>
<P>
   Because it is so good overall, the Coolpix 950 caused me to
think about giving up the Leicaflex my father loaned me some 30
years ago. (I'll return it soon, Dad, I promise.) The Leica is
magnificently un-digital, as rugged and heavy as a brick, but it
takes great 35-millimeter pictures.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, thanks to a new service called Kodak Picture CD, it can
take great digital pictures, too _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak, in partnership with the Intel Corporation, has made it
easier for people to get involved with digital photography. The
photographer takes a roll of film to be processed, checks the box
for Picture CD, and receives back not just a set of prints, but
also a compact disc that contains high-quality digitized images of
all the shots plus an assortment of simple photo-editing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Let's compare: I can spend $1,000 (counting accessories) on the
Nikon, and I'll have a top-quality digital camera that gives me the
instant gratification of seeing all my shots on the camera's LCD
screen. I'll never have to buy film or visit a processing lab
again. In just a few minutes, the images are in my computer, where
they can be cropped, touched up, sent to grandma by e-mail, posted
on a web site, or printed. Plus, digital cameras are cool.
</P>
<P>
   Or, I can take any existing 35-millimeter camera _ even one of
the cheap disposable kind _ shoot a roll of film, drive to the
drugstore, and get a Kodak Picture CD back along with my prints in
48 hours for an extra $8.95 to $10.95 on top of the photo
development charges. Eventually, Kodak and Intel say, they will
offer one-hour CD service. Even at a 48-hour turnaround time, it is
a bit faster than sending the film to one of several mail-order
developers, like Seattle Filmworks (www.seattlefilmworks.com), who
post the customer's digitized prints on a password-protected web
site 24 hours after the film reaches the company.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's nationwide network of film processing labs, using
powerful Intel workstation computers, scan the 35-millimeter shots
at a resolution of 1,536-by-1,024 pixels and scan Advanced Photo
System shots at 1,536-by-864 pixels. This is not as sharp as
Nikon's 1,600-by-1,200, but better than most digital cameras today.
Then I can transfer the photo files from my disk and manage them
any way I like, just as if they came from a digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   For those who are committed to the idea of digital photography,
buying a digital camera makes sense. For those who are intrigued
but still unsure, the Picture CD route is a less-expensive way to
get started.
</P>
<P>
   And that raises the old obsolescence bugaboo that is so familiar
to people who own anything with a computer chip in it.
</P>
<P>
   The Leicaflex, despite once being dropped from a hot-air
balloon, takes pictures today that are just as sharp as the ones it
took in 1969. I can't imagine using the same digital camera for 30
years, when I know that a better-faster-cheaper camera will be
available from Nikon and other companies by this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend $1,000 on a 35-millimeter camera, you get a very
good camera that you're probably planning to keep for a number of
years,'' said Jon Pepper, chief editor of the digital imaging
newsletter Digital Focus (www.digfocus.com). ``Technology products
get cheaper and cheaper, but if you have to replace them every few
years, maybe they're not that great a value.''

RUNS WITH LOSANGELES-TOURBOX  
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ They're coming. You know they are. They already
wrote or called or e-mailed to express their intent.
</P>
<P>
   Your friends or relatives from points distant, perhaps the
Midwest or East, have let it be known that they'd like to drop in
for a visit this summer _ and, if it's at all convenient, be shown
around Los Angeles, the place Raymond Chandler referred to as ``a
big, hard-boiled city with no more personality than a paper cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of your guests' stops will be predestined and
non-negotiable: Disneyland, one of the movie studio tours, perhaps
Mann's Chinese Theater. But if you're going to be stuck playing
tour guide, you'd at least like to show them a few sights that
might better capture the essence of the region.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe contradict Chandler in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Gas up the car. Try to keep smiling. And no matter how thick the
smog blanket or how tangled the traffic tie-ups, remember to act
smug about the privilege of living here _ your visitors will expect
nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   Here's your list: &QL; 
1. Griffith Observatory
</P>
<P>
   You won't find a better overview of the heart of the city. This
imposing, white edifice was built on a promontory high in the
Hollywood Hills, completed in 1933 _ a time when there was no acute
light pollution to foul up astronomical studies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best time to visit this place is at night, when the
source of all that light provides a stunning display of the breadth
of L.A. Walk around the front parapet of the observatory. Stop
somewhere in the center. And take it all in.
</P>
<P>
   That cluster of high-rises slightly left is downtown _ you can
tell your guests that in spite of the city's reputation for
glamour, that area becomes a ghost town after the sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Just left of that, if the Dodgers are home for the evening, you
can catch the glow of lights from Dodger Stadium. The tall
buildings that string out across the basin hug Wilshire Boulevard,
which stretches to Westwood and then the sea. If conditions are
right, you can make out the low hills of Catalina Island just
offshore. Far to the south, you can see the planes stacked up on
approach to LAX.
</P>
<P>
   That seemingly endless boulevard in front of you, the one that
disappears into the horizon, is Western Avenue. It stretches nearly
30 miles, clear to San Pedro; and no, there is no need to traverse
it.
</P>
<P>
   On a clear night, the observatory will have the Zeiss telescope
(on the second level) trained on some planet or nebula, and there
is no charge to look. The kids also might want to wander through
the Hall of Science inside, which is free. It has the feel of a
1960s school science fair, and you can step onto a scale and see
how much you weigh on Jupiter or Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for visiting the observatory at night: You're
less likely to notice that the building is in desperate need of a
coat of paint; you might want to drop a couple of bucks in the
donation bin. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2. Sunset Boulevard
</P>
<P>
   When outsiders see L.A. in their mind's eye, they're on this
road. You should drive it from the ocean (Pacific Coast Highway) to
the center of Hollywood (Vine Street), a span of 18 miles for which
you should allow 1{ hours (including a stop for eats). Along the
way, you'll cover every L.A. cliche in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after beginning the climb from Pacific Coast Highway,
you'll come upon an ornate, gaudy place of worship: the
Self-Realization Fellowship and Lake Shrine. Preoccupation with
self _ ah, quintessential L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The road winds through the tree-lined, self-conscious village of
Pacific Palisades, alongside the eucalyptus grove that shades
Riviera Country Club, home to Hogan's Alley (it's private, but you
might be allowed in for a peek if you're dressed nicely) and into
Brentwood. Your guests will probably plead for you to stop by
O.J.'s house, or at least the site where the house used to stand
before it was torn down and replaced. Do the world a favor and
adamantly refuse; just say, ``It's somewhere up there to the
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after crossing the San Diego (405) Freeway, you'll come to
Deadman's Curve, immortalized in song by Jan and Dean (the big,
downhill sweep just past Veteran Avenue). UCLA is on the right;
flat-rate parking off Westwood Plaza is $5 if anyone wants to buy a
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes the land of Norma Desmond: Bel-Air, Beverly Hills.
You'll know you're in the latter as soon as the road improves.
</P>
<P>
   The imposing, pink-and-green Beverly Hills Hotel, which the
Eagles used for the album cover of ``Hotel California,'' is on the
left. And yes, the ZIP code here really is 90210.
</P>
<P>
   When the potholes are evident again, you're in West Hollywood
and entering the fabled Sunset Strip: the Whiskey (they dropped the
``a Go-Go'' a while back), movie murals on buildings, billboards
(including the recently emasculated Marlboro man), the art-deco
Argyle Hotel, Carney's hot dog stand, and the Chateau Marmont
hotel, where John Belushi ended his life.
</P>
<P>
   Carney's, housed in a real Union Pacific rail car (at Kings
Road), is a good spot to knock down a hunger. Beware of the chili,
though.
</P>
<P>
   This trip can be capped off _ perhaps fittingly _ with a stop at
the Chinese Theater. Simply head north on Vine Street and double
back on Hollywood Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
3. The Getty Center
</P>
<P>
   Who says L.A. is a cultural wasteland? This place will show 'em.
Except that one of the treasures of the museum's permanent
collection, Van Gogh's ``Irises,'' is on loan to another museum
until October. Oh well.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of other stuff to look at here, though, provided
you can abide decorative arts. And the view and the gardens alone
are worth the visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty is perched high in the Santa Monica Mountains on the
west side of the city. There is no admission. The only cost is $5
for parking, but you need a reservation for that, so plan ahead
(see details in accompanying chart).
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival, head straight through the entrance hall and out
into the museum courtyard, then cut between the west and south
pavilions onto a point called South Promontory.
</P>
<P>
   Then catch your breath _ it was sure to have been taken away by
this view of the basin and the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Only now should you take on an art tour. To that end, the Getty
seems keenly tailored to L.A.: Back in the entrance hall, there are
two different tour brochures titled ``If You Only Have an Hour.''
But it also honors this city through its design _ the pavilions are
positioned around the open-air courtyard, and sunlight pours into
stairwells through enormous banks of windows. In the twilight, as
the setting sun reflects off the walls of travertine stone, the
place is positively enchanting.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you save time for an unhurried walk in the gardens,
which are terraced into a steep hillside. The area is crisscrossed
with a gentle ramp that is friendly to strollers, wheelchairs and
visitors both very young and very elderly.
</P>
<P>
   A delicious, reasonably priced lunch can be had at the Museum
Cafe, which features open-air seating and a distracting view of the
ocean. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
4. Mulholland Drive
</P>
<P>
   This route, which courses along the spine of the Santa Monica
Mountains, was built in the 1920s to fulfill the dream of William
Mulholland, L.A.'s chief engineer and water guru.
</P>
<P>
   Drive it in either direction between the San Diego (405) and
Ventura (101) freeways, but, as with Sunset, west to east might be
best. Although this span covers only 13 miles, it's probably wise
to allow an hour to traverse it.
</P>
<P>
   From numerous vista points, see what the Owens Valley's water
hath wrought: the sprawling sweep of the San Fernando Valley to the
north, the crowded L.A. basin to the south.
</P>
<P>
   People of means pay a great deal of money for these views. And
for privacy. You'll see a number of heavily fortified gates with
long driveways that disappear into the hills, leading to
unimaginable palaces of excess. Warren Beatty and Annette Bening
reside somewhere behind the imposing gate at 13671 Mulholland
Drive. Marlon Brando has digs at 12900.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of official viewpoints, with parking lots,
but as for the dirt turnouts, you can only linger during daylight
hours. The influence of these residents is obviously considerable _
the city seems to have spent a fortune on ``No Stopping'' signs. If
you travel this route at night, you'll have to be content with
taking in views without slowing down or getting out of your car _
which, actually, is itself an L.A. tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff of west-east transit is the Hollywood Bowl overlook,
just before you reach Cahuenga Boulevard (look for the concrete
sign and wrought-iron fence on the south side of the road). Here
your guests can survey the Hollywood sign, the Hollywood Bowl, the
distinctive Capitol Records building (designed to resemble a stack
of records on a turntable changer) and the Hollywood Freeway
snaking through the entire scene. &QL; 
5. Long Beach Aquarium
</P>
<P>
   When you drive near the ocean, or view it from one of the
lookouts previously described, you're left to imagine the life that
teems below its surface. At this 1-year-old aquarium, the
underwater world is brought to life for you.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike's L.A.'s bygone Marineland, sea creatures are presented
in an approximation of their natural habitat; there are no seals
trained to play a series of horns. And you get to see it as a scuba
diver would _ without having to fuss with tanks and wet suit and
the ungodly chill of the waters off these shores.
</P>
<P>
   There are three major exhibit areas, and the first one you're
steered into is devoted, in fact, to Southern California and Baja
California marine life. One tank features sea lions and harbor
seals. You can observe their behavior beneath the surface through
an enormous window, then, after climbing to an outdoor area, watch
from above as they poke their heads out of the water and bob on the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Another tank features sea turtles. In another, tiny eels from
the Sea of Cortez poke their heads from the sand like aquatic
earthworms.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach Aquarium has become home to two sea otters who
were orphaned off Monterey during last year's El Nino storms. They
are the focus of the aquarium's Sea Otter Summer promotion, which
runs through Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   It's an extremely kid-friendly place. Aware of the compulsion of
small children to want to touch unfamiliar things, guides
periodically set up hands-on exhibits where kids can feel the
surface of a starfish or run their finger through the sticky petals
of a sea anemone. At one tank, they can bend over a railing and run
their hands over rays and skates as the creatures swim by below.
</P>
<P>
   The true highlight is saved for the end. After the northern
Pacific exhibit, you wander into one devoted to the tropical
Pacific. Here are brightly colored reef fish of dramatic hues, some
of the fish seemingly luminescent. There are also sea horses and
strange-looking Australian sea dragons.
</P>
<P>
   And of course sharks. The reef sharks, mere 2- and 3-footers but
looking no less sinister than their larger cousins, prompt squeals
of excitement from young visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium crawls with kids from day camps on weekdays, and it
is suffocatingly crowded on weekends. A guide said the quietest
times to visit are weekdays after 2 p.m. (when the campers have
left) and just after opening (9 a.m.) on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For lunch, sandwiches and salads are pre-made and serviceable at
Cafe Scuba, and the patio dining affords views of the Queen Mary
across the harbor channel. There are no dishes on the menu made
with fish, however, not even tuna. A server said this was done for
a reason: ``We didn't want customers asking if we'd just pulled it
out of one of our tanks.'' &QL; 
(SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. Huntington Library
</P>
<P>
   As you pull onto the lush grounds of the Huntington Library, you
can tell your guests, ``This used to be some guy's home.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just any guy, though: Henry E. Huntington, one of industry's
robber barons of the early 20th century. He made his money in
railroads _ enough to establish his estate on 600 acres of the
former San Marino Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   It's 150 acres now, with expansive gardens _ the Camellia, Rose,
Japanese and Desert gardens are particularly impressive _ providing
numerous options for peaceful strolling. The art is housed in the
former mansion.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, you might be inclined to spend the bulk of your
time here out of doors, which is just as well. Although Huntington
was a devotee of rare books, his legacy has been poorly served
lately. The two most notable items in the permanent collection, a
Gutenberg Bible and an illuminated manuscript of Chaucer's ``The
Canterbury Tales,'' both dating to the 15th century, have been on
display _ though incongruously in a room packed with 18th-century
clocks, tapestries and furniture from France's Age of Decadence.
</P>
<P>
   Other treasures, however, are tucked away in storage as the
Huntington devotes its largest hall to temporary exhibits. That
means you likely won't get a chance to see the treasure trove of
works that used to be displayed there: early editions of
Shakespeare, Henry David Thoreau's corrected proof sheets, and the
handwritten letters of Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mark Twain and
others. Beginning Friday, a small sampling of this collection is
expected to be exhibited in a tiny room to the left of the
library's main entrance.
</P>
<P>
   In the art galleries, the highlights of the collection _ at
least they haven't been hidden away _ are Thomas Gainsborough's
``The Blue Boy'' and Thomas Lawrence's ``Pinkie,'' but for an
antidote to portraiture there is also ``View of the Stour Near
Dedham'' by John Constable.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Old Town Pasadena can be found only a few miles to
the north and west, along Colorado Boulevard. It's a fun, generally
safe place for window-shopping and people-watching, although a
recent contagion of chain retail stores has undermined its charm.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hungry, Mi Piace is excellent for Italian, Gordon
Biersch for microbrews, California pub food and patio dining.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
7. Malibu/Zuma Beach
</P>
<P>
   If your visitors are from a landlocked locale _ and let's face
it, most of America is that _ they won't feel their trip is
complete until they walk along a beach and get at least their
ankles splashed by surf.
</P>
<P>
   This can be done at numerous spots along the coast, but a
pilgrimage to this region should be planned nonetheless. It
fulfills the heartland fantasy of California beach life.
</P>
<P>
   The trip along Pacific Coast Highway can be planned as short
(Malibu Canyon Road to Zuma), medium (Topanga Canyon Road to Zuma)
or long (Santa Monica (10) Freeway to Zuma), but each excursion
will provide sweeping views of the coast, glimpses of bluffside
mansions, evidence of perpetual mudslides inland and the payoff of
a broad, sandy, generally clean beach at Zuma.
</P>
<P>
   North of Malibu Canyon Road _ right after you pass every
collegian's dream location for a school, Pepperdine University _
the land becomes more open as you leave behind the clog of roadside
businesses and the ramshackle million-dollar homes that cling to
this route farther south.
</P>
<P>
   The highway also rises and falls, which presents some tremendous
views of the coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Paradise Cove that Frankie Avalon and Annette
Funicello frolicked in their ``Beach Blanket Bingo'' movies,
helping to kick-start the surfing craze of 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   About 8{ miles north of Pepperdine, just past the traffic light
at Heathercliff, a small sign indicates the exit for Zuma Beach,
which requires you to swing right and circle through a tunnel that
runs beneath the highway. A $6 parking fee will gain you entry to
this state beach, which is more than two miles long and features
plenty of parking lots, restrooms and snack shacks.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is Westward Beach, immediately to the south
(parking is free along Westward Beach Road, if you're lucky enough
to have a space suddenly free up for you). And farther south, at
the end of this road, another state parking lot ($6 daily) is
administered at Point Dume.
</P>
<P>
   Lifeguards oversee this entire stretch of beach (heed their
warnings on riptides if your visitors want to go in to get creamed
by a wave). You'll notice that the guards are obligingly attired in
``Baywatch''-red suits and carry as props those red plastic floats.
</P>
<P>
   If lunch isn't a picnic on the beach, consider Duke's, south of
Pepperdine at the intersection of PCH and Las Flores Canyon Road.
Its Barefoot Bar has a patio area with trucked-in sand where you
can sip beer, eat fish tacos and watch the surfers catch the break
off the small point. On the restaurant walls, black-and-white
photos capture surfing's early heyday in the '50s and '60s, when
this area was affectionately called ``The Bu.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
8. Olvera Street
</P>
<P>
   It all started near here, in the late 1700s, when some Spanish
soldiers camped by a river that is now a flood-control channel and
named it El Rio Nuestra Senora La Reina de Los Angeles de
Porciuncula. The pueblo settlement that would follow took the same
name.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, the name was ultimately shortened _ to Los Angeles,
and then to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Olvera Street, on the northwestern edge of downtown, is now
presented as a Mexican village market, offering leather goods,
bright-colored garments with elaborate embroidery, sugary candy
made from squash ... and also depressing junk, like cheap
sunglasses and photos of pro wrestling stars.
</P>
<P>
   Look past these desecrations, however, and concentrate on the
setting. Many of the buildings date to the early 1800s. Mature
bougainvillea plants, with trunks as thick as your arm, crack their
ancient brick planters. Olive trees crowd the holes that were cut
in the concrete for them long ago. Grape vines cling to lines tied
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Squint a little and you might even be able to imagine life in
early L.A.
</P>
<P>
   A Visitors Center is supposedly open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Monday through Saturday, but the lone attendant was encountered
closing the door at 1:30. ``Going to lunch,'' she said
perfunctorily, but she at least provided one of the free
walking-tour guides before locking up.
</P>
<P>
   A fine Mexican snack, lunch or dinner _ with more character than
you'll find at your favorite haunt in the suburbs _ can be found at
Casa La Golondrina, a converted home. You might even encounter
troubadours singing Mexican love songs as they stroll among the
tables.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow alley at Olvera Street's midpoint leads to the Avila
Adobe, built in 1818 and said to be Los Angeles' oldest house. The
U-shaped dwelling appears to have been a comfortable-enough place:
wood floors, open beams, thick walls, a veranda with a broad
overhang to offer relief from the blistering summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   The patio out back even has a great spot for a pool. Guess they
never got around to putting it in.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. has been known to have that kind of effect on its
inhabitants. &QL;

   Debbie Collins e-mails a request for a Coca-Cola cake. Here's
one from the Internet at www.wwki.com, a radio station Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The second offering was sent in by Susan Harrison of Bedford,
Texas, who saw the recipe for spaghetti salad we ran last week. She
clipped this recipe from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram some time ago
and writes that it always gets raves.
</P>
<P>
   COKE CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8-10
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups miniature marshmallows
</P>
<P>
   Combine sugar and flour in large bowl. In a saucepan, combine
butter, shortening, cocoa and Coke; heat until butter is melted.
Pour over flour mixture and stir well by hand. Add buttermilk,
soda, eggs, vanilla and marshmallows. Mix well by hand and spoon
into a well-greased 9-by-13-by-2-inch pan. Marshmallows will tend
to lump in one place; distribute them thoroughly in pan. Bake in
preheated 350-degree oven for 45 minutes or until cake tests done.
Spread with frosting while cake is still hot.
</P>
<P>
   Frosting:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter
</P>

   3 tablespoons cocoa
</P>
<P>
   1 pound powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   About 5 minutes before cake is done, combine butter, Coke and
cocoa, and bring to a boil. Stir in other ingredients and pour over
hot cake while it is still in the pan. Topping will be thin, but
will thicken as it cools on the cake. Cool in pan until cake is
completely cool before serving.

LITTLE SANDERSON SETTLES ON A PRICKLY SOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fourth of July is a big time in Sanderson; always has been.
This year, the festivities will include an antique car show, rodeo,
baseball tournament, American Legion barbecue, old settlers'
reunion and a street dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it a concert so the Baptists will come,'' Terrell
County Judge Dudley Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be more than just fireworks at this year's
celebration. This is the year that Sanderson begins its comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassed years ago by Interstate 10 from San Antonio to El Paso,
Sanderson has quietly dried up.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of the people counted in the 1990 Census have
left. The 1,000 remaining residents have watched the economic
mainstays of wool and the railroad disappear like sand through
their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we've been hurt so bad,'' Harrison said. ``We've seen wool
prices fall to 12 1/2 cents a pound. The loss of the wool subsidies
cost this community about $3.5 million a year. We lost our rail
yard, and that cost $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, there is a rebound. The Legislature has declared
Sanderson the ``Cactus Capital of Texas.'' The Senate Resolution
recognizes cactus as ``renowned for its remarkable ability to
thrive in conditions that include periodic drought, dust, extreme
heat and flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   It says that the people of Sanderson are kind of like that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the week we're going to make it all official,''
Harrison said of the state proclamation. ``We finally got it
through the Legislature and signed by the governor. We're going to
present it to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson, 120 miles northwest of Del Rio on U.S. 90, steps out
of the dusty West Texas shadows this weekend to assume its crown as
Cactus Capital. Harrison said that the effort to develop tourism
has helped the economy some, but that getting the visitors to West
Texas is one thing and keeping them there is another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a little museum,'' he said. ``We have wonderful
churches, a fine school system, but no big parks, or swimming
holes. Nothing to hold them.''
</P>
<P>
   The city and county are developing plans for a network of
walking trails in the surrounding mountains. Birding is big in
Sanderson, Harrison said, and if the community can develop birding
trails, people might come and stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got every old lady in town busy filling feeders,''
Harrison said with a laugh. ``This could give everybody a shot in
the arm. It could uplift this whole community.''
</P>

DOCTORS' UNION IS NOT WHAT I'D PRESCRIBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just what we need: unionized doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, we already have some _ about 40,000 doctors belong to
various unions, according to the The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   But when the American Medical Association voted last week to
promote unionization on a national scale, the 290,000-member
doctors' group opened the door to ... well, it opened the door to a
patient's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, is this John Doe? Mr. Doe, Dr. Schmoe won't be able to
perform your liver transplant tomorrow because he and the other
doctors here at the hospital are involved in a labor dispute with
the hospital management.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you telling me that my doctor _ the dedicated surgeon who
is scheduled to perform a delicate, demanding and urgently needed
operation for the purpose of saving my life _ won't be operating
because he's ON STRIKE?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one way of putting it, I suppose. Don't worry, Mr. Doe,
we'll get back to you just as soon as the strike is over. Nothing
is more important to Dr. Schmoe than your health and welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy, you say? Cheap shot, you say? Doctors are professionals
who would never risk their patients' lives by going on strike, you
say?
</P>
<P>
   That's what they say, too.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA says its unionization push is designed to give doctors
more clout in dealing with managed-care insurance operations such
as HMOs _ to benefit patients, in other words, not jeopardize their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   But when has a labor union ever acted in the interest of anyone
or anything other than the union? In their single-minded
determination to advance the union's agenda, plenty of labor
organizations have gone so far as to ignore the interests of their
own members; it would be a historic occasion indeed if a union
should ever give a moment's thought to the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a doctor's union be less self-serving than any other
labor organization?
</P>
<P>
   A staff and wire report in the Star-Telegram quoted the AMA's
chairman, Dr. Randolph D. Smoak:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not for all physicians. This will not be a traditional
labor union. Your doctors will not strike or endanger patient care.
We will follow the principles of medical ethics every step of the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane M. Orient, executive director of the Association of
American Physicians and Surgeons, offered a dissenting opinion in a
statement distributed by the U.S. Newswire:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS)
opposes the AMA's decision to organize doctors into an AMA union.
This move is not about protecting patients, but about furthering
the AMA's political power and strangle hold on medicine, and can
only result in a blot on the professionalism of physicians and
decreased trust of doctors ....
</P>
<P>
   ``If it walks like a union and quacks like a union, you can be
sure it will look like any other big labor organization with a
mission of protecting itself and its leadership. Patients can only
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The AMA says that its union movement will involve only salaried
doctors who qualify as employees under federal law. But a bill
being debated in Congress could give self-employed doctors the
right to participate in collective bargaining as well _ a
development that would make the Mr. Doe-Dr. Schmoe scenario far
less fanciful than it might seem at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what would happen if there were a nationwide doctors'
strike: lifesaving operations canceled, hospital emergency rooms
disrupted, desperately needed medicines left unprescribed.
</P>
<P>
   And if the doctors walk, won't the nurses and the ambulance
drivers walk with them?
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for disgruntled airline pilots to leave
passengers stranded in airports by calling in sick, for striking
UPS drivers to let packages pile up on loading docks, for refuse
workers to refuse to pick up garbage. We're talking about major
inconvenience, gigantic aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   Unionized doctors could shut down the health-care system. People
could die.
</P>
<P>
   And what would lead us to believe that it won't happen?
</P>

   Jesse Jackson's driver pulls up in front of a U.S. Airways sign
at Washington National Airport when Amy Dupree of Addison, Texas,
recognizes him. Jackson, sitting in the front seat, continues a
conversation on his cellular telephone as Dupree and her husband,
Kyle, wait patiently to take a photograph with him.
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson emerges from the sedan several moments later, Amy
Dupree says, ``We're very proud of what you did.'' She tells
Jackson of her work getting women out of the ``adult
entertainment'' business _ she is a former topless dancer _ and how
God has changed her life.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says, ``God bless you,'' poses for a photo, and with
Yirgalem ``Yuri'' Tadesse, national director of international
affairs for Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, and this journalist
in tow, he heads for U.S. Airways Flight 6480, the 3 p.m. shuttle
bound for New York's La Guardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing on ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' the
previous night, Jackson is returning for a second-straight
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Louis Jackson, fresh from securing the release of three
U.S. soldiers imprisoned for little more than a month in
Yugoslavia, is being heralded as an American hero. This was not the
first time Jackson had gone on a successful mercy mission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he obtained the freedom of Navy flier Lt. Robert O.
Goodman Jr., who had been shot down over Lebanon. Later in the
year, he got Fidel Castro to release 22 Americans (most of them
held on drug charges) and 26 Cubans from prisons. Jackson also
persuaded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to release 500 foreign
nationals being held against their will.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Yugoslavia, however, provided Jackson with the
brightest spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for bringing our boys back home,'' says a middle-age
man with a middle-age middle. ``You're a real American hero.'' At
Legal Sea Foods, a restaurant in the airport, a group of women
pound on a window, wave and smile broadly as Jackson waves back. An
airline employee wants an autograph for his mother _ at least
that's what he says _ and two giddy teen-agers want to pose with
the world's best-known human rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane, it's more of the same. ``America thanks you ...
Good going, Jesse ... I just want to shake your hand.'' As he
settles in an aisle seat 20 rows back for an overdue interview, an
exhausted Jackson speaks for a few minutes and then suspends the
conversation to take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane lands in New York, he is refreshed and picks up
the conversation exactly where he left off. ``I always thought that
if we got close enough to touch them, we would leave with them,''
he recalls, referring to the soldiers. ``But it was strictly a
faith mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what Jackson says, these are not strictly faith
missions, though faith plays an intricate role. Nor are they merely
publicity stunts in which Jackson is used by unpopular foreign
leaders to manipulate U.S. public opinion. And despite the howls
from the State Department, he goes on these missions with their
tacit approval. After all, they made no effort to lift his
passport. How does he do it?
</P>
<P>
   First, Jackson is brash enough to think that he and only he can
pull off these feats. And so far, he has been right. Generally, he
has obtained the release of prisoners after the State Department
has failed, after back-channel negotiations through third parties
have failed and, in some cases, after U.S. or international
military intervention has failed, as was the case in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In each case Jackson knew when to make his move. Whether it's
securing the release of Goodman or the three Army soldiers _ Staff
Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher
J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales,
22, of Huntsville, Texas _ Jackson picks the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. M. William Howard Jr., president of the New York
Theological Seminary and a former president of the National Council
of Churches, remembers when Jackson decided to seek Goodman's
release. A group of ministers were huddling with tax attorneys in
Memphis to see how they could assist Jackson's 1984 presidential
bid without jeopardizing their federal tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse was bored out of his mind,'' Howard recalls. ``We broke
for lunch and went up to his suite. Wherever he is, he sends out
for this greasy fried chicken. He had sent somebody out to a
Popeye's, I believe it was. They brought in these buckets of
chicken. We were sitting around watching TV at lunchtime. I kid you
not, there was a news flash about how Donald H. Rumsfeld (NATO
ambassador under President Richard M. Nixon) had gone to Syria and
they were talking about the war in Lebanon and tensions with
Israel. They said nothing about Goodman.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point, Howard says, that Jackson sat up and
resolved to get a delegation of religious leaders together to go
and get Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   On his recent trip to Yugoslavia, Jackson followed that same
pattern of assembling a list of high-level religious leaders to
accompany him, including Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general
secretary of the National Council of Churches; an American rabbi; a
priest of the Orthodox Church in America; a Greek bishop; a Serbian
Orthodox bishop; a Baptist minister; an Islamic leader; and a
Methodist bishop. Also with them was Rep. Rod R. Blagojevich
(D-Ill.), the only Serbian-American member of Congress, and other
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson delegation received a formal invitation to visit
their religious counterparts in Yugoslavia. However, just before
departing, they were urged by National Security Council adviser
Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger to call off the trip, reminding them that
their safety could not be assured and that the bombing would not
halt just because they were in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it clear that if we were to get killed going in a
bombing zone, it would represent the ultimate PR coup for
Milosevic,'' Jackson says. ``That was their fear. But they could
have ended that fear just by stopping the bombing while we were
there.'' But they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   On the night the delegation arrived at the Belgrade Hyatt hotel,
the NATO bombing was among the heaviest of the war up to that time,
with some bombs landing just blocks away. ``They never stopped
bombing,'' Jackson says, clearly angry. ``They never stopped
bombing next to us. I think it aroused in us the fires of
determination. I was mentally prepared, spiritually fortified,
psyched, pumped, ready. War was so wrong, and our cause was so
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian officials promised Jackson protection once he was in
the country. They took him and Western reporters on a tour of a
residential area that they said had been hit by NATO's bombs.
During his trip, Jackson told the Yugoslavs that until there was a
peace agreement, the bombs would continue falling. He also repeated
NATO's requirements before there could be a cessation of bombing.
When it was time to meet the young men, only Jackson and
Blagojevich were allowed to visit, even then under the watchful
eyes of a military judge.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were brought in separately and left separately.
Stone, who had bruises healing on the left side of his forehead,
spoke with the visitors first and for the longest amount of time.
The U.S. delegation had brought the soldiers Bibles, small
religious icons, candy, a tape recorder and separate tape-recorded
messages from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The military judge denied Jackson's request to give the gifts
directly to the captive men, saying they had to be inspected. Each
soldier reported that he had been treated well and was feeling
good, considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, air-raid sirens sounded and the military judge
called for an end to the visit. But Jackson pressed on, asking that
the three soldiers be brought in together. His request was granted
and the men were reunited for the first time since they were
captured along the Yugoslav-Macedonian border on March 31.
Together, they prayed. ``Help is on the way and hope is in the
air,'' Jackson said. ``Soon, very soon, you will know peace and
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the delegates were allowed to meet with President
Slobodan Milosevic for three hours. In that meeting, they urged
Milosevic to free the soldiers. Bishop Dimitrios of Xanthos of the
Greek Orthodox Church says, ``(Jackson) was persuasive and just
would not let up. He kept saying, 'It's in your power. You can do
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the meeting, Milosevic portrayed NATO as the
aggressor in the conflict, just as the White House had feared. In
Milosevic's view, he was the victim. But when he asked who was
responsible for the bombings, Dr. Nazir Uddin Khaja, a California
physician and president of the American Muslim Council, replied,
``You are responsible.'' According to Khaja, Milosevic seemed
surprised. ``The whole group said that in one way or another. Maybe
I was more direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson met privately with Milosevic for about 20 minutes.
Milosevic promised to think about the request for freedom. Jackson
had been back at the hotel for 15 minutes when the delegation
received a call to meet with Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic at
his private residence. When they arrived, he told them, ``I am
pleased to tell you that President Milosevic has issued a decree
today releasing the three soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, there was a formal signing ceremony, which was broadcast
on U.S. television. With cameras rolling, Jackson had the soldiers
sounding more like civil rights workers than military men. They
chanted, ``'Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we're
free at last!''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson delegation left with the freed prisoners in a
Yugoslav bus. Under police escort, they were driven to the Croatian
border. From there, the soldiers were transferred to a Croatian
tourist bus rented by the U.S. Embassy and were driven to the Pleso
airstrip in Zagreb. Then they were flown to Ramstein Air Base in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the soldiers were whisked away to the Landstuhl
Regional Medical Center for a couple of days of testing before
their families arrived. So the Jackson group proceeded to
Washington, without the fruits of their labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Jackson had obtained the release of Goodman,
the pilot was not delayed by military authorities in Europe;
instead, the group was flown home aboard Air Force One and treated
to a ceremony in the Rose Garden. That was under Ronald Reagan, a
Republican president viewed as hostile to civil rights. Under
Clinton, who prides himself as a friend of African-Americans,
Jackson did not receive the red-carpet treatment, causing Jackson
to view the administration as ingrates.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he was ``very pleased'' that the soldiers were
coming home, Clinton said that nearly 1.5 million Kosovars could
not enjoy similar freedom. The president said conditions for ending
the bombing were simple: ``The Kosovars must be able to go home
with security and self-government, Serbian security forces must
leave Kosovo. An international security force must deploy with the
power not just to monitor but to protect all the people of Kosovo,
Albanians and Serbs alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was carrying a private letter to Clinton from
Milosevic, strongly urged the president to release two Serb
soldiers held by U.S. military as a reciprocal peace gesture.
Several weeks later, the administration did just that, denying the
release represented a quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by David Letterman how he could be civil to such an
international outlaw, Jackson's answer was simple: ``He had the
power to keep our guys or let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he returned from Yugoslavia, ``Jetstream Jesse,''
as he is sometimes called, was off to Africa, successfully
brokering a cease-fire in the Sierra Leone civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no budgetary commitment to rebuilding this
war-torn nation as we heard in Europe,'' Jackson said, after taking
credit for securing the release of 2,000 prisoners of war, most of
them children and soldiers from bordering countries. ``When the
Yugoslavia war is over, there will be billions spent on rebuilding
the cities. The same kind of security and stability and democracy
in Kosovo and Yugoslavia must apply to Sierra Leone and to Africa
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's exploits aren't likely to stop with Yugoslavia and
Sierra Leone. After all, this is the same person who crashed the
1985 Geneva Summit that was supposed to feature only Ronald Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Jackson confronted
Gorbachev in a crowded lobby, asking about the treatment of Soviet
Jews. Where he shows up next is anybody's guess.

nationals being held against their will.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Yugoslavia, however, provided Jackson with the
brightest spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for bringing our boys back home,'' says a middle-age
man with a middle-age middle. ``You're a real American hero.'' At
Legal Sea Foods, a restaurant in the airport, a group of women
pound on a window, wave and smile broadly as Jackson waves back. An
airline employee wants an autograph for his mother _ at least
that's what he says _ and two giddy teen-agers want to pose with
the world's best-known human rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane, it's more of the same. ``America thanks you ...
Good going, Jesse ... I just want to shake your hand.'' As he
settles in an aisle seat 20 rows back for an overdue interview, an
exhausted Jackson speaks for a few minutes and then suspends the
conversation to take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane lands in New York, he is refreshed and picks up
the conversation exactly where he left off. ``I always thought that
if we got close enough to touch them, we would leave with them,''
he recalls, referring to the soldiers. ``But it was strictly a
faith mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what Jackson says, these are not strictly faith
missions, though faith plays an intricate role. Nor are they merely
publicity stunts in which Jackson is used by unpopular foreign
leaders to manipulate U.S. public opinion. And despite the howls
from the State Department, he goes on these missions with their
tacit approval. After all, they made no effort to lift his
passport. How does he do it?
</P>
<P>
   First, Jackson is brash enough to think that he and only he can
pull off these feats. And so far, he has been right. Generally, he
has obtained the release of prisoners after the State Department
has failed, after back-channel negotiations through third parties
have failed and, in some cases, after U.S. or international
military intervention has failed, as was the case in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In each case Jackson knew when to make his move. Whether it's
securing the release of Goodman or the three Army soldiers _ Staff
Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher
J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales,
22, of Huntsville, Texas _ Jackson picks the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. M. William Howard Jr., president of the New York
Theological Seminary and a former president of the National Council
of Churches, remembers when Jackson decided to seek Goodman's
release. A group of ministers were huddling with tax attorneys in
Memphis to see how they could assist Jackson's 1984 presidential
bid without jeopardizing their federal tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse was bored out of his mind,'' Howard recalls. ``We broke
for lunch and went up to his suite. Wherever he is, he sends out
for this greasy fried chicken. He had sent somebody out to a
Popeye's, I believe it was. They brought in these buckets of
chicken. We were sitting around watching TV at lunchtime. I kid you
not, there was a news flash about how Donald H. Rumsfeld (NATO
ambassador under President Richard M. Nixon) had gone to Syria and
they were talking about the war in Lebanon and tensions with
Israel. They said nothing about Goodman.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point, Howard says, that Jackson sat up and
resolved to get a delegation of religious leaders together to go
and get Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   On his recent trip to Yugoslavia, Jackson followed that same
pattern of assembling a list of high-level religious leaders to
accompany him, including Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general
secretary of the National Council of Churches; an American rabbi; a
priest of the Orthodox Church in America; a Greek bishop; a Serbian
Orthodox bishop; a Baptist minister; an Islamic leader; and a
Methodist bishop. Also with them was Rep. Rod R. Blagojevich
(D-Ill.), the only Serbian-American member of Congress, and other
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson delegation received a formal invitation to visit
their religious counterparts in Yugoslavia. However, just before
departing, they were urged by National Security Council adviser
Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger to call off the trip, reminding them that
their safety could not be assured and that the bombing would not
halt just because they were in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it clear that if we were to get killed going in a
bombing zone, it would represent the ultimate PR coup for
Milosevic,'' Jackson says. ``That was their fear. But they could
have ended that fear just by stopping the bombing while we were
there.'' But they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   On the night the delegation arrived at the Belgrade Hyatt hotel,
the NATO bombing was among the heaviest of the war up to that time,
with some bombs landing just blocks away. ``They never stopped
bombing,'' Jackson says, clearly angry. ``They never stopped
bombing next to us. I think it aroused in us the fires of
determination. I was mentally prepared, spiritually fortified,
psyched, pumped, ready. War was so wrong, and our cause was so
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian officials promised Jackson protection once he was in
the country. They took him and Western reporters on a tour of a
residential area that they said had been hit by NATO's bombs.
During his trip, Jackson told the Yugoslavs that until there was a
peace agreement, the bombs would continue falling. He also repeated
NATO's requirements before there could be a cessation of bombing.
When it was time to meet the young men, only Jackson and
Blagojevich were allowed to visit, even then under the watchful
eyes of a military judge.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were brought in separately and left separately.
Stone, who had bruises healing on the left side of his forehead,
spoke with the visitors first and for the longest amount of time.
The U.S. delegation had brought the soldiers Bibles, small
religious icons, candy, a tape recorder and separate tape-recorded
messages from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The military judge denied Jackson's request to give the gifts
directly to the captive men, saying they had to be inspected. Each
soldier reported that he had been treated well and was feeling
good, considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, air-raid sirens sounded and the military judge
called for an end to the visit. But Jackson pressed on, asking that
the three soldiers be brought in together. His request was granted
and the men were reunited for the first time since they were
captured along the Yugoslav-Macedonian border on March 31.
Together, they prayed. ``Help is on the way and hope is in the
air,'' Jackson said. ``Soon, very soon, you will know peace and
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the delegates were allowed to meet with President
Slobodan Milosevic for three hours. In that meeting, they urged
Milosevic to free the soldiers. Bishop Dimitrios of Xanthos of the
Greek Orthodox Church says, ``(Jackson) was persuasive and just
would not let up. He kept saying, 'It's in your power. You can do
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the meeting, Milosevic portrayed NATO as the
aggressor in the conflict, just as the White House had feared. In
Milosevic's view, he was the victim. But when he asked who was
responsible for the bombings, Dr. Nazir Uddin Khaja, a California
physician and president of the American Muslim Council, replied,
``You are responsible.'' According to Khaja, Milosevic seemed
surprised. ``The whole group said that in one way or another. Maybe
I was more direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson met privately with Milosevic for about 20 minutes.
Milosevic promised to think about the request for freedom. Jackson
had been back at the hotel for 15 minutes when the delegation
received a call to meet with Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic at
his private residence. When they arrived, he told them, ``I am
pleased to tell you that President Milosevic has issued a decree
today releasing the three soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, there was a formal signing ceremony, which was broadcast
on U.S. television. With cameras rolling, Jackson had the soldiers
sounding more like civil rights workers than military men. They
chanted, ``'Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we're
free at last!''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson delegation left with the freed prisoners in a
Yugoslav bus. Under police escort, they were driven to the Croatian
border. From there, the soldiers were transferred to a Croatian
tourist bus rented by the U.S. Embassy and were driven to the Pleso
airstrip in Zagreb. Then they were flown to Ramstein Air Base in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the soldiers were whisked away to the Landstuhl
Regional Medical Center for a couple of days of testing before
their families arrived. So the Jackson group proceeded to
Washington, without the fruits of their labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Jackson had obtained the release of Goodman,
the pilot was not delayed by military authorities in Europe;
instead, the group was flown home aboard Air Force One and treated
to a ceremony in the Rose Garden. That was under Ronald Reagan, a
Republican president viewed as hostile to civil rights. Under
Clinton, who prides himself as a friend of African-Americans,
Jackson did not receive the red-carpet treatment, causing Jackson
to view the administration as ingrates.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he was ``very pleased'' that the soldiers were
coming home, Clinton said that nearly 1.5 million Kosovars could
not enjoy similar freedom. The president said conditions for ending
the bombing were simple: ``The Kosovars must be able to go home
with security and self-government, Serbian security forces must
leave Kosovo. An international security force must deploy with the
power not just to monitor but to protect all the people of Kosovo,
Albanians and Serbs alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was carrying a private letter to Clinton from
Milosevic, strongly urged the president to release two Serb
soldiers held by U.S. military as a reciprocal peace gesture.
Several weeks later, the administration did just that, denying the
release represented a quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by David Letterman how he could be civil to such an
international outlaw, Jackson's answer was simple: ``He had the
power to keep our guys or let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he returned from Yugoslavia, ``Jetstream Jesse,''
as he is sometimes called, was off to Africa, successfully
brokering a cease-fire in the Sierra Leone civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no budgetary commitment to rebuilding this
war-torn nation as we heard in Europe,'' Jackson said, after taking
credit for securing the release of 2,000 prisoners of war, most of
them children and soldiers from bordering countries. ``When the
Yugoslavia war is over, there will be billions spent on rebuilding
the cities. The same kind of security and stability and democracy
in Kosovo and Yugoslavia must apply to Sierra Leone and to Africa
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's exploits aren't likely to stop with Yugoslavia and
Sierra Leone. After all, this is the same person who crashed the
1985 Geneva Summit that was supposed to feature only Ronald Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Jackson confronted
Gorbachev in a crowded lobby, asking about the treatment of Soviet
Jews. Where he shows up next is anybody's guess.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   During the 27 years that Nelson Mandela was serving time in
apartheid jails, his successor, Thabo Mbeki, was also serving time.
Not in apartheid jails, but, as he once wrote to a friend, ``like a
cosmic wanderer, driven by the winds to land where they will.''
Mbeki was living in forced exile. His ``struggle politics'' made it
impossible to return to the land where he was born on June 18,
1942. Like Mandela, the decision to become a freedom fighter would
be as much destiny as it was choice.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's parents were part of the social, intellectual and
political elite of the Transkei, the southeastern region of the
country that gave birth to many major activists, including Mandela
and the late African National Congress president, Oliver Tambo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 Mbeki's father, Govan, went underground, and to prison,
with Mandela; Thabo, then a student activist, was sent out of the
country. He spent six months in a Rhodesian jail but eventually
made it to England, where he earned a master's degree in economics
from Sussex University and later married another South African
exile, Zanele Dlamini, a social worker and women's rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   While in exile, Mbeki helped build the ANC's youth sections and
received military training as part of the cadre of guerillas known
as ``Umkonto we Sizwe.'' Starting in the late '60s, Mbeki held ANC
postings in England, Botswana, Swaziland and Nigeria, with
intermittent spells in Lusaka, home of the ANC in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Mandela was released in 1990, Mbeki was finally free
to come home, playing a key role in the transition to democratic
rule. He cast his first vote as a South African citizen on April
27, 1994, after which Mandela, the new president, chose him as
deputy president. Highly and warmly regarded by Mandela, Mbeki was
for quite some time at the controls of the government's daily
operations, as well as its long-term planning.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken, pipe-smoking, private man given to quoting
William Butler Yeats, the Bible and of late, Zulu and Xhosa
proverbs, Mbeki seems an enigma to some. That is bound to change.
</P>
<P>
   When asked one too many times how he felt about stepping into
Mandela's shoes, Mbeki once responded with rarely seen but
characteristic playful humor: ``I don't want to step into Mandela's
shoes because he wears ugly shoes.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: During those 27 years in exile, did you
ever dream that you would be president of South Africa?
</P>
<P>
   THABO MBEKI: No, it was never even a thought. You see, I think
it must have been impossible for all of us to conceptualize what
freedom would bring. So we sort of thought, ``Well, freedom will
come and then we will get jobs somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You once said to me that you were trying to run a country
that you didn't know. What were some of the things you found out
that just blew your mind?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the personnel budget is extremely bloated and ... I
think the other problem here, which I don't think we quite
understood, was the level of corruption in society. I don't merely
mean a civil servant taking some money or being bribed; I mean
generally the collapse of social morality in society _ very
pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   We knew there were some police officers who you certainly didn't
want, and indeed they retired and were encouraged to retire, given
severance packages. But you discover in time that the root is much
deeper, its origins being in an illegitimate system, an
illegitimate government, and hence everybody ended up making their
own rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that you understand that, can you ``move forward
faster,'' as your campaign slogan promised?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think so. We are better educated about what South Africa
is; that is half the answer, to know the reality. I think that what
we should be talking about is an ongoing revolution. Many people
naturally look at what happened in 1994 as an election took place:
One party was defeated and another party won, what normally happens
in democratic systems. But I am saying it was not just a mere
change of system. What we have been about in the past five years is
to change the system. We have a continuing revolution in the
country, but the fact of our experience in the last five years
gives us the possibility to move forward faster. We can and must
move forward faster in every respect. And this thing without
precedent that we've established in the last five years, the
creation of something which is totally new in South Africa _ it
throws out its own lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So the problems are not insoluble.
</P>
<P>
   A: They are not insoluble. You need to discover what the
problems are, as truthfully, correctly and factually as possible,
and indeed that is half of the battle. It is true that the economy
is not growing at a rate which is absorbing unemployment to the
extent that we need. But a whole variety of things will be done.
... Housing construction will necessarily employ a lot of people.
Quite clearly, the rate of construction has to pick up in the next
five years. And the infrastructure problem _ roads in the rural
areas and so forth _ that too will absorb a lot of (unemployed)
people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Let's talk about crime. International investors have seen the
horrendous reports about crime. They don't say they are not coming,
but take ``wait and see'' attitudes because they don't know what
you're going to do. What do you say to them about the future?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you see, it depends whom you are talking to. General
Electric has decided that it is going to make major investments in
South Africa. I said to them, ``But what I am told is that
investors are being driven away from South Africa by crime.'' And
they say to me: ``Deputy President (because I was deputy president
then), we also work in Poland. We as a corporation are active in
Poland on a smaller scale than in South Africa and we've had 300 of
our cars hijacked. We have not had a single car hijacked in South
Africa. ... There is crime all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: But what about those who aren't here, who read the headlines
and see stories of crime in the newspaper? Do you say, ``Come,
there is no crime''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, no, we don't. They know there is crime. You need to
explain a lot of it. This understanding about the nature of crime
in South Africa comes from the experience of white South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But black South Africans too. I mean, people in the
townships. My caregiver for my mother, if I asked her to work an
extra half-hour, it would be pitch black by the time she got to
Alexandra township, and she is scared to go there after dark.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure, sure. But the point about all of this is that crime has
been a real problem in South Africa for a long time. A person from
Alexandra township will tell you that the crime problem in
Alexandra township is not new. What has happened is that crime has
begun to affect white areas in ways that it did not affect white
areas before.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK, but then the bottom line is, there is crime. What do you
say to international investors who are waiting to see what is going
to happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: I say to international investors, I don't believe there are
levels of crime here which would make you take a decision not to
come, as though there is not crime elsewhere in the world. You see,
President (Fernando Henrique) Cardoso of Brazil tells me that
people in Sao Paulo take their children to and from school by
helicopter. Now are investors saying, ``We are not going to put
money in Brazil because of the level of crime?'' Of course not.
There is a presentation of the level of crime as though South
Africa is unique in the world, which it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It isn't unique in the world, but crime is here. You need
international investment for jobs and so forth. So what is the
bottom line?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have to fight crime as all countries must fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've talked about two separate societies in South Africa,
one white and prospering, one black and declining. Do you see that
changing significantly in the next five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: It takes time; I mean it will take time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure we do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is no ticking time bomb out there among these young
people who have no jobs, who, as far as they are concerned, have no
hope?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, no, I don't think so. I think that the critical matter is
first of all to tell people the truth, that these things are going
to take time, and secondly, to do something, as has been done, that
is being done and will be done.
</P>
<P>
   If indeed there was nothing happening, then indeed we would get
an explosion. (A recent newspaper survey showed that) despair and
loss of hope is among your richer people, the white community,
followed by the Indians, who despair about the future because they
are fearful of losing what they have. Whereas the poor take
precisely the opposite position. They are very hopeful about the
future because they can see the changes that have been made (and
believe), ``Even if they have not reached me today, they will reach
me tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So how do you resolve those sorts of conflicting perceptions?
And what are you going to do about white people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many of the whites are victims of their own propaganda. The
fear of the future is a fear which they impose on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you reassure them?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it's important to communicate the message to them
continuously that the fears they entertain are unfounded, but I
think that also (we must examine) the practical, the actual things
that happen. They feared, after the elections in 1994, that
terrible things were going to happen to them, that they would be
slaughtered and this and that, and nothing like that happened. And
next they feared that they would lose their jobs because of
affirmative action and end up as the unemployed, and the black
people as the employed. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You recently told a crowd of black South Africans that they
needed to get angry. Can you explain that?
</P>
<P>
   A: You see, part of the problem is that we are too comfortable
with an ugly past. The consequence is that the impulse to change
the ugly reality that comes from that ugly past gets dulled. So I
say, you see, we have got to be angry about the fact of slavery. It
is not just a matter of saying, ``Oh, it happened.'' We have to be
angry about the history of colonialism. We have to be angry about
this history of neocolonialism, when African leaders robbed the
masses of our people and produced conflicts on the continent. We
have got to be angry about apartheid. Then we put ourselves in a
position to say, ``Let's do something about it to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   If I said to you what is happening in South Africa _ even the
memory of what apartheid meant is receding. There are people here
who, when you talk to them about the pass laws (which required
blacks to carry identification books), they say, ``What? What is
that?'' If you lose that anger and you lose that anger because you
are sitting in a comfortable position, you lose the drive to change
the things which have to be changed. And then perhaps there is too
much such forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you clarify that? Are you quarreling with the notion of
reconciliation?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. You know we must forgive the people who committed the
crime of apartheid, but I think a mistake is made when people then
think that also means forgiving apartheid. Nobody in the world asks
the jury for forgiveness for slavery. Why must we forgive slavery
and apartheid? We have done the forgiving thing. No, I think there
is too much forgiveness here. We never agreed to forgive the system
of apartheid.

 By JAMES BENNET  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On the windy Friday in February that the Senate acquitted her
husband of perjury and obstruction of justice, Hillary Rodham
Clinton turned her attention to her life after his presidency.
 &HT;    From before the first vote that day until long after the last,
she met with her friend Harold Ickes on the second floor of the
White House, in the family quarters, to weigh whether for the first
time to promote herself rather than Bill Clinton for public office.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton felt flattered that Democrats were begging her
to run for the Senate from New York, an idea she had laughed off
when Rep. Charles Rangel, the mischievous Manhattan Democrat, first
suggested it in a Chicago church last October.
 &HT;    She was delighted with the shift under way in her public image,
from passive victim to political heavyweight. After all her policy
work and speechifying, it had galled her to watch her popularity
spike upward in the past year as she turned her lapidary smile to
the world and suffered through the revelations of her husband's
affair with that woman.
 &HT;    Now, for four hours, as she and Ickes _ a scarred veteran of New
York politics and a former aide to her husband _ moved from the
living room to lunch in the family dining room and back to the
living room, she plumbed the risks of a race for the Senate seat
that Daniel Patrick Moynihan had decided to vacate.
 &HT;    Would she really want to be one of a hundred senators? Could she
survive a street fight with a nasty opponent? Could she stand the
pawing of New York City's feral reporters?
 &HT;    The backing and forthing with Ickes had fitting precedent. Half
a century ago, a woman Clinton regards as a role model, Eleanor
Roosevelt, mulled running for the Senate from New York at the
prompting of a former adviser to her husband. He was also named
Harold Ickes; he was the father of Hillary Clinton's friend.
 &HT;    But like so many parallels between the century's two most
compelling first ladies, this one illuminates as many differences
as similarities. Hillary had summoned her Harold, while Eleanor was
importuned by hers. Pulled between her lofty aims and her cautious
nature, Hillary was embarking on months of painstaking cogitation,
while Eleanor almost immediately turned her Harold down.
 &HT;    ``I feel very strongly that running for office is not the way in
which I can be most useful,'' she wrote him on May 26, 1945, just
days after he raised the idea. She did not want to burden her
children with another office-holding parent. She also did not want
to burden herself with having to follow what she called ``the party
line.''
 &HT;    ``I hope to continue to work with the Democrats and for them,''
Eleanor continued briskly, ``but I think the knowledge that I will
be free of any obligation may at times be very healthy.''
 &HT;    ``Free of any obligation'' _ it is an expression lustrous with
meaning for political spouses, and particularly for first ladies of
the United States. Since Martha Washington likened herself to a
state prisoner, first ladies have felt oppressed by arranging
flowers or delivering speeches, by wielding influence or not enough
of it, by the private compromises and the planetary humiliations.
 &HT;    Eleanor Roosevelt feared continued limitation in winning office
for herself. Hillary Clinton glimpses freedom, or so her friends
and advisers say _ freedom to participate in politics fully, with
her own constituents, on her own terms, for her own purposes.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton is about to become a liberated woman. Come
January 2001, for the first time since she moved to Arkansas as a
26-year-old lawyer in 1974, she will be able to walk her own path
regardless of her husband's political career. While most people
provided such an opening might be fantasizing about anonymity and a
long break, Clinton is methodically exploring her options for
staying in the spotlight.
 &HT;    If she does not pull out of the New York race in June, she is
likely to announce an exploratory committee in July, knowing that
that will be regarded as throwing her hat in the ring. With that
announcement, the Clintons would neatly reverse roles, at least
regarding New York. She would step forward to present herself as a
leader, while he would be relegated to behind-the-scenes,
supporting chores.
 &HT;    To be sure, since she graduated from Yale Law School and opted
for Bill Clinton and Arkansas, it has become unremarkable for women
to compete for higher office.
 &HT;    As she pondered the Senate race, Clinton was standing in the way
of another woman, Rep. Nita Lowey of Westchester County, and an
older but far less traditional political spouse, Elizabeth Dole,
was running for president.
 &HT;    Clinton's race would be path-breaking, but only because she
would be undertaking it while her husband was still in office. In
that sense, it would certainly be pioneering for Clinton and for
first ladies, but not for women generally. She is too late for
that.
 &HT;    But so what? Clinton did not sacrifice her ambition to her
husband's so much as yoke them together. As a result of that
decision, it has been her fate to be judged more for how she has
stood by her man than for what she has accomplished with him and
more for what she represents as a woman than for what she has done
as first lady.
 &HT;    As it happens, she has done quite a bit. And the flip side of
the loyal role she has played is that she regards his
accomplishments as hers too. When she was saving his presidency
last year _ condemning unnamed conspirators and then sticking with
him after he admitted they were right about his affair _ she was
also saving her own.
 &HT;    By now, Hillary Clinton is operating under the presumption that
she will run for the Senate, and she is looking for a house in
Westchester County. Her goals remain rather vague, but her ambition
for service and confidence in herself remain intact and vaulting.
It is just that Bill Clinton is no longer the best vehicle.
 &HT;    But that does not mean that she will run, and that points up
another difference between the Clintons. When it comes to politics,
he works from the gut as well as from his beloved polls, while she
is more cerebral. The risks and challenges of a race excite him.
They scare her. This is a defining life decision for her, perhaps
the biggest she has made since her marriage, and in the end she may
decide not to gamble her popularity and political clout.
 &HT;    She does not want to lose. Horse-race polls don't mean much now,
but the ones that showed her running away with victory have been
replaced by others showing at best that she might squeak by
Giuliani. And some of her advisers are more worried about a
possible challenge from Rep. Rick Lazio, the Long Island
Republican, or even Gov. George Pataki.
 &HT;    ``One of the lures of being senator is you're out on your own,''
one of her advisers told me. ''One of the liabilities is you lose
on your own.''
 &HT;    Paradoxically, Clinton's record in her husband's office is
clearest where it is least relevant to the voters who might elect
her. Far more than in the United States, Hillary Clinton has found
her own voice overseas. She has spent more days this year in North
Africa than in New York. And abroad, she conducts a sort of shadow
presidency, with advisers borrowed from assorted agencies and an
aging 707 whose port engine periodically bursts into flames.
 &HT;    She does it with what amounts to her own foreign policy,
promoting issues of women's rights, health care and development
that her husband addresses rarely, and almost always with her at
his side. In her speeches abroad, she seldom even mentions the
president, not wanting to muddy her message of female empowerment
by acknowledging that her influence derives from his power.
 &HT;    Yet Clinton's passion for that role could be a problem in New
York, where it plays into what her advisers view as her chief
liability: the suspicion that she would have her eye on concerns
far from Binghamton or the Bronx. It has probably not helped her
that in her remarks about a possible race, she has tended to dwell
on why New York is big enough for her, rather than vice versa.
 &HT;    ``New York is truly a microcosm of America,'' she recently told
reporters in Manhattan. Chuck Schumer has advised Clinton that if
she decides to run, she will have to devote herself completely to
the race. ``You can't be both first lady and candidate,'' he says.
 &HT;    As first lady, she has had two luxuries that will vanish if she
presents herself as a candidate: picking and choosing what issues
she wants to address and falling back on exhortation rather than
specific proposals to solve the problems she raises.
 &HT;    Her record of passionate concern for children would surely give
her great credibility on issues like gun violence in the schools,
which after Littleton she is turning into a crusade. (``I have not
stopped thinking about it,'' she told me.)
 &HT;    When I asked her what specifically she hopes to accomplish as a
senator or citizen, she began by replying, ``Well, you know, I'm
concerned about a broad range of issues.''
 &HT;    Then she gathered speed. ``You know, much of what I care about
falls into the broad categories of creating conditions for children
to grow up and be healthy and well educated and productive
citizens. And so that means I'm interested in everything from
economic policy to education policy to adoption and foster care and
welfare policy to health care.'' She laced her fingers together as
she added, ``I think that all of these social, political, economic,
cultural issues intersect.''
 &HT;    Clinton is widely viewed as more liberal than her husband, but
there is not much evidence to support that. In Arkansas, it was
Hillary who persuaded Bill to advocate the testing of public-school
teachers. The efficacy of the test is debatable, but there is no
question it angered some of their staunchest liberal supporters.
 &HT;    ``You know, people think she's such a big lib,'' says Maggie
Williams, Clinton's former chief of staff and one of her closest
friends. ``I think she's extremely conservative. I think she has
more in common with people in upstate New York than in New York
City, in a lot of ways.'' Williams calls Clinton ``patriotic and
practical. She thinks it's important to spend money on social
programs, but she wants to know that they work.''
 &HT;    Maybe so. But until she stands on her own politically, none of
us can know.
 &HT;    After Clinton stuck by her husband through the Lewinsky scandal,
she came to present a fat target for those who found her wanting as
a feminist. And it is hard not to wince these days over some things
she says, at times so self-righteously.
 &HT;    ``We can point to many problems around our world today where
women _ for reasons of history, culture, discrimination, prejudice
_ are used to lift up patriarchy, are used really as objects in
order for others to exercise power,'' she said in commemorating
International Women's Day this year.
 &HT;    Clinton makes no apologies for her decisions last year. In the
interview, she said at first that ``people have to make their own
judgments about that,'' but then went on to suggest they had no
business doing so. A bit paradoxically, she presented her actions
as evidence of her independence and self-sufficiency.
 &HT;    ``I would hope that young women _ women of all ages _ understand
how important it is to live your own life according to your own
values,'' she said, unspooling one of those lengthy sentences
characteristic of either Clinton, ``and not be constantly looking
over your shoulder to think what anybody else is thinking about you
or saying about you, because ultimately, at the end of the day, you
have to live with yourself and you have to do what you think is
right. And again, my choices may not be someone else's choices.''
 &HT;    When it comes to the Clintons, it is hard to separate the
personal and the political. Regardless of her feelings for him,
leaving her husband last year would have brought down a presidency
she believes in to her bones.
 &HT;    Some of the Clintons' closest associates have regarded their
relationship for years as a partnership with staged shows of
affection _ ``what they had to for the moment,'' as one of them put
it to me. Even some of Hillary Clinton's friends wonder if she will
stay with him after they leave the White House.
 &HT;    But politics did not keep the Clintons together, according to
other, closer friends of Hillary. She considered leaving him last
year, they say, but her daughter and her marriage vows stopped her.
Most important, they insist, she still loves him.
 &HT;    ``She loves him, and she doesn't have to, but she does,'' one
said. Part of the reason, this friend said, is their intellectual
bond: ``Whether you think they're changing things for better or
worse, they're always going to have something to say to each other
about it.''
 &HT;    But maybe it is time to leave wondering if the Clintons truly
love each other to the historians and to focus on the
accomplishments, failures and ideas that define his presidency and
would define her Senate race.
 &HT;    If Clinton runs, she is likely to limit her husband's role,
though he will try to meddle. Indeed, it has not escaped some of
her friends that being forced onto the sidelines would be
excruciating punishment for him, as, without a campaign of his own,
he watches his wife and his vice president run.
 &HT;    But Hillary Clinton wants to find out what she can do on her
own, they say. Further, having her husband front and center would
make her look weak.
 &HT;    And therein lies a delightful switch. For years, White House
aides have praised Hillary Clinton's ability and contributions
while in the next breath minimizing her influence in order to build
up the president. Now, Hillary's allies are unself-consciously
treating her husband the same way.
 &HT;    ``She'd be a fool not to work with him very closely on this,''
one of them told me. ``It will, however, be Hillary Rodham
Clinton's campaign. It'll be her voice, and it'll be her persona. I
see him playing very much a behind-the-scenes role.''

 By JAMES BENNET  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On the windy Friday in February that the Senate acquitted her
husband of perjury and obstruction of justice, Hillary Rodham
Clinton turned her attention to her life after his presidency.
 &HT;    From before the first vote that day until long after the last,
she met with her friend Harold Ickes on the second floor of the
White House, in the family quarters, to weigh whether for the first
time to promote herself rather than Bill Clinton for public office.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton felt flattered that Democrats were begging her
to run for the Senate from New York, an idea she had laughed off
when Rep. Charles Rangel, the mischievous Manhattan Democrat, first
suggested it in a Chicago church last October.
 &HT;    She was delighted with the shift under way in her public image,
from passive victim to political heavyweight. After all her policy
work and speechifying, it had galled her to watch her popularity
spike upward in the past year as she turned her lapidary smile to
the world and suffered through the revelations of her husband's
affair with that woman.
 &HT;    Now, for four hours, as she and Ickes _ a scarred veteran of New
York politics and a former aide to her husband _ moved from the
living room to lunch in the family dining room and back to the
living room, she plumbed the risks of a race for the Senate seat
that Daniel Patrick Moynihan had decided to vacate.
 &HT;    Would she really want to be one of a hundred senators? Could she
survive a street fight with a nasty opponent? Could she stand the
pawing of New York City's feral reporters?
 &HT;    The backing and forthing with Ickes had fitting precedent. Half
a century ago, a woman Clinton regards as a role model, Eleanor
Roosevelt, mulled running for the Senate from New York at the
prompting of a former adviser to her husband. He was also named
Harold Ickes; he was the father of Hillary Clinton's friend.
 &HT;    But like so many parallels between the century's two most
compelling first ladies, this one illuminates as many differences
as similarities. Hillary had summoned her Harold, while Eleanor was
importuned by hers. Pulled between her lofty aims and her cautious
nature, Hillary was embarking on months of painstaking cogitation,
while Eleanor almost immediately turned her Harold down.
 &HT;    ``I feel very strongly that running for office is not the way in
which I can be most useful,'' she wrote him on May 26, 1945, just
days after he raised the idea. She did not want to burden her
children with another office-holding parent. She also did not want
to burden herself with having to follow what she called ``the party
line.''
 &HT;    ``I hope to continue to work with the Democrats and for them,''
Eleanor continued briskly, ``but I think the knowledge that I will
be free of any obligation may at times be very healthy.''
 &HT;    ``Free of any obligation'' _ it is an expression lustrous with
meaning for political spouses, and particularly for first ladies of
the United States. Since Martha Washington likened herself to a
state prisoner, first ladies have felt oppressed by arranging
flowers or delivering speeches, by wielding influence or not enough
of it, by the private compromises and the planetary humiliations.
 &HT;    Eleanor Roosevelt feared continued limitation in winning office
for herself. Hillary Clinton glimpses freedom, or so her friends

<P>
   A well-designed pond can be a pleasant addition to any property.
The hardest part of installing a pond is digging the hole _ unless
you rent a backhoe. Unlike other home building projects, pond
building does not require precise measurements or accurate scale
drawings. Still, depending on the size of the pond, it will take
some planning.
</P>
<P>
   Because large ponds of more than 10 feet in diameter can affect
the environment surrounding your property, they should only be
installed after careful planning. This includes choosing the most
propitious site, ideally a wet hollow, then consulting with local
authorities, like the state Water Resources Board, to make sure
your project complies with all construction guidelines and with
wetland protection legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas the federal government may have jurisdiction over
wetland projects, and you may have to obtain special permits before
proceeding. Once the planning is complete, you will have to hire a
contractor with a bulldozer to excavate the site.
</P>
<P>
   Constructing a large pond is obviously not a do-it-yourself
project, but installing a smaller pond is within the skills of the
average do-it-yourselfer. You still need to check first with local
authorities to make sure the project complies with all codes and
zoning laws. Some building codes, for example, require a perimeter
fence around any pond that has a depth greater than 18 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Look over your property to choose the best site for the pond.
The land should be relatively level and free of obstructions like
tree stumps, roots and large rocks. If you intend to add aquatic
plants and fish to the pond, it must receive at least four hours of
direct sunlight each day.
</P>
<P>
   Next map out the general shape of the pond with a long rope on
the ground. The rope makes it easy to adjust and readjust the
outline until you are satisfied that the pond shape will fit nicely
into the surroundings. When the outline is in place, begin digging.
For a simple pond, you only have to dig the hole to one level, but
the pond will be more interesting if you make shelves for various
aquatic plants around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider the depth. If you plan to stock the pond with
fish, it must be a minimum of 18 inches deep. The water level will
be a few inches lower than the banks around the pond, If you want
the water to be 30 inches deep, then dig a hole 36 inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   When the hole is dug, check the banks to make surer that they
are level. To do this, rest a long 2 by 4 across the hole and check
it with a level. Cut down the high spots or build up the low spots
to level the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the soil is especially dense, the hole will not hold
water. You must install a waterproof liner. There are two types of
liners: preformed and flexible. Preformed liners are large plastic
or fiberglass tubs molded into a rigid shape. The ground must be
excavated to accept the right shape and dimensions of the liner.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier, and less expensive, to install a flexible liner.
Flexible liners are large blankets made of plastic, like
high-density polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride, or a synthetic
rubber, like ethylene proplylene diene monomer. They are available
in thicknesses ranging from 20 to 60 mils thick. The thicker liners
are more expensive. While they are more durable, they are also less
flexible and may be hard to shape to the contours of your pond.
</P>
<P>
   Liners come in a variety of colors. Black works best because it
makes the pond look deeper and it is easier to hide around the
edges of the banks. When purchasing a liner, check to see if the
manufacturer offers a warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Before installing the liner, place a 1/2-inch thick layer of
newspapers over the pond bed. The newspapers will pad the surface
and protect the liner from any sharp objects, rocks or twigs that
might puncture it. Eventually, the newspapers will absorb ground
moisture and decompose to form a clay-like substance that will
contain water should the liner develop a leak.
</P>
<P>
   Place the liner over the opening and lightly press down to make
it fits the contours of the hole. When working on the liner, be
sure to wear soft-soled shoes so you don't damage it. When the
liner is in place, position a few smooth rocks on the edges to hold
it while you fill the pond with water. Fill the pond slowly,
because the weight of the water may cause the liner to shift so it
needs readjustment. When the pond is full, add more rocks around
the edges to hold the liner in place. Trim away any excess liner
with tin snips or heavy- duty shears.

   The Life of the Leek
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some of my leeks were too small to harvest so I left them in
the ground last year, and now they are about to flower. Will they
still be good to eat after flowering? I don't want to harvest them
now. I want to enjoy the flowers, but it would be nice if I could
eat them afterward.
</P>
<P>
   A. Just remember how much you enjoyed those alliumlike flowers
when you harvest and eat what remains of the leeks. As a biennial,
leeks, members of the same family as onions, shallots and chives,
have their own agenda. They spend the first growing season stocking
up on energy and storing food in their underground storage bin _
the part of the leek that we eat. By harvesting in the first fall,
you are the beneficiary of the leek's efforts. If you wait until
after flowering, during the second growing season, the leek is the
beneficiary. It uses that energy up as the plant devotes everything
to setting seed before it dies.
</P>
<P>
   As its second spring arrives, the leek begins to create its
flower stalk. To support the flower, the center of the edible
portion becomes woody and inedible. Taking energy from storage to
produce a flower reduces the size of the leek and gives it a
sharper flavor. The best tasting overwintered leeks are harvested
early in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Not all leeks are winter hardy, so if you intend to leave your
leeks in the ground to overwinter, choose a hardy variety like Bleu
Solaise, Siegfried or Laura, and mulch them after the ground
freezes.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for winter-hardy leeks include Fedco Seeds, P.O. Box

phone orders), and Cook's Garden, P.O. Box 5010, Hodges S.C. 29653,
(800) 457-9703, free catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Hardiness Zones
</P>
<P>
   Q. Garden books often give numbered climate zones for perennials
and trees. How strictly do I have to follow these numbers? If I
live in Zone 5 (the lower Catskill region of New York State), can I
try something listed as Zone 6? Do all writers agree on the zones
for these plants, or is there some doubt I can benefit from?
</P>
<P>
   A. Hardiness zones, geographic regions classified by averages of
the lowest winter temperature that an area will normally reach,
have been used as a guide to choosing perennials, trees, shrubs and
ground covers since the first zones map was published in 1927 by
Alfred Rehder of the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University. The
idea has continued to be refined, and the latest version, published
by the Agriculture Department, goes from Zone 1 (temperatures
regularly falling below minus 50 degrees) to Zone 11 (never falling
below 40 degrees). Each zone represents a 10-degree difference, and
each is further divided into A and B zones of 5-degree increments,
with the A's cooler than the B's.
</P>
<P>
   Winter-hardiness information is sometimes not foolproof when an
area's growing conditions vary widely. In the 1954 edition of the
``Western Garden Book,'' Sunset Publishing divided the Western and
Pacific Coast states into 24 zones, taking into account summer high
temperatures, humidity, rainfall, elevation, latitude, the
influence of the ocean and other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how many divisions are made, the general
conditions may be different from the actual conditions in the
microclimate of a spot in your yard. Microclimates depend on
elevation, openness to the wind, surrounding sheltering material
and available moisture, among other things that can effect
temperature at any moment. You may live in a region that is
generally Zone 5, but some parts of your garden may be a bit warmer
or cooler than others, though probably not an entire zone.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, averages can be misleading. Borderline plants
may do fine for years and then get wiped out by one of those
winters that hark back to childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Experts differ on assigning hardiness zones to plants, but then
individual plants and individual test sites also differ. Just as
you can move from doctor to doctor until you find a diagnosis you
agree with, if you look in enough books, you might find one where
the plant you are interested in is listed as Zone 5, instead of
Zone 6. Whether or not you want to take the risk against the advice
of the majority is up to you. As long as you're not my
stockbroker. &QL;

A STAY OF EXECUTION FOR THE SILICON CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists at Lucent Technology's Bell Labs have examined the
future of the silicon-dioxide-based transistor that is used in
billions of chips and have pronounced the technology both half full
and half empty.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued last week, the scientists said that one
fundamental barrier to small chips wasn't as absolute as scientists
had thought.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon dioxide was supposed to be nearing the end of its
usefulness as a main component of microchips in 3 to 6 years, but
the Lucent team has shown that it should remain viable for at least
12 more years (the half-full part). After that, however, it's
finished _ and this time the scientists really mean it (the
half-empty part). The team, led by Dr. David Muller, published the
results of its work in the British journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon dioxide is usually applied in thin layers on chips
because it's an insulator. Pure silicon wafers are a semiconductor
of electrical signals, but mixing silicon with oxygen in silicon
dioxide cuts off the flow of electrons and lets it act as an
insulator.
</P>
<P>
   This silicon dioxide insulator is a crucial part of transistors
because it allows one wire to get close enough to another wire to
act as a switch without shorting out. As companies try to pack more
and more transistors, a type of switch, on a chip, they need to
make the silicon dioxide layer as thin as possible. That layer is
sometimes called the ``gate oxide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the typical transistor today, the gate oxide is 25 atoms
thick,'' said Dr. Greg Timp, a member of the research team. ``Even
that is thinner than people expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have long wondered just how closely they can slice
silicon dioxide. ``They thought we would have to stop at 10 atoms
or 8 atoms,'' Timp said. ``We've managed to push this down to 5 or
maybe 4.''
</P>
<P>
   The team of scientists came to this conclusion after trying two
different experiments. In the first test, they created silicon
wafers that were covered with several very thin layers of silicon
dioxide. Then they used a scanning electron microscope and focused
its beam of electrons down to the width of an atom.
</P>
<P>
   The beam of electrons was many times more powerful than a
typical current on a computer chip so it was strong enough to flow
through the silicon dioxide. The physicists used it to study the
electrical structure of the atoms. In the electron beam, the layer
appeared about as transparent as an insect stuck in amber looks
when examined with a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   The team looked at column after column of atoms. ``You fire the
beam off the sample, and it just hits one column at a time,''
Muller said. ``Then you move the beam over to the next column, and
you can map out the profile.''
</P>
<P>
   The team found that the silicon dioxide layer needed to be four
or five atoms thick to act as an insulator. With thinner layers,
quantum effects led to the leakage of electrons across the silicon
dioxide layer, shorting out the circuit. The thinner the layer, the
more electrons leaked.
</P>
<P>
   The team also tried building small transistors with more and
fewer than four or five atoms in the dielectric layer and found
that the behavior matched the results they had predicted. To be
practical, the layer needs to be a little thicker than the
theoretical limit of four atoms thick.
</P>
<P>
   That pushes back the timing of the doom expected for the silicon
chip. The Bell Labs team predicts that silicon dioxide will
continue to be a useful insulator through 2012 if chip
manufacturers continue to shrink the size of transistors at the
current rate. At that point, the chip designers will be down to
layers five atoms thick and won't be able to shave more atoms to
save space.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randy Isaac, a research vice president at International
Business Machines, said the new work was right in line with some of
IBM's own research. Still, he predicted that IBM's teams would hit
the four- to five-atom barrier well before 2012, perhaps as early
as 2005, but was optimistic that faster chips would continue to
emerge even after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key message is for 30 years, the evolution of the
transistor has been guided by a recipe for miniaturization, but you
cannot reduce that thickness forever,'' Isaac said. ``So we'll turn
to other innovation. We'll use other techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited some of IBM's latest innovations, like using copper
wiring on chips and building three-dimensional transistors, with
silicon dioxide on two sides of the transistor. Each solution he
suggested tweaks some assumptions of chip design. Chip makers have
avoided using copper for wiring because it can contaminate other
parts of a chip, but IBM recently found a way around that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Muller and Timp suggested that some research would continue to
focus on a silicon dioxide replacement. One job of the insulator in
a transistor is to act like a common device known as a capacitor,
which can store energy in the form of an electrostatic field. Other
chemicals do a better job at this, and replacing silicon dioxide
with them may make chips faster without shrinking the size of the
transistors. Both scientists caution, however, that those other
chemicals may have other flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Merkle, a Xerox nanotechnology specialist at the Palo Alto
Research Center, said more far-fetched solutions might turn out to
be practical. ``Some of the proposals kicking around in a
half-formulated state involve using electron spin or other very
small structures that somehow allow you to shrink the basic device
size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac is optimistic. ``History has shown that if something can
be done, someone will find a way to do it,'' he said. ``We'll just
have to find different ways of implementing the transistor.''
</P>

 RIDING the BUBBLE of the INTERNET BOOM

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For a homeless shelter's annual charity auction not long ago,
Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist, donated a breakfast with
himself at Buck's Restaurant.
 &HT;    Buck's is a bustling diner in Woodside, Calif., a
single-intersection hamlet nestled into an oak grove at the base of
the San Mateo County foothills. The booths at Buck's are
upholstered in ocher Naugahyde and the menus have the feel of
political-action newsletters and the owners are mighty proud of
their coffeecake.
 &HT;    Buck's also happens to be the place where Netscape and many
other high-tech companies were hatched.
 &HT;    ``Breakfast at Buck's'' was sold off by way of the Internet site
Ebay at the end of February; 78 bids after the auction started, a
budding Manhattan entrepreneur named Mark Hernandez offered to pay
$4,400 for the privilege of flying out to Silicon Valley two weeks
later to present his business idea.
 &HT;    That might sound like a lot of money to have breakfast with
someone, but Jurvetson is a venture capitalist with a reputation _
young, enthusiastic, open-minded.
 &HT;    He can be found at Buck's most mornings. He bounds in like a
kangaroo, exuberant, flashing a joyous smile, his youthful face
tanned from his noon-hour games of ultimate Frisbee.
 &HT;    He is generally more dapper than his colleagues, wearing a
charcoal Czechoslovakian hand-made suit over a cobalt shirt with
faint royal blue pin-stripes. His tie picks up these colors
perfectly; the black wing tips on his large feet shine. In the
plastic window of his wallet is the bridal portrait of his wife of
eight years, Karla, who is a psychiatrist at Stanford.
 &HT;    He has a prototypical resume for a Silicon Valley VC: earned
bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford, designed microchips
at Hewlett-Packard, learned management consulting at Bain &AMP; Co.,
returned to Stanford for his MBA and then beat out 250 other
applicants for a position at Draper Fisher, the venture firm.
 &HT;    Prototypical resume, except for the date column: As an
undergrad, he tricked the registration computer _ which blocked
signing up for more than 20 units _ by penciling in just two units
of credit on what were five-unit classes. In this way, he was able
to take eight classes at once and finish in two and a half years
with an A-plus average.
 &HT;    Think that's fast? The conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley is
that it takes three years to learn the craft. Jurvetson made
partner in six months. He was 28.
 &HT;    Venture capitalists' favorite unit of measurement is the factor
X. They live life on multiplication scale, and anything less than X
is inconsequential. When they invest, they ignore 12 percent or 15
percent or 18 percent returns. They start to take notice when they
see potential for 10X returns.
 &HT;    In this lingo, Jurvetson blasted through college at nearly 2X
the normal rate, and made partner at 6X speed. Now he's
accelerating _ straight into what could be a precarious stretch of
road.
 &HT;    Only 32, Jurvetson is in for the summer of his life, with no
fewer than 11 of the Internet-related companies he has backed (Wit
Capital, Goto.com, Tumbleweed and Netzero among them) at various
points along the road to an initial public offering.
 &HT;    The brand name he has built for himself with investments in a
couple of other successful Internet start-ups _ his firm's
specialty and the hottest destination for venture capital _ will be
put to the test. That's because the market's taste for Internet
stocks appears to have soured.
 &HT;    Dave Marquart, a Silicon Valley veteran who was the only venture
investor in Microsoft and the co-lead investor of Sun Microsystems,
warns: ``To be a bona fide venture capitalist, you have to go
through a complete cycle. Those who've entered the business since
the mid-'90s have never seen a down cycle. Everything has been to
the right and up _ very up.''
 &HT;    To understand why Jurvetson is a folk hero for so many of those
looking to convert their dreams and visions into Net wealth,
consider what happened in February 1996.
 &HT;    Sabeer Bhatia was an immigrant from India with zero experience
running a company, zero experience in consumer products and zero
experience in software. (He had been a hardware engineer at Apple.)
He was Jurvetson's age less two years, or J - 2. Bhatia had already
been turned down by 21 other venture capital firms. He had produced
no prototype, not even a graphic printed on a piece of paper.
 &HT;    What he did have was what Jurvetson called ``hallucinogenic
optimism'' and one intriguing idea, which he sketched out on a
conference room white board.
 &HT;    Jurvetson invested $300,000 to buy 15 percent of the project.
Less than two years later, the company that emerged from that
meeting, Hotmail, was sold to Microsoft for $400 million. Jurvetson
became an instant legend, the guy every young entrepreneur wants to
meet, even if it means paying 250X the cost of breakfast at Buck's.
 &HT;    Increasingly, successful venture capital firms are sheltering
themselves from the hail of unsolicited business plans by invoking
the Inverse Rule of Referrals: All good ideas come by referral, so
if it didn't come by referral it must not be a good idea.
 &HT;    Here's how a typical venture firm might catalogue the incoming
slough. Administrative staff scans the first paragraph of the cover
letter for a referral by a ``trusted third party,'' which is
entered in a database. Partners scan the database; they'll look at
the plan only if they trust the referral.
 &HT;    But Draper, Fisher, Jurvetson has cultivated a reputation for
ignoring that rule. The firm is located in Seaport, a sailing
harbor in Redwood City _ psychologically far from VC ground zero,
Sand Hill Road (but close enough to zip there in 10 minutes for a
meeting).
 &HT;    The problem with referral networks, as DFJ sees it, is that as
the venture capitalists age, so does their referral network,
cutting them off from the original thinkers. At DFJ they say they
read every one of the 5,000 plans sent to them each year. Theirs
was the first venture capital firm to run an advertisement.
 &HT;    DFJ is a ``seed'' firm, meaning it gets in on the first round of
financing for nascent businesses. ``Getting companies started is
the hardest part,'' says Tim Draper, the firm's founder, ``and it's
the most rewarding _ both financially and personally.''
 &HT;    To Jurvetson, it's even more rewarding than being an
entrepreneur. ``I get bits and pieces of several success stories,
sort of a highlight reel,'' he says.
 &HT;    Jurvetson has succeeded so far by making himself accessible to
the kind of young people who he figures come up with unusual ideas
_ as opposed to what the industry calls ``Me, Too'' product. One
recent month's ``Me, Too'' was on-line gift registries. He saw 30
business plans on that concept. The month before, it was
Web-calendar companies. He saw three Web-calendar plans out of Sun
Microsystems' employees alone.
 &HT;    Having lunch in San Francisco one day, he bumped into an old
friend who said he had left Netscape to found his dream start-up;
without much tact, Jurvetson jokingly blurted out, ``I hope it's
not another Web-calendar company!'' His friend's face fell. They
always think they're the only ones with the idea.
 &HT;    ``Truly original thinkers tend not to be entrepreneurs who've
spent 10 years at Cisco and can be trusted to know what they're
doing,'' Jurvetson explains. ``They tend to be 26 years old and
highflying. They often have a very childlike mind, with some
naivete. We're impressed by people who don't know what can't be
done.''
 &HT;    Just as the wild success of venture capital firms has made them
magnets for business plans, it has made them extremely popular with
fund investors (which tend to be pension plans, university
endowments and insurance companies). At a typical VC firm, money
under active management has gone up 40X; the number of partners to
manage that money has gone up only 4X. It's now common to raise
$350 million to $500 million every couple of years.
 &HT;    When Draper Fisher Jurvetson mailed out prospectuses for its
most recent fund, the firm received 3X the pledges it needed. The
partners drew the line at $180 million _ but even that is a huge
sum to deploy among early-stage firms, and easily the biggest fund
DFJ had ever raised.
 &HT;    VC firms have a fat incentive to raise more and more money,
because they get paid in two ways. First, when investors in a
specific fund are paid back after a set period of time has elapsed
(typically 10 years), the venture firm keeps 20 percent of all the
profits. Second is the gravy train: a 2.5 percent annual management
fee paid by investors, regardless of performance.
 &HT;    To deal with all the incoming money, most firms are ratcheting
up the size of investments, especially on secondary rounds, when a
company that has survived the seed stage needs large cash
infusions.
 &HT;    That means sticking with start-ups that have a high likelihood
of growing not just big but gargantuan, with billions of dollars in
annual sales. The Amazon of pharmacies, the Amazon of insurance,
the Amazon of auto parts _ consumer markets so big that even a
small slice of them guarantees a stellar payoff. They're not really
start-ups, they're bulk-ups. They put on weight fast and flex their
muscles and try to scare competitors off the beach.
 &HT;    But as Jurvetson sees it, something has been forgotten in this
process. Sure, it's cool to make so much money. And sure, it's cool
to be able to buy hair dye and condoms from the privacy of home.
But on-line superstores aren't creating new markets, and though
they might evolve the technology of E-commerce, they're not
revolutionizing it. They're just big Web sites. Where's the
adventure in that kind of venture?
 &HT;    Seed investing requires a special kind of hunger. Jurvetson's
parents were immigrants from Estonia, and he was reared in Dallas
by the creed that what he was to make of his life was entirely up
to him; there were no entitlements.
 &HT;    In an undergraduate psychology class, he answered a series of
Enneagram questions meant to divine his character type. He so fit
the description of a Type 3, the Performer (as in star performer),
that he was asked back in following semesters to lecture about the
traits of Type 3's: tremendous need for achievement, with an inner
drive to do something beyond the ordinary.
 &HT;    That drive is why he belongs dead center in the creation zone of
the new economy: where there's constantly a new goal to keep him
from getting bored, and where he has all of Silicon Valley as an
audience to perform for.
 &HT;    He seems very similar in character to the headstrong young
entrepreneurs he deals with, and perhaps that is partly why they
mind-meld with him so well.
 &HT;    At no time was this more clear than the day he drove across the
Dunbarton Bridge to meet Joe Chen, the CEO of a very new start-up,
See U There.com. Chen had 12 employees working in the living and
dining rooms of his Union City home. Jurvetson admits he's a sucker
for this kind of raw fertile atmosphere, and he grooved on it for a
while that day, talking to the employees and soaking up their
ambitious energy.
 &HT;    The whole point of money is that it's transferable legal tender,
that it retains its value no matter who possesses it _ your million
dollars is just as valuable as my million dollars. With venture
capital, that's not always the case.
 &HT;    Chen already had two other venture firms ready to give him the
million dollars he needed.
 &HT;    ``Literally, they are screaming at us, asking when we are going
to close the deal,'' Chen explained as we sat down at his
conference table in the garage. But he would rather have
Jurvetson's million dollars. His pitch: a plan to build an Internet
site to capture the largely untapped $60 billion market for event
planning. Jurvetson seemed inclined to invest (and two days later,
did).
 &HT;    Chen is J + 1 years old. He wanted Jurvetson's technical
fluency, but also a certain kind of cultural chemistry _ the
difference between working with someone who is just like your
father and working with someone who is just like you. As Chen puts
it, ``He's not some stiff suit walking in here.''
 &HT;    ``The hotmail story reached us even in Singapore,'' says
Eng-Siong Tan, the CEO of a start-up called Third Voice. Tan is J +
4 years old. ``It resonated and became part of the folklore of the
valley that he was willing to invest where 21 other firms had
passed. We knew Steve would be someone who gets our idea.''
 &HT;    Tan and eight other Singaporean engineers uprooted and came here
cold. They crammed into a cement-block storage warehouse in Foster
City, their front door an aluminum roll-up gate. In November, Tan
pitched Jurvetson.
 &HT;    Third Voice would make software that allows users to post
comments, viewable only by other users, directly onto the front
page of any Web site. It's the Web equivalent of empowering people
to spray-paint the State Capital. Jurvetson got it: This could do
to on-line chat what Ebay did to classified ads.
 &HT;    Internet companies are like Bazooka bubble gum. It takes a lot
of chewing and manipulation _ a tremendous amount of effort _ to
get the first bubble started. Then, with the slightest additional
effort, a mere exhale, it expands 100X. For a while it's customary
to double in size every month. That's what Tan is about to go
through. He's ready to exhale.
 &HT;    The first of Jurvetson's 11 IPO-bound companies _ Wit Capital,
an Internet investment bank _ went public early in June, right on
the heals of a disastrous week for Internet stocks. In late May,
Juno Online and Ziplink not only failed to post triple-digit
first-day returns, they both dropped below the offering price. Two
other IPOs were postponed.
 &HT;    Suddenly the center of the Internet boom seemed to a lot of
people like a scary place to be. But Wit went out and and finished
its first day up 85 percent _ a figure that would have been a
disappointment just months before, but now looked strong. And
Jurvetson sounded as chipper as ever.
 &HT;    Yes, some of the insane pops of early 1999 probably won't be
back, but Jurvetson says that only means offerings are being priced
more fairly and supply and demand are synching up. But the Internet
is the economy, he insists; businesses that still think it's just a
fad are in denial.
 &HT;    Of his IPO-bound companies, only one is considering putting off
its public offering by a quarter, he adds, and there is nothing in
his voice to suggest fear or unease about the future. That's what
the Type 3 description doesn't capture: This is a guy having time
of his life. The default setting on his face is a birthday-boy
smile.
 &HT;    And why not? ``I get to have the Steve Jobses of the next
century come to me and make their pitch. I can't define a better
recreation activity, let alone a job, that would be better than
that.''

DEATH MATCH ON THE GREEN (BUT TAKE TURNS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, golf. A venerable game of patience, practice and exquisite
concentration. A game of nuance and constant incremental striving
for perfection. The lush greens inspire a Zen-like contemplation of
the landscape. Custom dictates a sportsmanlike demeanor toward
one's fellow players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extreme golf'' would seem to be an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   After all, golf does not require hair-trigger reflexes,
outstanding agility or physical prowess. Unlike most extreme
sports, golf does not require players to hurtle through the air,
flip upside down or cling to sheer vertical surfaces. In fact,
there are few athletic pursuits less extreme than golf.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the makers of Links LS, a popular golf simulation,
have upped the computer golf ante with Links Extreme, a CD-ROM
billed as ``golf with attitude.'' It marries the precision of golf
to the lurid lighting and wanton violence of a pulse-pumping
computer game (and of course, the chukka-chukka-chukka heavy metal
that denotes ``extreme'' athletic programming on MTV and ESPN2).
</P>
<P>
   The Links Extreme tour roster consists of players suitably
attired in ``extreme'' Gen-X clothing _ baggy jeans, cargo pants,
stocking caps and backward baseball hats are de rigueur. After
selecting a golfer, you have two choices: driving practice or
course play.
</P>
<P>
   Driving practice lands you in Armadillo Al's Demolition Driving
Range, where cows, animatronic characters and slow-playing golfers
can be blown sky-high with golf ball grenades. Pebble Beach meets
``Apocalypse Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you've perfected your swing, it's time for a visit to the
Mojo Bay Resort and Country Club, located somewhere between
Jamaica, New Orleans and the Twilight Zone. Ghoulishly illuminated
by a blood-red sunset, Mojo Bay is dotted with palm trees,
alligator-infested swamps and skeletons that speak in an unplaced
Creole accent.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to convey menace on a golf course _ the openness,
clear sight lines and rolling hills make for an inherently
reassuring landscape. The spooky lighting and rustling noises
aren't really scary. But they are a kitschy reminder that something
dangerous is supposed to happen here.
</P>
<P>
   The trick-or-treat ambiance also highlights the performance of
the ``extreme'' golf balls, which allow you to hex your opponent's
shots and watch them boomerang or corkscrew into the water.
Meanwhile, your shots can go through trees, fly 400 yards with
rocket propulsion, skip over water or seek the pin with submarine
radar (a hollow plinking sound echoes until the putt sinks).
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, this couldn't be further from real life, where a
golf ball is a golf ball is a golf ball. On the other hand, every
golfer has experienced a shot that veers inexplicably at the last
minute or sticks to the green or sails farther than it should.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of these flukes can be explained by weather. But
whenever physical objects do something unexpected, there's an
element of superstition. There are times on the golf course when
you're blessed and times when you're cursed. At Mojo Bay, that is
an assurance, rather than a sneaking hunch.
</P>
<P>
   The other ``extreme'' course mode is Deathmatch Golf. This is
self-explanatory. You have at your disposal a number of artillery
balls: the Big Bertha (the blast radius is a city block), the
Howitzer (a ``circus tent-sized festival of destruction''), the
13-pound Frag Bomb and a small but effective grenade.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the pyrotechnics, the game retains a distinctly
golf-like formality. This is not a Quake free-for-all. Players take
turns. The hitting order on the first tee must be agreed upon.
There is also a decision about the maximum damage per hole, whether
explosive balls are allowed on the first tee and whether players
can be resurrected after their health score reaches zero _ and if
so, what is the penalty and the number of health points restored,
not to mention mulligans and gimmes.
</P>
<P>
   You can regain health points by making a birdie, an eagle or a
double eagle. If both players are within the blast radius of an
artillery ball and die simultaneously, the hole carries over. If
both players survive, the person with the lowest golf score wins.
In case of a tie, whoever has the most kills wins.
</P>
<P>
   It's very civilized, notwithstanding the exploding shells and
flying limbs. Unlike most computer death matches, there is no
fight-or-flight anxiety or rapid fire. All destruction is carefully
considered. Sometimes it's a tough call. For example, does one use
a 3- or 4-iron with the grenade, taking into account the sand traps
and wind conditions?
</P>
<P>
   The pace is deliberate, and the targets are static. It's trench
warfare on a golf course: Verdun with caddies, or croquet with a
body count.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still very sociable. You can play with up to three
other people. You can arrange tee times for nine holes of
Deathmatch Golf on the Internet. As with many online multiplayer
games, Links Extreme allows for chat, using either text or voice
messages.
</P>
<P>
   It speaks well for online games, a pursuit whose reputation has
been tarnished of late. On-line games combine two of our biggest
cultural bogeymen: computer games and the Internet. Critics
(universally non-gamers) tend to focus on the imagery and the
hotblooded competition.
</P>
<P>
   But few people realize how much agreement and consent has to
happen before two or more people can play a game, be it tennis or
Quake.
</P>
<P>
   Games are defined by rule systems; no matter how sweaty and
anarchic the action appears, there are always rules that must be
universally accepted by the players. As any parent knows,
persuading an adolescent to accept rule systems is a difficult
trick. On-line games persuade them to accept rule systems on a
routine basis, and that has a value, in and of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Death match, anyone?

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Bill Bradley had come home again, almost. To St. Louis, just up
the Mississippi from Crystal City (where, as you know if you've
heard his stump speech, there were 96 in his graduating class,
along with one stoplight and 3,492 souls all told).
 &HT;    Here, more than anywhere, he is an American hero, the good kid
who worked hard, minded his manners and grew up to be a Rhodes
scholar, a New York Knick, then a New Jersey senator. And now, who
knows, maybe even president.
 &HT;    People who knew Bradley as a kid remember not just his stats but
also how he was the kind of guy who, even as a high school
all-American, made a point of asking the shy or gawky girls to
dance.
 &HT;    One schoolmate, Sam Richards, who works for the town where they
grew up, still feels good that, way back when, Bradley the
student-council president bothered to thank him in front of a whole
convention of student leaders for moving the chairs in and out of
the auditorium.
 &HT;    Bradley the presidential candidate still does that sometimes,
showing a rare feeling for those who have worked hard making the
table arrangements or preparing food for an event. At a YMCA
``character breakfast,'' in Manchester, N.H., last month, he
reminded the crowd, ``Rooms like this don't just happen.''
 &HT;    But he can also show a real prickliness at odd moments. And on
the day of this homecoming, at a news conference for local
reporters, he bridled at the kind of question most pols answer on
cruise control. Missouri's secretary of state had endorsed him and
told of pickup games in which a young Bradley sometimes ``gave away
shots and even let the little kids win once in a while.''
 &HT;    The candidate too had spoken, in his poet's way, about ``the
sense of place along the Mississippi River'' as a metaphor that has
run through his life.
 &HT;    After that came the questions, none of them unfriendly. Yet when
a radio reporter looking for a sound bite with the word
``Missouri'' in it asked him whether he expected to carry their
state, Bradley was snide.
 &HT;    ``If you ask that of any candidate they're not going to say no _
so yeahhh,'' he drawled, as if speaking to an imbecile. ``Of course
I plan on carrying Missouri. And Iowa. And New Hampshire. And
California.''
 &HT;    As everyone filed out of the room, the same reporter dared to
ask a second innocuous question, about the latest school shooting,
and Bradley scolded him: ``Hey, this is a press conference. You had
your chance to ask a question, and now you're trying to get in
another one. That's not fair.''
 &HT;    Later I asked the reporter, for WIL-FM, if there was some
history between them. ``Never saw him before,'' he said.
 &HT;    Bradley was crotchety on several occasions during recent
campaign trips, usually with the local press. A couple of times, he
also took the unusual tack of correcting prospective voters whose
questions seemed to him predicated on faulty assumptions.
 &HT;    Twice too he corrected supporters whose glowing introductions
had slightly understated his resume. After a former intern
introduced him at Phillips Exeter Academy, in New Hampshire, by
referring to Bradley's ``two tremendous books,'' the senator
amended the count. ``Three great books,'' he said, joking but also
setting the record straight. It seems to have been quite a while
since Bradley danced with the fat girl.
 &HT;    And one of the most radical aspects of Bradley's campaign is his
apparent willingness to be himself, even when the result is not
particularly appealing. The effect, as he travels the country
telling Iowans that he knows nothing about agriculture policy, for
example, is Bulworth with all his marbles _ a sometimes jarringly
frank candidate who seems to feel he has nothing to lose. Which, of
course, can be appealing.
 &HT;    When he makes his pitch for campaign finance reform _ ``Do you
really think one man, one vote counts as much as somebody who can
give $500,000?'' _ heads usually bob. Because Bradley on the stump
is a truth-teller, especially when he's kidding.
 &HT;    Speaking to investment managers in Merrimack, N.H., he invited
questions: ``I'll call on you, and if I don't know the answer or
think the question is stupid, I'll go like this'' _ waving his arms
for the questioner to sit down. ``I mean, haven't you wanted to
have a candidate say what he's really thinking? You think this is a
piece of cake up here?''
 &HT;    Yet he is also peculiarly aloof, running for the highest public
office while safeguarding his privacy to the point that he refuses
to reveal what he reads. And he is surpassingly vague about what he
would do if elected. He wants to heal the racial divide, expand
access to health care and address child poverty. How? In the fall,
he says, all will be revealed.
 &HT;    Listening to Bradley, who is running to help us ``see the
collective whole,'' it is never completely clear whether he is
incredibly deep or just a shade dotty. Is he silent on the issues
by design or default? ``I think it's to my advantage to have people
get to know me'' before they hear the specifics of policy, he told
me. Specifics, of course, with which they may or may not agree.
 &HT;    Though Democratic bigwigs still aren't taking him too seriously,
Bradley has already given Al Gore a bad case of the williwaws _
without saying much more about his own plans than that line about
how he'd like his onetime teammate Phil Jackson, the former Chicago
Bulls coach, to be his secretary of defense.
 &HT;    Merely by announcing that his ideas are bigger, he has spooked
the vice president into unveiling all sorts of specific
initiatives, to the general amazement of the Bradley camp. (Who
knew it would be this easy?) So he won't be rushed into saying
more.
 &HT;    ``Policy has to have some roots,'' he explained. ``If it's just
policy, then you're back in interest-group land. People think
policy means legislation, a bill, but that is not connected to the
deeper yearnings. For love. For hope.'' Which, apparently, is where
Bradley comes in.
 &HT;    The Iowans who turned out for a political breakfast in Maquoketa
on a rainy Saturday last month seemed pretty content, chewing
homemade doughnuts and waiting for Bradley.
 &HT;    One man in the crowd got that misty look that comes over so many
white guys of a certain age when they mention the senator's years
as a Knick. Eventually, he snapped out of it; he's a Republican.
``I'm not here ready to say, 'Rah, rah, rah,''' he cautioned. ``But
I like his family values. A lot of what I've heard are crossover
themes,'' with appeal for independents.
 &HT;    Across the room, a teacher said she felt good about Bradley for
the opposite reason: He seemed to represent a return to traditional
Democratic principles. A couple of people even said they sensed
that Bradley probably knows more about farm issues than Gore, whose
summers hosing out hog parlors down on the family farm seemed to
have been wasted on this crowd.
 &HT;    These folks seemed inclined to like Bradley, even after he
showed up and told them he wasn't really conversant on farm issues:
``I represented New Jersey for 18 years. I don't pretend to know
agriculture.'' (A sore point, I'm sure, for truck farmers in South
Jersey.)
 &HT;    A man who asked him: ``Are you a person of high moral standards?
Are you now and have you always been?'' got this reply: ``I think
people have a right to know if I'm a crook. I don't think they have
a right to know if you're a sinner. We all are.'' Without so much
as a little dollop of sugar-free topping, he told a woman wearing a
huge ``Choose Life'' button that they would never agree.
 &HT;    As he speechifies, clearing his throat every few beats, he kicks
a chair, absently, or digs the heel of his foot into the floor,
hands burrowed deep in his pockets and then set free, all over the
place. Sometimes he rubs them together as if to warm them. When
audiences run out of questions, he papers over the quiet by asking
and answering his own: ``Who was the toughest guy I ever guarded?
Without question, John Havlicek.''
 &HT;    Despite persistent reports of dullness, he is in fact highly
ironic for someone in his line of work, mocking what he clearly
sees as his semiridiculous role in a semiridiculous process. As he
turned around and walked back into the building where he'd just
spoken in Merrimack, we nearly collided.
 &HT;    Forget something? ``No,'' he said, rolling his eyes. ``I'm just
being authentic for CBS.'' The cameras ready, he tried his exit
again.
 &HT;    But when he talks about our ``yearning for something beyond the
material,'' audiences do respond.
 &HT;    ``There is a goodness in most of us,'' he says. ``If we can see
that goodness in our neighbor, we'd feel less lonely, less
isolated, less fearful, and we'd see our untapped potential.'' Then
he invites them to ``feel a part of something you might look back
on and say, 'That was a special time and a special journey.'''
 &HT;    As a candidate, Bradley is first a celebrity, a sports legend.
In his 18 years in the Senate, he was considered a loner, hard to
know and, sometimes, hard to work with. Politically too he was hard
to pigeonhole, voting against President Clinton's welfare bill but,
at one point, in favor of support for the Nicaraguan contras.
 &HT;    He was one of only two senators to oppose Alan Greenspan's
confirmation as chairman of the Federal Reserve, questioning his
international experience.
 &HT;    As others have pointed out, Bradley and his immediate
competition have a certain amount in common, including calm
personal lives and only middling oratory skills. Bradley says he
barely knows Gore, never having worked with him on anything in the
Senate _ where neither won any prizes for collegiality.
 &HT;    Both are free-traders who support abortion rights and the death
penalty, though in each case Bradley a little more so. They voted
alike about 80 percent of the time.
 &HT;    No legislative lightweight, Bradley worked on Latin American
debt consolidation and monetary exchange rates and took home his
biggest victory in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. But he nearly lost
his last race, in 1990, to Christine Todd Whitman over a state tax
increase pushed through by Jim Florio when he was the Democratic
governor. When Bradley retired two and a half years ago, he walked
away, saying, ``Politics is broken.''
 &HT;    Most audiences, though, still know him principally as Dollar
Bill, famous good guy and a fairly blank canvas on which to project
any number of their own feelings. Certainly the national press
seems awed, the boys in particular.
 &HT;    ``You'd be surprised how many journalists we've heard from who
want to go to work for him,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's press
secretary, who is hyping the mytho-poetic aspects of the campaign.
(``The campaign replicates the rhythm of when he was on the road
playing ball,'' Hauser claims, though the schedule seems perfectly
standard. ``He does something, we drive, talk, down time, he
settles back in, works the crowd and gets the juices going. We kind
of stumbled into it, and now we try to build it in.'')
 &HT;    Even Gore loyalists are not immune. At a cocktail party for
labor leaders where Bradley appeared with Phil Jackson, only the
presence of the White House chief of staff, John Podesta, kept
another administration official from asking for an autograph.
 &HT;    ``I kept thinking, 'How much do I want that autograph versus my
job?''' said the official, who begged for anonymity. ''I don't
think you'd find too many people who could say one thing he stands
for,'' he added, back in Gore 2000 mode. Still, ``when they left, I
couldn't believe I had let the moment pass.''
 &HT;    This kind of adulation has allowed, and probably even
encouraged, Bradley to run, as he says, ``a different kind of
campaign.'' To run on trust. Who should be president? ``The
decision,'' he says, ``boils down to who do you trust with your
life? Who do you trust with your job?''
 &HT;    Of course, this nicely contrasts his own clean slate to the
Clinton-Gore scandals, which he never mentions.
 &HT;    More important, he's asking voters to simply take him on faith,
to trust him to do the right thing even before he's said what that
might be. In fact, even before he's worked it out for himself.
 &HT;    But surely there is an arrogance in his position that, while he
might not have thought through the issues or decided exactly where
he wants to take the country, we should trust him because he is,
after all, Bill Bradley. He has repeatedly said his ideas are
bigger than Gore's.
 &HT;    And in a sense, the answer to those who are asking, ``Then, so
what's the big idea?'' is that the idea of Bill Bradley is his big
idea: the idea that the candidate himself, his history and all he
represents, is the message in a campaign that is the opposite of
say, Steve Forbes' '96 run on the flat tax, flat tax, flat tax.
 &HT;    As Bradley told one particularly enthusiastic group in New
Hampshire, while the sun set over the foothills of the White
Mountains behind him, ``The things I'm going to mention are more
important than policy differences'' between candidates. After the
gathering, one woman hung her head out the window of her car and
yelled, ``He's so refreshing!''
 &HT;    People don't really vote on issues, Bradley told me.
``Particularly for president, they don't. They vote on the basis of
trust.'' And right or wrong, that idea is without question bigger
than the 15-point health-care plan that we in the media are all
pretending we can't wait to get our hands on.
 &HT;    Eventually, in the fall, Bradley promises, content will be
added. Meanwhile, weary of being pressed for specifics, he has made
up some nonsense about how his campaign is now in the ``vision''
phase, soon to be followed by the principle, policy and action
phases.
 &HT;    At this point, he is off to a fast start, raising a surprising
$4.3 million last quarter, with help from Hollywood and Wall
Street. He has described the primary campaign as many months of
``one on one'' with Gore.
 &HT;    Sometimes, Bradley throws a little sand in Gore's direction. ``I
only have time to read good books,'' he said, explaining why he
never tackled ``Earth in the Balance.'' But of course, Bill Bradley
cannot be Bill Bradley and pick a nasty fight with Al Gore.
Instead, he's going so far in the other direction as to claim he
isn't even running against Al Gore.
 &HT;    Really? He sighed: ``The question is, Can you have a politics
that becomes a little bit like the McGwire-Sosa home-run contest
last year? One of them won the title, but both of them won in terms
of what the competition produced for the baseball fans. Why can't
politics be like that?''
 &HT;    Then, he smiled, liking this new idea. ``That's pretty good. I
never said that before.''

along with one stoplight and 3,492 souls all told).
 &HT;    Here, more than anywhere, he is an American hero, the good kid
who worked hard, minded his manners and grew up to be a Rhodes
scholar, a New York Knick, then a New Jersey senator. And now, who
knows, maybe even president.
 &HT;    People who knew Bradley as a kid remember not just his stats but
also how he was the kind of guy who, even as a high school
all-American, made a point of asking the shy or gawky girls to
dance.
 &HT;    One schoolmate, Sam Richards, who works for the town where they
grew up, still feels good that, way back when, Bradley the
student-council president bothered to thank him in front of a whole
convention of student leaders for moving the chairs in and out of
the auditorium.
 &HT;    Bradley the presidential candidate still does that sometimes,
showing a rare feeling for those who have worked hard making the
table arrangements or preparing food for an event. At a YMCA
``character breakfast,'' in Manchester, N.H., last month, he
reminded the crowd, ``Rooms like this don't just happen.''
 &HT;    But he can also show a real prickliness at odd moments. And on
the day of this homecoming, at a news conference for local
reporters, he bridled at the kind of question most pols answer on
cruise control. Missouri's secretary of state had endorsed him and
told of pickup games in which a young Bradley sometimes ``gave away
shots and even let the little kids win once in a while.''
 &HT;    The candidate too had spoken, in his poet's way, about ``the
sense of place along the Mississippi River'' as a metaphor that has
run through his life.
 &HT;    After that came the questions, none of them unfriendly. Yet when
a radio reporter looking for a sound bite with the word
``Missouri'' in it asked him whether he expected to carry their
state, Bradley was snide.
 &HT;    ``If you ask that of any candidate they're not going to say no _
so yeahhh,'' he drawled, as if speaking to an imbecile. ``Of course
I plan on carrying Missouri. And Iowa. And New Hampshire. And
California.''
 &HT;    As everyone filed out of the room, the same reporter dared to
ask a second innocuous question, about the latest school shooting,
and Bradley scolded him: ``Hey, this is a press conference. You had
your chance to ask a question, and now you're trying to get in
another one. That's not fair.''
 &HT;    Later I asked the reporter, for WIL-FM, if there was some
history between them. ``Never saw him before,'' he said.
 &HT;    Bradley was crotchety on several occasions during recent
campaign trips, usually with the local press. A couple of times, he
also took the unusual tack of correcting prospective voters whose
questions seemed to him predicated on faulty assumptions.
 &HT;    Twice too he corrected supporters whose glowing introductions
had slightly understated his resume. After a former intern
introduced him at Phillips Exeter Academy, in New Hampshire, by
referring to Bradley's ``two tremendous books,'' the senator
amended the count. ``Three great books,'' he said, joking but also
setting the record straight. It seems to have been quite a while
since Bradley danced with the fat girl.
 &HT;    And one of the most radical aspects of Bradley's campaign is his
apparent willingness to be himself, even when the result is not
particularly appealing. The effect, as he travels the country
telling Iowans that he knows nothing about agriculture policy, for
example, is Bulworth with all his marbles _ a sometimes jarringly
frank candidate who seems to feel he has nothing to lose. Which, of
course, can be appealing.
 &HT;    When he makes his pitch for campaign finance reform _ ``Do you
really think one man, one vote counts as much as somebody who can
give $500,000?'' _ heads usually bob. Because Bradley on the stump
is a truth-teller, especially when he's kidding.
 &HT;    Speaking to investment managers in Merrimack, N.H., he invited
questions: ``I'll call on you, and if I don't know the answer or
think the question is stupid, I'll go like this'' _ waving his arms
for the questioner to sit down. ``I mean, haven't you wanted to
have a candidate say what he's really thinking? You think this is a
piece of cake up here?''
 &HT;    Yet he is also peculiarly aloof, running for the highest public
office while safeguarding his privacy to the point that he refuses
to reveal what he reads. And he is surpassingly vague about what he
would do if elected. He wants to heal the racial divide, expand
access to health care and address child poverty. How? In the fall,
he says, all will be revealed.
 &HT;    Listening to Bradley, who is running to help us ``see the
collective whole,'' it is never completely clear whether he is
incredibly deep or just a shade dotty. Is he silent on the issues
by design or default? ``I think it's to my advantage to have people
get to know me'' before they hear the specifics of policy, he told
me. Specifics, of course, with which they may or may not agree.
 &HT;    Though Democratic bigwigs still aren't taking him too seriously,
Bradley has already given Al Gore a bad case of the williwaws _
without saying much more about his own plans than that line about
how he'd like his onetime teammate Phil Jackson, the former Chicago
Bulls coach, to be his secretary of defense.
 &HT;    Merely by announcing that his ideas are bigger, he has spooked
the vice president into unveiling all sorts of specific
initiatives, to the general amazement of the Bradley camp. (Who
knew it would be this easy?) So he won't be rushed into saying
more.
 &HT;    ``Policy has to have some roots,'' he explained. ``If it's just
policy, then you're back in interest-group land. People think
policy means legislation, a bill, but that is not connected to the
deeper yearnings. For love. For hope.'' Which, apparently, is where
Bradley comes in.
 &HT;    The Iowans who turned out for a political breakfast in Maquoketa
on a rainy Saturday last month seemed pretty content, chewing
homemade doughnuts and waiting for Bradley.
 &HT;    One man in the crowd got that misty look that comes over so many
white guys of a certain age when they mention the senator's years
as a Knick. Eventually, he snapped out of it; he's a Republican.
``I'm not here ready to say, 'Rah, rah, rah,''' he cautioned. ``But
I like his family values. A lot of what I've heard are crossover
themes,'' with appeal for independents.
 &HT;    Across the room, a teacher said she felt good about Bradley for
the opposite reason: He seemed to represent a return to traditional
Democratic principles. A couple of people even said they sensed
that Bradley probably knows more about farm issues than Gore, whose
summers hosing out hog parlors down on the family farm seemed to
have been wasted on this crowd.
 &HT;    These folks seemed inclined to like Bradley, even after he
showed up and told them he wasn't really conversant on farm issues:
``I represented New Jersey for 18 years. I don't pretend to know
agriculture.'' (A sore point, I'm sure, for truck farmers in South
Jersey.)
 &HT;    A man who asked him: ``Are you a person of high moral standards?
Are you now and have you always been?'' got this reply: ``I think
people have a right to know if I'm a crook. I don't think they have
a right to know if you're a sinner. We all are.'' Without so much
as a little dollop of sugar-free topping, he told a woman wearing a
huge ``Choose Life'' button that they would never agree.
 &HT;    As he speechifies, clearing his throat every few beats, he kicks
a chair, absently, or digs the heel of his foot into the floor,
hands burrowed deep in his pockets and then set free, all over the
place. Sometimes he rubs them together as if to warm them. When
audiences run out of questions, he papers over the quiet by asking
and answering his own: ``Who was the toughest guy I ever guarded?
Without question, John Havlicek.''
 &HT;    Despite persistent reports of dullness, he is in fact highly
ironic for someone in his line of work, mocking what he clearly
sees as his semiridiculous role in a semiridiculous process. As he
turned around and walked back into the building where he'd just
spoken in Merrimack, we nearly collided.
 &HT;    Forget something? ``No,'' he said, rolling his eyes. ``I'm just
being authentic for CBS.'' The cameras ready, he tried his exit
again.
 &HT;    But when he talks about our ``yearning for something beyond the
material,'' audiences do respond.
 &HT;    ``There is a goodness in most of us,'' he says. ``If we can see
that goodness in our neighbor, we'd feel less lonely, less
isolated, less fearful, and we'd see our untapped potential.'' Then
he invites them to ``feel a part of something you might look back
on and say, 'That was a special time and a special journey.'''
 &HT;    As a candidate, Bradley is first a celebrity, a sports legend.
In his 18 years in the Senate, he was considered a loner, hard to
know and, sometimes, hard to work with. Politically too he was hard
to pigeonhole, voting against President Clinton's welfare bill but,
at one point, in favor of support for the Nicaraguan contras.
 &HT;    He was one of only two senators to oppose Alan Greenspan's
confirmation as chairman of the Federal Reserve, questioning his
international experience.
 &HT;    As others have pointed out, Bradley and his immediate
competition have a certain amount in common, including calm
personal lives and only middling oratory skills. Bradley says he
barely knows Gore, never having worked with him on anything in the
Senate _ where neither won any prizes for collegiality.
 &HT;    Both are free-traders who support abortion rights and the death
penalty, though in each case Bradley a little more so. They voted
alike about 80 percent of the time.
 &HT;    No legislative lightweight, Bradley worked on Latin American
debt consolidation and monetary exchange rates and took home his
biggest victory in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. But he nearly lost
his last race, in 1990, to Christine Todd Whitman over a state tax
increase pushed through by Jim Florio when he was the Democratic
governor. When Bradley retired two and a half years ago, he walked
away, saying, ``Politics is broken.''
 &HT;    Most audiences, though, still know him principally as Dollar
Bill, famous good guy and a fairly blank canvas on which to project
any number of their own feelings. Certainly the national press
seems awed, the boys in particular.
 &HT;    ``You'd be surprised how many journalists we've heard from who
want to go to work for him,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's press
secretary, who is hyping the mytho-poetic aspects of the campaign.
(``The campaign replicates the rhythm of when he was on the road
playing ball,'' Hauser claims, though the schedule seems perfectly
standard. ``He does something, we drive, talk, down time, he
settles back in, works the crowd and gets the juices going. We kind
of stumbled into it, and now we try to build it in.'')
 &HT;    Even Gore loyalists are not immune. At a cocktail party for
labor leaders where Bradley appeared with Phil Jackson, only the
presence of the White House chief of staff, John Podesta, kept
another administration official from asking for an autograph.
 &HT;    ``I kept thinking, 'How much do I want that autograph versus my
job?''' said the official, who begged for anonymity. ''I don't
think you'd find too many people who could say one thing he stands
for,'' he added, back in Gore 2000 mode. Still, ``when they left, I
couldn't believe I had let the moment pass.''
 &HT;    This kind of adulation has allowed, and probably even
encouraged, Bradley to run, as he says, ``a different kind of
campaign.'' To run on trust. Who should be president? ``The
decision,'' he says, ``boils down to who do you trust with your
life? Who do you trust with your job?''
 &HT;    Of course, this nicely contrasts his own clean slate to the
Clinton-Gore scandals, which he never mentions.
 &HT;    More important, he's asking voters to simply take him on faith,
to trust him to do the right thing even before he's said what that
might be. In fact, even before he's worked it out for himself.
 &HT;    But surely there is an arrogance in his position that, while he
might not have thought through the issues or decided exactly where
he wants to take the country, we should trust him because he is,
after all, Bill Bradley. He has repeatedly said his ideas are
bigger than Gore's.
 &HT;    And in a sense, the answer to those who are asking, ``Then, so
what's the big idea?'' is that the idea of Bill Bradley is his big
idea: the idea that the candidate himself, his history and all he
represents, is the message in a campaign that is the opposite of
say, Steve Forbes' '96 run on the flat tax, flat tax, flat tax.
 &HT;    As Bradley told one particularly enthusiastic group in New
Hampshire, while the sun set over the foothills of the White
Mountains behind him, ``The things I'm going to mention are more
important than policy differences'' between candidates. After the
gathering, one woman hung her head out the window of her car and
yelled, ``He's so refreshing!''
 &HT;    People don't really vote on issues, Bradley told me.
``Particularly for president, they don't. They vote on the basis of
trust.'' And right or wrong, that idea is without question bigger
than the 15-point health-care plan that we in the media are all
pretending we can't wait to get our hands on.
 &HT;    Eventually, in the fall, Bradley promises, content will be
added. Meanwhile, weary of being pressed for specifics, he has made
up some nonsense about how his campaign is now in the ``vision''
phase, soon to be followed by the principle, policy and action
phases.
 &HT;    At this point, he is off to a fast start, raising a surprising
$4.3 million last quarter, with help from Hollywood and Wall
Street. He has described the primary campaign as many months of
``one on one'' with Gore.
 &HT;    Sometimes, Bradley throws a little sand in Gore's direction. ``I
only have time to read good books,'' he said, explaining why he
never tackled ``Earth in the Balance.'' But of course, Bill Bradley
cannot be Bill Bradley and pick a nasty fight with Al Gore.
Instead, he's going so far in the other direction as to claim he
isn't even running against Al Gore.
 &HT;    Really? He sighed: ``The question is, Can you have a politics
that becomes a little bit like the McGwire-Sosa home-run contest
last year? One of them won the title, but both of them won in terms
of what the competition produced for the baseball fans. Why can't
politics be like that?''
 &HT;    Then, he smiled, liking this new idea. ``That's pretty good. I
never said that before.''

 &HT;    SUMMER SCHOOL GROWS BIGGER THAN EVER
 &HT;    600&AMP;adds With SUMMER-DATA. For release Sunday, July 4.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Summer school enrollments are being pushed to
record levels across the United States by two new waves of students
_ younger ones who are lagging behind their classmates and older
ones trying to surge ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer school is bigger than it's ever been in my 22 years in
the field,'' said Michael Casserly, executive director of the
Council of the Great City Schools.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 million students _ one out of every 10 in the elementary
and secondary grades _ will be attending accredited summer schools
this year. More than 4 million others will be involved in organized
learning activities ranging from Bible school and arts and crafts
sessions to short courses in computers, science, history or foreign
languages.
</P>
<P>
   A Cox Newspapers survey found that seven of the nation's 10
largest school districts are enrolling more students this summer.
Their combined summer enrollments will jump to well over 600,000
this year, an increase of more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many districts are following a recent trend of mandatory
remedial programs in math and reading. But summer schools have been
growing steadily throughout the 1990s, according to a recent
federal report.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, only 15 percent of public elementary schools receiving
Title I poverty aid used the federal funds to subsidize summer
programs. That had risen to 41 percent by last summer, and is
expected to be higher this year.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly said at least 22 of the 56 large school districts that
belong to his Washington-based Council of the Great City Schools
not only offer summer school, but make it mandatory for a
significant number of students. That helps combat the biggest
shortcoming of traditional summer schools _ an average dropout rate
of 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is a wonderful reflection of the national concern
that all kids meet high standards,'' said Education Secretary
Richard Riley. ``Kids who fell behind used to be socially promoted
or flunked; either course was bad for them. Now there's a consensus
that it's better to send them to summer school.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about one-fifth of the grade-schoolers and two-fifths of
the high school students in summer school come there for the
traditional reason: retaking a course they had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the U.S. Department of Education reported in May that
most summer students fall into two categories: low performers or
highly proficient.
</P>
<P>
   Low performers may never have failed a course, but they do so
poorly on standardized reading or math tests that they are urged or
required to go to summer school.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Walker of Waco, Texas, said her son Alvin ``ended up
enjoying it last year,'' when he had to pass reading in summer
school in order to be promoted to third grade.
</P>
<P>
   This year, like nearly two-thirds of last summer's students in
Waco, Alvin was promoted to the next grade without problems. ``This
summer he gets to sleep late,'' Mrs. Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Top performers, on the other hand are volunteering for extra
courses in order to get through school faster, study an unusual
subject, or improve their chances of admission to a prestigious
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I want to do when I am older and go to
college, and summer gives me a chance to pick up different ideas,''
said Alex Ridder, a junior at Kent Denver High School in Colorado.
As part of a one-week course in environmental journalism, he
paddled a canoe past dead fish floating on the Anacostia River
after a summer storm flushed raw sewage into storm drains in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional adds follow.)
</P>
<P>
   Like other parts of the fragmented U.S. education system, summer
schools vary a lot. Few are further apart than the widely admired
programs in Long Beach, Calif., which stresses remediation, and the
Parkway school district in Missouri, which stresses enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids are absolutely in a meat-and-potatoes program,'' said
Chris Steinhauser, the summer school superintendent in Long Beach.
There, 3,900 of the 15,000 students in second and third grade,
along with 450 fifth-graders, were sent to summer school by the
district or their parents for basic courses in reading or math.
</P>
<P>
   Each teacher concentrates on teaching a small group of students
with similar deficiencies under a tightly controlled curriculum
designed by the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have time to waste on nonproductive activities. If
it's language arts, then for four hours, they read, they write,
they spell,'' Steinhauser said. ``A lot of people were critical of
that, but it worked. So now a lot of places are copying us.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite philosophy is applied with equal enthusiasm outside
St. Louis in the suburban Parkway school district, where summer
school superintendent Craig Larson scoffed at ``drill and kill''
remedial classes as ``insane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If all you do in the summer is take a kid who hated the
regular school day, and make it even dryer and uglier in the
summer, why would that work?'' Larson asked. ``Our goal is to get
the kids excited about school so they progress academically without
you marching into the room to make them do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkway this summer is offering classes that range from ceramics
and medical biology to bicycle maintenance and a social studies
course in which students research and debate a specific public
policy. Last summer's topic: President Harry Truman's decision to
authorize the atomic bombing of cities in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The 21,000-student district, which also operates two satellite
summer programs in poor areas of St. Louis, this year has more than
8,000 summer students _ one-sixth of them from outside the
district.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   There are still many holdouts against summer school, especially
in states that don't generously subsidize it.
</P>
<P>
   Given a limited amount of money to help its disproportionate
share of low-performing students, Palm Beach County, Fla., decided
to concentrate on before-school and after-school programs, instead
of mandatory summer school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes much more practical sense than waiting (until) a
student has failed and trying to fix that in a couple of weeks over
the summer,'' said Bettye (cq) Roth, director of curriculum and
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, summer school is that it usually helps
students, and hardly ever harms them, said Harris Cooper, an
education expert at the University of Missouri-Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students who go to summer school achieve more academically
than the same kind of students who don't go,'' he concluded after
leading a team of researchers whose ``meta-analysis'' of more than
300 studies of the effect of summer school programs is to be
published next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that kids' brains don't turn off in June,
that they are capable of learning no matter what the weather is
outside,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that summer school still leaves plenty of time
for a child to drift freely through ``those lazy, hazy, crazy days
of summer'' celebrated by singer Nat King Cole. The average summer
program lasts five weeks and takes 16 hours a week less time than
the average child spends watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   Summer school also combats ``summer slide,'' in which knowledge
of fact-specific skills like spelling and arithmetic fades away
during the vacation months, said sociologist Karl Alexander at
Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that the children from lower-income households (in
Baltimore) improved at the same rate as those from upper-income
households during the regular school year,'' Alexander said, ``but
they slid back during the summer, while the others continued to
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   To a smaller extent, today's higher demand for year-round
special education and for courses in English as a second language
also contributed to the growth of summer school. That may help
explain why Hispanic students are nearly twice as likely as
non-Hispanic whites to go to summer school.
</P>
<P>
   Another, stronger source of support for the trend is the oldest:
a desire to find safe daytime activities for the youngest
schoolchildren. Summer school first became popular in the United
States after 1916, when child labor laws made it harder for
grade-school children in big cities to find paying summer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Child safety and supervision re-emerged as issues in the 1990s,
after changes in the economy, family structure and welfare laws
meant more children are being raised within families in which the
only parent or both parents work.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many summer schools that end around midday help out
working parents by pairing up with a low-cost afternoon recreation
program sponsored by a parks department, youth organization or
other community group.

   ``In poor families, in particular, in our mobile society, there
are not always a lot of relatives around to mind the kids,'' said
Linda Lopez, a school board member from Tucson's Sunnyside
District, where about 3,000 of the 15,000 students attend summer
school.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many studies have shown that organized educational or
recreational programs before or after the regular school day reduce
juvenile crime. Many people believe summer school might do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the main thing is the kids get more one-on-one attention
from the faculty in the smaller classes in the summer, so their
skills don't get rusty,'' Lopez said. ``Otherwise, it can take four
to six weeks to play catch-up when they return in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A big argument for all-year schools has been that if you break
the 180-day pattern into 45-day segments separated by three-week
vacations, kids forget less during the breaks,'' said teacher Marge
Eberts, a columnist on the Web-based Family Eduction Network.
``Summer school goes one step further, giving them extra days and
hours of instructional time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing slowing the trend is the cost: it takes a bundle to
retrofit an old school for air conditioning,'' said Steve
Jongewaard, (cq) professor of education at Hamline (cq) University
in St. Paul, Minn. During a heat wave in Chicago last summer, some
children in 100-year-old schools were passing out.
</P>
<P>
   But summer school can be especially helpful for ``kids whose
families can't afford to send them to camp or take them on
educational trips to Colonial Williamsburg or the Grand Canyon,''
Jongewaard said. And on a practical note, he added, ``For a child
on the free or reduced-price lunch program, it's also valuable as a
place to get something to eat.''

 By HOWARD MEANS  
 FROM: Washingtonian  
 &HT;    Thirty years ago this month at 4:17 and 40 seconds p.m. Eastern
Daylight Time on the afternoon of July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11
lunar landing module Eagle touched down on the moon's bone-dry Sea
of Tranquility.
 &HT;    Seconds later, the Eagle's 38-year-old civilian commander, Neil
Armstrong, radioed back to Earth what was to become the second most
memorable broadcast from outer space:
 &HT;    ``Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.''
 &HT;    ``Roger, Tranquility,'' came the reply from the NASA mission
headquarters in Texas, ``we copy you on the ground. You've got a
bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a
lot.''
 &HT;    Six and a half hours would pass before Armstrong and Air Force
Col. Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin became the first earthlings to walk on
the moon. As he did so, Armstrong topped his earlier broadcast with
the 11 most famous words ever beamed back from the heavens:
``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''
 &HT;    Above them orbited the only hope that Armstrong and Aldrin had
of returning home: the command module Columbia, piloted by Air
Force Col. Michael Collins.
 &HT;    The production values of the lunar broadcast watched that day
and night by hundreds of millions of people were terrible: grainy
black-and-white images delivered by choppy transmission to TV sets
that still weren't all that high in resolution themselves. But for
sheer drama, it was a moment almost impossible to top.
 &HT;    In the Oval Office, Richard Nixon placed a phone call that
traveled through the White House switchboard to the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, and from there to the Space Center in
Houston and via the Goldstone antenna in California to the two
astronauts posed in front of the TV camera they had planted on the
moon:
 &HT;    ``Hello, Neil and Buzz,'' the president began. ``I'm talking to
you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this
certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.''
 &HT;    NASA never tired in those days of reminding the public of all
the scientific advances already spun off from the space program:
filtering systems that could remove dust and airborne bacteria from
a command module or an operating room, sensors that were equally
adept at measuring meteorite hits on a spacecraft or muscle tremors
that might signal the early stages of Parkinson's disease. The list
went on and on.
 &HT;    As for future space conquests, the public's imagination didn't
need much stoking _ a lunar base, space labs, space wars, a landing
on Mars. Once you've gotten to the moon, what's to stop you from
going anywhere, doing anything?
 &HT;    What were more fascinating in many ways than the Apollo
program's future science or even its spinoffs were the actual
science and mechanics that went into the Apollo 11 flight. And it
was a triumphal moment for the engineers as well as for the
scientists.
 &HT;    But just in case there were any doubts, it seemed a good idea at
the time to invoke the aid of as many supernatural forces as one
could think of.
 &HT;    Then-Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who had contended for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1968, recalls his son's telling him that
at his Catholic elementary school all the students had been praying
as the Eagle left the command module for the lunar surface, but
nearly all of them had also kept their fingers crossed under their
desks.
 &HT;    ``I think most of us felt that way,'' McCarthy recalls.
 &HT;    In various areas of Washington, D.C., the power went out between
the Eagle's landing on the moon and the historic walk. A summer
thunderstorm had ripped through the area, sending broken limbs
crashing down on power lines.
 &HT;    Susan and Neil Sheehan hurried from their house in suburban
Wesley Heights to Neil's office at the New York Times' Washington
bureau to find a working television: ``Saw Neil Armstrong take
first step on moon!'' Susan Sheehan wrote in her dairy. ``Watched
with Neil and Max Frankel for an hour or two.''
 &HT;    Others had to catch it all on the fly. Current NASA chief
administrator Daniel Goldin was working for the TRW Space and
Technology Group in 1969. He was on his way to Harvard University
when the Eagle touched down.
 &HT;    ``I was changing planes at LaGuardia and everything came to a
halt,'' Goldin says. ``I remember there were many young people at
the airport that day _ people in uniform and people just on their
way. We watched the historic event on a black-and-white television
in the center of the lounge. For those few moments it didn't matter
what else was going on in the world. It felt great to be an
American.''
 &HT;    If the Apollo 11 mission now can be seen as a simple and pure
moment of triumph, it also has to be seen in its own time, and the
end of the 1960s was anything but simple. When and how you saw the
moon landing, and what it meant to you, had a lot to do with which
of the many conflicting realities of the day you happened to
inhabit.
 &HT;    A quick journey through the almanac of 1969 is a tour through a
tortured history. In Nigeria, the Biafran conflict and subsequent
starvation crisis became the first of a decades-long string of
highly publicized famines to sweep Africa. By mid-January more than
half a dozen planes had been hijacked to Cuba, and Cuban air maps
had become standard issue for U.S. commercial pilots.
 &HT;    The Six-Day War was over _ Arab forces had been trounced _ but
terrorism in the Middle East showed no signs of easing. In
February, the Palestine Liberation Organization was formed, under
the leadership of Yasir Arafat; less than six months later, Israeli
jets were striking Egyptian positions.
 &HT;    On March 10, 1969, James Earl Ray was sentenced to 99 years in a
Tennessee prison after he pleaded guilty to the murder of Martin
Luther King Jr., but for blacks that hardly seemed recompense. A
hundred African-American students seized the student union at
Cornell University on April 19.
 &HT;    Three months later, with Command Module Columbia still circling
the moon, Ohio Gov. James Rhodes called out the National Guard to
quell rioting in Columbus after the fatal shooting of a black man
by a white store owner. And then there was the war in Vietnam, and
the war here against the war there.
 &HT;    Alma Powell watched the walk on the moon in an Atlanta hotel
room. Beside her in bed, her husband, Colin, the future chair of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, slept like a log, having just flown in
that day from a second tour of duty in Vietnam.
 &HT;    Retired NASA scientist Homer Hickam, whose book ``Rocket Boys''
led to the wonderful movie ``October Sky,'' was just back from
Vietnam too when the Eagle set down.
 &HT;    ``I watched the landing in a Fort Lewis, Washington, barracks
television room with Army troops headed for Vietnam the next day,''
Hickam says. ``It was an eerie sensation being there with them,
giving advice on how to survive in Vietnam while we were waiting
for Neil to come down the ladder. ... I felt the irony of being
part of the greatest tragedy of the 1960s while watching one of the
century's greatest triumphs.''
 &HT;    Two years before Apollo 11 lifted off from the Kennedy Space
Center on its way to the moon, Navy pilot John McCain had been shot
down over North Vietnam and interned in the prisoner-of-war camp
known as the Hanoi Hilton.
 &HT;    McCain says he was ``overjoyed'' to learn of the moon landing
``but I didn't find out until two years later.'' McCain's source: a
speech by George McGovern broadcast through the prison camp in
which the Democratic presidential candidate said, ``The U.S. can
land a man on the moon, but it can't end the war.''
 &HT;    ``There were two different American visions colliding,'' says
Jeremy Rifkin, who today heads the Foundation on Economic Trends
and who then was coordinating the antiwar Citizens Commission of
Inquiry to investigate ``war crimes'' in Southeast Asia. ``We were
reaching beyond ourselves into outer space at the same time we were
involved in an epic struggle between generations and between
different visions of what the social contract was. The whole planet
was up for grabs.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, the Soviet Union, which had begun the space
race a dozen years earlier with the launch of Sputnik I, couldn't
leave the moment alone. The unmanned Soviet probe Luna 15 was in
its 27th orbit around the moon when Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins
arrived for their first orbit. Eventually Luna 15 would crash into
the moon about 500 miles from Tranquility Base.
 &HT;    For the Kennedy family, the Apollo 11 mission would have been a
double-edged sword in any event. The 1960s had begun with President
John F. Kennedy's pledge to put a man on the moon before the end of
the decade _ an audacious promise that seemed to signal a new,
audacious era.
 &HT;    Now, with only five months to spare, NASA was delivering on that
vow. But Jack Kennedy was dead, murdered five and a half years
earlier. So was brother Bobby, murdered only a little more than a
year before.
 &HT;    The political mantle of the Kennedy clan had fallen to Teddy,
the junior senator from Massachusetts, and the Washington Sunday
Star headline of July 20 speaks volumes: SPACEMEN SET TO LAND ON
MOON, the top headline reads. Just below it in slightly smaller
type is this headline: WOMAN DROWNS, KENNEDY UNINJURED.
 &HT;    For some people, Chappaquiddick Island and Tranquility Base
would be forever linked. Apollo 11 was still two days away from
Earth on July 22 when Ted and Joan Kennedy attended the funeral
service for Mary Jo Kopechne in Larksville, Pa. Photos of the event
show the senator looking broken and impossibly young.
 &HT;    For NASA too, Apollo 11 was a double-edged moment. Nothing could
have gone more perfectly, and because nothing could have, maybe
there was no topping that first manned landing on the moon.
 &HT;    NASA kept sending astronauts back to the moon _ there would be
six more flights in the Apollo series and five more landings on the
moon. But the last landing took place in December 1972, and by then
Americans were less enraptured. The deed had been done, and the
moon, for all its power in literature and the imagination, was an
undramatic place once you got there.
 &HT;    ``Even Walter Cronkite was getting bored,'' McCarthy remembers.
``He had announced at the first landing that the moon was a dead
body, which people had pretty much known at any rate. The second
time, he said it was deader than we thought. The third time, he
said it was even deader still. I guess there was nothing left to
say unless they discovered life on it.''
 &HT;    NASA's audience got tougher too. Many of those who cheered
Apollo 11 had been raised on Buck Rogers, Jules Verne, Superman and
Captain Midnight. Just behind them was a generation differently
conditioned.
 &HT;    The novelist Charles McCarry says that he and his wife, Nancy,
were ``enthralled'' by the moon landing but that their four
children, all under age 10, could not have been less interested:
``Sometime during the night I awoke and realized why: They and the
rest of their generation were the first cyborgs,'' McCarry says.
 &HT;    ``Their minds had been twinned with technology, and what was a
wonder to us was a perfectly ordinary moment for them. Having
watched television from infancy onward, they were used to having
their consciousness projected onto `Gilligan's Island' and beyond
at the flick of a switch. A trip to the moon was no different. They
required no imagination; the electromagnetic spectrum was their
constant companion.''
 &HT;    Not that NASA hasn't had its triumphs in the years since. Probes
sent to the edge of our planetary system and beyond have sent back
striking photos. The space station is a model of science and
international cooperation. Space exploration continues to spin off
high technology with far-ranging applications for life on Earth.
 &HT;    But budget pressures have squeezed the agency, and bureaucracy
seems in danger of stifling the burning curiosity that drove it in
the old days, or so many say. Goldin generally gets high marks for
his leadership, but he's leading a mature agency in a different
age.
 &HT;    Hickam says the secret to reviving the space program lies in the
rocket engine: ``NASA needs to get out of the low-earth orbit
operational business and hand it over swiftly to commercial
interests, and get on with the true exploration of space. To do
that it needs to build big new rocket drives based on fission,
fusion or anti-matter physics.
 &HT;    ``These drives are not science fiction. We can build one or more
of them in 10 years with a dedicated budget and necessary
legislative direction. Such drives will allow NASA to go out to the
moon in hours, to Mars in days. We can conquer, settle and exploit
the solar system with these machines during the next quarter
century.''
 &HT;    Maybe most important, such propulsion systems _ or whatever
other ones scientists might come up with _ would give NASA
something it hasn't had since that evening of July 20, 1969:
something, as F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote, ``commensurate to our
capacity for wonder.''

``Sometime during the night I awoke and realized why: They and the
rest of their generation were the first cyborgs,'' McCarry says.
 &HT;    ``Their minds had been twinned with technology, and what was a
wonder to us was a perfectly ordinary moment for them. Having
watched television from infancy onward, they were used to having
their consciousness projected onto `Gilligan's Island' and beyond
at the flick of a switch. A trip to the moon was no different. They
required no imagination; the electromagnetic spectrum was their
constant companion.''
 &HT;    Not that NASA hasn't had its triumphs in the years since. Probes
sent to the edge of our planetary system and beyond have sent back
striking photos. The space station is a model of science and
international cooperation. Space exploration continues to spin off
high technology with far-ranging applications for life on Earth.
 &HT;    But budget pressures have squeezed the agency, and bureaucracy
seems in danger of stifling the burning curiosity that drove it in
the old days, or so many say. Goldin generally gets high marks for
his leadership, but he's leading a mature agency in a different
age.
 &HT;    Hickam says the secret to reviving the space program lies in the
rocket engine: ``NASA needs to get out of the low-earth orbit
operational business and hand it over swiftly to commercial
interests, and get on with the true exploration of space. To do
that it needs to build big new rocket drives based on fission,
fusion or anti-matter physics.
 &HT;    ``These drives are not science fiction. We can build one or more
of them in 10 years with a dedicated budget and necessary
legislative direction. Such drives will allow NASA to go out to the
moon in hours, to Mars in days. We can conquer, settle and exploit
the solar system with these machines during the next quarter
century.''
 &HT;    Maybe most important, such propulsion systems _ or whatever
other ones scientists might come up with _ would give NASA
something it hasn't had since that evening of July 20, 1969:
something, as F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote, ``commensurate to our
capacity for wonder.''

WINDOWS REGISTRY TIP: LOOK, BUT DON'T TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

<P>
   Q. I have heard a lot about the Microsoft Windows registry. What
is a registry and what is it used for?
</P>
<P>
   A. The registry is a vast and detailed database of information
that Windows uses to keep track of your system's settings and
configuration information. Each time you add a hardware device like
a modem or scanner, install new programs or adjust your system's
settings, new data are added to the registry file. This file is so
important to your computer's health that Windows will not run
properly (if at all) if the registry is damaged or corrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The registry is organized into six main parts that contain
different data about your computer. You can see the registry
hierarchy by going to your Start menu, selecting Run and typing
``regedit.'' The names on the HKEY folders tell you what settings
files are inside.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to edit your registry files manually, but it is
highly advisable not to do anything more than just look. If you are
not careful (or don't know what you are doing), tinkering with the
registry could severely affect your computer's ability to operate.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, fully reinstalling the Windows operating system
is the only way to fix a damaged registry. There are several ways
to back up your Windows 95 registry, and some are more complicated
than others. One of the easiest methods is going to the Registry
Editor, selecting Export Registry File from the Registry menu and
saving it in a safe place. Double-clicking on this backup file
restores it to the registry. The Emergency Recovery Utility program
on the Windows 95 CD-ROM will also back up your registry for you.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows Registry Checker tool in Windows 98 backs up the
registry file for you each time you boot up. If you tend to leave
your computer on for extended periods without rebooting, you can
run the Registry Checker by typing ``scanregw.exe'' in the Run
window. The checker will try to fix a damaged registry or revert to
a previous copy if it finds anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For registry maintenance, Microsoft offers a utility called
Regclean that can help weed out old entries. You can find this
update in the Windows area of
support.microsoft.com/support/downloads.

ONLINE, CHOREOGRAPHER PUSHES BACK BOUNDARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Vt., Ky.)   (af)  
 By DULCIE LEIMBACH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a modern dancer and choreographer, Cathy Weis was one of the
first to use video, lugging the bulky video monitors on stage and
integrating them into her performances as if they, too, were
dancers. Fifteen years later, Ms. Weis is now one of the first in
New York's modern-dance hive to create a live interactive and
collaborative dance form on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive dance on the Web? Sounds a bit dubious in this era
of slow downloading and broken connections. But Ms. Weis isn't
waiting for modem speeds to catch up to her art form. ``This is not
talking heads,'' Ms Weis said. ``We're pushing this technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Her live Internet performance from Bennington College in Vermont
last year gave some sense of what Internet dance is about. Three
dancers at Bennington performed while Ms. Weis operated the video
camera on stage, shooting, for example, a dancer's foot and then
sending that image over the Internet to Mischa Bielicky, a
collaborator in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Bielicky, who is a new-media specialist at the Art Institute
there, responded with hand movements through a camera attached to
his computer. Ms. Weis then put Bielicky's movements through a
video mixer and projected everyone's movements onto a large screen
behind the Bennington dancers.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech grooviness was pitched against low-tech shadowy
lighting, giving the event a '60s psychedelic effect. Ms. Weis
called it a ``chance dance,'' a description made more apt by the
frequent breaks in the connection caused by traffic on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weis choreographed the event to ``allow for
idiosyncracies,'' she said, and she added that the dance had been
beautiful despite the freezing and fracturing of the image.
</P>
<P>
   A winner of the prestigious Bessie Award in the
choreography-creator category, Ms. Weis and her Internet
performances are taken seriously. Through online work, ``I'm trying
to use the magic by expanding the boundaries of performance,'' she
said in her faint Kentucky twang.
</P>
<P>
   She may have also been acknowledging indirectly that as a dancer
suffering from a debilitating disease _ she has lived with multiple
sclerosis for more than a decade and wears a leg brace during the
day _ she needs all the magic she can tap.
</P>
<P>
   The first inklings that something was wrong occurred when she
was living in San Francisco in 1977 and tap dancing professionally.
She underwent foot surgery and was laid up for a year. In
frustration, she channeled her creativity into making stained
glass.
</P>
<P>
   She then moved with her husband to New York. ``I was in my late
30s, feeling very tired, and my husband said, `Everybody in New
York feels like that.''' But she ``had some bad falls, things I
couldn't ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   After the diagnosis _ which shocked her despite the fact that
her mother had died of the disease when Ms. Weis was in her early
20s _ Ms. Weis felt as though her life was shattered. Her marriage
ended as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, as a dancer tough enough to have been a soloist at
age 13 for the Louisville Ballet, she had the physical and
psychological stamina to bounce back. ``It was hard for me to talk
about my MS for a long time,'' she said, ``but now that I've come
out of the closet, I don't stop talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her focus on technology over the years has illuminated her view
of her illness. For her most recent show, ``Lizard Monitors'' in
April, she and a partner, Scott Heron, performed at Dixon Place, a
club in the East Village in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the performance, an image of Ms. Weis' head appeared
live on a small television screen, which was passed around the
audience as Heron danced on stage and Ms. Weis talked from behind
the stage, creating an eerie disembodied effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oblique fracturing of the body parts, the disconnectedness
to your body is also an extension of what I'm doing on the
Internet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Very few of Ms. Weis' fellow modern dancers have produced work
on the Web. The dancer Bill T. Jones choreographed movements for a
``virtual dance installation'' at Cooper Union in New York last
winter, and the dancer Molissa Fenley participated a year ago in a
three-way performance from New York, Tokyo and Helsinki, Finland,
sponsored by a museum in Finland. That is about as far as the
big-name modern dancers have taken technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancers are old-fashioned,'' said Martha Wilson, the founding
director of Franklin Furnace, a New York venue for performance
artists that now offers live performances, including dance, on the
Web. ``They hear the word `body' and think about flesh and blood.
They don't make a leap to the body in question: the Net itself as a
circulatory system.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Ms. Weis is arranging a program called ``Tales
Exchange'' that will take root in Skopje, Macedonia, this fall.
(She was to take part in an arts festival there this month, but the
war in Kosovo prevented that.)
</P>
<P>
   At the Mot International Theater Festival in October in Skopje,
she and Frank London, a composer and musician, and at least one
other dancer will set up an ongoing performance choreographed by
Ms. Weis. The collaboration, shaped around short stories that
define the American and Macedonian cultures, will unfold in
periodic live performances on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it as a 3-D fairy tale,'' Ms. Weis said.
</P>
<P>
   You could also call it cyber-reality, a melding of two very
different aspects of her dance, the physical and the digital. Ms.
Weis smiled at the notion. ``When I move my hands, it feels like
two different bodies,'' she said. ``This dancing thing is so wild
when it's related to my MS.''

COMPUTERIZED MACHINE STEPS IN TO SHUFFLE CARDS BY THE TON
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the organizers of last month's European contract bridge
championships in Malta had 10 days to shuffle and deal about
200,000 hands of cards, they turned to Per Jannersten. ``That's
getting to be a ton of cards,'' Jannersten said, speaking
literally.
</P>
<P>
   While Jannersten attended the match, he did not personally do
the work. Instead the tournament, like all international
competitions, relied on the Duplimate Mark IV, a computerized card
shuffling machine developed and produced by Jannersten's company,
Jannersten Forlag (www.jannersten.com), in Avesta, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works flawlessly,'' said Brent Manley, editor of The Bridge
Bulletin, the magazine of the American Contract Bridge League. ``It
would take you about forever to do by hand what this machine
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Jannersten insists that the Duplimate is not only far faster
than the human hand but also far better. Studies show that human
card shufflers aren't nearly as good at mixing up cards to
guarantee the maximum variety in bridge games, Jannersten said.
``They don't take enough time,'' he said, and people are also more
prone to errors.
</P>
<P>
   With the Duplimate, software running on a standard Windows-based
computer figures out the shuffles and deals for each of the four
players at the card table. In theory at least, extremely patient
players could simply let the software do its work, examine the
result on their monitors and then pick their way through decks of
cards, pulling out the cards the computer says should be in their
hards.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Jannersten's machine valuable to tournament
organizers who value their sanity is a low-slung box that connects
to the personal computer. At one end, a bin accepts a package of
playing cards specially marked with tiny bar codes on the face of
each card. When the PC downloads its virtual deal into the
Duplimate's memory, the unit's microprocessor works with a bar code
reader as it picks out the correct cards and has them delivered to
the right players through a series of moving belts. The cards fall
into one of four slots, each labeled for a specific playing
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Duplimate, especially in its earlier incarnations, strongly
resembles the once mighty but now nearly extinct computer punch
card reader; the first Duplimate was built in 1989. That's not
entirely surprising given that its most direct ancestor was an
extremely complicated electrical and mechanical card sorter, also
made in Sweden and distributed by Jannersten Forlag, that relied on
playing cards with tiny holes punched in them .
</P>
<P>
   But by the late 1980s, international bridge officials were
becoming concerned that cheaters might be identifying cards by
reading their punched-hole patterns. Although Jannersten seriously
doubted that such cheating was actually happening, he nevertheless
hired engineers and designers to produce a much more sophisticated,
fully electronic dealing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Duplimate can turn out an infinite number of
identical sets of hands _ or boards, as they are known in bridge _
it has largely been responsible for the development of the
tournament game known as barometer bridge, said Manley, of The
Bridge Bulletin. In that game, large numbers of players use
identical hands generated by the Duplimate. At the end of each
round, all the teams' results are calculated and the teams are
ranked. ``It's the horse race of bridge,'' Jannersten said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the machines, which start at more than $2,000, are not
for everyone. Although some individuals in Scandinavia have bought
Duplimates for their homes, Jannersten said that most units went to
either bridge federations or large clubs. (An Australian company
makes a less sophisticated sorter that competes with the
Duplimate.)
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope that some form of Duplimate may be coming to a
card table near you soon. Late this summer, the company plants to
introduce a semimanual sorter that will sell for ``several hundred
dollars.'' It will be aimed at players who measure their cards in
ounces rather than tons, Jannersten said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Edwin Rothman, 66, an osteopathic physician from Haverford,
Pa., recently bought his first computer, a 400-megahertz mail-order
machine. His immediate goals? To use the Internet to pursue his
rare-book collecting, to get up-to-the-minute information on his
investments and to send e-mail to his four grandchildren. Rothman,
while no stranger to gadgets, has never used an ATM, has never
turned on the cellular phone that came with his car and always
bypasses an automated phone answering system in favor of a live
voice. Here are excerpts from a diary of his foray into the
computer world.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY, MAY 17 _ Entered my house and was suddenly aware of four
huge cartons sitting on the floor. My personal computer had
arrived. I panicked, even though everyone had told me, ``In one
week, you'll be a pro.''
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY, MAY 18 _ Purchased the obligatory computer table.
Waited for call from local cable television company, which supplies
Internet access, about hooking up computer _ which, of course, is
still in boxes.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY, MAY 19 _ Cable company finally called back with
information about installing line for computer. Was told to have
computer ready to run. Informed company's representative that it
was easy for him to say but not easy for me to do.
</P>
<P>
   Finally got up the nerve to open cartons, looking for how-to
documents. Called my son and asked for help. ``Dad,'' he said,
``you always told me to read the instructions before you do
anything. Take your own advice.''
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY, MAY 20 _ Played round of golf but didn't enjoy it. All
I could think of was my computer. Arrived home. Found that Jimmy, a
carpenter working at my house, had assembled table. It was sitting
there, waiting for its computer. Was completely unnerved and had a
drink.  &QL; 
FRIDAY, MAY 21 _ Hooray! Pulled computer from boxes, connected all
the cables, turned it on (all with help from Jimmy, again). Boot-up
was successful.
</P>
<P>
   Aggravation with Windows 98. Read start-up booklet, but was
unable to follow instructions. Shut down computer, restarted it and
was admonished by message on screen. Afraid to restart.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY, MAY 22 _ Asked a computer-literate friend to help.
After watching him moving and clicking mouse for one hour, I told
him to leave. Then my son arrived and basically did the same thing.
Told him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Cable company guy arrived and soon I was successfully hooked up
to Internet. But after 10 minutes of aimless wandering of the Web,
shut down computer in great deal of frustration. Decide to get a
computer tutor.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, MAY 23 _ Purchased ``Windows 98 for Dummies'' at local
bookstore. Was clerk laughing at me?
</P>
<P>
   Booted up computer in hope that some divine being would allow me
some semblance of understanding of Windows. Alas, it was not to be.
Shut down system. ``Windows 98 for Dummies'' is no help, which says
a great deal about my technical aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY, MAY 25 _ Tutor arrives and departs several hours later,
leaving me confused and disappointed. Too didactic, not practical
enough. Don't even learn how to e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Hired new instructor to be here in two days. Hope and pray that
she will be more helpful.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY, MAY 27 _ I did it! Successfully sent e-mail to my
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   New instructor arrives, and three hours later I have a headache.
Felt this instructor was more practical and less pedagogical,
though still feel like a neonate.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY, MAY 28 _ I just finished spending a half-hour with my
computer-literate daughter. Perhaps I should hire her as an
instructor, gratis, of course.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY, MAY 29 _ Turned on computer, thought I knew what to
do, again wandered aimlessly on the Internet. Evidently the
computer is more intelligent than I, or I am less intelligent than
I thought. My frustration level is climbing. Having trouble with
e-mail again.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, MAY 30 _ Thank goodness for my son-in-law. He contacted
online provider, righted problems with e-mail, and I am a new
person. Now I know my daughter made the right choice in spouses.
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY, JUNE 1 _ Really, really frustrated. Informed that
several e-mail messages were sent to me, but I am unable to
retrieve them. Either I am stupid or the computer is not
functioning properly _ not a very enticing choice.
</P>
<P>
   Call son-in-law, but reach daughter instead. She talks my way
through the e-mail problem. Now I know my son-in-law made the right
choice in spouses.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY, JUNE 2 _ Received and sent e-mail. I must be getting
proficient! I still have not surfed the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Later, absolute panic sets in. Returned from dinner and received
e-mail. While aimlessly moving icon, I removed the Start menu from
the desktop! Called online help and was put on hold for 15 minutes,
during which time I kept opening and closing different menus, to no
avail. In desperation, I punched different keys and saw the start
menu. Turned off computer. I envisioned a sleepless night.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY, JUNE 3 _ Finished one-hour lesson with instructor,
explored Internet and search engines. Disquietude still exists,
almost two weeks since this irreverent, inanimate (although I'm not
sure about that) computer entered my life.
</P>
<P>
   Later, my wife started first lesson and immediately called to
me, ``Dear, I just set up my own user name.'' Trouble beckons. I'll
have to share this as I share everything else.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY, JUNE 4 _ Love libraries and bookstores. Haven't been to
one in two weeks, having spent most of my spare time in front of
this machine. Spent one and a half hours in Barnes &AMP; Noble. For
five minutes, I rapidly skimmed over new fiction and nonfiction.
Remainder of time, I perused the plethora of books regarding
Windows 98. Purchased the one with the simplest pictures. I must be
reverting to my childhood.

   SUNDAY, JUNE 6 _ Became adventurous. Found Web site for Winston
Churchill (I'm a big fan) but soon got lost. I didn't know what to
do next, so I went to check my stock portfolios. I could not
remember what name and password I used previously, so I entered
various ones, to no avail. So I closed everything and played
solitaire. Won a game. There's still hope for me.
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY, JUNE 8 _ Realism has set in. I can send and receive
e-mail, and it's fun, but I find that my other objectives still
elude me.
</P>
<P>
   But I vow to keep working at it, confident that someday,
neophytes will come to me for advice and I will answer, ``Don't
worry, in one week you'll be a pro.''

BUSH STUMBLES ON GOLD RUSH IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ ``Conservative'' is collecting $4.5 million
over three days for his Republican presidential campaign.
``Compassionate'' is speaking Spanish on a stage at the Del Mar
Fair while a mariachi band plays ``Vaya Con Dios.''
</P>
<P>
   On his three-day trip through California, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush is giving the contributors to his presidential campaign an
explanation of what it means to be a ``compassionate
conservative.'' It means, for example, the government needs to
``confront illegitimacy'' while offering ``practical help to women
and children in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is conservative to reform welfare by insisting on work,''
Bush told about 400 Orange County Republicans Tuesday. ``It is
compassionate to take the side of charities and churches that
confront the suffering that remains.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the public speech, but Bush is teaching Republicans
something much more critical than the meaning of his campaign
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush essentially came here to raise money _ loads of it _
from California Republicans, he also brought a message the
California GOP didn't hear very well during the 1998 elections:
Ignore the state's burgeoning Hispanic population and lose.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's first non-fund-raising stop in California came at the
Plaza de Mexico at the Del Mar Fair. Young folklorico dancers took
the stage. People shouted ``Viva Bush'' as he worked the 4-H
exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate spoke in Spanish to the crowd and told reporters
afterward that Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration ballot
initiative, wouldn't work in his state. ``I said when it first came
out that I'm against the spirit of 187,'' Bush said. ``I felt like
every child ought to be educated regardless of the status of their
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, said the same thing
recently when asked whether illegal immigrant children should be
kicked out of school. Conservative groups that put Proposition 187
on the ballot lambasted Davis for his remarks and said they would
mount a recall effort. Now, the Republican presidential candidate
is bringing a similar message to California, where 70 percent of
Hispanics who went to the polls in 1994 voted against Proposition
187, which nonetheless was approved.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the Republican Party in the last election,
including former Attorney General Dan Lungren's brutal 20-point
loss to Davis, was blamed significantly on a divisiveness that
arose because of the GOP's support of Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   ``All wisdom is based on the last election,'' said Bruce Cain, a
political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley.
``You tend to take the lessons from the last election and apply it
to the next. A lot of what we're seeing now is what was learned
from the last campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also avoided throwing himself entirely behind Proposition
209, the ballot initiative that ended public affirmative action
programs in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the spirit of no quotas and no preferences,'' Bush
said. ``But I think it's important to say not what you're against
but what you're for. As you know, in our state I'm for increasing
the pool of applicants, opening the door so that more people are
eligible to go to the university system.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Texas was moving toward a system based more on
economic need than racial preferences. ``I've learned you cannot
lead by dividing people,'' Bush has said repeatedly in his
fund-raising speeches. ``I'm a uniter not a divider.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip to California was intended to introduce himself to
voters. But the introduction is a lot more complicated than anyone
could have predicted for a general election that is 17 months away.
</P>
<P>
   When GOP presidential candidate Lamar Alexander visited
Sacramento recently, he took a cab, alone, from the airport to his
campaign stop. The Bush campaign, with a huge press corps in
attendance, already looks presidential. The campaign has chartered
an MD-80 aircraft dubbed ``Great Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush picked up nearly $480,000 at breakfast Tuesday in La Jolla.
The haul that morning was supposedly a record for a federal
candidate in San Diego. Outside the ballroom, supporters were
literally kneeling on the tightly woven carpet writing out $1,000
checks _ the federal limit _ before heading in for a handshake, a
continental breakfast, and Bush's nearly worn speech about what it
means to be a compassionate conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The line-up for the rest of the fund-raisers was equally
massive: $400,000 at an Irvine luncheon; $2.3 million at a Los
Angeles dinner with at least 1,920 contributors, including actress
Bo Derek, who sponsored a table; $250,000 at Sacramento events
Wednesday; $800,000 at a San Francisco dinner Wednesday night;
another $300,000 at a Silicon Valley event Thursday; and $150,000
in Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Bush campaign announced that it had raised at
least $35.5 million in the first six months of the year, swamping
the $18.5 million raised by the apparent Democratic front-runner,
Vice President Al Gore.

   WHO GIVES A GIGABYTE?
</P>
<P>
   By Gary Stix and Miriam Lacob (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1999; $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   The subtitle of ``Who Gives a Gigabyte?'' is ``A Survival Guide
for the Technologically Perplexed,'' but readers are liable to be
more perplexed about just what the book is about.
</P>
<P>
   Given the title, one might expect the book to plant itself
firmly in the realm of the digital. And it does devote a lot of
space to explaining just what ``digital'' means and guiding the
reader through the world of computers. But just as much space is
devoted to describing things like lasers, genetic engineering and
strategies for a cleaner environment.
</P>
<P>
   The chapters read like Scientific American articles, which isn't
surprising; Stix is an editor at that magazine, and Ms. Lacob an
occasional writer there.
</P>
<P>
   The classic raison d'etre for a book like this, indeed for all
science writing, is the Enlightenment ideal of an informed
citizenry. But, the authors argue, this book isn't all ``eat your
spinach'' _ it can be enjoyable to bump the brain out of summer
vacation mode.
</P>
<P>
   All that's hard to argue with. But one might argue with the
authors' choices for the ``machines and processes that may most
affect our lives today and beyond the dawn of the new millennium.''
For example, the book does not spend time on transportation or
weaponry, and while it addresses many types of medical technology,
it does little with something as relevant to public policy as
reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   The authors' approach works better for the physical sciences.
The first three chapters are an excellent introduction to computer
hardware and software and telecommunications, and the chapters on
lasers and material science are both meaty and generally easy to
follow. Their explanations sometimes don't take the reader all the
way to real understanding, however, stopping short before enough
information has been given.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining how a computer does simple computations, for
example, the book says multiplication is just repeated addition.
That seems fine, but the statement ``division is the subtraction
process done over and over'' doesn't quite cover the bases, never
saying how the computer figures out what to subtract.
</P>
<P>
   Once genetics shows up, the authors seem to be trying to distill
a couple of college courses' worth of concepts into a few pages.
Any reader who needs the box explaining how a cell works isn't
going to have a chance of mastering the polymerase chain reaction.
The chapters on the environment, on energy and pollution issues,
are more successful.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book offers some handy glossaries and time lines,
there are no Web links to steer readers to more information because
the authors thought such links would become outdated too quickly.
But surely such links would have stayed fresh as long as some of
the authors' predictions for hot technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Even at its most helpful, ``Who Gives a Gigabyte?'' isn't for
the technological neophyte. Its intended audience seems to be the
kind of person who reads Scientific American: someone who is
perhaps not very knowledgeable about the topic under discussion but
is by no means a stranger to science and technology.

   WEB STYLE GUIDE
</P>
<P>
   By Patrick J. Lynch and Sarah Horton (Yale University Press,
1999; $35).
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second chapter of ``Web Style Guide,'' the reader
gets advice that pretty much sums up the thesis of the book:
``Don't get so lost in the novelty of Web pages that the basic
standards of editorial and graphic design are tossed aside.''
</P>
<P>
   That sage advice comes from two Ivy Leaguers (Lynch is the
design director of the Center for Advanced Instructional Media at
Yale University and Ms. Horton is a multimedia applications
specialist at Dartmouth College). They assume that their readers
are not raw beginners who are still trying to learn how to write
page code in HTML or are looking for a copy of ``Web Sites for
Dummies.'' Staid and solid, the book is a measured examination of
the intrinsic structure of a Web site, from the raw foundation and
organization to the finished product that must be updated and
maintained to offer maximum benefit to users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web Style Guide'' covers all the basic elements of creating a
Web site in the course of its eight chapters. Readers are first
offered the notions of content and interface design before they are
asked to contemplate the traditional eye-candy favorites of page
layout, graphics and multimedia. Authoritative factoids are
sprinkled throughout, like: ``Research has shown that for most
computing tasks the threshold of frustration is about 10 seconds''
and ``Cognitive psychologists have known for decades that people
can only hold about four to seven discreet chunks of information in
short-term memory.'' These serve to ground the book in logic while
elevating it above some of the brightly colored hyperactive Web
design manuals out there.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prose is a bit dry and decidedly scholarly, the
authors slip in an unexpected bit of humor here and there, noting
that picking Web page colors in hexadecimal code is ``a procedure
that only a propellerhead could enjoy.'' The sites they have chosen
to illustrate their points are fairly conservative in layout but go
well with the conventional tone.
</P>
<P>
   The book is sort of an ``Elements of Style'' for Webmasters, and
the authors even invoke that classic handbook's injunction to
``prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague,
the concrete to the abstract.''

   HOW THE WEB WAS WON: MICROSOFT FROM WINDOWS TO THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Andrews (Broadway Books, 1999; $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, the story of the computer industry,
the Internet and the World Wide Web may well turn out to be as
painstakingly chronicled as World War II. Every few months, another
book appears, focusing on this or that aspect of the digital
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The book's second subtitle reveals what it is actually about:
``The Inside Story of How Bill Gates and His Band of Internet
Idealists Transformed a Software Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   This installment in the continuing story of how the Internet has
changed everything and everyone (for the better, mind you) is a
well-researched, highly readable account. Its focus, as promised,
is Microsoft. The story begins in 1991, when the company was just
getting around to registering the Microsoft.com domain name while
remaining otherwise oblivious to the incipient groundswell of all
things Internet. (Sadly, the book perpetuates the myth that the Net
was started so that military forces could ``keep communicating in
event of a nuclear attack,'' but that's another story.) The book
ends with the federal government's antitrust suit against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting pages in ``How the Web Was Won'' are
devoted to the about-face that Microsoft's chairman, William H.
Gates, ordered in 1995, at the urging of his underlings, to make
his company a force to be reckoned with in the Internet ``space,''
as industry insiders put it.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews quotes Gates' Dec. 7, 1995 ``Pearl Harbor Day'' speech:
``You'll hear from us that we're not forming an Internet
division,'' Gates said. ``To us that's like having an electricity
division or a software division. The Internet is pervasive in
everything we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus did Microsoft turn on a dime to pursue the Internet, full
speed ahead. No matter what you think of Gates and his business
practices, such nimble movement for a company the size of Microsoft
is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes books like this read like a demonstration of how much
reporting the author has done, with no editor in the picture.
Andrews does, on occasion, throw in gratuitous bits of detail, as
if he were being paid by the word. But such lapses are few. For the
most part, readers will find his profiles of Internet zealots both
in and outside of Microsoft fascinating. Andrews, who is the
co-author of a 1993 Gates biography and a technology columnist for
The Seattle Times, paints a largely sympathetic portrait of
Microsoft. But in this year of Microsoft bashing, his perspective
is almost refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   While books like this often suffer from acronym and technical
jargon overload, Andrews is admirably restrained on both counts.
And he includes a helpful time line of important events.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the title, and the Justice Department's lawsuit, it
remains not at all clear that Microsoft has conquered the Web. The
Java programming language is still a persistent threat to
Microsoft's desktop-computer-based revenue model. And there is
constant talk of an imminent post-PC era, when computing will be
done via the Internet and not the desktop. And don't forget:
America Online now owns Microsoft's archrival, Netscape. No, this
is a Web still to be won.

   DIGITAL MCLUHAN: A GUIDE TO THE INFORMATION MILLENNIUM
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Levinson (Routledge, 1999; $27.95).
</P>
<P>
   When the digital age went looking for an oracle, it found
Marshall McLuhan. The communications theorist and '60s media guru,
best known for his dictum ``The medium is the message,'' is listed
as the patron saint in every issue of Wired magazine. McLuhan's
book ``Understanding Media'' was reprinted by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1994. The 1996 federal court decision
that overturned the Communications Decency Act even used McLuhan's
phrase ``global village.'' Not bad for a tweedy former English
professor who distrusted commerce and who limited his own
children's television viewing.
</P>
<P>
   McLuhan died in 1980, so it has fallen on his many admirers to
interpret his words for the age of the personal computer and the
Internet. This is the task Paul Levinson attempts with ``Digital
McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium,'' with very mixed
results.
</P>
<P>
   For readers unfamiliar with McLuhan, Levinson performs a useful
service. Many of McLuhan's themes were developed in bits and pieces
over his 30 years of writing and speaking. Levinson bases several
individual chapters around single ideas. In doing so, he
demonstrates the applicability of ideas like the ``discarnate man''
_ McLuhan's description of a society where people no longer meet
face to face _ to the virtual world. His chapter on McLuhan's
distinction between ``hot'' and ``cool'' media illustrates just how
exhausted those labels have become.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson, who shares McLuhan's weaknesses for bad puns and
hyperbole, does have a few disagreements with the master,
particularly over what he calls media determinism _ McLuhan's
belief that technology shapes people and not the other way around.
But for the most part, Levinson eagerly applies McLuhanism to
almost every facet of modern communications.
</P>
<P>
   Like many contemporary admirers, Levinson seems to forget that
McLuhan was also deeply suspicious of technology and its effects.
He didn't care much for computers, he once argued that radio should
be shut down and he believed that gadgets reduced their users to a
state of ``servo-mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is persistent confusion over McLuhan's theories, the
fault probably belongs more to McLuhan. A brilliant improviser and
self-promoter, he spun off ideas like they were advertising
campaigns but he had no gift for logical argument; in fact, he
openly disdained it. ``Clear prose indicates the absence of
thought,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   McLuhan's conceptual slipperiness has been inherited by many
digital gurus. Perhaps it is his style, not the substance of his
thought, that is his real gift to the wired age. Is the Internet
the end of the written word or the rebirth of text? Is e-commerce
the next age for the global economy or just the mail-order business
in tax-free (so far) clothing? When you register for My Yahoo, are
you being pushed, portaled or personalized? As McLuhan himself
knew, when you have nothing new to sell, the first thing you do is
change the label.

<TEXT>
<P>
   First, the bad news: Bill Gates is not going to send you to
Disneyland or give you free Microsoft software or pay you to test
it. No one is going to close the Internet down for a day of spring
cleaning. And the Miller Brewing Co. is not celebrating the
millennium by giving away free six-packs of beer to two million
computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the good news: the federal government is not going to
start charging for each e-mail message. And that dying English boy
of 10 years ago who was trying to collect enough get-well cards to
make the record books? He actually got well, thank you very much.
Well enough to wish that he and a variety of charities were not
still getting cards.
</P>
<P>
   Hoaxes can spread through the Internet faster than viruses, to
which they have been compared. They are more tenacious in some
ways, because they are passed on by every new person to get on
line, and they mutate freely. And with just a few clicks in your
address book, it is easy to forward a chain letter, a virus warning
or a list of specious True Facts.
</P>
<P>
   It is harder to figure out which messages are true, especially
when many people check their powers of critical thinking at their
Internet portals. As Joe Wells of Antivirus Online (www.av.ibm.com)
said, ``Thoughts travel faster in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem to be easy enough to avoid what has been termed
the gullibility virus, by just deleting any e-mail that smells like
a hoax. But few people, especially those who are new to the
Internet, can resist the urge to forward a message about the need,
say, to send around a picture of an angel made out of repeated
keyboard symbols to insure good luck.
</P>
<P>
   While forwarding such e-mail might seem harmless, consider what
would happen if everybody did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If each of the so-called good Samaritans sends the letter on
to only 10 other people (most send to huge mailing lists), the
ninth resending results in a billion e-mail messages, thereby
clogging the network and interfering with the receiving of
legitimate e-mail,'' according to the Computer Incident Advisory
Capability Web site (ciac.llnl.gov/ciac) of the Department of
Energy, where hoaxes, false virus warnings and chain letters are
listed.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet hoax resulted in death threats against a man whose
name was falsely attached to the online sale of T-shirts with
offensive slogans about the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Someone on America Online posted the name of the man, Kenneth
Zeran, and his home telephone number on a bulletin board with an
advertisement for ``Naughty Oklahoma T-shirts.'' Zeran was not
selling any such shirts. (He eventually sued AOL in a federal
court; the suit was dismissed there, and Zeran lost on appeal.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, hoaxes are born every minute, and they have been
around since the computer was an abacus. Take, for example, the
fraud perpetrated by one Lozier in 1824, who convinced hundreds of
New Yorkers that all the new construction around Wall Street was
making Manhattan bottom heavy and that therefore the island needed
to be sawed off at the northern end, towed out to sea, turned
around and reattached, or it would tip and sink.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 men signed up for the project, according to
contemporary accounts collected by Rick Brown, Webmaster of the
History Buff's Home Page (www.historybuff.com), which includes a
list of great hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   Some hoaxes are not born, however, but made from what begins as
a legitimate e-mail letter. In Hubbards, a rural fishing town in
Nova Scotia, Glynda Wimmer's fifth-grade class at Mill Cove
District School decided, as a geography project, to send e-mail to
a total of 15 family members and friends, asking them to reply with
their geographic location and to forward the message to their own
friends, asking them to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   All was fine at first (except that the class' computer was soon
overloaded with e-mail). But then two people called from Florida to
say they had received obscene replies from the school.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that someone had altered the return address on the
original message, routing mail to an account that generated rude
responses. The school was able to fix the problem soon after it was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The sick-child hoax has also been mischievously modified.
Originally, Craig Shergold, 10, with brain cancer, tried to get in
the Guiness Book of Records for receiving the most get-well cards.
His efforts, and his surgery, were successful, but he and several
children's-last-wish charities are still receiving cards.
</P>
<P>
   His story also lives on in various permutations, one naming
``Timothy Flight'' as the sick child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone took the name Timothy Flight and replaced it with an
actual kid, at an actual high school in Pittsburgh,'' said David
Emery, the guide to urban legends and folklore for the About.com
search site. ``Apparently the guy who perpetrated the hoax was
jealous of this kid, because they were both in love with the same
girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The family of the Pittsburgh child has put out public requests
for people to stop calling them to see if he actually needs
get-well cards, Emery said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides jealousy, motives for hoaxes include the ageless desire
to pull a fast one and the hope of foiling spammers (by sending,
for example, an e-mail message falsely asserting that any e-mail
with the subject ``Make Money Fast'' contains a virus, so people
won't read it).
</P>
<P>
   Financial gain can be a motive, too. In April, the share price
of a company called Pairgain Technologies increased by 30 percent
in a few hours after a false report that the company was being
bought was posted on a personal Web site. The stock price
eventually went back down after the report was debunked, but
presumably not before someone made a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   Emery sees larger motives for telling improbable tales and
disseminating them. People like to scare themselves, he said,
whether they are gazing at a campfire or into the glow of a
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   They also like to unite against the behemoths of the business
world.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a general spirit of hating big corporations,''
Emery said. (Hence all those rumors about Nike giving away free
clothes to everyone who forwards a particular e-mail message.)
``When you start to scratch the surface and challenge the
information,'' he added, ``people are so convinced that big
corporations are evil that they won't let go of a specific rumor,
even if you can prove it to be false.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the people who start hoaxes are almost assured of
anonymity, for better or worse, because verification of a letter's
authenticity is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to believe in the chain letter, you should
be able to click through to some URL and be able to verify it
through some independent source,'' said Rob Rosenberger, who runs
the Web site www.kumite.com, which dispels myths about computer
viruses. ``But I can easily concoct a Web site that would
`validate' a chain letter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people have tried to trace an e-mail back to the
original,'' Emery said, ``but it just has to get a generation or
two beyond the original, and the original is lost. You can't get
caught doing it, or I don't think anyone has so far.''
</P>
<P>
   And justice is hard to come by if you or your business has been
the victim of an anonymous hoaxer. Internet service providers are
not responsible for the information posted on their bulletin boards
or flung through the gossip mill of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hymes, a Hewlett-Packard engineer who runs a nonprofit
Web site that exposes hoaxes (www.nonprofit.net/hoax/hoax.html),
recalls originating a chain letter hoax of his own, geared to
academics and called ``Win Tenure Fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked on the same premise as those pyramid schemes for
making money,'' he said. ``It said if you want to build a lot of
citations, simply add your name to this letter and cite it
yourself, and if everyone who receives it does same thing, you'll
have millions and millions of citations, and you're guaranteed
tenure. I've still seen this circulating years later, in different
incarnations.''
</P>
<P>
   Other hoaxes have mutated as well. Electronic rumors that the
Postal Service would soon start charging a 5-cent fee for every
piece of e-mail eventually developed a Canadian strain, which urged
e-mail recipients to lobby members of parliament to vote against
taxing e-mail, though no such legislation was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberger calls that an example of ``E-Darwinism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed of e-mail and its incessant forwarding capability
make it easier to evolve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are steps computer users can take if they receive chain
letters or other suspected hoaxes via e-mail:
</P>
<P>
   DON'T SPREAD IT Delete the message, or send it on to only one
person _ your computer security officer or system administrator.
That makes it possible for other users to be warned not to pass on
similar e-mail messages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASK QUESTIONS Write to the sender to ask how that person can
verify the information in the message. Consider the sources. Ask
yourself why IBM would be writing directly to you about the latest
e-mail virus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOOK FOR INFORMATION Use search engines to look for information
about a suspected hoax _ many become the subjects of discussion
groups or Web pages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEEK REPUTABLE SOURCES Go directly to the home pages of the
companies or government agencies that are the subject of Internet
rumors. You should be able to verify the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an e-mail claims the FCC or the U.S. Postal Service is
going to five cents per e-mail as an E-stamp, you should be able to
click on www.usps.gov, and if it doesn't show up there, it behooves
you not to get duped by that e-mail,'' said Rob Rosenberger, who
runs a Web site called www.kumite.com, which dispels myths about
computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of Web sites track hoaxes, including these:
</P>
<P>
   DON'T SPREAD THAT HOAX: www.nonprofit.net/hoax/hoax.html
Includes a listing of possible hoaxes that are still being checked

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not just athletes who are on steroids _ American houses are
using chemicals to bulk up. In the last two decades, home exteriors
have undergone a stylistic shift with flat facades giving way to
columns, pediments and bulging 3-D details like quoins, keystones
and dentil cornices. How can people afford to build houses with
such opulent facades?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in many cases, is a polystyrene foam covered by a
synthetic spray-on stucco _ a construction method that allows
builders to do more for less. But some experts contend that this
approach may cause serious problems down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The method, known generically as EIFS, for exterior insulation
and finish systems, is associated with the fanciful, and often
gaudy, buildings that critics love to hate. Picture Tara and
Versailles in the same subdivision, and you have the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the real problem with EIFS (pronounced eefs) isn't rotten
architecture, but rotting architecture: this type of construction
has led to water damage in thousands of wood-frame homes, mostly in
Maryland, North and South Carolina, and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Now this construction method is gaining in popularity in the
Northeast, from a chic hotel in TriBeCa, to country houses in the
Catskills to suburban developments in New Jersey and on Long
Island. While no serious problems have been reported here, there
are still unanswered questions about the material and its effects.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the artificial stucco _ unlike the real
thing _ is too waterproof. Water that gets trapped behind it has
nowhere to go and begins soaking into studs or plywood sheathing.
Repair bills have run to the tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits against manufacturers are pending in at least half a
dozen states, with a class-action suit in North Carolina scheduled
to go to trial this fall against seven industry leaders. One
defendant, Senergy, of Tallahassee, Fla., settled with the
plaintiffs for $20 million; the remaining defendants are W.R.
Bonsal Co., Continental Stucco Products, Dryvit Systems, United
States Gypsum Co., Thomas Waterproof Coatings Co., and two European
manufacturers, Parex Inc. and Sto Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers' responses are uniform. Dryvit, for instance,
states that the problems were due not to a faulty product but to
``poor construction practices, lack of proper supervision by
builders and local building inspectors, and the use of sub-standard
windows and doors.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4 percent of new homes and 13 percent of new commercial
buildings used EIFS in 1997, according to The Appraisal Journal, a
trade publication in Chicago. The problems afflict mainly
wood-frame houses in warm, wet climates.
</P>
<P>
   In Merrick, N.Y., on the South Shore of Long Island, where
dozens of homes have been renovated with EIFS, some residents
aren't even aware that it's synthetic stucco, rather than the
porous, cement-based type, that's covering their houses.
</P>
<P>
   At Port Liberte, a waterfront development in Jersey City, N.J.,
the installation of the artificial stucco is one issue in a lawsuit
that has been wending its way through the courts. Homeowners have
instituted an ambitious inspection schedule to make sure none of
the synthetic stucco panels crack or slip.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with architects, engineers and construction
scientists, a consensus emerged: the problems are not likely to
appear _ at least not in large numbers _ in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, driving rains in coastal areas, the absence of a
heating season in some areas (heating a house in winter can help
dry out wet walls) and shoddy construction in areas where many
large homes were being built simultaneously all contributed to the
widespread failures, experts say. Still, no one can say for sure
that problems won't arise.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Clements of Inspectech, a multistate home inspection
service, says owners of affected houses should make spring and fall
inspections, examining exteriors for cracks or separations that
could admit moisture, and interiors (particularly baseboards) for
stains or warping.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Graham, an associate professor of construction science
of Texas A&AMP;M University, has studied hundreds of buildings with the
artificial stucco system, and is pessimistic about their prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The material in and of itself is fine,'' he said. ``But it's a
statistical probability that every building is going to leak at
some point in its life. With the EIFS systems we've seen, at least
until now, there hasn't been proper provision for that leakage.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Kenney, an administrator at R.J. Kenney Associates, a
building-materials lab in Plainville, Mass., pointed out that
``EIFS is an unforgiving system.'' But she added, ``In the
Northeast, we turn the heat on in the winter, which gives buildings
a chance to dry out.'' If the material is properly installed, she
said, ``an EIFS home isn't likely to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Properly installed'' means insuring that every door or window
has been carefully fitted with flashing. But it helps to make sure
that water that does get behind the panels has a way out. Dryvit
and its competitors now offer products in which the back of the
foam insulation is ridged, so that water can drip down the grooves.
To assuage the fears of consumers _ many of whom saw a ``Dateline
NBC'' report in March on the dangers of EIFS _ the company sells
its ``moisture drainage'' product with a 10-year guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made for a much better system,'' said Mark Topham, a
Dryvit distributor in New England, who quickly added that,
installed properly, ``there was no problem with the old system.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Shipman, an attorney for the plaintiffs in the North
Carolina class action, disagrees. ``The industry has known since
the 1980s about problems with the material,'' he said, ``and yet it
failed to warn consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Measured in terms of dollars lost, ``the controversy probably
represents the largest consumer problem ever to hit North
Carolina,'' David Kirkman, an assistant attorney general, wrote in
a report last year. North Carolina (with an estimated 30,000 EIFS
homes) and Georgia have banned the EIFS that can trap water.
</P>
<P>
   At Dryvit Systems, in West Warwick, R.I., Barbara Catlow, the
company's manager for marketing services, said, ``What we've found
is not an EIFS problem; it's a construction problem.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   John Campagna, the Dryvit distributor for much of New York and
New Jersey (his company is based in Edison, N.J.), says that
difficulties arose when inexperienced builders installed the system
sloppily.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, EIFS seems to be gaining in popularity
largely because of its plastic qualities, which allow homeowners
(whether building or renovating) to create bold, integrally colored
exteriors and high insulation value. When Arthur Williams, a
communications executive, built his weekend home in Stone Ridge,
N.Y., he wanted a stucco look. Plus, ``the house is incredibly cool
in the summer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On some blocks in Merrick, as many as a quarter of the
homeowners have added columns or elaborate window surrounds of the
synthetic stucco. ``I wanted something modern, and I liked this
look,'' said Myra Wittlin, who two years ago added pillars on both
sides of her entry.
</P>
<P>
   Building inspectors are less concerned about the use of EIFS on
buildings with steel and masonry frames since those materials don't
rot. ``Even when there's leakage, as there often is, the response
is not so profound as in a wood-frame structure,'' said Graham of
Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, the material can be seen on the upper reaches of
the Doral Hotel and on the Alexandria apartment building on West 72
Street. The TriBeCa Grand Hotel, now under construction, will have
precast panels made partly of Dryvit.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's Buildings Department has no rules about EIFS.
But Alex Herrera, the director of technical services for the
Landmarks Conservancy, said he has forbidden its use in projects
the conservancy finances. ``Aesthetically, it's a disaster, and you
don't know how long it will last,'' he said. ``I feel it's asking
for trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The artificial stucco is generally brittle and thus susceptible
to chipping. ``You ding it with your car, or hit it with a baseball
bat, and you've got a repair job on your hands,'' said Joe Carter,
a senior editor of This Old House magazine, who has worked with the
material.
</P>
<P>
   The building method was first developed in Sweden in the 1940s,
and was popularized in Germany in the 1950s. (Dryvit means ``quick
dry'' in German.) It is credited with helping to speed postwar
reconstruction of Europe. EIFS was introduced into residential use
in this country in the '70s, when its extra insulation value
appealed to homeowners during a period of skyrocketing fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it was '90s affluence that ushered in the age of
EIFS. Consumers today demand houses with expensive-looking details.
Clapboard walls and aluminum sliders are out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want deep sills, they want cornices, they want
keystones, they want quoins,'' said Larry Landes, the president of
Garden State Brickface, Windows and Siding, which installs
traditional stucco throughout the northeast. ``Well, that's very
easy to do in foam.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Dryvit make the contractor's job easy, cutting
foam according to the architect's specifications and shipping it to
the site. The foam is glued right to the shell of the house, then
the artificial stucco surface is sprayed or troweled on. The result
can be so exuberant that Dryvit has become synonymous with
flamboyant architecture. (The fake Manhattan skyline at the New
York, New York casino in Las Vegas, is made largely of Dryvit; so
are parts of Celebration, the town Disney built in Florida).
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in The Appraisal Journal, problems began
to appear in 1985, when a study financed by the Massachusetts
Executive Office of Communities and Development found that a number
of EIFS-covered public buildings had cracks that permitted water
penetration and internal damage.
</P>
<P>
   The journal also noted that in a later study by the federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development of commercial and
multifamily buildings with EIFS siding in Missouri, Massachusetts
and Illinois, nearly three-quarters of the buildings had cracks.
The HUD report suggested third-party inspections of such buildings.
</P>
<P>
   As for aesthetics, Carter, the editor, said that although the
foam-and-artificial-stucco combination brought back traditional
details, ``there's not even a hint of authenticity, _ it's
architecture l-i-t-e.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the effects can be striking. At Paolucci's restaurant in
lower Manhattan, Campagna, the Dryvit distributor, proudly pointed
to the restaurant's Dryvit resurfacing, which replicated the
200-year-old building's limestone details.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Italy, they let the base coat cure for a year, so all the
cracking is out of it,'' Campagna said, referring to traditional
stucco. ``This stuff,'' he said, pointing to the Dryvit wall,
``goes up in minutes.''

YALE ARCHITECTURE DEAN'S REMODELING JOB: HIMSELF

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can the New York architect Robert A.M. Stern, famous for
replicating old-money architecture right down to the eyebrow
dormers, shed his gray shingles to become a hipper, populist
educator in tune with the restless talents of tomorrow?
</P>
<P>
   When Yale University president Richard C. Levin announced last
fall that he had appointed Stern, who calls himself a modern
traditionalist, as the new dean of the Yale School of Architecture,
the news roiled the design community. Nor did it go down easily
with the 150 Yale graduate students in architecture, for whom a
Walt Disney Corp. board member (he was appointed in 1992) was quite
possibly the last candidate on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the astonishment of many in the field, Reed Kroloff,
editor of the slick Architecture magazine, wrote in October 1998:
``Who's got the mojo to lead the fabled school into the 21st
century? Are you sitting down?'' He went on to condense Stern as
``the suede-loafered sultan of suburban retrotecture, Disney party
boy and notorious academic curmudgeon.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stern gave his first speech as dean, 10 students walked out
to protest the unilateral process by which the dapper Stern had
been selected: he had not been one of the four paraded contenders
for the job. Then, Levin surprised everyone by naming him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rocky start.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, who graduated from the school in 1965, bridles at the
suggestion that such blatantly traditional projects as the Thornton
Wilder-esque master plan for Celebration, the Disney town in
Florida, or the model house in Wilton, Conn., for This Old House
magazine, might represent the gamut of his esthetic sensibility.
``Listen, I was trained as a modernist under Paul Rudolph,'' Stern
said, invoking Yale's eccentric but much admired architecture dean
during the 1960s. ``I don't know what they thought I was going to
do. Open a Ralph Lauren shop?'' He spoke in the low growl, a mock
rage, that is his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the work in the architect's Manhattan firm ranges
widely, from the proudly Jeffersonian School of Business for the
University of Virginia to a pulsating, kaleidoscopic vision for
redeveloping parts of Times Square. In addition, he taught design
and architectural history at the Columbia Graduate School of
Architecture, Preservation and Planning starting in 1970 and is the
author of a three-volume series on New York City's history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with an academic year behind him and a general thaw in the
students' reception, Stern is well on his way to reinventing
himself as a happening dean, the school's first unmarried steward
since Charles Moore in the late 1960s. Key to the transformation is
a bachelor pad, a duplex loft in downtown New Haven, Conn., for
entertaining. It is two blocks from the school, in a Renaissance
Revival building overlooking the town green and next to an Ann
Taylor boutique.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of new energy on tap reveals itself at the loft's street
entrance, with the realization that the 60-year-old Stern lives in
a third-floor walk-up. Inside, from the swatch of Andy Warhol's
pink and yellow ``Cow'' wallpaper, the Bang &AMP; Olufsen compact-disk
player and the black rubber rug in the living room to the Philippe
Starck clear polycarbonate chair in the kitchen, the loft is
stridently modern.
</P>
<P>
   The furnishings are a role call of classics by Le Corbusier,
Jean Prouve, Charles and Ray Eames, George Nelson, Eero Saarinen,
Robert Venturi and Norman Foster, with a few rusty finds from
Lafayette Street rakishly thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   The loft design was treated like any other project in Stern's
professional office, right down to a half-inch-scale cardboard
model, with photocopied images of paintings and furniture, in the
exact shade, the better to envision room arrangements. ``It was
like having your mother for a client,'' said Roger Seifter, a
partner in the Robert A.M. Stern firm, who ran the three-month
project. ( Stern paid for the furnishings and takes care of the
rent.)
</P>
<P>
   His plan was one large room, ideal for entertaining a first-year
class of 40 students. ``He saw his position as a social one,''
Seifter said. It would be hard to imagine anything farther from the
lobbylike salons, chockablock with stuffed sofas and the
marble-lined foyers published so frequently over Stern's name in
Architectural Digest. (Lore has it that they informed Tom Wolfe's
descriptions of the too-good life in ``Bonfire of the Vanities.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``In New Haven, I get to have my downtown feeling,'' said Stern,
who spends two nights a week there during the school year but
otherwise lives in a small apartment on Manhattan's Upper East
Side, seldom straying south. ``Going downtown doesn't fit into my
schedule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also owns a ranchburger in East Hampton that he renovated
into a stately shingle house.
</P>
<P>
   The architect is divorced and has a son, Nick, 31, an
independent theater producer who once worked as a Disney Imagineer.
``He's trying to be hip and downtown, like I am,'' Nick Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A.M. Stern threw a number of receptions in the late
spring to let students and faculty know he was on their wavelength.
Devin O'Neill, who just graduated and is working for the architect
Deborah Berke in Manhattan, has made the off-campus trek to the
loft. ``There's a lot of wow! furniture,'' O'Neill said. ``It was
nice to actually see some of the pieces that I only know from
books.''
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse into the pantry revealed shelves lined with rows of
oversize martini glasses and stacks of black cocktail napkins in
two sizes. The shelf paper is a silver plastic emblazoned with a
three-dimensional Op Art pattern. ``I'm not Mr. Party Boy,'' Stern
said while directing an assistant to restock the smaller black
cocktail napkins. ``But part of the role of this loft is to help me
develop a sense of esprit and to get to know the students.''
</P>
<P>
   The swank loft as platform for a chance-taking dean (and perhaps
to convert those unimpressed by the 16,000-square-foot log cabin he
designed for Michael Eisner) is not lost on some who have seen it.
Mark Shafiri, a recent graduate, described Stern on campus as a
constant but inscrutable presence. ``The loft is an apt metaphor
for his personality,'' he said. ``The formal rooms in front are
done up just as they should be as the home of a famous New York
architect. Then in the back there's this grungy abandoned space
that's stripped out and quite mysterious.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the view through the arched windows in the living
room is a charming vista of a typical New England green, the scene
out the rear-view window in the bedroom is of a large, spiraling
concrete parking garage ramp. ``My personal Guggenheim,'' Stern
said.
</P>
<P>
   A faculty member noted that, excluding the Le Corbusier
leather-covered chaise, there are no seats for two to sit on at the
same time. The rarefied gallery effect was underscored by Stern's
curatorial pride in showing off a chair in the front hall made of
irregularly-cut clear plastic tubing; it was designed by the
Campana brothers of Brazil, young stars of a recent show at the
Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan. ``I have the only piece in the
country besides the one at the museum,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Does the loft work? A half dozen students from the graduating
class seemed appreciative of Stern's obvious effort to win them
over. They noted that he was the first dean since Paul Rudolph to
live near the school and were impressed by how quickly he was able
to get new computers installed in the school.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's boldest academic move last spring _ inviting
nonagenarian architect Philip Johnson to teach a class with the
outspokenly theoretical Peter Eisenman _ backfired with some
students. Stern sent out press releases and a television crew
showed up for class, several students said. ``It was a media event
that went overboard,'' Shafiri said, ``but it wasn't education any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleased that the new dean wants to restore some of Yale's star
power _ Stern has scheduled Daniel Libeskind and Frank Gehry to
teach in the fall _ Eric Clough, a student, said of the studio,
``Half the class was concerned with it being a gimmick, while the
other half was taking advantage of these amazing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarra Cotterman, now working for a small firm in New Haven, was
one of the dissenters. ``I would rather have really good teachers
interested in new ideas, not in themselves,'' she said, dismissing
the august Johnson as ``just a nice old man who's done a lot of
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern also attempted to reintroduce a grade point system in an
effort to raise competitive excellence. The students fought it,
then admired Stern for listening _ and backing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He desperately wants to be successful,'' said Eisenman, who
has known Stern for more than 30 years. ``But if history is going
to remember him as a great dean, he has to have the pulse of the
moment, and he can't retreat into academia, egotism or ideology.
Luckily, there are many faces of Bob.''

   Every day in the summer, Ettore and Diana Nannetti start at 6
a.m. for Manhattan Beach or Coney Island. They're trying to beat
traffic, but not to nab a place in the sun. Mr. and Mrs. Nannetti
search the shore for buried objects as they wear headsets and hold
their Minelab Excalibur metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   When the monotonous tone in their headsets rises in pitch and
volume, they know they've struck something. And by 10, when the sun
is starting to climb in the sky and the tanning is getting good,
they're gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, I was very interested in history and
archeology,'' Nannetti said. ``This is almost an extension of a
mini-archeological dig. You have no idea what you're going to
find.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nannettis rarely find more than a few salt-caked coins or
the occasional class ring, which they try to return. ``We do it for
the enjoyment, not for monetary value,'' said Nannetti, who counts
an unopened six-pack of beer as one of his most memorable finds
since he started using metal detectors in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In the hopeful world of metal detecting, it's an aluminum pull
tab today, but maybe a gold ring tomorrow. The question for the
average beachgoer who may occasionally see someone sweeping the
sand is:
</P>
<P>
   How does a metal detector distinguish between the two?
</P>
<P>
   All metal detectors are based on one principle: metal reacts to
a magnetic field. A metal detector runs electric current through a
transmitting coil to create an electromagnetic field that extends
under the surface of the ground and changes direction several
thousand times per second. If that field comes in contact with
metal, it induces electric currents in the metal, which in turn
create a magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of that secondary magnetic field is picked up by the
metal detector's receiver coil (unless it is a model with a single
coil that handles both functions), which takes into account the
current induced in it by the magnetic field transmitted by the
detector, dismissing that as background and looking for the signal
generated by a piece of metal in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The detector's electronic components pick up that current and
amplify and interpret it, then signal the user with sound or a
visual display. Metals that don't conduct electricity well but are
easily magnetized can also generate a strong signal because they
are magnetized by the detector's magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   Today most hobbyists, known to their fellow searchers as
detectorists or THers (for treasure hunters), use Very Low
Frequency detectors. A VLF detector works, like earlier models, by
creating a field and transmitting it into the ground and receiving
information about distortions in these fields caused by metallic
objects.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency, between 6 and 70 kilohertz, refers to the number
of times per second the magnetic field changes direction.
</P>
<P>
   Some models are able to reject highly magnetic minerals, like
iron, that are simply part of the soil, which foiled the older
machines. VLF detectors can also take a guess at the depth of the
object by the strength of the distortion signal. The larger the
object, the stronger the current induced in the receiver coil.
</P>
<P>
   The popular VLF detectors have different types of electronic
components than older models. Vacuum tubes were used by some of the
older technologies popular in the 1960s and 70s, like beat
frequency oscillator (BFO) detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Later detectors use transistors, and miniaturization of
components has meant that modern models can include more analytical
electronics, like integrated circuits and microprocessors.
Vdetectors emit a steady electromagnetic field, while a type of
device called a Pulse Induction detector emits a field in pulses.
</P>
<P>
   Microprocessors are used in metal detectors manufactured by
companies like Garrett Electronics, White's Electronics and Minelab
Electronics. Midrange metal detectors generally cost $300 to
$1,200. The user can instruct the processor to look for different
types of metals at various depths. Processors can also learn to
ignore certain objects by storing information about the signal the
object produces.
</P>
<P>
   Although many detector enthusiasts extol the thrill of the find
and either return items or save them as collectibles, some sell
what they find to dealers, collectors and pawnshops. ``Found! 100
Gold Coins worth $36,000!'' and ``$4,375 Gold Nugget!'' are the
types of headlines that can be found on the covers of Western and
Eastern Treasures, a magazine for detector fans.
</P>
<P>
   Although searching a public beach for lost jewelry and coins is
generally permitted under state laws, metal detecting in state and
federal parks and historical sites is not. People with detectors
who hunt for Civil War and Revolutionary War relics (like uniform
buttons and bullets) in landmark battlefields can disrupt these
areas irrevocably if they start digging up what they detect, said
Veletta Canouts, deputy program manager for archeology and
ethnography for the National Parks Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're working within some legitimate excavation
planning process, there's little way of knowing the context of what
you're digging up,'' Ms. Canouts said. ``And once you destroy an
archeological site, you can't put it back together again.''
</P>
<P>
   People who use detectors recreationally have to abide by federal
laws like the Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, which
says any item found on public property is protected by the
government and is not the property of the finder. Some states
protect items more than 100 years old found on private property.
</P>
<P>
   The metal detecting community, which includes hundreds of
regional organizations as well as the Federation of Metal Detectors
and Archeological Clubs, a national group, discourages illegal
searches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few bad apples out there who trespass and remove
artifacts without permission,'' Nannetti said. ``The best we can do
is tell them we don't agree with what they're doing and try to get
them to stop so that they don't spoil it for the rest of us.''

CAN IT PAY TO SURF THE NET? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Md., Mass.) (nk) 
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounded like a great idea at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Harmon, a 26-year-old technology salesman in San Francisco,
received an e-mail message about a company that was offering to pay
people up to $20 a month for something he did everyday anyway: surf
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no risk to sign up,'' Harmon said. ``It would really
cost me nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, All Advantage.com, was ready to pay people who
signed up 50 cents an hour for every hour that they spent online,
up to 40 hours a month. And, Harmon found out, he could make even
more money by recruiting others to do the same. He could earn 10
cents for every hour that each of those referrals surfed, and 5
cents for every hour logged by people who signed up under the
referrals. In fact, he could earn 5 cents for the referrals under
those referrals _ and so on, down two more levels.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon signed up and then recruited 12 people, who referred
hundreds more to the company. For that, All Advantage would put as
much as $600 in his pocket every month.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening shop in Hayward, Calif., in late March, All
Advantage has signed up more than 1.7 million members on the
promise that they can get paid to surf the Web. In return, all the
prospective surfers have to do is tolerate an on-screen viewbar
featuring advertising sold by All Advantage. Some members have
gathered referrals so aggressively _ recruiting more than 10,000
members, in some cases _ that they claim they stand to earn
thousands of dollars every month.
</P>
<P>
   But a week ago, the company quietly changed its plan. Before
even fully starting its service, All Advantage changed the maximum
surfing time to 10 hours a month from 40 hours a month. For people
who are expecting to surf as much as possible under the company's
terms, that's $5 a month instead of $20. The information about the
switch was posted on the company's Web site (www.alladvantage.com).
</P>
<P>
   Harmon, who had read the fine print earlier on the company's Web
site, was not terribly surprised. ``My expectations were set for
something like this,'' he said. ``I didn't set them too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Other All Advantage members, who saw a bigger drop in their
projected earnings, were not so philosophical. ``My thoughts about
the 75 percent reduction in view time are not pretty,'' one member
wrote in a Web-based discussion group at www.egroups.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another member wrote: ``I thought it was devious and slick of
them to make a last-minute announcement of it.'' The member said he
felt that the company had ``milked'' him by first enticing him to
find recruits and then changing the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of online marketing programs, where the
drive to build membership often moves much faster than the push to
make a profit, or even cover costs.
</P>
<P>
   As marketing companies try to figure out how to get people to
actually pay attention to advertising online, they are turning to
any number of strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC, a company in Pasadena, Calif., received a lot of
attention earlier this year when it announced that it would give
away Compaq computers worth about $700 to 10,000 people who were
willing to watch advertisements and to provide the company with
information about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies offer people the chance to earn electronic cash
or points redeemable for products. Cybergold, based in Berkeley,
Calif., offers cash simply for requesting free estimates from
online car dealerships. My Points, a company in San Francisco, pays
people redeemable points for reading e-mail messages from
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   All Advantage's business model is based on the belief that
people will be willing to tolerate advertisements running across
their computer screens if they are paid. The All Advantage viewbar
flashes advertisements at a rate of one or two per minute as
members scroll through Web pages. The viewbar is still being
tested, but the company says that it will be available to All
Advantage's first 200,000 members this month.
</P>
<P>
   James and Lisa Grove of Boston are among those who have become
so taken with All Advantage that they have set up Web sites
dedicated to recruiting members. The Groves even paid a few hundred
dollars for advertising to draw people to their site
(www.grovelabs.com). They now have more than 1,700 people signed up
under them. With a 40-hour limit, they could have earned as much as
$3,600 a month. That amount has now been cut to $900.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at it pragmatically,'' Grove said. ``I figured
that something like this might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before this week's announcement, some marketing experts
were skeptical of All Advantage's plan. And advocates for consumer
privacy warn that companies involved in Web-based marketing may not
be giving away stuff as much as they are trading products or cash
for personal information and the right to record people's movements
online.
</P>
<P>
   Venky Shankar, a marketing professor at the University of
Maryland at College Park, studies multilevel marketing programs
like All Advantage's, which provide incentives for those who sign
up to recruit others to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them start by promising an exciting boom in income,
Shankar said. ``But pretty soon,'' he said, ``people realize they
actually have to put in more effort and it is much harder than it
was made out to be originally.''
</P>
<P>
   Shankar said the rate change did not help the company's image.
``Smart multilevel marketing programs would not try and lessen the
value for their members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jorgensen, the founder and chief executive officer of All
Advantage, sees the reduction in hour limits differently. ``We
didn't actually change anything,'' Jorgensen said. ``We're ramping
up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's plan will still allow its members to earn
thousands of dollars, he noted, but it will just take them longer.
``We just don't want to go broke before we get there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen, who has a master's degree in business administration
from Stanford University, has spent years creating and managing
start-up companies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he co-founded Discovery Zone, which built and managed
indoor entertainment complexes across the country. He left the
company in 1992, after it had grown to include more than 200
complexes. (Discovery Zone then fell into bankruptcy trouble and
recently won court approval to be acquired by CEC Entertainment,
the company that runs Chuck E. Cheese restaurants.)
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Jorgensen owned and sold a few companies that
offered medical-malpractice insurance and helped to start a
soccer-camp company called Challenger Sports.
</P>
<P>
   He said he started thinking about All Advantage in February and
founded the company a month later. Technologically, the company's
strategy is possible because of the viewbar, which gathers
information on members by tracking what search terms they enter and
what sites they visit on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to fly-fishing sites a lot, we'll know that you
fly-fish,'' Jorgensen said. ``So even if you aren't on a
fly-fishing site, we could still provide you advertising related to
fly-fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   That information, Jorgensen said, also allows advertisers to
avoid wasting their promotions on the wrong people. ``Part of that
efficiency,'' he said, ``can be handed back to the users in the
form of electronic payment.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much lucrative advertising can be aimed effectively
at All Advantage's users, however, is still untested.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sterne, the author of ``What Makes People Click: Advertising
on the Web'' (Que Education &AMP; Training, 1997), said he expected
that companies would be interested in the idea of targeting their
advertisements to members' interests, but he questioned whether All
Advantage would be able to attract advertisers for high-end
products.
</P>
<P>
   The people who typically join such marketing programs, Sterne
said, are people of low- or middle-income levels who are interested
in bargains, discounts or sweepstakes. ``They will only attract a
certain type of advertiser,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gourevitch, a spokesman for All Advantage, said that such
skeptics might be surprised. The members they have attracted so
far, Gourevitch said, do not fit the profile of low-income
consumers seeking sweepstakes. Most of them are young and, like
Harmon, they live in zip codes that are known for relatively high
incomes and frequent computer use.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger risk in All Advantage's plan, industry analysts say, is
that it is based on multilevel marketing, which can lead to
uncontrolled growth. E-mail makes referral recruiting easier and
faster than ever, leading to membership bases that may be wildly
larger than expected. Jorgensen said his business model was built
on the expectation of 20,000 members; by Wednesday, more than 1.72
million people had signed up.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the number of members, or what online
marketers call ``eyeballs,'' is what helped the company attract
advertisers. So far, 32 companies _ including Ebay and Efax _ have
decided to run advertisements on the viewbar.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in paid surfing hours will have no effect on the
deals struck with advertisers, Jorgenson said. The advertisers
signed up so far have paid for a certain number of ``impressions,''
or online displays of their ads to specific users. The company is
also striking deals with advertisers to earn its own commissions on
products that people purchase after clicking on ads shown on the
viewbar.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Slack, an analyst with Jupiter Communications' online
advertising group, is not so sure that advertisers will shrug off
the company's revised start-up policy. Some people have simply
signed up to receive $20 a month and are not interested in building
referrals, Ms. Slack said. Now that they will only receive $5 a
month, they may be less willing to take part.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a huge reduction to what they are promising these
people,'' she said. ``If this ends up collapsing their user base,
advertisers are going to be less interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates say that consumers should be wary of signing
up for free Internet offers for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Catlett, the president of Junkbusters, a consumer advocacy
group that tries to limit unsolicited mail, warned that companies
like All Advantage are collecting information about members' social
networks, as well as e-mail addresses and surfing habits. ``People
don't like strangers knowing who knows them,'' Catlett said.
</P>
<P>
   To join All Advantage, members must provide their names, mailing
addresses, ages and e-mail addresses. The company has promised its
members that it will not divulge the information to advertisers or
other companies. That applies to data about members' referrals,
Jorgensen said. Free-PC promises the same, noting on its Web site
that it will keep personally identifiable information ``completely
private forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy policies for Cybergold and Mypoints say that the
companies will not share personal information with third parties
(like advertisers on its Web sites) unless members grant
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Agre, a professor of information studies at the University
of California at Los Angeles, says that consumers can never be too
wary. A company could be bought by a larger company, for example,
and policies could change without much notice. ``Just because it is
their policy today,'' Agre said, ``doesn't mean that it is their
policy tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should also be aware, he said, of marketing clubs like
All Advantage striking deals with third-party companies that want
to send advertisements to the clubs' members. The clubs don't give
the third parties the information; they simply take on the
marketing themselves, sending messages to their members about the
other company's products.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC, for example, is planning to send its participants
e-mail messages asking for permission to send targeted
solicitations from its advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   When Jorgensen of All Advantage was asked about the possibility
of sending members e-mail advertisements, he shook his head. ``We
would consider that spam,'' he said. ``We'd consider that an
invasion of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is more concerned about All Advantage being
defrauded by its own members than he is worried about privacy
issues. The viewbar tracks how many minutes people are surfing by
sensing movement on the mouse and keyboard. Jorgensen is preparing
safeguards to guard against surfing tricks like ``motor mouses''
that some people might use to add to their hours when they are
actually away from the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't cheat us,'' he said, and ``we'll be delivering.''

SMITH'S CHARM, BRANAGH'S LUNACY SALVAGE `WEST' REMAKE AS A GUILTY
PLEASURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who bothers to complain about ``Wild, Wild West'' because
of its African-American star _ Will Smith plays James West,
essentially the first Secret Service agent _ misses the point. The
original series didn't exactly radiate historical accuracy, either.
</P>
<P>
   And never has a star seemed to enjoy himself so much as Smith.
His uncomplicated sunniness makes him look as if he's never missed
a night's sleep in his entire life. And he's so contemporary, he
might as well be the only cowboy on the range to carry a cell phone
and a pager.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the joke. In the 1960s TV series, also set in the
United States just after the Civil War, Robert Conrad had the
square-jawed, wind-me-up stiffness that seemed a product of the
era; he's a graduate of the Bill Shatner School of Fine Actin'. At
least in this movie derived from the series, Smith seems a lot more
comfortable, possibly because his clothes fit. (Conrad might have
gotten in so many fights because his outfits looked a couple of
sizes too tight _ that could account for a lot of tension.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie turns partners James West and Artemus Gordon, played
by Kevin Kline, into a pair of squabbling buddy cops forced to work
together by their superior, President Ulysses S. Grant (also played
by Kline). West's and Gordon's separate investigations eventually
put them on the trail of the same man, former Confederate
strategist Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh).
</P>
<P>
   Loveless is short here, but unlike the TV series Loveless
(Michael Dunn), whose diminutive stature made him the original
Mini-Me, the movie's Loveless is a Civil War survivor who exists
only as a torso and head. Loveless' plan is to take over the United
States with his grotesque mechanical inventions and auction off the
country to European powers.
</P>
<P>
   Salma Hayek is Rita, who's tailing Loveless to find her father;
she joins up with West and Gordon, who compete for her attention.
She's what they used to call in old westerns The Girl. But ``West''
features other old-fashioned touches, like the bad guys attacking
Jim West one at a time, and at an old-fashioned leisurely pace,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The movie features a number of genuinely witty visual touches,
such as sheep grazing on the White House lawn and a cornet-size
hearing aid perched in an ear of one villain. And the inventions by
the scientific visionaries Gordon and Loveless have the
rivet-studded gimmickry inspired by science-fiction visionary Jules
Verne; the production design sends up modern technology taking over
the world. (That was a part of the old show as well, but only
because the series was trying to keep up with the James Bond movies
of the era.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of Loveless' inventions _ like a giant mechanical spider
the size of a skyscraper _ are not only obvious replacements for
his legs, but for his loss of potency as well. His motorized
wheelchair cranks out an oily cloud of smoke as it chugs across the
West. And Loveless' posse is a group of brainy, beautiful women _
the World's Smartest Supermodels.
</P>
<P>
   ``West'' also makes blithe fun of racism. It uses ``Blazing
Saddles'' as a point of departure, as well as Bob Hope comedies
such as ``Son of Paleface,'' in which the hero's modernism was also
part of the joke. ``West's'' irony is so pervasive that when the
movie tries to play it straight _ such as a scene in which West
explains that he was raised by Indians _ it comes off like a joke.
The movie works better when it doesn't try to explain anything,
since nothing in the real world could possibly account for it.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is part of a tradition of acting started by Eddie Murphy.
Like Murphy, Smith satirizes the upright cool of action heroes. He
doesn't take himself seriously for a second, yet that doesn't
detract from crowds' enjoyment of Smith. (That's also a tribute to
Smith's considerable charisma.) This makes Smith like a modern-day
version of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby: quick-witted and laid-back at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Smith couldn't be luckier in having a director like Barry
Sonnenfeld. (This isn't Sonnenfeld's first time at the TV
series-into-movie dance; he made his directing debut on ``The
Addams Family'' and also handled its sequel.) Sonnenfeld's
directing style is flashy yet simple. He stages all the action at
the center of the frame, and the principals seem to have a small
spotlight on them _ his movies are set up like elegant versions of
``Mad'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   A former cinematographer, Sonnenfeld envelops his stars with
enough glamour that they take their places on screen by natural
right. (Think about how Sonnenfeld italicized John Travolta's
essence in ``Get Shorty.)'' Smith gets a movie-star entrance in
almost every scene, drawing and spinning his pistols whenever he
walks into a room.
</P>
<P>
   As the eccentric master-of-disguise Artemus Gordon, Kline is
lost, because his furtive twinkle can't compete with Smith's
outsize easiness. Kilne registers most impressively in his
vaudevillian turn as President Grant, who wears his oblivious
arrogance like a signet ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``West'' also has the Sonnenfeld knack for collapsing the story:
The movie goes straight from setup to climax, leaving out the
entire second act. (Sonnenfeld first used this trick in ``Men in
Black.)'' At 107 minutes, the movie seems barely as long as the
video for the Will Smith song ``Wild, Wild West.'' Like the song,
the movie is a propulsive sample, snatching from every available
source and blithely exploiting what has worked before. (The song
may be the most aggressive double sample in history, plundering
both Stevie Wonder's ``Sir Duke'' and Kool Mo Dee's ``Wild, Wild
West.'')
</P>
<P>
   Through the movies, Smith has freed himself from the fate that
seemed to be the final resting-place of all former rap stars _ an
NBC sitcom _ and launched himself into rap's biggest comeback. He's
grown into the assurance he played at having on TV. He's become
skilled enough that he can hold his own in scenes with Branagh,
where the most interesting dueling emerges; they bait each other
with race and disability insults.
</P>
<P>
   It's Branagh _ playing Loveless as a fatty, salty piece of
Southern ham with a lewd, hungry gleam in his eye _ who has the
most unforgettable moment in the picture. At the helm of the
gargantuan tarantula as it stalks across the plains of Utah, this
would-be conqueror gleams with the loony serenity of a true madman.
He rolls away with the picture.
</P>
<P>
   If not for him, ``Wild, Wild West'' would end up a lot like its
star, Will Smith _ brazen, slick, handsome and, at its center, a
little bland. Despite all the noise, smoke and gunplay, this action
comedy could be called ``Mild, Mild West.'' But it's undeniably one
of the most astounding blends of pop culture ever to be seen in a
movie, and on its own could make up for the cultural imperialism of
pictures like ``Phantom Menace'' and ``Tarzan.''

   Before he died in January 1997, Townes Van Zandt used to tell

   Jeanene didn't know what the Fort Worth native and genius
songwriter meant; there was little chance of a Jimi Hendrix-like
post-mortem popularity explosion. Van Zandt never sold many
records, even though he'd been a major influence on people such as
Lyle Lovett, Steve Earle and the Cowboy Junkies _ covered by
everyone from Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard to Bob Dylan to
Seattle grunge band Mudhoney. He was known more for his hard living
than for his music.
</P>
<P>
   But 2 1/2 years after his death at age 52, Van Zandt is about to
get at least as much attention as he ever did alive, maybe more _
all because of a handful of tapes he casually passed along to
Jeanene shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
   This week saw the release of ``A Far Cry From Dead,'' a
collection of 13 songs Van Zandt recorded primarily between 1989
and 1991. The music includes Van Zandt favorites such as ``Pancho
and Lefty, To Live Is to Fly, Snake Mountain Blues, For the Sake of
the Song,'' and two previously unheard tunes, including
``Sanitarium Blues,'' the last tune Van Zandt recorded.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the recordings to Jeanene with a cryptic ``Hang onto
these, babe,'' and she just set them aside until months after his
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was archiving his stuff and I wondered what was on them,''
says Jeanene Van Zandt, a Corpus Christi native who met her husband
in Austin in December 1980. ``So I called Eric (Paul) and we had
Thanksgiving dinner and started listening and I was like, `Holy cow
_ I never heard Townes sing and play this good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Paul is a respected Nashville producer who has worked with Kris
Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, Johnny Cash and Nelson. He, too, was
stunned by what he was hearing. But like Jeanene, he didn't know
what to do with the tapes. Then Jeanene heard about the possibility
of a Van Zandt live CD that would include, she says, subpar
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset,'' she says. ``I thought it'd destroy his career.
And then his voice came into my head saying, `Remember those tapes?
You've got everything you need.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She and Paul began working on the tapes, adding musicians over
the basic guitar-and-voice tracks that Van Zandt had laid down.
They didn't have a label, so to pay for the studio and musicians,
Jeanene sold off some stock she had been saving. The two of them
would sit in a Nashville studio with the lights off and candles
burning; there would be pictures of Van Zandt all over and, in a
little heart-shaped tin, his ashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go somewhere I take the tin,'' Jeanene says.
``When we started doing the record it was like, `Come on, Townes,
we're going to the studio.' I figured he'd want to be there. Townes
taught me a lot in 15 years, and it all came out _ I'd say `I want
butterfly wings' and Eric would know what I mean. I think in terms
of flowers; he knows how to make flowers show up on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul says the hardest part was assembling the beginnings and
endings of the songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intros and exits were all fabricated,'' he says. ``Townes
didn't play intros. He'd just start. I strengthened what we had
with guitar and dobro when his guitar wasn't enough. The songs took
on their character at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   The most troublesome (both to record and to listen to) was Van
Zandt's final composition, ``Sanitarium Blues.'' Recorded as a
spoken poem, it describes, in chilling detail, being sent to a
sanitarium, receiving shock treatments, and the confusion he felt
upon being released. ``They hose you down, make sure you're
clean/Wrap you up in hospital green/Shoot you full of Thorazine/The
sanitarium blues,'' he sings in a clenched, despair-drenched voice.
</P>
<P>
   The CD was completed last year, and Jeanene and Paul didn't know
what to do with it. People at Arista Records were talking about Van
Zandt's music; Paul took the finished tapes to the label on a
Thursday and got a call back Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric told me they wanted the record,'' Jeanene says. ``And
when I put down the phone it was like a veil between me and the
other side had opened and I saw him there, smiling, for just a
second, and he was gone. All of his and my dreams were coming true,
and I couldn't believe it.''

TOWNES VAN ZANDT'S WIFE HELPS HIM LIVE ON IN POSTHUMOUS CD

   Before he died in January 1997, Townes Van Zandt used to tell
his wife, Jeanene, that he might not have been famous when he was
alive, but that once he passed away she would be ``a very busy
girl.''

`SOUTH PARK' MOVIE HAS LOTS OF YUKS, BUT IT'S TOO YUCKY FOR KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of the most horrendously offensive elements of Comedy
Central's crudely animated and even more crudely written ``South
Park'' _ whether that be singing and dancing feces; Chef's R-rated,
libidinous songs; or any assortment of jibes aimed at women, racial
minorities, gays, organized religion or the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Now take those elements and multiply them by, oh, say a
thousand. Now you might have some idea of what to expect from the
network's new spinoff film, ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut,''
the most unapologetically offensive movie ever to come out of
Hollywood. And did I mention it's also hilarious?
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of being drawn and quartered by parents who
accidentally stumble into this cartoon with their children, I'll
preface my praise with a stiff warning: There has NEVER been a
motion picture more inappropriate for children, even though it's
seemingly aimed at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have always
approached humor with the subtlety of a snickering 13-year-old boy,
so it stands to reason that the adventures of four foul-mouthed
Colorado youngsters (think Peanuts with profanity) would appeal to
kids. But director Parker has packed his film so full of
adults-only subject matter, even open-minded parents would be
insane to allow their preteens to see it.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of the ``South Park'' movie mirrors the inevitable
backlash the film will incur. Kyle, Stan, Kenny and Cartman sneak
into an R-rated movie starring their TV heroes Terrence and
Phillip, a pair of Canadian comics infatuated with flatulence.
</P>
<P>
   After the boys pick up a number of colorfully profane phrases,
their enthusiasm for the film infects all of South Park's children,
leading to a mass epidemic of cursing. Parents, led by Kyle's
outspoken mother, band together to vanquish the source of this ugly
new trend, declaring war on the most likely culprit ... Canada.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to summarize the action beyond this, because so much
of the film can't be discussed in a family newspaper. Suffice it to
say that, if there's a group out there not offended by something in
this film, its omission was purely unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone seem to have set up a checklist of everything
they knew they couldn't get away with on television and then fired
it all at audiences machine-gun style. The odd thing is, when your
jaw isn't lying on the floor in front of you, it's working overtime
laughing, albeit nervously, at stuff you're embarrassed to find
amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's previous effort as director, 1998's porn-biz parody
``Orgazmo,'' shared a similar sensibility in that it proudly
proclaimed itself an adult comedy. It's refreshing that in a
society increasingly obsessed with protecting its children from
anything inappropriate, some filmmakers still produce grown-up
entertainment without the slightest interest in how children will
perceive it.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning is simple; it's not for kids. And neither is
``South Park.'' Let's hope that as theaters start cracking down on
the carding of patrons of R-rated films, they pay special attention
to this one.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry kids, this cartoon's for grown-ups.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Film: ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut''

BOCCACCIO WAS AHEAD OF CHAUCER'S `TALES'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend eyed with curiosity an edition of Boccaccio's ``The
Decameron,'' which I had obtained at a flea market. To my surprise,
she asked, ``What is that?'' She's intelligent, well-read and in
possession of good, all-around knowledge of literature, but she
hadn't heard of Giovanni Boccaccio or ``The Decameron.''
</P>
<P>
   So I asked whether she had heard of Chaucer, not quite realizing
that I was truly adding insult to injury. Of course she'd heard of
Geoffrey Chaucer, and knew ``The Canterbury Tales'' rather well.
Whereupon I remarked that Chaucer derived his scheme for the
``Tales'' from Boccaccio's signature work.
</P>
<P>
   They are the great matching cornerstones of late medieval
literature: ``The Canterbury Tales,'' verse narratives studied by
college English majors in the original Middle English, but
requiring translation into ``modern'' English for the lay reader;
and ``The Decameron,'' composed in Latin prose and translated
almost immediately into romance languages.
</P>
<P>
   Chaucer's birth year is uncertain, but the circa date usually
given is 1340. That would have him junior to Boccaccio by 27 years,
although they are generally thought of as contemporaries because
they wrote at the same time. They never met, although each was
aware of the other's work. But Boccaccio came first.
</P>
<P>
   He began writing ``The Decameron'' in 1348, the year of the
Black Death, and the fabled plague is the springboard for his
extraordinary serving of 100 stories.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of strangers meet in a Florentine church. The Black
Death is all around them, and their inspiration is to flee Florence
to spend some time in the uninfected hills of Fiesole. The 10
people (seven women, three men) are inspired to pass time by
telling stories.
</P>
<P>
   They agree on a format that entitles each member to be queen or
king for a day, as ``ruler'' of a program wherein each of the 10
will tell a story. Ten stories for 10 days, and thus the title.
</P>
<P>
   Chaucer adopted this same narrative method. He brought together
two dozen English folk, all being pilgrims to Canterbury, on their
way there to worship at the shrine of Thomas a Becket, the
``blessed martyr.'' They take lodging at the Tabard Inn in
Southwark, and there the host _ the charismatic Harry Bailey _
organizes the storytelling among the pilgrims, offering a free
dinner to the person relating the best story.
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrims are joined at the inn by several other people,
including one Geoffrey Chaucer, described as an author. Each in the
original party tells one story, so the Chaucerian tally of
narratives approaches Boccaccio's total by only about one-fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Chaucer's tales, like Boccaccio's, offer a full range from
chivalry, romance, tragedy and farce, and both compendiums are
rooted in folklore. There are keen differences, though, in the
tale-spinning casts of characters.
</P>
<P>
   Boccaccio's people are all young and tend to hold romantic
dispositions toward life. The Chaucer pilgrims are rather older and
more hardened by life, with a few youthful exceptions. The pilgrims
to Canterbury represent a cross section of 14th-century English
life, and all are identified by their vocations. Only three of the
pilgrims are women: two nuns and the resourceful Wife of Bath.
</P>
<P>
   Chaucer's cast is more distinctive, emerging as vivid
personalities as they deliver their stories and react to the tales
told by others. Yet Boccaccio was an innovator in bringing common
people into literature, with Chaucer again following his literary
lead.
</P>
<P>
   So you, too, know Chaucer better than Boccaccio? Be advised that
the latter, a bawdy satirist at his best, ranks with Dante and
Petrarch in forming the great literary triumviate of the Italian
Renaissance. G.H. McWilliam's 1972 translation of ``The Decameron''
may be the best one. It's a lot of fun.

`JACKAL' AUTHOR CHANGES GEARS, TO `PHANTOM' FANTASY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After nearly three decades of topping bestseller lists with
thrillers such as ``The Day of the Jackal'' and ``Icon,'' Frederick
Forsyth could have been forgiven for resting on his literary
laurels and churning out more techno-whodunits.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 60-year-old Forsyth is risking his high place on
the literary ladder with the November publication by St. Martin's
Press of ``The Phantom of Manhattan,'' which its author describes
as ``fantasy, with the theme of sin and redemption, emotions I
don't normally touch on, even a tad of religion.'' The Phantom of
the title is the infamous Phantom of the Opera. Forsyth's decision
to extend that character's fictional existence with a ``what if''
yarn has already cost him a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bantam, my publisher in the United States, passed on this
book,'' Forsyth said in a rare phone interview from his home in
England. ``My agent had made it plain to me that going outside my
usual subject area was taking a chance. Clearly, both agent and old
publisher preferred a topic that was money in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Forsyth was ready to gamble, spurred on, he says, by
conversations with close friend Andrew Lloyd Webber, who wrote the
ultrasuccessful musical ``The Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This all started one night a few years ago when Andrew and I
had dinner,'' Forsyth recalls. ``We were musing over the claret
about whatever might have happened to that Phantom guy, and with
his great love, Christine, if he turned out to have survived the
fire at the end of Andrew's musical. We kept on talking about it. I
began to get some ideas. It grew from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a painstaking researcher, Forsyth began an exhaustive
study of 1895-96 Manhattan, guessing that the Phantom might have
fled there from Paris to hide himself in New York City's teeming
underworld.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I felt about this character, I decided he would not
only remain there but thrive there, although as a mysterious sort
of power rather than someone very visible,'' Forsyth said. ``I
reckoned that would be the combination; that he became reclusive
but powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth didn't take long crafting ``The Phantom of Manhattan''
once he'd completed his research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had certain parameters mandated by the original `Phantom of
the Opera,' so I didn't have to invent many main characters,'' he
said. ``I suppose it took me six months to write the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth's agent placed the novel with the Thomas Dunne imprint
of St. Martin's Press, which is diligently gearing up to promote
this unexpected book from such a well-known author. Even Forsyth
isn't confident that longtime fans will snap up his new title.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent has made it plain this must be a one-off unless it
takes off like a brush fire,'' Forsyth said. ``If this book is a
turkey and I write a second in the same vein, there would be
problems placing it (with a publisher). I accept that. But 60
million people have seen Andrew's musical, and if just 10 percent
of them were sufficiently intrigued by my book to buy it, well,
that certainly would be enough. As for my longtime fans, well, I
hope they'll give it a try, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth exploded onto the literary scene in 1972 with ``The Day
of the Jackal,'' a gripping tale about a fictional assassin
stalking French leader Charles de Gaulle. Along with John Le Carre
(''The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,'') Forsyth led a new
generation of novelists who based their well-written thrillers on
real people and world tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been based in East Germany while writing for Reuters''
wire service, Forsyth said. ``I wrote `Jackal' out of instinct,
with no background in writing novels, no earlier attempts at
writing novels that had been rejected. I didn't have to make much
up, really. The book did well, and I was able to go on from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Day of the Jackal's'' success inspired other writers to
tackle the genre and other publishers to print their novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frederick Forsyth made thrillers respectable,'' bestselling
author Tom Clancy said in a recent Star-Telegram interview. ``When
he wrote `The Day of the Jackal,' he redefined the genre ... nobody
has done it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Forsyth said, confining himself to thrillers became
monotonous.
</P>
<P>
   Then came dinner with Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``The Phantom of Manhattan'' written and at the
printer's, Forsyth can only wait nervously and hope for the best.
St. Martin's is demonstrating corporate faith by publishing the
book in November (it will probably be in bookstores by late
October), the heart of the literary Christmas shopping cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early news has been encouraging,'' Forsyth said. ``Reaction
from buyers for the larger book chains has been positive, and
that's the first hurdle. So the books will be out there, very
visible. But people still have to buy enough of them. I expect
we'll know for certain if we've succeeded or not by December.''

HOW TO NAIL `HAMMER' THEME MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find a recording of ``Harlem Nocturne,'' the
theme music from the ``Mike Hammer'' TV series starring Stacy
Keach? _ J.D.C., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're looking specifically for the version that was used
on ``Mike Hammer,'' it shows up in two compilations of TV songs:
``Mission Impossible: Cult TV Themes'' from Silva America and
``25th Anniversary Edition TV'' from Breakable Records.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, there are more than two dozen versions of
``Nocturne'' recorded by different artists, including Ray Anthony
on ``Best of Ray Anthony,'' Les Brown and his Orchestra on ``Great
Les Brown,'' Tito Puente on ``Revolving Bandstand'' and Kenny Blake
on ``Interior Design.''
</P>
<P>

   Q: I'm looking for a poem that used to be read by my pastor. All
I remember is ``A careful man I want to be/A little fellow follows
me.'' Can you help? _ L.H., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The poem, attributed to Lee Fisher, has been reprinted often
in Christian and Boy Scout publications under the title ``A Little
Fellow Follows Me.'' Here's one version:
</P>
<P>
   ``A careful man I want to be,/A little fellow follows me;/I do
not dare to go astray,/For fear he'll go the self-same way,/I
cannot once escape his eyes/Whate'er he sees me do, he tries;/Like
me he says he's going to be,/The little chap who follows me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks that I am good and fine,/Believes in every word of
mine;/The bad in me he must not see,/The little chap who follows
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must remember as I go,/Through summer's sun and winter's
snow;/I am building for the years to be/That little chap who
follows me.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who wrote ``The Hunchback of Notre-Dame,'' and what was the
history behind the author? _ M.D.H., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The Hunchback of Notre-Dame'' is the English title of
``Notre-Dame de Paris,'' a French novel written in 1831 by Victor
Hugo.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo, who lived from 1802 to 1885, was one of France's most
successful poets and playwrights at the time ``Notre-Dame'' was
published. He wrote the book to fulfill an 1828 contract for a
historical novel, finishing it more than two years past deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victor Hugo: A Biography,'' a recent book by Graham Robb, was
published in paperback last month.  &QL;

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My 60-year-old house has an equally old detached garage in my
back yard and there is no electricity going out to this garage.
Instead of stringing a heavy overhead extension cord out there (as
I have been doing in recent years) I want to install a permanent
underground power line that will supply electricity for the garage.
I want to tap into a weatherproof outdoor outlet on the back of the
house by hooking up an underground cable that will run out to the
garage. I've been told there is a type of electric cable that can
be buried in the ground safely without having to use conduit. Is
this true, and if so can it be connected to the existing outdoor
outlet box on the house?
</P>
<P>
   A: The cable you refer to is called UF type cable, but you
should check with your local building department to make sure the
cable is approved for use in your community. Also, be sure the
circuit you are tapping into is adequate for the load you will be
adding. For example, if you are going to run power tools or a
heater you may have to add a separate circuit. The cable can be
laid directly in the ground, but usually it has to be buried about
12 inches to 16 inches underground. In addition, it is a good idea
to lay a wood plank over the cable to protect against accidental
damage when digging in the future, although this is not required in
all communities. Where the cable is exposed as it goes from the
outlet box down into the ground it should be enclosed in a length
of rigid conduit as shown here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have lived in our present house for about three years and
had the exterior shingles painted the first year. Within a couple
of months, and while the weather was still warm, this paint started
to peel. The painter says this is due to air pollution since
several neighbors also have a peeling problem. Could the peeling
problem have anything to do with the fact that we added insulation
in the floor of our attic after we moved in?
</P>
<P>
   A: I doubt if air pollution could be the cause. Peeling could be
due to condensation developing in the attic after the insulation
was added _ if there is not enough ventilation in the attic.
However, condensation usually occurs during or immediately after a
cold spell, so I'm inclined to think that is not your problem. I
think the problem is most likely due to the fact that the shingles
were painted instead of being stained. Wood shingles should never
be painted _ only stained or treated with a wood preservative so
that the wood can ``breathe'' properly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When our very old house was renovated about 15 years ago all
the windows were replaced, some (but not all) with Anderson
windows. There are no problems with the Anderson windows, but many
of the other windows, which are also double-paned, have developed
condensation between the inner and outer glass. Vision has been cut
down severely and it is impossible to clean the dirt out of the
inside. Short of replacing these windows, are there any suggestions
you can offer to clean the windows and solve the condensation
problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: This depends on how the windows were made originally. Some
double-pane glass units are sealed and can never be taken apart and
cleaned or re-sealed, while others can be repaired by a
professional glazier who is equipped to do repairs of this kind.
But not all pros do this work, and not all double-pane glass can be
repaired without replacing the unit entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The concrete wall in my basement is cracked and water comes
in after a heavy rain. I filled the crack with hydraulic cement
some time ago, but now this cement has started to crack out so that
water is coming in again. What is the best way to permanently solve
this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Assuming you did the patch job properly then it's likely that
the only permanent cure is to work from the outside. Your best bet
is to call in a professional to excavate around the outside down to
the footing and clean the concrete to fill in the crack from the
outside. After applying a waterproof membrane coating to the
outside of the wall and laying drain tile (perforated plastic pipe)
and gravel on top of the footing to carry ground water away, he
will finish up by putting down another 6 inches of coarse gravel
before replacing and backfilling with soil.

`SHADOW: FIVE PRESIDENTS AND THE LEGACY OF WATERGATE': PRESIDENCY
AS BLOOPER SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Woodward's mode of operation is by now ordained. He talks to
everybody who will talk to him and decorates the results with some
local color. This time out, he begins with President Gerald R.
Ford's pardon of Richard M. Nixon (``Aug. 1, 1974, was a hot
Washington summer morning with the humidity heavy in the air, but
inside Richard Nixon's air-conditioned White House it was
unnaturally cool'') and works his way up or down through Jimmy
Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, concluding with Bill
Clinton, who occupies more than half of this fat new book.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material is familiar, and Woodward's opinions are
generally unexciting. His theme consists of presidential lapses,
starting with Ford's announcement, from which he never recovered:
``There is no Soviet domination of Europe, and there never will be
in a Ford administration.'' Woodward construes the Nixon pardon as
a seminal act of the Ford presidency, above all an act of loyalty
to Nixon. In Woodward's generous view, Ford made the correct
decision but executed it poorly.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter episodes focus on the corruption charges against Bert
Lance, the administration's budget director _ ``My faith in the
character and competence of Bert Lance has been reconfirmed'' _ and
on Hamilton Jordan, the president's chief of staff, who was mired
for months in ``a sticky personal criminal investigation.'' In
Woodward's unremarkable judgment about these unremarkable events,
the president recognized that his claim to a high moral ground
``helped me get elected, but it also came back to haunt me later
on.'' In short, Carter ``did not always tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   It took six years before the Reagan presidency was touched by a
major scandal, but it was a dandy, involving arms sales to Iran,
the diversion of profits to the Contras, CIA machinations and the
dubious activities of William J. Casey, Caspar W. Weinberger,
Robert C. McFarlane, Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter and Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North. Woodward's main source for this complicated tale
is evidently George P. Shultz, Reagan's secretary of state, who
played the part of the white hat amid a company of connivers. The
lesson is that if you expect kindly treatment at Woodward's hands,
be forthcoming in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward concludes the Reagan chapter with a question he posed
to Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent prosecutor: ``How will
Iran-Contra be remembered in history?'' Walsh answers: ``I think
it'll be remembered as a non-sordid disregard of constitutional
restraints. I think the president was wrong, he was defiant, he was
deliberate, but he wasn't dirty.'' That's about as interesting as
the conclusions come.
</P>
<P>
   Bush owed his first brush with scandal to his son Neil, fingered
as the ``poster boy'' of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association. The president lamented, ``They're out to get my boy,
they're out to get me.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later, Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, was caught
using government planes for personal trips, $500,000 worth over two
years. Then came the Tailhook embarrassment and the moment during a
presidential debate when the president was caught looking at his
watch. Nor could he escape repeated charges that he was ``in the
loop'' on Iran-Contra.
</P>
<P>
   None of this makes for exhilarating reading. In a relatively
fresh summing up of the Bush career, Woodward maintains that the
president built his career as the patron of other Republican
presidents: ``He had not acquired the political skills that many
politicians develop through struggle and adversity. As a new
president, he was not as well equipped as he should have been to
handle the inevitable scandals. The investigations and conflicts
were distasteful to him. The controversies almost dazed him.''
</P>
<P>
   But all these events are just appetizers for the Clinton
presidency, featuring Monica S. Lewinsky, Linda R. Tripp, Paula
Corbin Jones, Webster L. Hubbell, Robert S. Bennett, Ronald H.
Brown, James Carville, Kenneth W. Starr and other casualties of the
time, which the nation has long since wearied of hearing about.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward digs especially into the scandal-management team of the
Clinton defenders, which was riven by dispute. More than once we
are reminded, the president assured his lawyers regarding his
dealings with women: ``I'm retired.'' To Clinton's remonstrance
that ``I get the sense that you don't believe me,'' Dick Morris
replied, ``Mr. President, my job is to run the pump and the motors,
not to fix the hole in the bottom of the boat.'' Not long after
this exchange, Morris resigned when it was revealed that he had a
relationship with a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, the president's lawyer, figures substantially in
``Shadow'' as a lawyer who dares to talk to and about his client,
especially as doubts began to increase about the boss' story.
Bennett says he took comfort in the adage that ``the worst defense
lawyers are the ones that believe their clients.'' The one lawyer
who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying his role was William H.
Ginsburg; we learn that he and Ms. Lewinsky shared a 1985 Chateau
Haut-Brion at Nathan's restaurant in Georgetown, and he made all
the talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, with Washington anecdotes, opinions and
persiflage. Woodward seems to be developing some larger point about
the shadowy side of national politics, but the connections between
the various presidents do not repay much study. When the material
is not recooked, it tends toward gossip; the result is an overlong
inside-the-Beltway collage.

   Somewhere in the attic of this old Maryland farmhouse is a faded
picture of my grandparents Grace and Carroll Raver standing in the
front yard in front of four sticks just barely taller than
Granddad, and he was not a tall man.
</P>
<P>
   These sticks are Norway maples, probably dug from the woods
(because why would a farmer pay for a tree) and planted next to the
road to shade the house. They put in a privet hedge, too, kept low
to frame the changing fields of wheat and corn and soybeans across
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been around 1902, because that's when your
great-grandfather died,'' Mother said, as we sat on the front porch
sipping Scotch one evening a few weeks ago. A light wind rustled
the big leaves of the trees _ now 60 feet tall _ and a catbird
screeched from a branch in the thick canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Great-Granddad built the house around 1890 to shelter his 13
children, and some of their names are still carved up in the attic
rooms. But his wife, Caroline, died young (probably of exhaustion)
when her last child, Ralph, was only 4, so my newly married
grandparents got the farm _ and a brood of youngsters to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace was only 16 when she eloped with Carroll,'' said Mother,
who is 86. I know the legend. How Grace climbed in the buggy with
the cake her mother had baked for the church supper and drove right
by the church, heading for Baltimore and the preacher.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my favorite old maple, the one right next to the
porch. I used to read Nancy Drew mysteries in its wide branches,
and you could escape from the upstairs bedroom by climbing out on
the porch roof and walking right into its arms. Half those branches
are gone now, sawed off by Eugene Yelton, our faithful tree man,
who has nursed them through hurricanes and hailstorms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Yelton loves that tree,'' Mother said, and so does she,
since it shades her bedroom. ``I'll be afraid he'll tell me it's
got to come down and he'll say, `Oh, she's doing fine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The latest disaster came one afternoon in June 1998. My mother
was setting the table for lunch when she noticed that the sky
looked strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had this yellowish streak all around the horizon and very
black clouds above that,'' she said. ``I thought I better go up and
put the windows down when the hail came.''
</P>
<P>
   When the storm was over, the yard was full of fallen limbs. The
black walnut was uprooted. The English chestnut was ripped down the
trunk like a toothpick. And the maples had lost half of their
branches.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, we sat on the porch surveying the survivors.
``Those two in the middle really should go, Mom,'' I said in my
ruthless New Yorker voice. ``It's beginning to look like the Addams
family lives here.''
</P>
<P>
   I let the privet hedge grow up about five years ago to screen
out the houses that had cropped up on Elijah Blizzard's cornfields,
and to muffle the sound of the cars and trucks that roar by on
their way to the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we just plant some young trees in front of the old
ones,'' she said, ``and when they get going, we can cut down the
maples.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that sounds like a reasonable idea, but Norway maples are
notorious for sucking all the moisture and nutrients from anything
except poison ivy. And their leaves, which are as big as butter
plates, can shade a young tree right out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   I just said, ``Hmmm,'' thinking of this hedgerow I wanted to
plant. A couple of sugar maples, maybe, mixed in with lots of other
trees and shrubs, like spruce and cedars, dogwoods, magnolias,
viburnums and highbush blueberry. A wildlife habitat about 50 feet
wide, straight up to the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Maryanne Connelly, a landscape architect, had
suggested the idea years ago. On her first visit to the farm, she
hacked a sightline through the ancient mock oranges so my mother
could see out the kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   When Mom went away for a couple weeks, I called Maryanne. What
if we got a little plan together, and an estimate, just to test the
waters? So that's what we've been up to the past few nights,
batting around ideas from Maryland to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Could we have sycamores, like the ones down by the stream? No,
they need moisture. How about a horse chestnut, like those beauties
in Central Park? Too grand. A Katsura? Too formal.
</P>
<P>
   We settle on Franklinia alatamaha, the tree the 19th-century
naturalist John Bartram found in Georgia. And magnolias, which have
a country feel. Redbud and viburnums, like the black haw by our
stream.
</P>
<P>
   And Maryanne thinks big: eight Norway spruce, a dozen red cedars
and a dozen Hamamelis virginiana, my favorite witch hazel. Plant
lovers tend to want one of everything. ``But the most dramatic
landscape comes from keeping to a few,'' Maryanne said. ``And a lot
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   So we added a dozen purple lilacs, 19 highbush blueberries, 50
viburnums, 15 red twig dogwoods. And a dogwood developed by Rutgers
University that's resistant to anthracnose but as close to the
Florida dogwood as you can get: Cornus x Rutgan.
</P>
<P>
   Close to the house are 60 Rosa rugosas, which the birds will
love for the hips, and I'll think I'm in Nantucket. (Or is this
plan starting to look like the Hamptons?)
</P>
<P>
   The cross section that came through the fax machine at the local
convenience store was beautiful. I could see what Maryanne meant by
starting low at the road and sloping up and back down to the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different types of birds live at different heights,'' Maryanne
said. ``By giving them a shrub layer, understory and a canopy,
you're giving them a place to work'' _ as in working the trees for
bugs and nest-building materials, not to mention flowers and
berries.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the fun part: pricing this dream list. I drove over to
TDH Nurseries, which was started 34 years ago by Tom, Dick and
Harry Irvin on a farm in Phoenix, Md. They grow their own trees and
shrubs, and cater to the horsy set, so their prices are comparable
to New York's: $11,410 for the plants, wholesale, multiplied by
2.5, the general cost factor for site preparation and planting. The
installed price: $28,525, give or take a couple thousand.
</P>
<P>
   And I hadn't even figured in the cost of taking down four
century-old maples. I called Yelton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in Canada hunting bear,'' said Shirley, his wife. ``He'll
be down towards the last of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, as I came up from the meadow, I found Yelton
out under the maples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think your mother will go for this,'' he said, shaking
his head as he went from tree to tree. He gave me his rough
estimate: $1,600 to remove the two damaged trees by the walkway,
$2,000 for the others, which are still relatively strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the stumps and roots ground up?'' Yessir. ``That'll
be another $125 each.''
</P>
<P>
   So now we're up to $4,000 for removing four trees. Add another
$1,000 for bulldozing the privet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to take that old yew, too,'' he said, squinting, as
if he'd heard of heartless types like me. As he got in his pickup
and gave his maples one last nod, he repeated, ``Your mother will
never go for this.''
</P>
<P>
   I know she won't. Next time I went down to the woods, I looked
around for some young tulip poplars. And I saw a silver maple that
might do just fine in the yard.

   Ingredients will come together for clusters of showers and
thunderstorms to develop across the upper Mississippi Valley and
advance into the Great Lakes region Thursday. An unusually fast jet
stream, marked by winds as strong as 150 mph near an altitude of
30,000 feet, will extend from the Pacific Northwest to the northern
Rockies and Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, moderate to moderately high humidity will gradually
build northward from the Gulf of Mexico. Finally, a potent
disturbance in the energetic jet stream will arrive and lift humid
air. The coming together of these ingredients will set the stage
for thunderstorms, some with heavy rain and a few with the
potential to spawn severe weather.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of potent thunderstorms will erupt near a weak warm
front near northern Oklahoma and Kansas. Some storms will reach
severe levels in areas where intense sunshine heats the ground and
destabilizes the atmosphere. Clusters of storms will migrate
eastward toward the Mississippi Valley later Thursday. Damaging
winds will pose the greatest threat.
</P>
<P>
   After a respite of lower humidity in the Northeast on Wednesday,
humidity will surge back into the region, accompanied by scattered
showers and thunderstorms. In the Southeast States, isolated heavy
thunderstorms will flare in the humid heat of the afternoon near
the Carolina and Georgia coasts. Heavy thunderstorms will also
barrage parts of northern Florida with heavy rains, particularly in
the panhandle, where the inland-moving sea breeze lifts tropical
air.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: RAINLESS IN BOSTON
</P>
<P>
   With a matter of hours remaining in June and a front weakening
over southeast Massachusetts, Boston was poised to set a rare
record late Wednesday. No measurable rain had been observed at the
airport last month, a feat matched only in March, 1915. Boston's
weather records date back to 1871. Only a trace of rain was
recorded last month (and March, 1915), but such meager rain seems
more impressive in June, a month when humidity, showers and
thunderstorms build. Humidity was generally low in June, but, when
it was high, any showers and storms that developed, bypassed
Boston.

   Lightweight Alternative With Zip for the Road
</P>
<P>
   For those on the go, ``companion'' computers, bigger than a
Pop-Tart and smaller than a breadbox, might be just the right size.
Compaq's Aero 8000, released last month, boasts quite a bit under
the hood for a lightweight alternative.
</P>
<P>
   It runs on a zippy 64-bit, 128-MHz SH4 processor and also
features a smart card reader and writer built right into the unit
for those needing file security on the road. The device comes with
a voice recorder and 16 megabytes of RAM, which can be upgraded to
64 MB.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a 7-hour standard battery life and the ability for
remote users to synchronize the unit with servers running Lotus
Notes, Novell Groupwise and Microsoft Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   At 10.75 inches wide, 8.5 inches deep and 1 inch thick, the Aero
8000 is big for its class. It weighs 2.9 pounds and offers a
10-inch screen and a keyboard that, at 95 percent the size of a
regular notebook keyboard, will allow most adults with
average-sized hands to actually type on it. The basic model lists
for $949.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests a question: as these companion computers (which
usually run Windows CE) get more powerful, why not just spend a
little extra for a low-end laptop running Windows 98? The Aero
8000, a product in that awkward, in-between phase, seems like a
good compromise for those who don't mind trading power for less
strain on the shoulder and wallet.

   AOL Giving Subscribers Incentives to Stay Home
</P>
<P>
   America Online's next generation of software, AOL 5.0, will be
introduced this fall. The release will have a number of new
features intended, apparently, to tempt users to eschew the greater
Internet in favor of remaining on America Online's proprietary
site.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a wish list derived from America Online users and focus
groups, the new software will offer an online appointment calendar
and the first search feature capable of hunting for content both on
the Internet and on America Online's proprietary channels.
</P>
<P>
   Users who log on via a broadband connection will automatically
be served richer content as well. For instance, a broadband user
searching the movie listings might see a short video clip along
with the usual reviews.
</P>
<P>
   And by the end of the year, users of the new You've Got Pictures
feature will be able to drop off a roll of film at a store with an
Eastman Kodak processor (there are 40,000 nationwide) and pay an
extra $5.95 to digitize the images, scan them and send them to an
America Online account within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   How well will such ambitious features work? Beta testing on
You've Got Pictures started in three cities last month. But one
limitation is already apparent. The feature will be introduced
before a companion editing program becomes available. So
grandparents will just have to live with red eye for a while. &QL;

   Miniature Pinball With Buzz, And a Bunch of Apes on the Run
</P>
<P>
   Two innovative new games for Nintendo Game Boy and Sony
Playstation systems are finding new uses for idle hands. On the
smaller-scale Game Boy, Nintendo delivers Pokemon Pinball, a Game
Boy cartridge that outdoes ordinary pinball wizardry by challenging
players to collect 150 little monsters by flipping and tilting the
ball around the fast-moving but sometimes disorienting
matchbook-size color LCD screen. Because a whole pinball field
won't fit on the device's tiny screen, players see half the board
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But the real innovation happens off-screen: Pokemon Pinball is
the first Game Boy cartridge to include a built-in force-feedback
mechanism, causing the device to vibrate. Holding it is akin to
containing a handful of bumblebees.
</P>
<P>
   A single AAA battery powers the cartridge, which is fatter and
taller than ordinary Game Boy cartridges. Other Game Boy developers
will probably follow the game's tremulous lead and slip in a little
shaking of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Sony presents a different sort of challenge with Ape Escape.
Players usually manipulate only one of the controller's dual
free-wheeling knobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ape Escape demands that players put both thumbs to use. The goal
is to travel back in time and capture a slew of mastermind monkeys
on the loose. A series of training sessions is intended to help
players put the opposition into opposable thumbs.

   Memory-Starved Palm Owners Can Take Resourceful Steps
</P>
<P>
   Though the new wafer-thin Palm V got points for size and style
from gadget lovers, it came with only two megabytes of RAM _
considered paltry by Palm pals who like to load up with plenty of
third-party applications.
</P>
<P>
   The 3Com Corp. offers no memory upgrade options for the Palm V,
but a few enterprising folks have taken matters into their own
hands, safely stuffing an eight-megabyte chip inside the device.
</P>
<P>
   In an illustrated Web page translated from his original Japanese
(www.asahi-net.or.jp/TG7T-KSWG/newpalmve.htm), Toshio Kashiwagi, a
Palm V owner, describes gently melting the sealant on his unit with
a blow dryer so he could pry it apart and add the bigger memory
chip.
</P>
<P>
   For those Palm V owners who don't possess quite the same level
of fearlessness, a company in Sunnyvale, Calif., will do the job
for you. The Electronic Fast Integration Group (www.efig.com) will
take the Palm V that you send them and install the eight-megabyte
chip for $249.
</P>
<P>
   John Figueroa, the vice president for engineering at EFIG, said
that he announced the service on March 13 in an Internet newsgroup
and that his company had already upgraded more than 500 units for
RAM-starved Palm V owners.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't yet own a Palm V, EFIG will sell you a new one
(complete with cradle and software) with the extra memory already
installed for $649. The company also offers an optional extended
warranty for an additional $40, which might come in handy because
the EFIG upgrade voids 3Com's warranty. &QL;

   Software Will Let You Mingle With the Crowd at a Web Site
</P>
<P>
   Although e-mail, chat rooms and instant messaging have turned
parts of the Internet into a conversation parlor, surfing the Web
is still a solitary activity. Or it was before Gooey, a new
communal Web-surfing program.
</P>
<P>
   Gooey, which can be downloaded free at www.getgooey.com, places
a rectangular box on your screen. When you visit a site, the box
lists other Gooey people who are at the same site at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   You can then send messages to anyone else _ or everyone else _
who is scrolling through the site with you. You can also start what
Gooey's founders call ``dynamic roving communities'' by leading
other members to sites you are visiting.
</P>
<P>
   More than 32,000 people have downloaded Gooey since it came out
in June, the company said. ``It's like there are walls between
those who are surfing the Internet,'' said Shai Adler, co-chief
executive of Hypernix Technologies, Gooey's parent company. But
with Gooey, he said, ``there's a way to communicate with all those
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooey members can also share something else: flashing ads on the
Gooey box. &QL;

   Smaller Than a Regular Mouse, But Big Enough for Travelers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most laptops give you two options for a pointing device, either
a touchpad or a trackball, and many mobile users don't like either.
Unfortunately, most tray tables aren't big enough for a mouse. And
many of the smaller laptops, in the subnotebook class, have
eliminated the serial and ports and the mouse ports to save weight.
</P>
<P>
   Targus took a look at the problem and came up with the USB
Mobile Mini Mouse. About a third the size of a regular mouse, it's
still big enough to be used by travelers with large hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked some really big guys to test it and they were happy
with it,'' said Richard Heim, director of product marketing at
Targus.
</P>
<P>
   The product, with an expected price of $29.95, will be available
after Aug. 1 through retail outlets.

   WHO SANG THAT? The International Lyrics Server (www.lyrics.ch) a
popular source of music lyrics, is back on line after a five-month
legal hiatus. After reaching an agreement with the National Music
Publishers Association, the site no longer features full lyrics but
does allow users to enter a phrase to find a song or artist. For
example, who sang the line ``lawyers dwell on small details''? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BREAK IT TO ME BY E-MAIL First, the good news: it's easier to
give bad news by e-mail. A study of 117 Boston University
undergraduates found that people can deliver bad news with less
distortion by using e-mail than they can in person or over the
phone, according to a recent issue of Information Systems Research.
</P>
<P>
   But the article's authors did not address the issue of the
effects of receiving bad news through e-mail.

RICHARD SCHULTZ: THE MAN WHO GARDENS WITH FURNITURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARTO, Pa. _ Most people look at a lettuce and see salad.
Designers look at a lettuce and see lettuce green.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you think of that color on a chair?'' Richard
Schultz, a furniture designer, asked, pointing to the bright floppy
head sticking out of the ground in a vegetable garden fenced by
tall wire tangled with wild purple roses. A chair in the garden is
apple green, last month's flavor, which the designer chose by
walking into a local paint store with an apple in his hand, picked
from the tree behind his studio.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz, 72, has spent the last 45 years getting to know his
materials. As much as the metals and plastics that inspire
innovation in furniture, they are the lettuces, leafy ferns, the
light and shadow and lichened stone walls of the 49-acre,
19th-century farm he shares with his wife, Trudy.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz is not a gardener. But he has cultivated the outdoors,
planting designs in the landscape to see if visual relationships
will grow. The two small houses, barn, gardens and pond that sit
within a circus of woods have been his laboratory for experimenting
with furnishing the outdoors handsomely, and accommodating man-made
objects thoughtfully in the most fragile, temperamental of
settings: nature.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of perfection can be tough to compete with. The
rolling property is spotted with furniture, prototypes, sculpture
and garden follies that look like sketches tossed out on the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz is the author of the Leisure Collection, a sculptural
series of outdoor tables, chairs and chaise longues designed for
Knoll Associates in 1966 that is one of the most well regarded
collections of modern outdoor furniture ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   Design dealers and collectors are bringing it back into season,
as are hoteliers like Andre Balazs, whose new hotel, the Standard,
in Los Angeles features 24 chaises stretched like sunning models by
the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked high and low, and there's nothing better out
there,'' Balazs said. ``It is extremely elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz isn't in many of the design histories. But pieces of the
Leisure Collection are included in the collections of the Museum of
Modern Art, the Victoria &AMP; Albert and the Louvre. ``It's brilliant
design in a field where it's difficult to find anything more than
passable,'' said Stanley Abercrombie, the editorial director of
Interior Design magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz left Knoll in 1972, starting his own business, Richard
Schultz Design, in 1992 with his son Peter, now 40, an architect.
They produce his 1966 collection (Knoll gave them the original
machine tools); the newer Topiary line, begun in 1992, and
Confetti, a group introduced this spring. Prices range from
approximately $500 for a side chair to $2,000 for a chaise longue.
</P>
<P>
   The long-running success of Schultz's lithe sling-seat furniture
may have to do as much with the lack of serious modern
outdoor-furniture design as it does with the virtues of his first
collection, still as crisp to see and sit in as a summer-weight
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz's career as an outdoor furniture designer wasn't meant
to be that, in fact. He studied industrial design at the Institute
of Design, the Chicago school founded by the former Bauhaus
instructor Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. Schultz took his first job with
Knoll Associates in New York in 1951, where he was made apprentice
to Harry Bertoia, the Italian-born sculptor who created the iconic
wire chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Trudy Schultz moved to the Pennsylvania German
countryside in 1955 to be close to the Knoll factory in East
Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, Florence Knoll, who founded the company in
1946 with her husband, Hans (who was killed in an automobile
accident in 1955), asked Schultz to design outdoor furniture for
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She tried using Bertoia's chairs outdoors, but they didn't
hold up, as manufactured then,'' Schultz said, sitting out on his
simple white screened porch last week, drinking iced tea. The
sky-blue ceiling, which might easily have been a designer's touch,
is traditional to the area. Bird song went off in the background
like weekend fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came back, fuming. `There should be some decent outdoor
furniture that doesn't fall apart,''' Schultz recalled her saying.
``It had nothing to do with esthetics; it had to do with
maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer began with his materials: noncorrosive aluminum and
something that couldn't have been more pedestrian in its elegance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's summer shoes used to be made out of what looked like a
woven plastic,'' he said. ``A mill in Massachusetts made the stuff,
a vinyl-coated polyester yarn. We got them to make it stronger and
more durable, then weave it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he had never designed outdoor furniture before, Schultz
made the lucky mistake of bringing to it a level of sophistication
associated with contemporary indoor design. But modern designs
showed to great advantage outdoors, where they added sharp shape
and discipline to soft foliage and rough irregular textures like
stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early modern designers, Breuer and Gropius and people like
that, they knew something which one finds out,'' Schultz said.
``And that is that modern furniture looks better when it's not in a
modern interior but placed beside more primitive materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Schultz has taken a different tack. He has
investigated forms of furnishing that will be assimilated into
their surroundings. The two recent lines include sheet-aluminum
chairs that are stamp-punched with a variety of cuts to let light
pass through the forms. The lattice creates an artist's
chiaroscuro, or natural dappling, that Schultz hopes will help the
furniture dissolve into its setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of this was imitation shrubbery,'' Schultz said. ``A
chair that looks like a shrub that's been trimmed to look like a
chair.'' They are a kind of garden pun.
</P>
<P>
   The designer has also created larger garden follies, including a
pyramid constructed from 2-by-4's and sheet metal stamped to look
like brick, which is routinely sold as a skirting material for the
bases of mobile homes. The pyramid sits in wooded solitude in a
patch of ferns, which appeared shortly after it was completed, as
though by alien visitation from the stars.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schultz also developed a quick trick for training views. He
pruned one long, low hedge that borders the driveway between his
studio and the house with a draftsman's precision, to underscore
the untamed hedges and trees beyond it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of a natural vista, if you have one element
which is a little geometric, it's enough to define a great amount
of space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape has been furnished sparely, like rooms with
spectacular views that need only enough furniture to view them
from: a pair of butterfly chairs, designed by Jorge Ferrari-Hardoy,
beneath the giant sheepdog of a willow by the pond; a group of
Topiary chairs and table, like an ornamental fountain, tucked into
the crux of two stone walls.
</P>
<P>
   Indoors, the furnishing is as simple as that of the porch, which
opens the old house as expansively as if it were also outdoors. The
scarred, wide-plank wood paneling in the dining room behind the
Bertoia chair might be the trunk of a tree. Upstairs in a bedroom,
yellow polka dots sponge-painted on the walls could be lemons
ripening to drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always afraid to add on to the house, or introduce too
much into the landscape, for fear that I would ruin it,'' Schultz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple, no sophistication,'' he added, but by that
it was clear that his long career and his life in the country have
brought him to appreciate those qualities as the quintessence of
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very pure,'' said Mrs. Schultz, who presented the visitor
with a gift of fresh lettuces from her garden for the trip back to
the city, as though they were food for thought.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz's collections are available from Richard Schultz Design,
Palm, Pa.; (215) 679-2222; or www.richardschultz.com.

   NEW YORK _ In the summer of 1977, New York lost its mind.
</P>
<P>
   A mountain climber named George Willig scaled the World Trade
Center. Terrorist bombs linked to Puerto Rican nationalists
exploded at Manhattan office buildings and department stores. The
temperature hit 104 degrees, nearly breaking the record high. A
Consolidated Edison blackout triggered looting that resulted in
more than 3,000 arrests. Elvis Presley died. Studio 54 opened. The
Bronx's most dysfunctional family, the Yankees, revived their
legendary World Series rivalry against the Dodgers. Abe Beame was
struggling to avoid being the first elected mayor in more than half
a century to be defeated for a second term. And, oh yes, a
psychopathic serial killer armed with a .44-caliber revolver and
dubbed Son of Sam held New York hostage as no crime figure had done
in the decades since a disgruntled former Con Ed worker, George
Metesky, periodically vented his rage as the folkloric Mad Bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee's latest film, ``Summer of Sam,'' which opens Friday,
is not a documentary. But it vividly captures the depravity of a
city that had lost its bearings as well as its mind. Thousands of
movies have been made in and about New York, but relatively few
have produced such a hyperreal snapshot of the ever-changing city
at a particular point in time. Most moviegoers' short list would
probably include ``Marty,'' ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' ``Midnight
Cowboy,'' ``The French Connection,'' ``Annie Hall,'' ``An Unmarried
Woman,'' ``A Thousand Clowns'' and Lee's ``Do the Right Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That metaphorical summer of 1977 lasted from March to October
and fell midway through five years when New Yorkers were
desperately grasping at competing visions. One concluded that the
real good old days were the 1950s and that in the ensuing two
decades the city had passed its prime and had grown unmanageable. A
second vision defined New York as a resilient immigrant mecca
where, once the crater-size potholes were fixed, the streets would
again be paved with gold.
</P>
<P>
   Those two views of New York are encapsulated in the gritty
on-screen soliloquies that serve as bookends to ``Summer of Sam.''
As the film opens, the newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin is
standing in today's squeaky-clean Times Square. Business is
booming, he intones. Crime isn't. Then, for the generation of
moviegoers who weren't even born when the events depicted in
``Summer of Sam'' unfold, he recalls: ``Well, it wasn't always like
this. This film is about a different time, a different place, the
good old days, the hot, blistering summer of 1977.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee authentically recreates an anarchic epoch that was,
anomalously, shaped by the last gasps of an anything-goes sexual
revolution, by bankers and bond raters who decided to punish New
Yorkers for being too profligate, and by the biggest police manhunt
in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   Son of Sam, who taunted the police and the press with bizarre
handwritten notes, was, Breslin wrote, the first murderer he knew
of who also understood how to wield a semicolon. Nonetheless, this
was largely a tabloid story, a spine-tingling tale of ordinary
people in the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn who were gripped by fear
of a random stalker and driven to a collective nervous breakdown.
For New York's tabloids, these  &UR; were &LR;  the good old days, maybe the
last of them, the last time a self-perpetuating story routinely
sold hundreds of thousands of additional copies a day.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, Lee was a Morehouse College sophomore home in
Brooklyn with nothing to do but experiment with his new Super 8
movie camera. He produced a home movie, ``Last Hustle in
Brooklyn,'' and returned to Morehouse that fall to declare his
major as mass communications.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The good old days' _ I sound like an old geezer,'' Lee said
in an interview. ``Today, it's cleaner, the air's better, the
schools are worse, the cops are worse, there's more guns.'' Crime
is down, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Summer of Sam,'' the killings are, fittingly, the backdrop
against which a fictional story of love, hate and alienation plays
out. Fittingly because the .44-caliber killer's rampage, too, was
splattered across a much bigger canvas. As city editor of The Daily
News then, my job was to digest the daily mayhem and blast it on to
the front page.
</P>
<P>
   A Sense of Stability, But Not for Long
</P>
<P>
   After the go-go years of Mayor John V. Lindsay's administration,
New Yorkers cherished a modicum of stability under his successor,
Beame. But that momentary stability was rudely shattered when
Beame, an immigrant and a product of the by-now dysfunctional
Democratic machine, found himself having to order the first
municipal layoffs since the Depression. After allowing the city to
borrow beyond its means for years, banks suddenly shut the spigot.
</P>
<P>
   Naysayers were ascendant.
</P>
<P>
   Hulking skeletons of half-built schools stood as grim reminders
that spending on public works had evaporated. To save on overtime,
firefighters were dispatched to blazes in dial-a-cabs to relieve
those ending their shifts. Tuition was imposed at the City
University of New York. ``Planned shrinkage'' of city amenities was
suggested so that what remained of the city might be more
manageable. And Americans shunned the place they loved to hate,
prompting the immortal Daily News headline: ``Ford to City: Drop
Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   A brief outbreak of boosterism fueled by the nation's
bicentennial celebration and the hoopla surrounding the first
Democratic National Convention held in New York in 52 years _ a
convention that would nominate Gerald Ford's successor _ produced
an artificial euphoria in 1976. But, arguably, the city never fully
recovered its self-confidence until 1980, when Edward I. Koch, who
defeated Beame in 1977, rallied New Yorkers to meet the challenge
of a transit workers strike. (It was also Koch who, confronted by
an elderly woman who urged him to ``make it like it was,''
acknowledged the limits of nostalgia: the good old days were never
as good as we remember.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was a different time. New York was a different place.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Ritchie, played by Adrien Brody, personifies
another transition: the psychosexual liberation of a pre-AIDS
generation. He is shunned by former friends in a largely
Italian-American section of the Bronx not only for daring to be
different, but for doing so in another neighborhood. In Manhattan,
yet. ``Saturday Night Fever,'' which opened that same year, ended
with John Travolta realizing that he had outgrown Bay Ridge,
Brooklyn. He headed for Manhattan, which was synonymous with hope.
In ``Summer of Sam,'' the weird worlds of Manhattan's Studio 54,
CBGB's and Plato's Retreat seem less like a brave new world to Mira
Sorvino and John Leguizamo than an alien planet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, when the blackout struck, ``Superman'' fortuitously was
being filmed at the Daily News building. The newsroom was bathed in
generator-powered klieg lights, which made it more difficult than
usual to distinguish between fantasy and reality. When the director
introduced himself, Michael J. O'Neill, the paper's editor, was
appreciative but unfazed. ``I've got a lot of actors pretending to
be journalists working for me, too,'' he said. The Daily News had
only recently been diagnosed as suffering, like Son of Sam, from a
split personality. It was seeking to retain those loyal blue-collar
readers who hadn't already fled to the suburbs while also appealing
to other New Yorkers who might have ordinarily considered the paper
too lowbrow. We were aiming to be irreverent, but respected. Not
respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Rupert Murdoch landed in New York and overnight
transformed the chronically ailing New York Post from the city's
real old gray lady of journalism into a scandalous ingenue. He
challenged The Daily News to a duel to the death. Thanks to the
insatiable ego of newspaper publishers, the duel has lasted longer
than anyone would have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism On a Rampage
</P>
<P>
   Another transition was going on, too. The clatter of typewriters
(one of which I actually saw thrown during a fight in The Daily
News) was giving way to the tap of computers, which imposed a
disorienting silence. (To compensate, the keyboards were outfitted
to emit a beep when a key was struck; it was quickly disconnected
because the newsroom chirped like an overstocked aviary.)
</P>
<P>
   Screaming headlines could still shatter the silence, though.
</P>
<P>
   That summer's journalistic excesses were judged harshly by some
critics, who even suggested that the overheated tabloid and
television coverage may have incited Son of Sam, although he had
already struck several times before he was publicly identified that
March as a serial killer. But the terror was palpable, and ``Summer
of Sam'' reproduces it with chilling intensity. Responding to the
killer's presumed preferences for women with long dark hair, many
women wore their hair up or dyed it blond. Young couples shunned
discos because they thought the killer targeted disco denizens. The
police waved away cars from lovers' lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Breslin was the only journalist who received a letter from Son
of Sam, though several other columnists appealed to the killer to
surrender to them instead. (The Daily News experience with people
giving themselves up was spotty. One slow Sunday a few months
earlier a conscience-stricken fugitive showed up at the Daily News
offices to turn himself. Nobody wanted him.) The police visited The
Daily News several times to fingerprint everyone who had handled
the letter so detectives could isolate Son of Sam's prints. That
raised a disturbing question: If the police couldn't take
fingerprints from volunteers under ideal conditions, how were they
going to get the killer to cooperate?
</P>
<P>
   We tried to be as helpful as possible. We analyzed the letter
from every angle, finally, hoping to elicit any clue, even printing
a picture of the postmark. Clues were few. Sam, some sort of father
figure, according to the killer, was a 6,000-year-old man
(inspired, as it turned out, by his 64-year-old Yonkers neighbor)
who spoke to him through a dog (a black Labrador whose name in real
life was Harvey).
</P>
<P>
   The police analyzed lyrics from a 1967 Jimi Hendrix album that
might have inspired Son of Sam, and even considered comparing the
handwriting on motor-vehicle applications by white men between the
ages of 20 and 30 until detectives discovered that 250,000 people
fit that description in Queens alone. Everybody, including a local
organized crime boss whose failure to protect the neighborhood from
disorganized crime was costing him respect, had his list of
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   From Tragedy To Absurdity
</P>
<P>
   The capture of the .44-caliber killer that August prompted
understandable relief, not just because Son of Sam no longer posed
a threat, but because of who he wasn't. In the film, Spike Lee
plays a television news reporter who ventures into a black
neighborhood for the ``darker perspective.'' He interviews a woman
who, echoing the emotions of members of ethnic and racial groups,
expresses relief that the killer wasn't black. In real life, a news
radio headline blaring from the radio of a taxi the morning after
the arrest prompted the driver, presumably still shaken by the
city's fiscal crisis, to ask my wife: Why would a young man not
only transform himself into a killer, but also jeopardize a secure
civil service job in the Post Office?
</P>
<P>
   After the arrest of David Berkowitz, tragedy degenerated even
further into farce. The tabloids outbid each other for old letters
from Berkowitz to his girlfriends. (The Daily News paid $200 for
one batch of letters and published them before The Post, which had
paid $500.) One defense lawyer peddled taped interviews with his
client. And a psychiatrist who had probed Berkowitz's canine
delusions concluded, paraphrasing Freud, ``Sometimes a dog is just
a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer, like the film, didn't end that year until October. The
assorted characters who constituted the Yankees somehow got it
together and won the World Series, thanks to the sixth game heroics
of Reggie Jackson. He wore number 44.

AUSTRIA REFUSES TO CEDE KLIMT PAINTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five important paintings by Gustav Klimt plundered by the Nazis
and claimed by their Jewish owners' descendants under a new
Austrian law will not be returned, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Austria's restitution commission rejected most of the
arguments made by the heirs of Adele and Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer. The
commission did agree that 16 Klimt drawings and 19 porcelain
settings should be returned to the Bloch-Bauer descendants, who
live in the United States and Canada, and postponed a decision on
``Portrait of Amalie Zuckerkandl,'' another Klimt painting they
claim.
</P>
<P>
   E. Randol Schoenberg, a lawyer for four of the five Bloch-Bauer
heirs, said he was disappointed. ``Even in the beginning, we had
our doubts about the resolution in Austria to do the right thing,
but we also always had hope, based on all the nice pronouncements
made at the time the law was passed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg asked Elisabeth Gehrer, the Austrian culture
minister, to disregard the commission's ruling or ask it to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Heidimarie Glueck, her spokeswoman, said that Mrs. Gehrer could
not legally overrule the commission, but added that the heirs could
take the case to the Austrian courts.
</P>
<P>
   Told of this response, Schoenberg said, ``If the only way we can
get a fair hearing is to go to the courts, it's something we will
have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Now worth tens of millions of dollars, the paintings include
Klimt's ``Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I,'' one of his best-known
works. The case is complicated because Mrs. Bloch-Bauer, who died
in 1925, had asked her husband in her 1923 will to give the five
paintings to the Austrian National Gallery after his death. But
Bloch-Bauer, who died in exile in 1945, left them to his family.
His descendants contend that his wife's will was only a request,
not legally enforceable, and that he would never have donated
anything to Austria after the Nazis seized his property.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the family agreed to donate the works to Austrian
museums in exchange for export licenses for some 30 other
paintings. ``It was evident that there was a bargain for the
drawings and the porcelain,'' said Rudolf Wran, the head of the
commission, but not the paintings.

   Wran said the commission had resolved two other cases, returning
a vast trove of Old Master paintings and objects to the Austrian
branch of the Rothschild family and a smaller collection of works,
including a painting by Gentile Bellini, to the Lederer family. So
far, it has two other cases to consider.

AFTER 2 YEARS, `ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS' SHOWING SIGNS OF WEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ This former British colony passed its second year
under Chinese rule Thursday, and to a growing number of critics
Hong Kong is taking on a disquieting resemblance to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
   As Hong Kong prepared for the commemoration, highlighted by the
unveiling of a Reunification Monument next to its futuristic
Convention Center, there is mounting concern that it is losing its
image as an oasis in freewheeling China, one where the rule of law
prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong was supposed to be a semiautonomous region
within China for 50 years after the handover _ under the
Chinese-British agreement known as ``one country, two systems'' _
recent events suggest that the one country is rapidly subsuming the
two systems.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, Beijing overruled a Hong Kong court on a landmark
immigration case, using a legislative mechanism that deeply
troubled legal experts but was requested by the territory's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, the U.S. Senate had passed a bill that
stipulated that Hong Kong be treated like the rest of China in
exporting American technology with military applications. The move
was in response to a congressional report on military espionage and
China in which Hong Kong was portrayed as a staging ground for
smuggling technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hong Kong doesn't constantly bang away at the differences
between it and China, the rest of the world is going to start
treating them the same,'' said Michael DeGolyer, director of an
academic project that surveys attitudes about Hong Kong's return to
China. ``If that happens, Hong Kong is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   That Hong Kong's autonomy should be threatened is no surprise,
said academic experts, lawyers and democracy advocates. Before the
handover, many people had predicted that no treaty between Britain
and China would be a match for the ineluctable march of Chinese
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first year after the change, worries that China would
meddle were obscured by the Asian financial crisis, which plunged
this prosperous enclave into its worst recession since World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   China largely stayed out of Hong Kong affairs, leaving the local
government to battle rising unemployment, a swooning stock market
and currency speculators. Now, though, as the economy begins to
recover, worries about Hong Kong's rule of law and autonomy are
resurgent.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal by Beijing of the Court of Final Appeal here was
its first overt interference in the Hong Kong legal system. The
Chinese government was acting at the behest of the local
authorities, who feared that the ruling would open the door to more
than one million immigrants from mainland China. But critics said
the decision could a set a precedent for Beijing to overturn any
unpopular ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of law is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's success,'' a
democracy advocate, Emily Lau, said. ``If we don't have the rule of
law, then we're just another Chinese city.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, Ronny Tong, said:
``I'm an optimist, and I would like to think this is a one-off
situation. But the government keeps giving out mixed signals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong Justice Secretary Elsie Leung has refused to rule out
asking Beijing to intervene in future court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   But the No. 2 official, Anson Chan, said Wednesday that
Beijing's action ``was an exceptional decision made in exceptional
circumstances.'' Mrs. Chan, who had just returned from a trip to
the United States and Canada, said officials there had expressed
doubts about Hong Kong. Among the skeptics was Rep. Christopher
Cox, R-Calif., who led the committee that investigated accusations
that China had acquired military secrets from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Mrs. Chan, Cox said he was concerned that
China could divert technology from Hong Kong by smuggling it across
the border on trucks that belonged to the Chinese army, which has
maintained a garrison in Hong Kong since the change in government.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chan said Cox had accepted her invitation to visit Hong
Kong to inspect its customs procedures. But she conceded that he
was not alone in harboring doubts about the separation between Hong
Kong and China.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong has not been helped by a recent Chinese government
decision to bar U.S. military planes from landing here. That
extends a ban imposed on American warships. Experts said China was
sending a chilly message in the aftermath of the bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Although China is entitled to take such action, analysts said it
simply reinforces the perception that Hong Kong _ two years later _
is in danger of becoming an afterthought rather than an exception.

LITTLE VIOLENCE, BUT MUCH TALK, FOLLOWS KURD LEADER'S DEATH
SENTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Fears that violent rampages would follow the
death sentence given to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan on
Tuesday have so far proved unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   No incidents were reported in Turkey, where police remained on
alert but daily life proceeded normally. In Diyarbakir, the largest
city in the mainly Kurdish southeast, about 1,000 soldiers in
civilian clothes marched through the streets shouting slogans
against Ocalan and his insurgents. No clashes were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kurds staged demonstrations in several European cities and in
Australia, but none escalated into serious violence. In Germany,
which is host to the world's largest community of Kurdish exiles,
there were several arson attacks on Turkish restaurants and travel
agencies in the pre-dawn hours. One man was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The relative calm was a sharp contrast to the fatal violence
that broke out in several European cities after Ocalan's capture in
February, and to the brief but deadly terror campaign that rebel
sympathizers launched in Turkey soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and commentators had unanimously predicted that
Ocalan would be sentenced to death, so the decision was no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan said during his trial that he wanted to help promote
peace, but warned that violence could grow if he is executed.
Before that can happen, his sentence must be upheld by an appeals
court, the Turkish Parliament, President Suleyman Demirel and the
European Court of Human Rights. The process could take a year or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kurds have nothing to gain by doing anything violent at
this point,'' said a foreign diplomat posted in Istanbul. ``They
certainly didn't gain much by the last spasm a few months ago. But
that doesn't mean they don't have the ability to do anything. They
launched some operations in March that killed a number of people
and wiped out tourism in Turkey. If they decide the time is right,
now or in the future, they can still do a lot of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said Wednesday that they would ask the European
court to order an immediate halt in the Turkish appeal process.
They said their client's rights were violated by the way he was
captured and the conditions of his detention.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the decision on whether to hang Ocalan will be made
by what one newspaper columnist referred to as ``the all-powerful
state establishment.'' That was understood to be a euphemism for
the military command, which maintains an unofficial veto over key
security decisions here.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish newspapers devoted their entire front pages Wednesday to
the sentence with jubilant headlines like ``This Is Justice!'' and
``Death Penalty: The Executioner Is Sent to the Executioner.'' Many
front pages featured images like a large noose, a mutilated infant
said to represent Ocalan's savagery, and cheering relatives of war
victims waving Turkish flags and hugging each other after the
sentence was announced.
</P>
<P>
   News commentators continued to suggest that commuting Ocalan's
sentence might be wise. ``I wonder whether sentencing him to life
in tight confinement would not be a heavier punishment than hanging
him,'' one columnist wrote. Another asserted, ``Turkey should
combine this victory with steps that will resolve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan said in his testimony that he and thousands of other
Kurds were driven to rebel against Turkish rule by their
frustration over restrictions placed on their cultural life,
especially those that limit use of the Kurdish language. The
government says his movement is no more than terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   European governments reacted to the verdict with strong and
unanimous appeals that Ocalan not be executed. Wednesday,
newspapers in many European countries endorsed this view.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ocalan alive, political solutions, though they may be
difficult, are always possible,'' the conservative Spanish daily El
Mundo said in an editorial. The Swedish paper Dagens Nyheter said
that keeping Ocalan alive would deprive militant Kurds of ``a
martyr and an inspiration for further violence.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading German paper, Suddeutsche Zeitung, said it was
encouraged by Turkey's willingness to be guided by the European
Court of Human Rights. ``If Turkey is ready to turn its greatest
problem over to a European court,'' the paper said, ``then there
can only be one reply: placing Turkey on the list of candidates for
membership in the European Union.'' Joining the union has been a
longtime goal of the government.

HILLARY CLINTON PLANS CAMPAIGN SWING TO TARGET GOP STRONGHOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will devote the
maiden campaign swing of her Senate race to targeting traditional
Republican strongholds across upstate New York, campaign aides said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to visit five communities in four days after
notifying the Federal Election Commission next Tuesday that she is
creating an exploratory committee to raise funds for her Senate
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign to succeed
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said the first lady
deliberately chose central New York and the Albany area to begin
her summer-long ``listening tour'' with small groups of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a great place to start,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a kickoff campaign statement, said: ``I'm eagerly
looking forward to listening to New Yorkers and hearing directly
what's on their minds about the issues affecting their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Present plans call for Clinton to officially announce her
candidacy later this year. Her ``listening tour'' for the remainder
of the summer constitutes the second-phase of a year-long
exploratory effort that has already taken the first lady to New
York state 12 times since January, including a house-hunting trip
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The predominantly rural upstate area being visited by Clinton
hosts traditional GOP strongholds represented in Congress by
nine-term Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-N.Y., as well as Democratic
bastions such as Albany, N.Y., represented by six-term Rep. Michael
R. McNulty, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   This region is critical for any statewide candidate because it's
a swing region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton launches the next phase of her Senate campaign amid
mounting GOP criticism of her use of Air Force jets on campaign
trips to New York.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson announced that he will visit four
upstate cities on Thursday _ Elmira, Albany, Rochester and Buffalo
_ to challenge Clinton's unreimbursed use of Air Force executive
jets for her travels thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxpayers should not foot the bill for her campaign forays to
New York,'' Nicholson said in a statement, adding that the
Republicans' tour ``will send a clear message _ `Pay your bills,
Mrs. Clinton, and quit making the taxpayers pick up the tab.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson defended Clinton's use of Air Force planes, saying her
trips are ``wholly appropriate and completely consistent with her
activities as first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   FEC guidelines require a Senate or House candidate who uses a
government plane to reimburse the treasury for the hypothetical
commercial airfare for the itinerary _ not the actual cost of
operating the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Using that formula, Clinton will begin reimbursing the treasury
the required share of her future campaign travel once she has
established her exploratory committee, aides say.
</P>
<P>
   By launching her so-called ``listening tour'' at Moynihan's farm
at Pindars Corners, a crossroads where Moynihan has an office in a
19th century schoolhouse office, Clinton will be able to saturate
upstate media markets. Her four-day swing will take her by
motorcade and small plane to Oneonta, Cooperstown, Utica, Syracuse,
and Albany before returning to the nation's capital on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster who has served as a strategist for
Republican New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, says upstate New York
will be the most important battleground for the 2000 Senate race in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstate is the key to the race,'' says Luntz, who is urging
Giuliani to seek the Senate seat, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Republicans are underestimating her,'' Luntz
says. ``Republicans who assume she's going to crumble, if and when
she officially announces, are foolish. She will be much stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz says a crucial swing constituency in a Clinton-Giuliani
contest would be the ``3 M Bratwurst Moms'' _ middle-aged, middle
income, white ethnic moms who live in the upstate region. Such
voters have voted Republican in the past, but have defected to
Democrats in the last two elections.
</P>
<P>
   These voters ``should be a Hillary Clinton voter, but at this
point it is the one group of women who aren't necessarily behind
her,'' says Luntz, who helped then-Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
mastermind the 1994 congressional campaign manifesto ``Contract
with America'' that helped Republicans take control of the House
and Senate for the first time in 40 years.

<P>
   Clinton, the first first lady in history to seek elected office
while in the White House, trails Giuliani statewide, 50 percent to
40 percent, according to the latest public opinion survey, a Zogby
International poll completed Monday. Giuliani showed strength in
the suburbs where he reaps 63 percent of the hypothetical vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won 55 percent of likely voters in New York City
compared to Giuliani's 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may get a boost from a possible GOP primary battle that
could pit Giuliani against four-term Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., in a
Republican primary in September 2000 _ barely two months before the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton beats Lazio, 47 percent to 31 percent in a hypothetical
race posed in a Luntz survey completed on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also can count on considerable Democratic financial
support for a race that could cost $20 million. Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., a Clinton ally, announced Wednesday that the
national Democratic Senate Campaign Committee that he heads this
year has already raised $12 million _ almost a 50 percent boost
over what had been raised at a comparable period in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming Clinton, Torricelli said that Democrats'
recruitment of ``top tier candidates'' is playing a part in
achieving record fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said he hopes to raise $60 million to help Democrats
win Senate races in 2000. Republicans now control the Senate,
55-45.
</P>
<P>
   Antipathy to Clinton runs high across New York, according to
Luntz' survey, with 44 percent of Giuliani's support coming from
anti-Clinton voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already have the most polarized electorate in the country
for a Senate race,'' Luntz said. ``Hillary is the deciding factor.
Voters are determining who they are voting for by what they think
of Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's challenge is to ``let the people of upstate New York
who could care less about New York City _ let them know what he has
done down in new York and tell them he could also do that in
Washington,'' Luntz said.

DEMOCRATS URGE REOPENING OF AMNESTY APPLICATION PROCESS FOR 350,000
IMMIGRANTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Led by Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, several
congressional Democrats called Wednesday for allowing tens of
thousands of illegal immigrants who have lived in the United States
for almost two decades to seek amnesty from deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The drive is aimed at reopening the amnesty application process
for an estimated 350,000 immigrants who were late filing paperwork
because of a misinterpretation of the 1986 Immigration Reform and
Control Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effects of the current provisions have been devastating,''
said Jackson Lee, a Democrat. ``Late-amnesty individuals are losing
their work permits and this is causing hardships for families and
communities around the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation sponsored by Jackson Lee would allow the
late-amnesty applicants to appeal Immigration and Naturalization
Service rulings to the federal courts and would encourage the
agency to settle the cases. No hearing has been scheduled in the
House on her bill.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1986 act, immigrants who had lived illegally in the
United States since Jan. 1982 were allowed to seek amnesty from
immigration laws and to remain in the country legally.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the one-year application period, the INS
determined that definitions used when turning away some
amnesty-seekers were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Many who subsequently reapplied were denied again for not
meeting the deadline. These so-called late-amnesty applicants were
denied legal resident status and faced deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits were filed and, in 1996, the Supreme Court eventually
sided with the immigrants and blocked efforts to deport them while
the INS and lower courts reconsidered the cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Supreme Court decision, the Republican-led
Congress enacted legislation sponsored by GOP Reps. Henry Hyde of
Illinois and Lamar Smith of Texas, barring the immigrants or their
advocacy groups from seeking help from the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These hard-working, taxpaying individuals and their families
have increasing fears of deportation and separation,'' said Rep.
Bob Menendez, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, D-Ill., said the late-amnesty applicants
are not seeking government benefits. ``We are not asking for
generosity,'' he said. ``We are asking for fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who chairs the House immigration subcommittee, is not
inclined to change the 1996 law. ``He feels to change it would
encourage illegal immigration,'' said Smith's spokesman Allen Kay.
</P>
<P>
   The change proposed by Jackson Lee and her Democratic colleagues
``would be grossly unfair to those who have sacrificed and waited
their turn to enter the U.S. legally,'' Kay said.

   The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love
</P>
<P>
   by Jill Conner Browne
</P>
<P>
   (Three Rivers Press, $12, paperback)
</P>
<P>
   Ask a middle-aged Southern woman her preference in home decor
and she'll have one major request: The living room should be large
enough to house a throne.
</P>
<P>
   Southern women are raised for thronedom. There are twirling
classes, the Merle Norman lessons, the cheerleader clinics. All
training is aligned toward puberty, when the sweet young things
will blossom into precious womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, we don't all peak at the same time. Many of us reach
tiara status long after we'll ever see a size 6 again. And forget
makeup and rooting for the home team. We don't need no stinkin'
batons.
</P>
<P>
   And so goes the premise for ``The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of
Love.'' These women of a certain age know the world and are ready
to impart their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   This Jackson, Miss., court of self-anointed queens (all named,
appropriately enough, Tammy) sallies forth in tiny sequined shifts,
opera-length white gloves and most important, majorette boots with
tassels.
</P>
<P>
   The Sweet Potato Queens know all that's important in life and
love. They know to avoid men who have been plastically enhanced. Or
toupee-topped. Or who still live with their mamas.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens know that every woman needs five men in her life at
all times to reach nirvana. That would be a man who can fix things,
a man to dance with, a man who can pay for things, a man to talk to
and a man to sleep with. Those men amassed, the Queens can go on to
take care of daily business.
</P>
<P>
   That business would be consuming the four major food groups:
sweets, salt, fried and au gratin. It also means renting a
rock-star bus and having a lingerie-trying-on party in it on the
way to Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   The subtitle of ``The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love'' is ``A
Fallen Southern Belle's Look at Love, Life, Men, Marriage and Being
Prepared.'' Fallen is incorrect. These Southern belles have risen
again and have rightfully taken their thrones.

BROOSE IS LOOSE; LOOK OUT, BIG APPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than a decade as a well-regarded North Texas musician
(first with Tarrant County-based pop poppins, more recently with
his project TOOMuchTV) and with a growing reputation as a painter,
Broose is decamping for New York, fed up with what he says is a
lack of support for the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've drained the well dry here,'' says Broose, 33, whose last
name is Dickinson. Born in San Francisco, he grew up from the age
of 9 in Arlington, Texas. ``I've done as much as I can. I want to
be somewhere that there's more inspiration; you can only go to the
DMA (Dallas Museum of Art) so many times. A lot of people around
here say they're supportive of the arts, and they're really not.
And neither are any of the local publications.''
</P>
<P>
   What he's leaving behind as a musician is a number of fine CDs
with pop poppins, several solo CDs and cassette releases, and the
smart pop-with-lounge-touches of TOOMuchTV's 1997 ``TOOMuch Is Not
Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   What he's leaving behind as an artist is even more interesting.
He works in oils and acrylics, favoring icy blues, deep greens and
blues, and mixing the easily identifiable with curving, rounded,
almost liquid shapes and shadows.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is slightly unsettling, dark and vivid. ``Weathered
Downtown,'' a portrait of a melting Dallas skyline, is instantly
reminiscent of Van Gogh's ``Starry Night;'' other works, such as
``The Emotion Booth'' and ``The Subterranean Stream,'' have an
inky, rich tone.
</P>
<P>
   Several paintings are meant to be viewed while listening to
songs on nearby CD players; the music is gentle acoustic guitar.
Broose says he doesn't know what the connection between his music
and his artwork is, except that he wants both to be
``atmospheric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the weird things about music and art is I have zero
education in music _ all my education went to art,'' says Broose,
who sold the rights to his 1994 solo CD, ``As an Individualist,''
to Dallas Carpe Diem Records for $3,000, which allowed him to study
at the San Francisco Art Institute for several months. ``I know
what I'm doing technically with my art. I play pop music because
it's what I was raised on _ it's simple enough for me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Broose says he plans to do both in New York. He'll try to get
gallery representation and record a second TOOMuchTV CD. Exactly
how he's going to pay the rent and eat, though, is still up in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not expecting to get any attention in New York,'' he says.
``A lot of what I do is based on impulse; I don't worry about it. I
should be able to set up some acoustic shows. Whether or not I
enjoy it, it'll be a positive experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to draw people on the street for $10 or wait tables,
that's fine. I'm going to try to survive up there as long as I can
_ if not, I'll come back. All I know is it can't get any worse.''

BRAVE COMBO TRAVELS OFF THE BEATEN PATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you've hitched up the Winnebago and taken a few cross-country
trips.
</P>
<P>
   Do it on a regular basis for the next 20 years and you'll know
what it's like to be Brave Combo, the ``nuclear polka'' kings from
Denton, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time Grammy nominees, who celebrated their 20th
anniversary last month, have crisscrossed America with their brand
of world music featuring polkas and mambos. They've been to Europe
and Japan, but most of their travels have been on the interstates
and back roads of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people go for the Eiffel Towers of the world,'' said Carl
Finch, the band's founder. ``We try for the more obscure.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not fit the myth of life on the road with a rock 'n' roll
band, but Brave Combo usually takes the road less traveled.
</P>
<P>
   They've developed a philosophy of travel and have found plenty
of undiscovered gems. In Bakersfield, Calif., they found Merle
Haggard's daughter holding court in a karaoke bar. They found Louis
Prima's former sax man, Sam Butera, performing in the Tropicana
Hotel lounge in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   As for hotels, let others have the Waldorf; Brave Combo prefers
the Great Plains Motor Inn in Lincoln, Neb. It's the kind of place
that uses water glasses, not plastic cups, and the rooms are
comfortable whether it's a bitter winter or a scorching summer.
</P>
<P>
   The six-piece band eschews the traditional tour bus for a
nondescript, custom-built GMC truck dubbed ``The Donut.'' The name
is derived from the preferred breakfast food of police and state
troopers around the country. The band hopes that law-enforcement
authorities will be more forgiving if Brave Combo is pulled over
for speeding or other driving violations.
</P>
<P>
   A typical five-day round trip is like the one took last March,
to Minneapolis and back. Along the way, there were stops in Chicago
and St. Louis, ending with an all-night ride through an ice storm
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly flying first-class, but band members have seen
and played at some great national landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   They shared a stage in Central Park with hip country band
BR5-49, played under the Brooklyn Bridge, and had the Pacific Ocean
at their backs while performing on the Santa Monica Pier.
</P>
<P>
   They've seen the Grand Canyon many times and were awed by Utah's
Monument Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, they're still wowed by the Marfa lights in far West
Texas, and they love to take U.S. 281 through the Hill Country to
Austin or San Antonio. They're fascinated with the giant monument
to Texas hero Sam Houston that stands along Interstate 45 outside
Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their favorite offbeat sights include Rock City, a
series of lava formations near Minneapolis, Kan., and Bedrock USA,
a Flintstones-themed amusement park in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cornfields, wrecks, mom-and-pop motels and Red Roof
Inns,'' bassist Bubba Hernandez said. ``And it's cool things like
hiking up Mount Rainier after a gig in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the sights, there is the fun of simply getting there.
</P>
<P>
   Percussionist Joe Cripps remembered a recent episode at an
Arkansas truck stop, where the Donut broke down and the band was
stranded. They encountered people who were eccentric, to say the
least.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two old guys (farmers) were getting diesel fuel and putting it
in milk jugs,'' Cripps said. ``They got in a spat with the lady
running the cash register and were yelling. But one of them looked
over at us and said `What's wrong with y'all?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The irate but helpful farmer looked under the hood, found that
the starter cable was disconnected, fixed it temporarily and told
the band members how to make a permanent repair when they had more
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could probably write a book on road stories,'' trumpet
player Danny O'Brien said. ``It's been like one surreal, strange
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   For Finch, the memories begin in May 1979, driving to shows in a
Honda Civic with a trailer hitched to it. Compare that with last
summer's exotic but frantic trip to Europe, where they played one
concert in Sweden and had to catch an all-night train to Finland 30
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a concert in the late 1980s in Switzerland, when
Hernandez couldn't decide whether the boisterous crowd was cheering
for Brave Combo or preparing to riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played one encore, stopped, then another encore and
stopped,'' Hernandez said. ``By the fourth encore I was pretty
scared. People were stomping their feet. I was beginning to freak,
looking for a way out. After the sixth encore we stopped, and they
were fine. They were shaking all of our hands.''

LEARNING LIFE'S LESSONS IN A GARDEN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.) (For release Thursday July 8)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Did it start with the tale of Jack and his beanstalk?
</P>
<P>
   This glorious idea that we can be saved by a scattering of seeds
and growing green vines that stretch toward the heavens?
</P>
<P>
   Gardening books line the shelves of bookstores, waiting to be
plucked by baby boomers whose back yards have become their private
sanctuaries _ a retreat from corporate pressures, cell phones and
clamoring kids.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban neighbors garden, creating a new tableau for each
season ... impatiens in the summer, azaleas in the spring, mums in
the fall, even a fountain pond with water lilies and giant goldfish
that survive the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Carmona gardens, too, coaxing vegetables and succulents
from the soil of his small yard in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Even more importantly, as director of garden programs at the
Community Environmental Council in Santa Barbara, Carmona nurtures
the hidden, tender soul of teen-agers who have become brittle and
hard.
</P>
<P>
   There is much talk lately of saving our kids.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, says Carmona, we overlook the obvious: giving them
perspective, a sense of worth, appreciation for the preciousness
and fragility of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what's going on,'' says Carmona. ``They're missing
simple things. All kids see are action packed, shoot-em-up
adventures where everything magically comes together and is OK
again. We're just products of our environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Reverence and gentleness emerges in the midst of green, growing
things, Carmona says. Gardens are cool, tranquil spots where
breathing slows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When given the opportunity to garden, they do,'' he says.
``It's not about lecturing to them. They sit down in this garden
and all of a sudden, they start talking about their feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   And the young gardeners become a part of something larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about participation,'' says Carmona of his community
gardening projects. ``They understand that they have a role and a
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lessons to be learned:
</P>
<P>
   Seeds poke tendrils through the dirt, budding ever so slowly.
Watch with patience.
</P>
<P>
   Castoffs often turn into beautiful, thriving plants. Use for
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting flowers keeps a plant blooming. Never give up.
</P>
<P>
   Roots must go deep for times when water is scarce. Find inner
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the human touch that really counts. Life is limited, a
set amount of time. What are your priorities? What do you want to
do with that time?'' Carmona asks. ``Develop a plan around those
priorities so your life has meaning.''

ALEXANDRA STEVENSON RALLIES, ROLLS ON IN PROFESSIONAL DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ If brashness has its virtues, and if
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Pete Sampras won't
mind at all that his was the signature shot Alexandra Stevenson
decided to emulate when she saved a match point against Lisa
Raymond and rallied to a 2-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-2 victory to reach the
Wimbledon quarterfinals in her professional debut.
</P>
<P>
   With an arrogant forehand pass delivered at a full run from the
outer limits of Court 5, the 86th-ranked Stevenson, an 18-year-old
from San Diego, stayed alive and evened the second set tie breaker
at 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say that's my trademark shot; Pete Sampras hits
that shot really well, so at home I practice it a lot,'' said
Stevenson, who also made reference to John McEnroe's 1977
breakthrough run to Wimbledon's semifinal as a qualifier like
herself. ``I've been waiting for this my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson converted the set with a crosscourt forehand return,
lurched out to a 3-0 lead in the third set and with a backhand
return winner at match point, she became just the fourth open-era
qualifier to reach a Wimbledon quarterfinal. There, she'll square
off against the third Open era qualifier to reach the
quarterfinals, 16-year-old Jelena Dokic, who rocked this Slam by
ambushing her role model, Martina Hingis, to become the youngest
and lowest-ranked player to upset a top seed in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's Mirjana Lucic defeated Tamarine Tanasugarn, 7-5, 6-3,
to advance against last year's runner-up, Nathalie Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
   Also into the quarterfinals went second-seeded Steffi Graf, who
completed her rain-interrupted dissection of the qualifier Kim
Clijsters, 6-2, 6-2. Graf next faces Stevenson's buddy and Slam
role model, Venus Williams, a player who reached a Grand Slam final
at the 1997 United States Open on her first campaign. Wednesday
Williams, like Stevenson, had to recover from a wobbly opening set,
but once she did that, the 6th-seed made short work of 17th-seeded
Anna Kournikova, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she was just stronger mentally today,'' said
Kournikova. ``She's a great player; I'm a good player. Women tend
to get nervous more than men, men just play, so probably women's
tennis is a lot about mental toughness. I should have stayed longer
with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' next opponent is the most formidable one in the field,
Graf, the seven-time Wimbledon champion who celebrated her 30th
birthday just after collecting the French Open title, her 22d
career Slam, earlier this month at Hingis' expense. Graf and
Williams are 2-2 in career meetings, none of them at Slams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm definitely ready to compete, and she is,'' Williams
conceded. ``I have to try to get to the semis; I never have
before,'' said the 19-year-old Williams, who got caught up in a
dispute over line calls and suffered a meltdown in her quarterfinal
against last year's eventual champion, Jana Novotna.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson's most problematic moments came after her match. She
arrived at her news conference armed with a prepared statement of
support for her mother, Samantha, who has received media scrutiny
following comments attributed to her about racism and lesbianism on
the women's tour.
</P>
<P>
   While she denied making many of the strident comments,
Stevenson's mother did have a dispute with the WTA Tour on her
daughter's attempt to collect prize money here when her
professional status had not been clarified. Now the teen-ager will
receive at least $80,000 for reaching the quarters. But she said of
her success: ``It's for the glory of the game, not for the money.''

HORMEL'S GAY PARTNER SEES SILVER LINING IN CONFIRMATION BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Timothy Wu, the gay partner of James C. Hormel,
said Wednesday that Hormel's successful 18-month fight to become
the new U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg was a victory for human
rights and for minorities across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Wu said the nation's consciousness was raised by the fight over
Hormel's nomination when a handful of Senate conservatives blocked
the nomination because he is gay .
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that the process was generating very important dialogue
of how do we Americans define equality and what matters most when
you're applying for a job,'' he said. ``I think it has brought the
whole national dialogue on basic human rights forward, that
includes womens' rights, the rights of minorities and ethnic
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Hormel's nomination, fought on a national stage,
inspired an outpouring of public support, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, 66, a San Francisco businessman and philanthropist, heir
to the Hormel meatpacking fortune and former dean of the University
of Chicago Law School, was nominated by President Clinton for the
post in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton bypassed the Senate logjam created by Hormel's
conservative opponents when he gave Hormel a recess appointment
while Congress was not in session. The appointment enables Hormel
to serve as ambassador until the end of this Congress in January
2001, which is also when the Clinton administration leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright administered the oath of
office to Hormel on Tuesday and he plans to leave for Luxembourg
within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Wu said he and Hormel received hundreds of supportive letters,
e-mails and phone calls from people across the country. Wu said it
was ``affirming'' that there was ``such overwhelming support that
people should be judged for a job based on their qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire experience demonstrated that ``your average person
believes in basic human rights for everybody,'' Wu said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Wu said negative comments about homosexuals during the debate
over Hormel's confirmation ``would have been more upsetting or
hurtful or angering if they had resonated with mainstream America.
But they so clearly didn't. Comments like that were made, but fell
on very deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative groups accused Hormel of advocating pedophilia and
incest because he donated $500,000 for what became a wing in San
Francisco's public library that contains books on homosexuality.
Hormel's supporters say he didn't select the contents of the
library and that virtually all the materials can be found in the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Wu said he and Hormel gave each other mutual support on bad days
when the burden of becoming the nation's first openly gay
ambassador seemed especially heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the days that Jim got really down, I would cheer him up and
tell him it's never easy being the first,'' Wu said. ``The first is
always scrutinized more closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel and Luxembourg's current ambassador to the United States,
Arlette Conzemius, have something in common: They are both firsts.
Conzemius is the first woman ambassador in Luxembourg's history.
</P>
<P>
   Wu, 36, the son of Merrill Lynch stockbroker, was born in New
York City, raised in Singapore and Hong Kong and studied political
science as an undergraduate at Princeton University before getting
a Harvard law degree in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation from Princeton, Wu became the youngest person
and the first Asian-American elected to Princeton's Board of
Trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Wu said he worked as a producer for CBS News in New York before
becoming a fundraiser for nonprofit organizations in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After Hormel goes to Luxembourg in the next month, Wu will
relocate to Washington where he will become a White House fellow
for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Wu is one of 16 fellows who will help draft and review
legislation, respond to Congressional inquiries, write speeches and
conduct policy briefings.
</P>
<P>
   Calm and softspoken, Wu said he and Hormel have been partners
for almost four years after they met through their common interest
in philanthropy and nonprofit organizations. Wu is a member of the
board of directors of several organizations concerned with human
rights and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hormel accepted Clinton's 1997 nomination to be
ambassador to Luxembourg, Wu said he and Hormel discussed it at
length, knowing they would both face bitter criticism from
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we thought all along it would have been a cake walk, this
would have been more difficult,'' he said. ``But we went into this
with our eyes open... What we went through was nothing like the
civil rights struggles of the 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu said he and Hormel never lost confidence that, ultimately,
Hormel would get the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through all of this, Jim never gave up on the integrity of the
process,'' Wu said. ``This was the will of the public.''

DAY OF THE LONG GOODBYE AT WIMBLEDON AS BECKER, COURIER DEPART 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ It was the day of the long goodbye at
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Becker's swan song at the tournament that made him a
power-tennis icon ended on a dispirited note with a straight-set
loss to Australia's Patrick Rafter in the Round of 16. Jim
Courier's weather-beaten three-day event against Britain's
sixth-seeded Tim Henman concluded in the local hero's favor with
the American distraught over a botched line call in the
next-to-last game of their 4-hour-30-minute struggle. And
10th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, a three-time finalist who described
himself as suicidal upon losing last year's final to Pete Sampras,
intimated after Wednesday's anemic fourth-round exit to
eighth-seeded Todd Martin that he might not want to expose himself
to this kind of pain again next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the day's most painful bow was taken by Germany's
ginger-haired Becker. First, his serve said goodbye to him, and
then, traumatized by 13 double faults and eight lost service games,
he bid farewell to Wimbledon, and his beloved Center Court, 6-3,
6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does have a presence out there, but his game wasn't really
firing today, and I felt like I couldn't hit the ball much
better,'' Rafter said.
</P>
<P>
   The nonsentimental Rafter admitted he didn't ``really care''
that he'd spoiled Becker's last hurrah: ``I don't feel bad for
beating him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the quarterfinals, Rafter faces Martin, who downed
Ivanisevic, 7-6, (7-3), 6-3, 6-4; and Henman meets the unseeded
Cedric Pioline, who ousted 13th-seeded Karol Kucera, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6
(7-5), 4-6, 6-3. Henman is now the sole Briton left in the hunt
following Greg Rusedski's 2-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 6-1 collapse
Wednesday against seventh-seeded Mark Philippoussis, Sampras'
quarterfinal opponent. Sampras delivered 20 aces in his 6-3, 6-4,
6-2 rout of Canada's Daniel Nestor.
</P>
<P>
   Becker had handled Rafter in two previous encounters, but both
of those victories occurred before the Australian distinguished
himself as a Grand Slam artist to be reckoned with _ not to mention
a latter-day Becker of sorts with his acrobatic serve-and-volley
technique _ by winning back-to-back U.S. Opens in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Becker was victimized by a slew of vicious passing
shots and managed just eight aces himself. In fact, he seemed to be
at odds with the very weapon that earned him the sobriquet ``Boom
Boom'' on these lawns and made him a three-time champion (1985,
1986 and 1989) and four times a runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no timing on my serve at all, almost throughout the
whole match,'' Becker said. ``Every time I served it was a
struggle, and for my part, it was very unfortunate that I wasn't
able to give him and the crowd a better match for my last match.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his Wimbledon match record stands at 71-12 and his 116-25
record on grass remains the best of any active player, including
the five-time Wimbledon champion Sampras. And a proprietary Becker
has called Center Court his birthplace ever since he stormed
unseeded to the 1985 championship at 17.
</P>
<P>
   After saving one match point with a service winner but
surrendering the second with a misguided backhand half-volley,
Becker made his last bow in the direction of the Royal Box. Its
occupants marked the 31-year-old's official retirement from the
Grand Slam stage by joining the commoners in giving him a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an incredible ride,'' Becker said. ``I'm thankful I
was able to have the chance to come back and play decent tennis and
now its time to go do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker had originally retired from Slam strife at Wimbledon in
1997, when he fell to Sampras in the quarterfinals and told the
stunned winner he was quitting during their netside handshake.
Becker decided to play one last Wimbledon when he realized that,
with a second child on the way in August, he would be quitting the
tour altogether this summer to concentrate on his family.
</P>
<P>
   The 61st-ranked Courier, now 28, briefly quit tennis last
summer, but he was lured back by the prospect of playing Davis Cup,
and his decision proved to be felicitous when he upset both Henman
and Rusedski in the first round at Birmingham in April, a coup that
enabled the United States to host Australia in the second round at
Longwood Cricket Club next month.
</P>
<P>
   But Courier's inspiring campaign here at Wimbledon, where he
reached the Round of 16 for the first time since his run to the
final in 1993, ended with Wednesday's 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 9-7
defeat to Henman. The match had been halted by rain Monday evening
with Henman ahead by 4-3 in the third set and was further delayed
by Tuesday's washout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, he's probably as strong as they get,'' Henman said,
``and for me to beat him 9-7 in the fifth is very satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Courier Wednesday, Henman showed his mettle by erasing
three match points at 5-6 of the fifth set with a spurt of
brilliant serving. An ace down the middle saved the third match
point, and a perfect copy of that ace earned Henman the game for
6-6. Then, Courier came unglued in the 15th game of the set when
Henman's apparently wide backhand approach volley was ruled in,
creating a break point that Henman converted for 8-7. During the
changeover, Courier flung a cupful of ice backwards over his
shoulder and also received a warning for foul language, but his
tantrum, and the match, ended quickly when Henman held at love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like calls affecting the outcome of matches, but they
do, and it's a fact of professional tennis, and I should have
finished the match before and then I wouldn't have had to worry
about it,'' said Courier, who felt the Monday postponement helped
him ``in that it cooled Tim off, because he was playing ... it was
like an alien abduction out there, someone invaded his body and
turned him into the greatest volleyer in the universe. And today he
came back on earth a little bit, which was nice.''

HILLARY CLINTON PLANS CAMPAIGN SWING TO TARGET GOP STRONGHOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will devote the
maiden campaign swing of her Senate race to targeting traditional
Republican strongholds across upstate New York, campaign aides said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to visit five communities in four days after
notifying the Federal Election Commission next Tuesday that she is
creating an exploratory committee to raise funds for her Senate
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign to succeed
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said the first lady
deliberately chose central New York and the Albany area to begin
her summer-long ``listening tour'' with small groups of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a great place to start,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a kickoff campaign statement, said: ``I'm eagerly
looking forward to listening to New Yorkers and hearing directly
what's on their minds about the issues affecting their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Present plans call for Clinton to officially announce her
candidacy later this year. Her ``listening tour'' for the remainder
of the summer constitutes the second-phase of a year-long
exploratory effort that has already taken the first lady to New
York state 12 times since January, including a house-hunting trip
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The predominantly rural upstate area being visited by Clinton
hosts traditional GOP strongholds represented in Congress by
nine-term Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-N.Y., as well as Democratic
bastions such as Albany, N.Y., represented by six-term Rep. Michael
R. McNulty, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   This region is critical for any statewide candidate because it's
a swing region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton launches the next phase of her Senate campaign amid
mounting GOP criticism of her use of Air Force jets on campaign
trips to New York.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson announced that he will visit four
upstate cities on Thursday _ Elmira, Albany, Rochester and Buffalo
_ to challenge Clinton's unreimbursed use of Air Force executive
jets for her travels thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxpayers should not foot the bill for her campaign forays to
New York,'' Nicholson said in a statement, adding that the
Republicans' tour ``will send a clear message _ `Pay your bills,
Mrs. Clinton, and quit making the taxpayers pick up the tab.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson defended Clinton's use of Air Force planes, saying her
trips are ``wholly appropriate and completely consistent with her
activities as first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   FEC guidelines require a Senate or House candidate who uses a
government plane to reimburse the treasury for the hypothetical
commercial airfare for the itinerary _ not the actual cost of
operating the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Using that formula, Clinton will begin reimbursing the treasury
the required share of her future campaign travel once she has
established her exploratory committee, aides say.
</P>
<P>
   By launching her so-called ``listening tour'' at Moynihan's farm
at Pindars Corners, a crossroads where Moynihan has an office in a
19th century schoolhouse office, Clinton will be able to saturate
upstate media markets. Her four-day swing will take her by
motorcade and small plane to Oneonta, Cooperstown, Utica, Syracuse,
and Albany before returning to the nation's capital on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster who has served as a strategist for
Republican New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, says upstate New York
will be the most important battleground for the 2000 Senate race in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstate is the key to the race,'' says Luntz, who is urging
Giuliani to seek the Senate seat, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Republicans are underestimating her,'' Luntz
says. ``Republicans who assume she's going to crumble, if and when
she officially announces, are foolish. She will be much stronger.''

   Luntz says a crucial swing constituency in a Clinton-Giuliani
contest would be the ``3 M Bratwurst Moms'' _ middle-aged, middle
income, white ethnic moms who live in the upstate region. Such
voters have voted Republican in the past, but have defected to
Democrats in the last two elections.
</P>
<P>
   These voters ``should be a Hillary Clinton voter, but at this
point it is the one group of women who aren't necessarily behind
her,'' says Luntz, who helped then-Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
mastermind the 1994 congressional campaign manifesto ``Contract
with America'' that helped Republicans take control of the House
and Senate for the first time in 40 years.

   Clinton, the first first lady in history to seek elected office
while in the White House, trails Giuliani statewide, 50 percent to
40 percent, according to the latest public opinion survey, a Zogby
International poll completed Monday. Giuliani showed strength in
the suburbs where he reaps 63 percent of the hypothetical vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won 55 percent of likely voters in New York City
compared to Giuliani's 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may get a boost from a possible GOP primary battle that
could pit Giuliani against four-term Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., in a
Republican primary in September 2000 _ barely two months before the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton beats Lazio, 47 percent to 31 percent in a hypothetical
race posed in a Luntz survey completed on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also can count on considerable Democratic financial
support for a race that could cost $20 million. Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., a Clinton ally, announced Wednesday that the
national Democratic Senate Campaign Committee that he heads this
year has already raised $12 million _ almost a 50 percent boost
over what had been raised at a comparable period in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming Clinton, Torricelli said that Democrats'
recruitment of ``top tier candidates'' is playing a part in
achieving record fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said he hopes to raise $60 million to help Democrats
win Senate races in 2000. Republicans now control the Senate,
55-45.
</P>
<P>
   Antipathy to Clinton runs high across New York, according to
Luntz' survey, with 44 percent of Giuliani's support coming from
anti-Clinton voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already have the most polarized electorate in the country
for a Senate race,'' Luntz said. ``Hillary is the deciding factor.
Voters are determining who they are voting for by what they think
of Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's challenge is to ``let the people of upstate New York
who could care less about New York City _ let them know what he has
done down in new York and tell them he could also do that in
Washington,'' Luntz said.

LAWMAKER QUESTIONS INS ON RELEASE OF SUSPECTED KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of a House panel demanded Wednesday
that Attorney General Janet Reno explain why Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials had released suspected serial
killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, who remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of lives that could have been prevented,'' said
Rep. Lamar Smith, head of the House Judiciary's immigration
subcommittee. ``It's time for the Department of Justice to explain
how that could happen and what they are going to do to prevent it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, INS officials acknowledged that Resendez-Ramirez was
deported to Mexico on June 2 after earlier being captured by Border
Patrol agents for illegally crossing into the United States near
Santa Teresa, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has said it was unaware that Resendez-Ramirez, 39, was
wanted for questioning in three killings in Texas and one in
Kentucky when he was detained on June 1. He is suspected in at
least two slayings in Texas and two in Illinois after he was
deported.
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said the Justice Department's
inspector general would investigate the release. INS is a part of
the Justice Department and it oversees the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Resendez-Ramirez case has raised serious questions about
INS' knowledge of the case and procedures used in encounters with
Resendez-Ramirez,'' Meissner said in a statement. ``These issues
include why Resendez-Ramirez had multiple entries in the (INS
computer) system and was not detained and whether INS knew about
Resendez-Ramirez's criminal activities after being contacted by
local law enforcement earlier this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said the agency also would conduct an internal audit to
review ``the effectiveness of our current systems in an effort to
avoid any similar situation in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, R-Texas, said Resendez-Ramirez's release could have been
prevented if the INS computer identification system were connected
to the FBI's National Crime Information Center's database, which
allows law enforcement authorities to determine whether a person
has a criminal history or is wanted for a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The INS system _ called IDENT _ contains information such as
fingerprints and photographs of illegal immigrants who are detained
by INS officials. The system was developed in 1994 to track illegal
border crossers and became widely used between 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the system is primarily a database about how many times a
person has illegally crossed the border, it does contain some
criminal background information, according to Meissner.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents also have access to the FBI's crime
database through a separate system but do not routinely run a check
on all of the 1.5 million illegal immigrants who are detained along
the U.S.-Mexico border each year.
</P>
<P>
   When people are detained by INS for illegally crossing the
border, their fingerprints are entered into the system for
identification. Before the system was installed, those caught
crossing the border illegally routinely used aliases.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez was detained by Border Patrol agents in Texas
and New Mexico nine times between January 1998 and June 1999,
according to records obtained by Smith's office. Smith said a
person must illegally cross the border about 10 times before his or
her case is referred for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez is a suspect in the deaths of:
</P>
<P>
   _ Christopher Maier, 21, in Lexington, Ky., on Aug. 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dr. Claudia Benton, 39, of Houston, on Dec. 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife Karen, 47, in Weimar,
Texas, on April 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ Josephine Konvicka, 73, of Fayette County, Texas, on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   _ Noemi Dominguez, 26, of Houston, on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   _ George Morber, 80, and his daughter, Carolyn Frederick, 52, in
Gorham, Ill., on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Resendez-Ramirez travels by freight train
because the deaths all occurred near train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year officers investigating Benton's killing found
fingerprints on his car and sent them to the Texas Department of
Public Safety, which later matched the prints of Resendez-Ramirez.
The FBI issued a warrant for his arrest on May 27.

AD AGENCY CONSOLIDATION CONTINUES WITH HOLLAND-INGALLS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Continuing a wave of industry consolidation, the fifth
largest ad agency in Massachusetts, Holland Mark Martin Edmund of
Boston, said Wednesday it has agreed to buy the fourth largest
agency, Ingalls of Boston, for an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal is completed, New England's four largest ad
agencies will have been sold within the last two years, said Skip
Pile of Pile and Co., a Boston consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Bill Davis, a new agency that will be
known as Holland Mark Edmund Ingalls projects combined annual
billings of $180 million and revenues of $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there will be layoffs, Davis said: ``It's
premature to get into that because we're just beginning the due
diligence process. We may have to eliminate positions because of
overlap. But the long-term goal is to build a bigger agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two agencies employ about 180 people.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency's combined list of clients includes Citizens
Financial Group, The Boston Globe, T.J. Maxx, and USTrust.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last two years, New England's three largest ad
agencies _ Arnold Communications, Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos,
and Mullen _ have been bought by huge communications giants looking
to offer global clients a wide range of services from Web site
marketing to traditional advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the chief owners of the region's three biggest shops
were nearing retirement age, and selling their agencies was a way
for them to cash out their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Such considerations were not a part of the Ingalls deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a rapidly changing environment, large ad agencies and tiny
boutique agencies can thrive, but the middle ground is fast
becoming inhospitable terrain _ especially for independent agencies
without access to additional resources.
</P>
<P>
   Such agencies are too big for small clients and too small for
big clients that have bulked up on acquisitions of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The middle is no place to be,'' said Adweek New England editor
Judy Warner, who reported a few weeks ago that Ingalls was shopping
itself around.
</P>
<P>
   The booming economy has meant explosive growth for big agencies
such as Arnold and Hill Holliday, but ``both Ingalls and Holland
Mark have been struggling a bit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Times have indeed been challenging for Ingalls. Raytheon Co. has
taken most of its ad business elsewhere. Two top officials left.
Looking for a boost, Ingalls recently restructured.
</P>
<P>
   Given Ingalls' troubles, speculation on the deal's price tag was
all over the map, ranging from $3 million to $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   By combining forces, Holland Mark and Ingalls hope to offer
clients the best of both worlds _ the size and resources of a large
agency along with the nimbleness and the higher level of client
service that are the advantages of a small agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked ourselves, `In what ways can we continue to build our
clients' brands and do it smarter and better?' We needed more
resources to do that,'' said Davis, 41, before referring to the
proposed Ingalls deal. ``This positions us for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one plus one equals three situation,'' said Ingalls
chairman Bink Garrison, 51.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison will hold the title of chairman at the new agency and
report to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the dream job _ to work with clients, to work on new
business, and to work in the community,'' Garrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to be determined is where the new agency will be housed.
Ingalls is based in South Boston; Holland Mark occupies a Back Bay
building owned by an investment group that includes Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Each agency has different strengths. Holland Mark evolved into
an ad agency from a background of direct marketing. (Its sister
company, database marketer TPC of Burlington, will not be a part of
the union of Ingalls and Holland Mark.)
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls has more of a national reputation, and Garrison has a
higher profile in the Boston business community than Davis.
</P>
<P>
   One added bonus for Holland Mark: It was in danger of losing its
USTrust account after Citizens, an Ingalls client, recently
announced plans to buy USTrust. Now there's a good chance the
business will be handled by Holland Mark Edmund Ingalls.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1911, Ingalls has gone through many reincarnations. Its
acquisition by Holland Mark is simply the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Said consultant Pile of the proposed union of Holland Mark and
Ingalls, ``This is healthy for both companies.''

TOUR DE FRANCE RACE DIRECTOR LETS VIRENQUE BACK IN RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Two weeks after he banned almost 20 riders and officials
in hopes of producing a Tour de France of renewal and redemption,
Jean-Marie Leblanc, the race's director, admitted failure
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beaten,'' he said at a news conference called to
announce that the bicycle race would admit Richard Virenque, a
French star, and Manolo Saiz, a Spanish team official, as ordered
Tuesday by the governing body of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blow by the International Cycling Union,'' which is
known as the UCI for its initials in French.``We have been
prevented from completing our attempt to restore the image of the
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a failure,'' Leblanc said. ``But it is not a failure we
are going to accept. We are going to try and correct it legally.''
</P>
<P>
   With the race scheduled to start Saturday in western France, he
said that Virenque would participate.
</P>
<P>
   Virenque was the leader of the nine Festina riders who were
expelled from the last Tour after team officials admitted to a
systematic program of using illegal performance-enhancing drugs.
Six of the riders said they had engaged in doping, but Virenque was
one of three riders who have denied knowingly using the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Frenchman, who now rides for the Polti team in
Italy, is still under formal investigation in that case, which
nearly scuttled the race as riders protested police tactics in
investigating doping. Virenque was also questioned by the Paris
narcotics police in another drug scandal in May.
</P>
<P>
   Hugely popular among female teen-agers , Virenque has been
widely mocked in print and on television for his repeated denial of
charges against him documented by his former trainer, team doctor
and team director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing against Richard Virenque as a man,'' Leblanc
said Wednesday. ``We simply said that his name and image are the
incarnation of doping and that's why we excluded him.''
</P>
<P>
   Virenque's presence is certain to be controversial with fans,
even though 60 percent of those questioned in a recent French poll
said that he should be allowed to ride the Tour. He was its top
climber from 1994 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last three winners of the Tour will be absent in the
180-man field, Virenque becomes a favorite now.
</P>
<P>
   Will Leblanc shake his hand and congratulate him if he wins this
86th Tour de France? ``Ask me in three weeks,'' the race director
replied.
</P>
<P>
   After he was banned June 16, Virenque and his team appealed to
the UCI, whose disciplinary commission reversed the decision on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It based its order on a little-noticed clause that says teams
must be invited to a race at least 60 days before it starts. Since
the Tour named its first entries on May 12, which was 51 days
before Saturday's start, those teams were technically invited
illegally. Therefore anybody banned was technically uninvited
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding vexed, Leblanc noted that the Tour had used the same
selection date for the last 10 years and nobody ever objected.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to discuss the political infighting implicit in the
UCI order. ``I accept the term snub, but it is not a U-turn'' in
the fight against doping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we can have a great Tour de France, clean from
the business that polluted it last year. We're convinced that
things are heading in the right direction and we're going to
demonstrate that in the Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc said it would not have been possible to stage the race
while defying the UCI order. As he pointed out, the organization
furnishes judges, timers and other officials, while authorizing the
points for victories that riders covet in salary negotiations.
Also, Leblanc said, ``We're lawful.''
</P>
<P>
   The banning of Saiz, the director of the ONCE team, was not
related to a drug scandal, although he was questioned in the
Festina affair. The Spaniard was punished because of crude remarks
characterized by Leblanc as ``insults to the race and the country''
he made when he withdrew his team last year to protest actions by
the French police.
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc's news conference was held after a major sponsor, French
bank Credit Lyonnais, said it was considering an end to its
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep supporting a Tour, which has been wonderful for
many years,'' a bank spokesman said. ``We will keep supporting a
Tour which is attempting to restore its image.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the Tour cannot restore its image, we will pull out.''
The bank will decide after the race, he added.

COCA-COLA ESTIMATES LOWER QUARTERLY SALES DUE TO EUROPE RECALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing the recall of its soft drinks in Europe in June _ the
biggest in company history _ Coca-Cola Co. estimated Wednesday that
its beverage sales fell 1 percent to 2 percent in the second
quarter compared with sales in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the company's European division, which includes
Belgium, France and other countries where Coke was ordered off
store shelves after a contamination scare, are expected to fall 6
percent to 7 percent, the largest drop in any of Coke's six global
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly damaging blow that occurred as a result of the
recall,'' said Skip Carpenter, a beverage analyst for Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, adding that before the recall began June 14,
``their Continental Europe business was seeing some good momentum
in a lot of markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Other markets appeared unimpressive, too. In the United States,
typically Coke's star performer, sales are expected to be flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volume trends for the quarter reflect the difficult global
economic conditions that remain in many key markets,'' the company
said in a statement. ``In addition, during the month of June, the
company has experienced a negative impact on sales in several
countries within the Greater Europe Group as a result of the recent
temporary product withdrawal in Belgium and France.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola did not say how much the sales drop would affect
earnings in the second quarter. Profit was already expected to
fall, to 41 cents a share from 47 cents a share in the quarter a
year earlier, according to First Call Corp., which tracks company
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has been mired in a bad year, with profit already down
for two consecutive quarters. Starting last August, the company's
sales declined in many of its biggest markets around the globe,
including Germany, Japan and Brazil, largely because of economic
downturns. That slowdown has also affected some of its large
bottlers, which have posted gloomy results, too. In the United
States, a price increase in many stores has caused sales to drop
off.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by Coke to buy additional brands to expand its overseas
business have been stymied by regulators in Europe, Mexico and
Australia. In addition, fears that Coke's products were
contaminated, which arose after hundreds of people in Belgium
complained of nausea, dizziness and other symptoms after drinking
Coke and Fanta, led to government-ordered recalls of an estimated
15 million cases of drinks in Belgium, France and Luxembourg. Three
factories in Europe were shut until the bans, which went into
effect June 14 and June 15, were lifted June 23.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, mold was discovered inside bottles of Bonaqua, a
mineral water sold by Coke, and that brand was recalled in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The volume declines were expected by Wall Street, which reacted
positively to the news. Shares of Coca-Cola rose 81.25 cents, to
$62, on a day when the rest of the market advanced smartly.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it expected its volume in Latin America to be
flat or down 1 percent, compared with 12 percent growth in the
second quarter of last year. In Africa, which grew 18 percent in
the second quarter of last year on a small base, volume is expected
to fall 1 percent to 2 percent, the company said. The company's
Asian and Middle Eastern business, which grew 7 percent in the
second quarter last year, is expected to decline 1 percent to 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola chairman and chief executive M. Douglas Ivester said
in a statement that ``the worst is behind us'' and predicted
improvement in the second half of the year and next year.

BUSH TOPS $36 MILLION IN FUND-RAISING RACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush has raised an
unprecedented $36.2 million for his Republican presidential
campaign, making him the undisputed winner in both parties of the
White House money race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's four months of fund-raising collected more money than any
presidential candidate in U.S. history has raised in their race for
a party's nomination. Bush now has raised about twice as much money
as all seven of his GOP presidential nomination opponents combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am humbled by the response. I am amazed, amazed at the
outpouring of support,'' Bush said during a Los Angeles news
conference. ``This is a campaign that has a wide range of people
who are willing to help. I am gratified.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has raised twice as much money as Vice President Al
Gore, the Democratic front-runner, who reported collecting about
$18.5 million. His lone challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley,
raised about $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans will always do better than Democrats'' in raising
money, Gore said Wednesday, ``but out ideas and policies had more
support from the American people. And that will be the case again
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the eventual Republican nominee in 1996, had raised
what was then a record $13.58 million by this time in his election
cycle. By the time the Republican primaries were over in 1996, Dole
had raised $31.3 million. Dole, of course, lost to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised $29 million during the year and a half leading up
to the Democratic Party's nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Steve Forbes spent $37 million in his unsuccessful
1996 Republican primary bid, but that was his own money. Forbes,
who is running again now, has raised $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it into a race for vice president,'' University of
Texas government professor Bruce Buchanan said of the Republican
primary field.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reminded reporters that his father, former President Bush,
lost his 1992 re-election bid just 11 months after receiving a 92
percent favorable rating in public opinion polls. Bush said he is
taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money doesn't win. It's a pretty good start,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush jokingly said the fund-raising was due to his ``wonderful
personality.'' But he added that Americans are ``hungry for
something,'' a better and less divisive future.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign finance chairman, Don Evans, said the
fund-raising demonstrates a true groundswell of support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country that is starved for a leadership they can
trust,'' Evans said. ``These are dollars from the hearts of people
who love this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said more than 75,000 contributions were raised by 2,500
volunteers who pledged to raise $10,000 each. But Evans said that
alone would not have raised this kind of money since Bush first
formed his exploratory committee March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he will decide sometime next month on whether
to take federal matching funds. A candidate who accepts federal
matching money is bound by state-by-state spending limits as well
as a total primary spending limit of about $48 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those spending limits could put Bush at a competitive
disadvantage against a self-financed candidate like Forbes who
would not be bound by the limits. While Bush might be equal to
Forbes in total money, the spending limits would give Forbes the
advantage in states like Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal matching fund system also gives some of Bush's
opponents incentive to stay in the race despite his major
fund-raising advantage. If Bush's opponents have qualified for
federal matching funds, they may want to stay in the race until
after they collect their money next January.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, signaling the financial competition between them, on
Wednesday demanded that Bush give back all the campaign funds that
came from special-interest political action committees. Bush
campaign staff members said they had not yet sorted through the
money to determine how much PAC money they had raised.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, former American Red Cross president and wife of
the 1996 GOP nominee, said Wednesday that she definitely is running
for the Republican presidential nomination next year. Her
exploratory committee has raised about $3.4 million so far, about
one dollar for every 10 that Bush has collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just that he (Bush) is garnering an enormous amount
of money, which he is,'' said Rice University political scientist
Bob Stein. ``He's also making it difficult for the other candidates
to even get to the starting line, and it's not clear they ever
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign reported that the contributions, which are
limited to a maximum of $1,000 a person, came from people in all 50
states. Texas accounted for 30 percent of all the contributors. The
average donation was $480.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Bush's campaign fund led to questions about whether
the American system of political finance has caused the public to
believe the system is corrupting.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to have to develop a level of public trust
with anyone in public office. That's what leadership is about,''
Bush said. ``If people think candidates can be corrupted by $1,000
contributions then they shouldn't vote for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he favors several campaign finance reforms, including
instant contribution disclosure on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best policy for campaign reform is to let the sun shine
in,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's nearest Republican rival in fund-raising, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona with $4 million, campaigned Wednesday in New
Hampshire on the need for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that there is no room for this issue in
Republican primaries. I intend to make room for it,'' he told about
200 cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wants to ban soft money, the donations from unions,
corporations and individuals that do not fall under federal limits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed banning soft money from labor unions and
corporations, but not from individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent Wednesday raising even more money for his campaign in
Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco. He also attended a
program honoring teachers in Los Angeles and a youth mentoring
program in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign enjoyed several lighter moments Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush discussed meeting movie star Warren Beatty on Tuesday
night in a closed meeting with Hollywood big shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's secretly in love with my mother,'' Bush said in
reference to former first lady Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shook his (Beatty's) hand and said, 'Hi, I'm George W.' He
said, 'I'm Bulworth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty earlier this year starred in the comedy as Bulworth, a
U.S. senator from Los Angeles who has arranged his own murder and
decided to tell the truth about American politics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush also had a brief statistical clash with Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush likes to say in his speeches that he is ready to be
president because Texas, if it were a separate country, would have
the world's 11th largest economy. But in introducing Bush at the
Virginia Road Elementary School, Riordan announced that Los
Angeles, if a separate country, would have the world's 11th largest
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Mayor, you and I have got to have a little discourse about
whether Los Angeles is the 11th largest economy in the world,''
Bush said. ``I think you meant 12th.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush also again defended his recent series of mistakes in the
names of countries and their peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I mispronounce the name of a country doesn't mean
I don't understand how to lead,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What America is going to have to be comfortable with is: Do I
know how to set clear goals. Do I know how to lead, and do I shoot
straight. That's all I know how to do.``

IN A GATHERING TWILIGHT, CLINTON CONTINUES TO PUSH HIS AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Conn., Ill.) (gm) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Two days ago, a local politician introducing President
Clinton at a fund-raising luncheon in Westport, Conn., said that
Clinton was entitled to a ``victory lap'' of public valedictories
as he completes his final 18 months in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton bristled at his host's well-meaning remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I'm on a victory lap or a final lap,'' Clinton
told the crowd of contributors, a smile disguising his impatience
with those ready to write him off. ``They're beginning to talk to
me as if I'm _ there is a sort of ring of eulogy about all of this.
As far as I can tell, I'm reasonably healthy. I still show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this about Bill Clinton: He will not go gentle into
political oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six days, he has given a major domestic policy
speech laying out his priorities for the next year, conducted a
75-minute endurance test of a news conference and announced that
his budget team had found an additional trillion dollars in federal
surpluses over the next 15 years. He also unveiled the most
sweeping set of proposals for remaking Medicare in the program's
34-year history, which he pitched to senior citizens here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called on Republicans in Congress to set aside
partisanship and embark with him on a ``season of progress'' on
Medicare and Social Security, education, gun control, health care
and campaign financing. Clinton said the public is pleading for at
least a temporary truce in the partisan bickering and rancor that
have characterized his six and a half years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Clinton and the Democrats are at least as
responsible as the Republicans for the capital's polarization.
Clinton now wants progress on his agenda _ and his legacy _ and
says he is willing to compromise with the GOP on taxes in order to
get it.
</P>
<P>
   He swears that he is serious about wanting to get things done
before presidential politics and congressional campaigns swallow
Washington's energy. Responding to Republicans who doubt his
sincerity _ and even some in his own party who would prefer to run
their campaigns against a do-nothing Republican Congress _ Clinton
said there is a still a narrow window for bipartisan agreement on
critical national issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, some other people here really believe that because the
presidential season has already started, the battle for Congress
has already started, even though it's a year and however many
months away, that the best politics is just to run out the clock
and wait until the next election and hope that the country is doing
so well and we enjoy the lazy days of summer so much, nobody will
notice,'' Clinton told a group of students at Georgetown University
on Friday. ``I don't agree with that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech at the White House on Tuesday detailing his
Medicare proposal was similarly suffused with the spirit of sweet
reason. He hailed the participation of several Republican leaders,
saying ``their presence here today indicates that we can all raise
concerns about each other's ideas without raising our voices.'' He
said ``it augurs well for this announcement today and for the
welfare of our republic.''
</P>
<P>
   But inside that velvet glove of accommodation was the
president's mailed fist of partisan aggression. Clinton said that
the nation's leaders had not only an opportunity but an
``obligation'' to remodel Medicare for the onslaught of the baby
boom generation early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The clear message is that if Clinton's health care plan is
rejected or weakened, it will be the fault of the parsimonious
Republicans who prefer to give the nation's economic bounty to the
wealthy, in the form of cuts in capitals gains and estate taxes,
rather than to the deserving elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's health and education plans follow a familiar pattern:
He proposes generous new programs that poll well with the public
and challenges Republicans to act on them.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, with Medicare. Polls show that a subsidized
prescription drug benefit is extremely popular with the public and
the new budget surplus projections afford Clinton the luxury of
proposing it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was warmly received here Wednesday when he pitched his
Medicare proposal to an audience of several hundred senior citizens
at the Chicago Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the audience, Frances Krause, 79, expressed hope
that the president can persuade Congress to pass his Medicare
proposal, or at least the prescription drug part of it. But Mrs.
Krause, a registered Republican who often splits her votes between
the two parties, said that Republicans may try to block the plan to
prevent Clinton from getting credit for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he's for they're against,'' she said.

   BUSH-FUNDRAISING (Los Angeles) _ George W. Bush, shattering
presidential fund-raising records, raised $35.5 million in the
first six months of 1999, nearly 10 times as much as his closest
Republican rival and millions more than Vice President Al Gore.
Bush's fund-raising prowess has virtually dried up the pool of GOP
money for his rivals. Bush, at a news conference in Los Angeles,
says his campaign is still counting donations and termed the $35.5
million figure a ``minimum number'' after a fund-raiser in

   DETECTIVE-INDICT (Denver) _ Using deception and a network of

ended up in the hands of everyone from the tabloid press to a
reputed member of the Israeli Mafia. James Rapp, 39, and his wife,
Regana Rapp, were indicted last Friday on two counts each of
racketeering, in a case that is the first known criminal
prosecution against the growing business of peddling confidential
information. The couple face up to 24 years in prison a $1 million

FILM REVIEW: THE LOVERS ON THE BRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 4 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Leos Carax's deliriously romantic, prohibitively
expensive ``The Lovers on the Bridge'' has been hung up on the
other side of the Atlantic for some eight years. But now, with a
``Martin Scorsese Presents'' credit attached, this art film to end
all French art films can finally be seen in America.
</P>
<P>
   It was well worth the wait. Even in its direst depictions of
Paris' lower depths, there's a stunning, classic compositional
sense to practically every frame (the cinematographer, Jean-Yves
Escoffier, went on to shoot ``Good Will Hunting''). And the
virtuoso sequences _ water skiing down the Seine as Bastille Day
fireworks explode and sparkle, a shadowy night tour of a fine art
gallery, the tiled walls of a Metro station ablaze with flaming
posters _ simply steal your breath.
</P>
<P>
   And the film's main location, the Pont Neuf, Paris' oldest
bridge, is itself a wonder to behold. Not because it's a minor
architectural masterpiece in a city full of major ones, but because
it's an utterly convincing replica, complete with blocks' worth of
surrounding urban banks, that was built on a lake in Montpellier.
</P>
<P>
   As for the film's story, it incorporates just about every great
theme of French cinema into an archetypal ode to the marvelous
madness of love. The saving, killing, healing, hurting,
disorienting, disturbing, deluding, creative, confusing and
confounding powers of passion are Carax's subjects, and he
orchestrates them into an intoxicating _ yet somehow credible _
symphony of transcendent emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Lavant plays Alex, a barely functional addict who lives on
the bridge _ which has been closed to traffic for a two-year
retrofitting _ with an older bum, Hans (Klaus-Michael Gruber). One
night, Michele (``The English Patient's'' Juliette Binoche), an
artist who's going blind, squats on one of ``their'' benches. Hans
wants the interloper to leave immediately; Alex, quite rightly,
sees her as a potential lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed she is for him, and he becomes hers as her condition
deteriorates. Despite the degradation of their hand-to-mouth
existence, they have terrific fun with one another and share
immensely tender moments. They remain chaste, too, partly because
of Michele's obsession with a lost lover and partly because of a
secret she's keeping. The film's cockeyed, squalid updating of
courtly love somehow resonates deeply, and the unlikely purity of
it makes the lovers' climactic, unavoidable betrayals ring with
extra notes of poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are as accomplished as the film's formal
elements, with Lavant ranging from near-catatonia to the kind of
self-interested and self-sacrificing extremes only deep human
connections can inspire. Binoche's exquisite instincts for just how
much feeling should be displayed or held back in any given
situation get a real workout here, and she's up to the task as
Michele ricochets from despair to hope to resignation to cold
calculation. It's Binoche's richest work ever, on a par with her
performance in Krzysztof Kieslowski's ``Three Colors: Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Carax has only made one other feature since 1991, ``Pola X,''
which recently received a cool reception at the Cannes Film
Festival. It's easy to imagine his aesthetic and romantic fancies
flying out of control. But they reach a kind of unique, perfect
pitch in ``Lovers'' that, indeed, may not be repeatable. Genius and
madness, as often as they are lumped together, almost never achieve
such a sublimely coordinated union. &QL;

AIRBUS ACCUSES BOEING OF STARTING ANOTHER PRICE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As cat fights go between global giants, it does not get much
better than the current one between Boeing Co. and Airbus
Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, on the last day of the Paris Air Show, Boeing
announced a surprise deal to buy 17 of Airbus' top-of-the-line,
wide-body jets from Singapore Airlines in order to sell 10 new
Boeing 777s to the carrier. Airbus was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Wall Street analysts at a hastily called meeting in
New York on Wednesday, John Leahy, senior vice president and
commercial director of Airbus, called the move ``an act of
desperation'' and accused Boeing of reigniting a costly price war
between the two airplane makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're preparing our counterattack at the present time,'' he
said, adding, ``I don't want to predict what our response will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The harsh words raised fears among some Wall Street analysts of
a return to the fierce price cutting that took place in the
mid-1990s and ultimately proved ruinous to the earnings of both
Boeing and Airbus, a consortium of four European companies.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts played down the prospect of a new price war,
saying that Airbus was simply trying to divert attention from the
embarrassment of seeing a prestige customer abandon its airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious loss when a big and valuable customer takes one
of your product lines and ejects it from their fleet,'' said Joseph
Campbell, an aerospace analyst at Lehman Brothers. ``The analysis
goes: either it was a really attractive financial deal or I really
don't like your airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy clearly wants the world to believe it was the former.
</P>
<P>
   Even Boeing acknowledges that its decision to buy the 17,
four-engine Airbus A340-300s, which carry a list price of $135
million each, was unusual. But it said that it had agreed to buy
the planes in 1995, when Singapore Airlines placed an order for 34
777s with options for 43 more.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said that Boeing would have a hard time making a profit
reselling the airplanes, but Boeing spokesman Sean Griffin
disagreed. ``It's not a loss leader,'' he said. ``We will be
looking to make money on this deal.'' He added that Singapore
Airlines would try to sell the planes itself and that Boeing was
the buyer of last resort, much like a car dealer taking a trade-in.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines spokesman James Boyd said the carrier bought
the 265-passenger A340s in the early 1990s when they were the only
plane that size with the range to fly from Asia to North America
and Europe. Now, the twin-engine 777, which began flying in 1995,
makes more sense on those routes, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said that Singapore Airlines was still committed to its
order for five of Airbus' new longer range A340-500 jet, which is
scheduled to be introduced in 2002 and will be able to fly nonstop
from New York to Singapore. But many analysts now say that Boeing
might trump Airbus again with a new, long-range 777 that it is
expected to announce later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to disperse any cloud that might be gathering over the
A340, Leahy told analysts that he expected to announce two or three
new orders for the airplane by the end of the summer. Indeed, the
South American carrier Lan Chile is close to placing a firm order
for seven of the jets, according to an industry executive.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said that airlines had asked Airbus to buy their Boeing
777s so they could buy A340s. ``We cannot make a good business case
for doing that, and we always assumed our competitor couldn't make
a good business case either,'' he said. ``I think we see him buying
market share here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell of Lehman Brothers was doubtful a new price war was
in the offing. ``My view is that Singapore is a special customer,''
he said. `` I don't believe that Airbus will respond in kind, and I
don't believe that Boeing will do a lot more of this.''

GOVERNMENT ISSUES GUIDE TO ENDING SOCIAL PROMOTION AT SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Thursday will
recommend some practical steps to school administrators on how to
end social promotion, the practice of passing academically troubled
students to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley will unveil the guide,
``Taking Responsibility for Ending Social Promotion,'' at a visit
to an elementary school here. The 72-page booklet lays out some
strategies for insuring that students get the help they need and
don't find themselves in the 10th grade not knowing how to read or
do simple arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   The guide suggests:
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing summer school for students who fail to meet the
academic standards of each grade level.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offering after-school programs, homework centers and
year-round schools to help kids who are falling behind.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keeping younger students together with a teacher for more than
a year to build bonds that enhance learning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Setting out clear academic standards for students and their
families and communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social promotion is not good for children,'' Riley told
reporters at a breakfast meeting. ``We always had high standards
for some children. But now we're talking now about high
expectations for all children, high standards for all children.
That's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The booklet will go 15,900 school districts plus about 1,100
education organizations and state education officials, Education
Department spokeswoman Julie Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the practice of promoting poorly performing
students is a response to stories about children who reach high
school and even graduate without mastering basic educational
skills, including reading and writing.
</P>
<P>
   Ending social promotion is one of few areas of education where
Democrats and Republicans agree. President Clinton talked about the
ill effects of social promotion in his State of the Union address.
And in May, Clinton unveiled an education plan that included giving
states four years to end social promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is part of Clinton's goal of adding 100,000
teachers to reduce class size in the early grades.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also oppose social promotion. Texas Gov. George
Bush, the early front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, spoke out against social promotion this year and won a
$173 million appropriation to help Texas public schools end the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republicans differ with Democrats on what Washington's
role should be. The Clinton administration wants to make federal
education dollars to states contingent on those states doing away
with social promotion. The administration also proposes spending an
extra $800 million for remedial programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to include ending social promotion as an option
for states receiving an estimated $13 billion in federal aid to
education. In the debate over reauthorizing the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act taking place in Congress, Republicans want
to dispense the money in block grants that states could spend for
any educational purpose they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Ten states already have explicit policies forbidding social
promotion. Last year, the California Legislature approved a law
requiring school districts to hold back children who don't meet
specific academic criteria and provide them with summer school to
get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   In 2003, New York will require all its high school students to
obtain a regents diploma in order to graduate. Earning the diploma
requires passing rigorous state exams and is tougher to obtain than
a locally issued diploma with less stringent requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Houston, executive director of the American Association of
School Administrators, said that ending social promotion is a moot
point since virtually no school district in the nation has a policy
specifically approving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes great politics,'' he said. However, he praised the
administration for seeking to provide more money for remedial
programs.

weirdos who thought Son of Sam was a generation of ``surface to air

FORMER PRIME MINISTER TO HEAD RUSSIA'S GAS MONOPOLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Cementing the relationship between the Kremlin and big
business, Viktor Chernomyrdin was installed Wednesday as chairman
of Russia's biggest company, the natural gas monoply Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   The move returns the former prime minister, who recently served
as Moscow's envoy to the Balkans, to the company where he began his
career.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives President Boris Yeltsin and his allies greater
influence over a lucrative company and potential source of campaign
funds during the coming political year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chernomyrdin is considered to be loyal to Yeltsin and his
family,'' said Andrei Piontkovsky, a leading political analyst.
``He may not channel financial flows to the family. But he will not
allow Gazprom to channel them to coffers that are not approved by
the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Housed in a towering skyscraper in Moscow, Gazprom has long been
one of Russia's most powerful and mysterious companies.
Paradoxically, its political influence has increased with the
collapse of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   While many of Russia's banks and holding companies were hurt by
the financial crash, Gazprom has gained. As a result of the
devaluation, its natural gas exports have become even more
profitable. Gazprom announced a $475 million profit on gas exports
for the first quarter of 1999, a three-fold increase compared with
last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, last years' economic crisis swept away many of
the economic reformers who were trying to force Gazprom to be more
open about its financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Boris G. Fyodorov, who served as Russia's chief tax collector
before last August's devaluation of the ruble, clashed with
Gazprom's chief executive, Rem Vyakhirev, over Gazprom's failure to
pay back taxes. Fyodorov even moved to seize the company's
property.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fyodorov is no longer in the government, and company and
government officials collegially negotiate the amount of tax
Gazprom will pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is kind of feudal relationship,'' Piontkovsky said. ``The
amount of tax that is paid is determined, not by law, but by ad hoc
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's interest in Chernomyrdin's new appointment was
clear on Tuesday when Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and Aleksandr
Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff, came to Gazprom's
headquarters on the eve of the shareholders' meeting. The Russian
government holds a 38 per cent stake in Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who led Gazprom before he was picked as prime
minister in 1992, was elected Wednesday as chairman of the company
by a new 11 member board.
</P>
<P>
   Vyakhirev, the previous chairman will retain his seat on the
board. He will also continue to serve as the company's chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Russia commentators on Wednesday painted Chernomyrdin as a
counterweight to Vyakhirev, who was deemed to be too politically
untrustworthy by the Kremlin. Russia is bracing for parliamentary
elections in December and presidential elections next summer. And
there has been speculation in Moscow that Vyakhirev might throw his
support behind Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   While Luzhkov has been trying to position himself to succeed
Yeltsin, he has been stoutly resisted by the Kremlin, which is
looking to groom its own candidate, possibly Stephasin.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent slight, the government even refused to give the
mayor permission to take a poltical trip by helicopter to nearby
farms, saying the flight plans had not been submitted in time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Natural gas is not the only monopoly where the Kremlin has moved
to solidify its control. Last week, Voloshin was named chairman of
United Energy Systems, Russia's electrical utility. Anatoly B.
Chubais, the former pro-market Kremlin aide, who remains as adviser
to Yeltsin, is president of the utility.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision will give Chernomyrdin more of a political
base. He has his own party, Our Home is Russia. But he is too
unpopular to mount a serious bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin is often been lampooned as a wooden and
inarticulate speaker. And his role in bringing an end to NATO's war
with Yugoslavia has earned him the enmity of many nationalists and
left-wing legislatures, who complain that he was too supportive of
the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chernomyrdin is in a position to help other candidates
and forge alliances with stronger politicians. And he has indicated
that he would keep his hand in politics in his new position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot and will not mark a retreat from active politics,''
Chernomyrdin said this week.

JOHN &AMP; KEN GET EARLY SLOT ON RIVAL STATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a couple of guys who have to get up for work
long before even the crack of dawn, John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou
seem pretty upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Known to legions of listeners simply as John and Ken, the talk
team debut today at a new station in a new time slot. Kobylt and
Chiampou helm the new 5-to-9 a.m. morning show at venerable talk
outlet KABC-AM (790) after five years in afternoons at crosstown
rival KFI-AM (640).
</P>
<P>
   ``We did mornings in New Jersey for a couple years,'' Chiampou
said. ``That's how we started. Mornings is a better time for us,
because we can hop all over the place in terms of topics, little
stories to world stuff. Morning listeners are ready for a grab bag
of subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the KABC morning slot had been occupied for
almost 25 years by another Ken _ Ken Minyard. Minyard _ and his
co-host Peter Tilden _ were let go last year when KABC's new
management didn't see ratings improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that was a great opening,'' Kobylt offered. ``It was
the first time since 1973 that the KABC morning show was open. When
I first heard last year they were interested in us, I thought
mornings would be a great move.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair have signed a four-year contract with KABC, with
bonuses for increasing the station's 35-to-54 demographic.
</P>
<P>
   Chiampou said the early time slot wouldn't mean any drastic
changes to a current events-oriented talk formula that gave KFI
sturdy ratings and a substantial revenue stream for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real competition is (KFI morning host and former
colleague) Bill Handel now,'' Chiampou said from his South Bay
home. ``Taking away some of the audience we left at KFI is the big
goal for our first year at KABC.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kobylt is looking forward to ``going up against
the big guys,'' meaning Howard Stern, Don Imus, Mark &AMP; Brian, Rick
Dees and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to a point in my life where I wanted to do mornings in
Los Angeles,'' said Kobylt, 38, a father of two. ``We had a good
long run at KFI, and you want to do different things at different
times in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting up might take some getting used to. Kobylt says he must
rise for the new gig at 3 a.m., at least an hour before his
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a nasty horrible person in the morning,'' he admits. ``I
need an hour in the house, otherwise I'm going to be an unpleasant
person to work with. That extra hour at home is for everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   As for show topics, Kobylt said the 5-to-9 a.m. shift gives the
team a chance to get on a story before it has the appearance of
being ``pretty chewed over'' by afternoon drive-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of being first on something in the morning,''
he said. ``I'd rather be first in line to take our crack at
something than wait until 4 p.m.'' &QL;

   DAYS-BEFORE-THEATER (Modena, Italy) _ ``The Days Before: Death,
Destruction and Detroit III'' was originally conceived as a piece
about the Apocalypse, and its 12 scenes are filled with bizarre
imagery and stylized movement. Each includes an excerpt read by the
actress Fiona Shaw from Umberto Eco's novel ``The Island of the Day
Before,'' the texts seemingly unrelated to the onstage action.
Robert Wilson, who conceived, designed and directs it, calls ``The
Days Before'' ``a celebration of humanity.'' Originally
commissioned by the Lincoln Center Festival, it will have its world
premiere in New York on Wednesday. By Anne Midgette. (Moved).

   ASSAYAS-FILMS (Paris) _ Olivier Assayas is someone who believes
in spontaneity and openness to the world. One of the most
significant talents among the new generation of filmmakers working
in France, he is known for his mobile, often handheld, camera style
and for his probing explorations of young people's lives. Assayas'
new film, ``Late August, Early September,'' which opens on
Wednesday, is a loosely structured, evocative depiction of a group
of thirtyish Parisians who are drawn together by the untimely death
of a slightly older writer friend. The film, shot in the spring of
1998, has proved to be Assayas's most successful in France so far,
winning praise last fall at both the Toronto and New York film
festivals. By Laura Winters. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-BALLET-DANCE (Undated) _ Going forward by looking back
may be bad advice, but American Ballet Theater has danced better
and better the more it has concentrated on the past _ a
19th-century repertory. Four of the seven full-length ballets in
the company's recent season at the Metropolitan Opera House were
French and Russian classics created more than 100 years ago. The
20th century did intrude, chiefly through the questionable transfer
of Kenneth MacMillan's ``Anastasia'' (1971) from the Royal Ballet.
To see Ballet Theater at its best, however, was to see it in
``Giselle'' and ``La Bayadere.'' By Anne Kisselgoff. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BORIS-GODUNOV-OPERA (New York) _ Modest Mussorgsky wrote ``Boris
Godunov'' twice. The first version, composed at white heat in 1868
and 1869 to a libretto adapted from Pushkin, comprises seven
tableaux organized into four acts and lasts barely two hours. It
was submitted to the directorate of the Imperial Theaters in 1871.
The directors were impressed but asked for changes, including a
substantial female role. A second ``Boris,'' completed in 1872,
consists of a prologue and four acts, and lasts almost three hours.
Today, at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere, ``Boris'' is often
performed with Mussorgsky's original vocal and instrumental parts.
But what we usually (at the Met, always) hear is a conflation of
1869 and 1872. This results in a panoramic ``Boris'' longer than
either version Mussorgsky composed: an abundance of marvels but,
arguably, not a finished product. By Joseph Horowitz. (Moved). &QL;

   OAR-ALBUM (Undated) _ Alexander (skip) Spence, who died in
April, recorded ``Oar'' in December 1968, an album of songs he had
written in Bellevue Hospital. He produced it himself and played all
the instruments himself. Released on May 19, 1969, ``Oar'' showed
one of the bleakest undersides of the '60s. It was a snapshot of
mental illness, a portrait of bitter isolation in a time of
communal celebration. On Tuesday, Sundazed Music will reissue a
remixed and remastered version of the album with 10 bonus tracks.

<P>
   FRANK-O'HARA-ART (Undated) _ Frank O'Hara proved that friendship
is an art form all its own, as a new exhibition reminds us. The
show, ``In Memory of My Feelings: Frank O'Hara and American Art,''
opens next Sunday at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles
and remains on view through Nov. 14. An appealingly sentimental
affair, it rounds up some 100-odd works by 25 members of the O'Hara
gang _ from canonical Abstract Expressionists (Willem de Kooning,
Franz Kline, Philip Guston) to underrated figurative painters
(Fairfield Porter, Alice Neel, John Button) to celebrated Pop Art
pioneers (Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg) to at least one essential
eccentric (Joe Brainard, who took his cue from comic strips before
giving up art to devote himself full-time to reading Victorian
novels). By Deborah Solomon. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   UNCLE-SAM-ART (Undated) _ Contrary to popular belief, Uncle Sam
wasn't born on the Fourth of July but on Sept. 13, 1766, in
Arlington, Mass. And he had many guises before James Montgomery
Flagg painted a stern, white-haired man proclaiming,
ungrammatically, ``I want YOU for U.S. Army.'' Uncle Sam's namesake
was Samuel Wilson, a meat packer who settled in Troy, N.Y., and
supplied food to American troops during the War of 1812. According
to legend _ and to an eyewitness report published in The New-York
Gazette and General Advertiser in 1830 _ a workman joked that the
letters ``U.S.'' on Wilson's shipping crates stood for ``Uncle
Sam'' Wilson. The anecdote spread and led to the patriotic symbol
now reproduced in political cartoons, advertisements, posters and
fine art. By Sarah Bayliss. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   LA-REBUILD-ARCH (Los Angeles) _ Seven years after the Los
Angeles riots shook Southern California and the world, the words
``South-Central'' still evoke the open wounds of urban decay and
social dislocation. But here on a wide swath of once-grand Vermont
Avenue at 81st Street, seedlings of renewal are taking root this
summer. Against all odds, 36 mustard-colored, stucco town houses _
half of them built above storefronts facing the street and the rest
around an interior court _ are filling up with first-time
homeowners, most of them single mothers. In the process, Vermont
Village Plaza is testing anew the possibilities of the New Urbanism
of its award-winning architect, Daniel Solomon. By Todd S. Purdum.

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-RKO-281 (Undated) _ When Orson Welles made his masterpiece
``Citizen Kane'' in 1941, it was no secret that the film's
protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, was a barely fictionalized
version of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper magnate whose
enormous empire was then beginning to falter under a barrage of
debts. But there was a drama behind the drama, as Welles _ then
just 25 and swelled by the arrogance of youth and genius _ found
himself up against the full force of Hearst's fury. Hearst was
desperate to stop the film, no matter what the cost, and nearly
succeeded in having it destroyed before it had ever been released.
Now the story of their battle is to be the subject of its own film.
``RKO 281,'' which takes its name from ``Citizen Kane's'' working
title at the RKO studio, will have its premiere on HBO in November.

REVIEW: SUMMER OF SAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Spike Lee's latest New York social study, ``Summer
of Sam,'' finds the director outside of his usual Harlem and
Bed-Stuy stomping grounds. But in the most important way, he's
right at home, poking into the dysfunctions and frustrations of
Bronx Italian-Americans, and examining how their tightly knit
community affects their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Although set during the overheated July of 1977 when the serial
killer Son of Sam was terrorizing the outer boroughs, the movie's
focus is on a working-class neighborhood. David Berkowitz's
depredations are depicted, but not exploited; the primary role of
the killings is to increase tensions that are just waiting to boil
over between people who've known one another all their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who reworked a semi-autobiographical script by Victor
Colicchio and fellow actor Michael Imperioli, builds the movie
around two troubled young couples. Vinny and Dionna, played by John
Leguizamo and Mira Sorvino, are disco-dancing marrieds whose
expertise on the dance floor does not extend to their bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie (Adrien Brody), Vinny's best friend since childhood, has
returned to the neighborhood all spike-haired and English-accented
after a stay in the East Village. He's soon taking up with Ruby
(Jennifer Esposito), the local girl with a reputation, who's about
the only homey who appreciates _ let alone even comprehends _
Ritchie's urge to be different.
</P>
<P>
   These folks have big problems. Vinny suffers from a serious
madonna-whore complex, and he cheats on Dionna rather than ask her
to fulfill his hardly outrageous carnal desires. By chance, Vinny
barely escapes Sam's wrath while fooling around with Dionna's
Italian cousin. When he finds out about the close call, Vinny
begins spiraling down a vortex of drug abuse and Catholic guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie's dreams of punk music stardom proceed slowly and
unprofitably, and he turns a few tricks to make ends meet. Even
before they find out about this, Joey T (Michael Rispoli) and the
Guys Who Hang Out at the End of the Street are pretty unhappy that
their old buddy has become so ... well, different. As Sam-inspired
hysteria rises, these guys find a welcome outlet for their rage.
Their list of possible suspects grows to include anybody who
doesn't conform.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Lee's superficially similar masterpiece ``Do the Right
Thing,'' ``Summer of Sam'' busts out of the neighborhood for a
wider sociological survey of the city at the time. Lee himself
plays a television reporter who not only describes the search for
Sam, but such other key incidents as the heat wave blackout and
Reggie Jackson's triumphant Yankees season.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate New Yorker Jimmy Breslin, the newspaper columnist whom
Berkowitz wrote to during his spree, narrates bookending sequences.
Various Gotham characters, from the paternalistc mob boss (Ben
Gazarra) to the middle-age crooner (Mike Star), texturize the
piece.
</P>
<P>
   We enter the punk palace, CBGB's, and don't get past the doorman
at Studio 54 (Vinny and Dionna do attend an orgy at Plato's
Retreat, which, of course, is the last thing that their
relationship needs). Superb music selections, from ``Who's Next?''
to ``Fernando,'' capture the cultural tensions of the time, and
Ruth E. Carter's costume designs are the first in many a movie to
make the disco look seem as glamorously attractive as it was silly.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Lee has captured the era in convincing detail. But
even with that and crackling good ensemble acting _ led by
Leguizamo's thoroughly humane portrayal of a stupid man struggling
with inner demons that will always outsmart him _ the movie never
quite achieves the soul-searing intensity it should. After all,
it's about people misdirecting their passions, whether hateful and
loving, in the midst of a shared, unfolding tragedy. That's
powerful stuff, and we don't always feel it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``Summer of Sam'' never fails to address its very
big agenda with intelligence, sensitivity and craftsmanship of the
highest order. Yes, it will be controversial, like many of Lee's
films. But it also should stand as one of his most insightful and
compassionate. &UR;  &QL;

2 BIG ITALIAN BANKS AGREE TO MERGE; 3-WAY DEAL IN FRANCE FALTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Two major moves to consolidate European banking went in
different directions Wednesday as two of Italy's biggest banks
agreed to a friendly merger and efforts by the French government to
negotiate an amicable solution to a three-way bank merger broke
down.
</P>
<P>
   In Milan, the boards of Banca Intesa, the second-largest bank in
Italy, and Banca Commerciale Italiana, the fourth-biggest, approved
a $15 billion share swap creating what will be Italy's largest
banking group, with assets of roughly $290 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the participants in a $38 billion hostile bid by
Banque Nationale de Paris for two French rivals, Societe Generale
and Paribas, failed to negotiate an end to their five-month old
duel, leaving it up to investors to decide the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The failure by the governor of the Bank of France, Jean-Claude
Trichet, to negotiate and end to the battle clears the way for
French banking authorities to approve a sweetened $19 billion bid
by Societe Generale for Paribas. The two banks' plans to unite was
upset when Banque Nationale launched its hostile bid for both banks
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors cheered the luckless outcome of the talks, which ended
early this morning. Societe Generale's share price rose by as much
as 4.3 percent, to 173 euros, or $178; the Paribas share price rose
almost 4 percent, and Banque Nationale's shares rose as much as 3.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While French government officials insisted they were ``neutral,
if not indifferent'' to the outcome, they made clear that they
sought a French solution. Many analysts interpreted the government
willingness to allow the talks to end as a sign that it believes
that investors, mainly large funds from the United States and
Britain, will choose the larger three-way alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the effort to bring together Banca Intesa and Banca
Commerciale Italiana went smoothly, though it too came about only
after government intervention to steer the course of bank
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Unicredito Italiano, another large Italian
bank, had made a bid for Commerciale that the Bank of Italy, the
central bank, rejected as hostile. Last week, the Bank of Italy's
president, Antonio Fazio, cleared plans for the merger announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under their deal, Banca Intesa will exchange 1.65 of its shares
for each Commerciale share, for 70 percent of Commerciale, with an
option to acquire the rest. The banks said they expect savings
before taxes of about $865 million over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Intesa itself is the product of a merger two years ago of the
Cariplo savings bank and the Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, two powerful
groups in Italy's heavily industrialized north.
</P>
<P>
   Ripples of the merger will be felt beyond Italy, with
connections reaching into the heart of French and German banking.
Credit Agricole of France, Intesa's largest shareholder, will
retain about 13 percent of the merged group. Agricole, together
with the new combination and Commerzbank of Germany, now a major
Commerciale shareholder, will hold almost 17 percent of Credit
Lyonnais, the giant French bank that the Paris government recently
took public after bailing it out.

TREATMENT OF CUBAN REFUGEES DRAWS ANGRY PROTEST IN MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PAMELA MERCER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Miami's large Cuban-American population was bristling
with outrage Wednesday, a day after the Coast Guard used water
pumps and pepper spray to turn back a boat carrying six Cuban
rafters who had come within 150 yards of the Miami Beach coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which was broadcast live on local television, was
the topic of the day on Spanish-language radio talk shows and
prompted hundreds of protesters to take to the streets, blocking a
roadway to Miami Beach and a main road in the predominantly Cuban
city of Hialeah.
</P>
<P>
   Local politicians and angry commentators drew parallels between
the government of Fidel Castro and what they said were coercive
tactics used by the U.S. government through the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the Statue of Liberty falls with her arms open wide,''
declared Ninoska Perez, a commentator on WQBA radio and a member of
the Cuban American National Foundation, a powerful lobbying
organization. The Spanish language newspaper El Nuevo Herald ran a
headline on Page One that read ``Insult to Human Dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Coast Guard, Jibran Soto, said that the
conduct of its officers in the incident was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters directed their ire at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. A crowd of protesters picketed Wednesday
outside the immigration service's Krome detention center in west
Miami, where the six men were being held.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Tuesday's incident is an agreement between the
United States and Cuba, signed in 1994, under which Cubans who are
intercepted by the Coast Guard at sea are turned back no matter how
close they are to shore, while those who manage to make it ashore
and turn themselves in to the authorities can be released on parole
for a year and a day and then issued a green card, a privilege
granted only to Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Soto said the six Cubans, all men, were spotted by a Coast Guard
airplane on Tuesday afternoon about 400 yards from Florida's shore.
Four Coast Guard vessels surrounded them, urging the Cubans to turn
themselves in, the Coast Guard said. The Cubans jumped off the boat
and tried to swim the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   One, Carlos Hernandez Cordoba, 29, said later that he had
threatened to commit suicide by getting stuck in the propellers of
the Coast Guard boats unless they allowed him to swim to shore.
Hernandez and Israel Ramos Consuegra, 18, managed to make it
ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kane, a spokesman for the immigration service in
Washington, said that each of the six cases would be reviewed
separately. Officials are also investigating whether the men were
brought from Cuba by smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   To many people here, the incident is an unfortunate chapter in
the enforcement of an immigration policy that, in trying to stave
off a mass exodus from the island on the one hand and grant
leniency to Cubans fleeing an enemy regime on the other, has led to
erratic law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kane said that the agency had no plans to review its
immigration policy regarding Cubans, Dario Moreno, a professor of
political science at Florida International University, said a
review might be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at the start of a presidential campaign, Moreno said, the
incident could force the hands of both parties' front-runners, Vice
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who have both
tried to reach out to Hispanic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the incident was less about the flaws in immigration
policy than about the political influence of Cuban-Americans in
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcry is a function of the power of Cuban-American
politicians in South Florida and the spectacle of seeing the
incident live,'' said David Abraham, a professor of immigration law
at the University of Miami. ``The Cubans know that they enjoy a
privileged situation and they seek to exploit that privilege by
smuggling'' themselves in.

`MULTICULTURALISM' AT WIMBLEDON? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Edits thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``Predominantly white.'' That's the Wimbledon rule to
watch out for when you suit up for a scuffle on the grass. No clown
ensembles, thank you, as may be seen elsewhere on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that way in a couple of other departments, too,
like the balls and the faces.
</P>
<P>
   That started to change in 1957 when a dark-skinned woman from
New York named Althea Gibson won a Big W singles title. Eighteen
years later Arthur Ashe, barred from playing kids tournaments in
his hometown, Richmond, Va., because of his complexion, made it to
the winner's circle. Twelve years after that the tournament
radicalized further by adopting yellow balls.
</P>
<P>
   There went the neighborhood, right? Right. It got better.
</P>
<P>
   So if quarterfinalist pals Venus Williams and Alexandra
Stevenson win their next two matches and arrive in Saturday's
final, will it be historic?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. Never have two teen-agers collided for the title.
There's more. Never has a qualifier (Stevenson) gone so far. And
more. It would be the altitudinest major female finale: Venus, at 6
feet 2 inches, an inch taller than Stevenson. Additionally, no
19-year-old from Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., (Venus) has ever faced
an 18-year-old from San Diego (Alexandra) for the big door prize.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, the final would be predominantly unwhite. That would
make the neighborhood even more intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 Ashe, relatively new on the scene, asked reporters why
they kept referring to him as the ``Negro'' _ the word then _
``Davis Cupper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't write `Willie Mays, the Negro center fielder,' do
you?'' was Arthur's wry rebuke. ``I thought we were beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   We should have been.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, after the rookie Stevenson had gone for the
bundle with one electrifying all-or-nothing forehand blast on the
dead run, the reporters' questions were about pigmentation rather
than celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The kid had a right to celebrate after she'd nervelessly
canceled a match point against her in the tiebreaker with that huge
forehand. The nifty shot down the line boomeranged the match to
her, 2-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-1, over Lisa Raymond, another American who,
at No. 37, ranks 49 lengths ahead of Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson is the product of a mixed union: black father, white
mother. Is that such a big deal? Ask some of the descendants of one
of the guys who made the United States _ Thomas Jefferson _ if
that's a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Stevenson was asked about being one of the first
pair of African-Americans (presumably she and Venus, a 3-6, 6-3,
6-2, victor over Anna Kournikova) in the quarters.
</P>
<P>
   She had a good answer. ``I represent both African and Caucasian,
so I think it's great for both sides. Without race or anything I
think it's great because we're both friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Excellent. Shouldn't we be past the race thing _ but not
interracial friendship?
</P>
<P>
   Still, racism came up because her mother had said Alexandra had
been called a despicable name at a junior tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was called `nigger' once, but there's racism everywhere in
the world,'' Stevenson said. ``I'm not going to say who did it. It
has no relevance. It doesn't matter any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after the press conference, Alexandra, an imposing kid of
caffe latte shading, was thinking about labels, like
African-American, and decided maybe she's an M.C.
``Multicultural,'' she chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm eight parts: English, Welsh, Cherokee, Irish,
Italian, Swedish on my mother's side. African and French on my
father's. I love 'em all.''
</P>
<P>
   Who is her father?
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Is she in touch with him?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   That's her right.
</P>
<P>
   A story in the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel states that the name
Julius Erving appears on Stevenson's birth certificate as the
father, alleging it may be the same Erving, now retired, of
basketball renown at the University of Massachusetts and with the
New Jersey Nets of the ABA and Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA.
Despite a photo of Alexandra's alleged birth certificate in the
paper, Erving denied he's the father in the Sun-Sentinel story.
Alexandra's mother, Samantha Stevenson, a sometimes sportswriter
and TV reporter for Boston's Channel 7 in 1974, declined to comment
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Good genes, if true. But is it really any of our business? Is
her family tree either, even though she's a peach of a player who's
fallen from it?
</P>
<P>
   Should I write that Alexandra Stevenson is the first
multicultural member of Wimbledon's last eight? Risky unless we've
examined the family trees of all those to go before. No thanks. I'm
not in the genealogical forestry business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williams and Stevenson?'' says the Italian journalist, Gianni
Clerici. ``Who cares who their parents are? I call Venus espresso
and Alexandra cappuccino. It would be a tasty final.''
</P>
<P>
   I call them bright American kids on a wonderful ride toward the
end of the rainbow.

PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE ANNOUNCES END TO MOST ANIMAL TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio) (rk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. said Wednesday that it would
immediately end animal testing for 80 percent of its consumer
products, from shampoo and color cosmetics to household cleansers
and dishwashing detergents.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights groups, which had engaged in a protracted battle
to force P&AMP;G, the maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and
Pampers diapers, to end testing on animals, reacted with guarded
praise to the company's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The ban includes all shampoo and hair-styling products as well
as tissue and towel, skin care, household cleaners and laundry and
dishwashing products. The remaining 20 percent of the products not
covered by the ban include those that are required by law to be
tested on animals, such as drugs and certain food items, like those
containing pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   For the goods included in the animal-testing ban, ``science and
technology have advanced to the point where we can confirm the
safety of these finished products through nonanimal alternatives,''
said Larry Games, the company's vice president for global product
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, animal rights groups were quick to point out that P&AMP;G's
new policy applies only to existing products. The company
acknowledged that it reserved the right to use animals to test
certain new products that fall into the categories of goods
included in the ban. That stipulation led animal rights groups to
urge caution in effusively praising the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is made in small steps, and today P&AMP;G has taken one of
them,'' said Mary Beth Sweetland, the director of People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, which is one of P&AMP;G's staunchest
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Among multinational consumer and cosmetics businesses, P&AMP;G has
been one of the last holdouts to abandon animal testing. As a
result, P&AMP;G in recent years became a high-profile enemy for animal
rights groups looking for a new target.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G said its policy change, however, was prompted by the
availability of new testing methods and the company's own internal
goals. But public pressure was clearly a factor, analysts and the
animal rights groups said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that had something to do with it,'' said Jeff
Hallmark, a director of the Animal Rights Community, based in
Cincinnati, P&AMP;G's hometown, which had been at odds with the company
for more than a decade. What is more, he said, ``the majority of
their competitors making similar products have all changed. They
are just following a trend and are very late to follow the trend.''
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Food and Drug Administration said P&AMP;G was not
breaking any new ground with its ban because the products included
are those containing chemicals and other ingredients that have
already undergone extensive animal testing. ``So there is really no
necessity to do further testing to determine the safety of those
ingredients,'' said Dr. Mack Holt, director of the FDA's office of
animal care and use.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G said, however, that it had long been committed to finding
effective alternatives to animal testing. The company said that
over the last 15 years it had invested nearly $100 million in the
study and development of alternative research methods.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and the company said the shift was also in line with
P&AMP;G's ambitious goal to significantly increase its sluggish sales
growth and decrease its cumbersome product development cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The company, for example, should see cost savings from replacing
expensive animal testing with cheaper methods. The alternative
methods are also often faster than animal-testing procedures.

MCCAIN SAYS HE'LL TARGET FUND RAISING, SPECIAL INTERESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. _ In a rare move for a presidential candidate,
Senator John McCain declared Wednesday that drastic overhaul of the
campaign-finance system and disabling special interests will be the
centerpiece of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the war in Kosovo, McCain has shifted his
message from foreign to domestic, embracing a cause he has
championed in Congress for years. He had harsh words for
Republicans, Democrats, and even himself; the noontime crowd at the
Bedford town hall interrupted him with applause and cheers 16 times
throughout the address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all corrupted,'' said McCain, pointing to the titanic
``soft money'' donations that flow freely through the nation's
capital, stifling legislation and political overhaul
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the defenders of an elaborate influence-peddling scheme
in which both parties conspire to stay in office by selling the
country to the highest bidder,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Arizona Republican, campaign-finance overhaul is a
trademark issue, one that has buttressed his reputation as a
political maverick. It is a topic that most politicians don't talk
about, and it is a cause that has isolated McCain from his party's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be a US senator and therefore a Washington insider, but
he doesn't have the same views and concerns that Washington
insiders might have,'' said Anthony Corrado, a government professor
at Colby College, explaining the boost McCain may get from the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   McCain delivered his speech on the same day that reports of
second-quarter fund-raising for the presidential campaigns became
public. Texas Governor George W. Bush, for example, shattered all
modern money records by taking in an astonishing $36 million in the
first half of 1999. McCain ran a distant second among GOP
fund-raisers, with $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   While many political professionals say voters are bored by talk
of changing the way politicians pay for their campaigns, and while
the senator's own advisers tried to talk him out of pushing the
subject in his presidential campaign, McCain vehemently disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wrong,'' he said. ``Most Americans care very much
that it is now legal for a subsidiary of a corporation owned by the
Chinese Army to give unlimited amounts of money to American
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans care very much that the Lincoln bedroom has
become a Motel 6 where the president of the United States serves as
the bellhop,'' said McCain. ``Most Americans care very much when
monks and nuns abandon their vows of poverty and pay tens of
thousands of dollars to have spiritual communion with the Vice
President.''
</P>
<P>
   While he referred to Democratic fund-raising scandals, he also
slammed Republicans. McCain said Republican voters don't like
seeing their party abandon efforts to make government smaller and
closer to the people in order to preserve financial contributions
that give them an edge over Democrats. And he noted that since the
Republicans have controlled Congress, special interest earmarks in
appropriations bills, also known as pork, have increased
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise in pork-barrel spending is directly related to the
rise of soft money, as Republicans and Democrats scramble to reward
major donors to our campaigns,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that before any president can accomplish anything,
the system of campaign finance must be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to reform our tax code. I want to reduce government by
waging a relentless war against wasteful spending. I want to reform
and protect Social Security and Medicare,'' he said, ticking off a
long list of priorities. ``But we won't reform anything until we
first reform the way we finance our political campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, McCain said that when Congress held hearings for
the 1996 Telecommunications Act, every company affected by the
legislation ``had purchased a seat at the table with soft money.''
The result, he said, is that the legislation protected all of the
companies and none of the consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Currently pending in Congress is the McCain-Feingold legislation
to ban soft money to the national parties, restrict corporate and
union spending on campaign advertising, and provide for greater
disclosure of contributions. McCain and his partner, Wisconsin
Democrat Russell D. Feingold, have had no luck breaking a
filibuster that killed their bill in both 1997 and 1998. So far
this year, the bill has not made it back up on the floor of either
the House or the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   To some in Congress, McCain's ardent championship of campaign
finance legislation is an attempt to repair his image after he was
linked to the ``Keating Five'' imbroglio. McCain was accused, along
with four Democratic senators, of intervening with federal
regulators on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr., a rich savings and
loan owner. Following a drawn-out ethics committee investigation,
McCain was lightly rebuked in February of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, McCain said that the voters' perception that public
service is a corrupt endeavor shames him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their contempt is a stain upon my honor and I cannot live with
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, McCain said, he would stake his campaign on the
cause of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it were true that Americans don't care about campaign
finance reform _ and I do not for one moment believe that it is _ I
would not give up this fight,'' he said. ``I would rather not be
president than win that high office on false pretenses.''

TAPE EXPERT TESTIFIES IN CISNEROS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An audio recording expert testified Wednesday that
some tapes of telephone conversations between former Housing
Secretary Henry Cisneros and his onetime mistress are ``copies of
copies'' that could nonetheless be used as evidence against
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Koenig of Manassas, Va., the government's tape expert,
told U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin that copies or duplicates
are usually entered into evidence in criminal trials when the
original recording does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors with Independent Counsel David Barrett pared their
list of tapes they want to use to 26 from 34 when Cisneros goes to
trial in September on conspiracy charges. The reduction was made on
Sporkin's request to expedite a pre-trial hearing, now in its
second week.
</P>
<P>
   Koenig said none of the tapes in Barrett's possession is an
original.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are duplicates of the original information,'' Koenig
said, adding that at least five tapes are ``duplicates of
duplicates.''
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin called those ``a double whammy,'' but he did not signal
how he may rule on motions by Cisneros' lawyers to keep the tapes
from jurors when the case goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes are crucial to Barrett's conspiracy case against
Cisneros, who is accused of orchestrating a cover-up with Linda
Jones to conceal $250,000 in hush money paid to her after their
love affair ended in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend Cisneros, 52, sought to hide the financial
arrangement with Jones to protect his 1993 nomination to head the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, a job he held until
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The two are named in a 21-count indictment handed down by a
federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 50, testified last week that she taped telephone calls
with Cisneros out of fear that he would cut off financial support
to her if he moved to Washington. Jones testified as part of an
agreement that would reduce the 3 1/2-year prison sentence she
received for bank fraud, money laundering and obstruction of
justice in a case prosecuted by Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, formerly known by her married name, Linda Medlar, kept 88
tapes of telephone conversations made over several years.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also told prosecutors he wanted testimony about
whether there has been wholesale redactions, editing and splicing
of the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   When he did break off support, Jones said, she went public with
charges that he broke a verbal pledge to provide her $4,000 a
month. She filed a civil lawsuit claiming a breach of contract and
later settled for $49,000.
</P>
<P>
   She also went on a national television show in a paid interview
and accused Cisneros of lying about the payments to FBI agents
conducting a routine background investigation into his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett originally sought to introduce 34 tapes into evidence at
the Sept. 7 trial. The hearing into their admissibility is expected
to continue after the July 4 holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Koenig testified Wednesday just hours before the 21-year-old
independent counsel law expired. The expiration does not affect
ongoing investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett declined comment on the demise of the law that was
enacted in the fallout of the Watergate scandal.

UNION FAULTS PROGRESS OF NEW FLIGHT-CONTROL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The union representing technicians who certify and repair
air-traffic control equipment said Wednesday the Federal Aviation
Administration's billion-dollar purchase of a delay-plagued
Raytheon computer display system has fallen even further behind
schedule. The union questioned whether it will be installed
anywhere by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   By announcing their concern, the Professional Airways System
Specialists have ripped apart a carefully bound public front
involving the FAA and the unions responsible for the air-traffic
control system.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, the FAA, PASS, and the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association jointly announced a delay in the STARS
(Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System) program _
designed to replace aging air-traffic control systems at facilities
that control the crowded, busy airspace within a 50-mile radius of
the nation's 172 largest airports.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, STARS was supposed to be installed in September 1998
at Boston's Logan International Airport, and at Washington's Ronald
Reagan National Airport earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But when the FAA announced that STARS would be delayed
indefintely, the agency also said that modified versions of the
system that would use current comptuer systems, rather than new
ones, would be installed and tested at two small airports _ in
Syracuse, N.Y., in December, and in El Paso, Texas, early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the unions, including PASS, supported the move.
But Wednesday PASS said that timeline isseven weeks late. ``To have
a project slip by seven weeks over the course of eight weeks is the
type of slip that does not make us feel good about the delivery of
this system,'' said Tom Brantley, national vice president of the
union.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman William A. Shumann, while acknowledging that
``some software development and human factors issues took us longer
than initially anticipated,'' said the display system of STARS is
still scheduled to be installed in Syracuse in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not fallen behind schedule,'' he said. ``When we
developed that time schedule two months ago, we included some
contingency time within that schedule, and we have used that to
solve the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   STARS is being developed for the FAA and the Department of
Defense by Raytheon Co. Raytheon spokesman David Polk said the
company had no comment on the criticism by PASS.
</P>
<P>
   PASS has been in contract negotiations with the FAA, but
Brantley said the union's concern had nothing to do with
bargaining, but rather with the FAA's ability to field a working
air-traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
   Because of delays, the FAA said must buy off-the-shelf color
controller displays made by Lockheed Martin Corp. for five radar
approach centers including those at New York's LaGuardia and John
F. Kennedy airports, and Washington's National.

US TO SEEK NEW TALKS ON MIDEAST PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The announcement Wednesday that Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak has formed a coalition government paves
the way for a new push to achieve peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, long eager for this moment, now will
press Barak to reopen talks on all fronts _ with Syria, the
Palestinians, and other Arab leaders to revitalize economic ties
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one predicts a quick deal on any track, only that new
negotiations could begin before summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Wednesday to Shimon Peres, the acting speaker of
Israel's parliament, Barak said he would present his government
early next week, paving the way for the transition to his
administration from defeated leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   In the key decision over the makeup of the coalition, Barak
brought in the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which has dovish views on
giving back territory to the Palestinians and the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   Shas' 17 seats brings Barak's coalition to 59 seats in the
120-member Knesset, or parliament, but outside the coalition he
will be able to draw upon a well of support. Arab-backed parties
add another 10 seats to the coalition on peace votes, and the
far-left Meretz party brings 10 more. In all, Knesset watchers can
count a possible 87 votes in the parliament for peace initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who remained closed-mouthed in the bargaining for
coalition partners, decided against including the right-wing Likud
Party in the government, a decision that analysts say will enable
Israel's new leader to negotiate more freely with the Syrians and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, said analysts, is that Barak has sidestepped one
of most divisive issues in Israel today _ the secular-religious
divide. By including Shas in the coalition, he will be ignoring a
major message in the recent elections that secular Israelis wanted
the religious to have a smaller voice in government.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to give Shas four ministries _ Labor, Health, Religion
and Infrastructure _ but he also forced them to give up the
powerful Interior Ministry, which the party held under Netanyahu.
The Interior Ministry now could go to Meretz, as a possible
enticement to expand his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak's choice of Shas shows where his emphasis will be _ with
the peace process,'' said Mark Heller, a political analyst at the
Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   But the question now is, which peace process?
</P>
<P>
   While US Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk this week
said the Clinton administration wants Barak to open talks with the
Syrians and the Palestinians, there is widespread perception in
Washington, Jerusalem, Cairo and other Arab capitals that the most
substantial movement will happen on the Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
   That is partially because Barak has stated he wants to pull his
troops out of southern Lebanon within a year. Barak could pull the
troops unilaterally, risking further confrontations with Hezbollah
guerrillas in Lebanon, or he could do it in conjunction with a
Syrian peace deal that would involve giving back part or all of the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel today, giving back the lush and hilly Golan, which
overlooks the Sea of the Galilee and sits atop much of Israel's
water resources, would be extremely difficult. But it would be much
easier than solving the long-intractable issues with the
Palestinians, including the future of Jerusalem, the return of
refugees and water rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak will give greater priority to the Syrian front, but
we're still a long way from the big breakthrough,'' Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad has said he wants the talks to
begin exactly where they left off several years ago. He has said
Israel had agreed to the principle of returning the Golan, which
was captured from Syria more than a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   But recently Assad, in an interview with British biographer
Patrick Seale, made comments about Barak that were stunningly
positive, calling him a ``strong and honest man. ... It is clear
that he wants to achieve peace with Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Assad has given other ``signals'' to US officials
that he is ready for peace talks with Barak, Indyk said. An
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the messages have come through French and European Union officials,
as well as through cables filed to Washington by US Ambassador to
Syria Ryan Croker.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility for movement with Syria has left Palestinian
officials anxious and nervous about being left behind. The
Palestinians have communicated this fear in all directions, to
Washington, to King Abdullah of Jordan, to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and to Assad himself.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat recently sent envoys to see
Assad, but the Syrian president has given them no indication that
he will work in concert with the Palestinians toward a
comprehensive peace deal, said a Palestinian official, speaking on
the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of movement toward a final settlement with the
Palestinians, Barak would more likely take smaller steps and
fulfill parts of the deal made last year between Netanayahu and
Arafat at the Wye plantation in Maryland, predicted US officials
and Palestinian analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barak will make some symbolic moves toward the
Palestinians ... but the Lebanon and Syrian issue seems to be the
foremost concern and priority,'' said Hisham Ahmed Fararjeh, a
political scientist at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. ``The
kind of diplomatic overtures we are seeing, by Barak toward Assad,
and by Assad toward Barak, backed up by statements made by the
Clinton administration, give almost every indications needed that
there will be a serious move on the Syrian track.''
</P>
<P>
   After Barak forms his government next week, he will then make
plans to visit Washington for a short trip, perhaps three days
later in July, according to the Israeli Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real feeling that there's an opportunity of gettign
the peace process back on track, but much difficult work needs to
be done,'' said an Israeli government official in Washington. ``We
shouldn't be over optimistic.''

   NEW YORK _ They look like any of the anxious patients who walk
into the city's polyglot emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But there are telltale signs: Sometimes they arrive with luggage
and with tourist visas in their pockets. Often they hand over
crumpled notes from their doctors back home in China or Africa.
</P>
<P>
   One man from the Dominican Republic flew into La Guardia Airport
weak with fever, asked for an ambulance and presented himself at
New York Presbyterian Hospital, where he announced that he had
leukemia and needed help. Along with his suitcase, he carried his
own intravenous drip.
</P>
<P>
   They are known as medical immigrants, poor or middle-class
foreigners who scrape and save to fly to New York, but not to join
family, flee oppression or find work. Instead, they come solely to
seek treatment at city emergency rooms, where federal and state law
mandates that they must be examined and treated if their problems
require immediate care.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that such patients have been gravitating to the city
in modest numbers for years, mostly to the city's public hospitals.
While New York appears to receive the brunt, hospitals in Chicago,
Houston and Miami also report treating a steady stream of medical
immigrants, mostly from poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   No one is able to say exactly how many there are or how much
their care costs hospitals. And in part, this is a policy decision.
Many emergency departments, fearing the anti-immigrant sentiment
that has restricted access to health care in California and other
states, resist counting such patients or pressing them about where
they came from if they do not volunteer that information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I wonder whether this is the guy from Third Avenue who
doesn't have any money or the guy from the Third World who doesn't
have any?'' asked Dr. Lewis Goldfrank, the emergency services
director at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan. ``That's not my
job,'' he said. ``I'm a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   But especially in New York, those who keep an eye on city
hospitals' precarious finances say that if something does not
change, the hospitals will not be able to keep their emergency room
doors open to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The medical immigrants are a tiny but dramatic example of a much
larger and growing problem of uninsured or underinsured patients _
both citizens and immigrants, legal and illegal _ who rely on
emergency rooms as clinics for everything from colds to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York state Health Department, city
hospitals provided $1.2 billion in care to those who could not pay
in 1997, the last year for which figures are available. The same
year, the state collected only $635 million in a charity pool used
for such care, most of which went to city hospitals. The pool is
financed through taxes on hospitals and insurers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the shortfall, New York's percentage of uninsured
people _ 19.1 percent _ is not only higher than the nationwide
percentage but is growing faster.
</P>
<P>
   While medical immigrants account for only a sliver of this
population, Patricia Wang, a senior vice president of the Greater
New York Hospital Association, called the phenomenon ``a tremendous
concern to hospitals as the number of uninsured grows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another thing that's putting a lot of stress on hospital
budgets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The patients come from all over the world, many with
long-neglected, serious illnesses. Just after 2 this Sunday
morning, a newly-arrived Honduran woman showed up at Elmhurst
Hospital's emergency room, and doctors determined that she had an
aggressive form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Goldfrank treated a West African with kidney failure
who had sold his house and possessions to travel to Guinea for
dialysis. He could not get help there, but tacked to a bulletin
board in the hospital was an announcement saying that if patients
could get to Bellevue in New York or Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in
Paris they would get free dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   The man, whose name was not released by the hospital, flew to
New York last February and walked into the emergency room with
almost fatal levels of potassium in his blood, Goldfrank said. He
was stabilized and has remained in New York for weekly dialysis,
paid for with emergency Medicaid funds that require mountains of
paperwork for the hospital to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   When Bellevue officials asked the man whether he would be
willing to be interviewed, provided that his name would not be
used, he became so frightened that nurses in the dialysis program
worried he would not show up for his treatments again.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who are on a mission to save their lives,''
Goldfrank said. ``It's their last resort before they give up. And
it can be a very courageous journey they're taking.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But not all cities are as welcoming. At Jackson Memorial
Hospital in Miami, officials have begun to make access to care much
harder when patients cannot prove legal residency or an ability to
pay. They might be stabilized in the emergency room but not
admitted. Or if their condition is not immediately
life-threatening, they may be turned away and told to go to the
hospital's clinic, where they must pay an upfront fee before being
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Jackson has even begun taking the most drastic step:
alerting immigration authorities if hospital administrators
determine that a patient's condition can be treated in his home
country. When this leads to deportation, the hospital will
sometimes pick up the cost of the airline ticket, many thousands of
dollars cheaper than the care they might otherwise have provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to draw a line, and we're doing it more and more,''
said Maria Rosa Gonzalez, a spokeswoman. ``The county has made it
very clear that our first responsibility is to the people of
Miami-Dade County. And we're not ashamed to admit that.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, the flow of medical immigrants has slowed
considerably since the 1994 passage of Proposition 187, which
sought to deny most medical help to illegal immigrants and require
doctors to report undocumented aliens to the police. While the
measure has been mostly dismantled in court, uncertainty among
immigrants about whether they will be treated has deterred them
from traveling to California for medical care.
</P>
<P>
   But New York doctors who see such patients say they have no
intention of ever denying care because of economics or immigration
status, even though in some cases the law might allow them to
discharge the patients once they are stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view, I'm just interested in getting them
taken care of,'' said Dr. Stuart Kessler, the director of the
emergency department at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, another
city emergency room frequently sought out by such patients because
of its diverse neighborhood and proximity to the airports.
``Whether it's a strain on resources or not, that's an issue I can
debate some other time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue estimates that it may see a few dozen patients a year
who doctors or social workers determine traveled to the country
just for medical care. But hospital officials believe there are
probably dozens more patients who lie, thinking they are more
likely to receive treatment if they claim they came to the city for
a vacation or to find work and then fell ill. Elmhurst officials
say they may see a few patients a month whom they know to be
medical immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the patients all the doctors talk about,'' said
Kessler, who added that he is always especially amazed by those who
bring doctors' notes or medical charts. ``This is not a letter from
a doctor down the street; it's from another part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the number of these patients appears to have
risen only slightly over the years, probably because of obvious
barriers, doctors say. First, the patients must be able to get a
tourist or temporary visa in their countries and come up with the
money for the airline ticket. They must also have a certain level
of sophistication to know that they will indeed be treated once
they show up. Sometimes this knowledge comes from friends or
relatives who live in New York and take them to the hospital after
they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, underequipped hospitals in Third World countries
actually urge seriously ill patients, like the West African with
kidney failure, to go to New York as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   The man from the Dominican Republic who showed up at New York
Presbyterian was more than lucky: he ended up getting a bone marrow
transplant, according to a former doctor at the hospital. But
sometimes, Goldfrank says, the patients arrive too late. A few
years ago, a man in Mexico City who knew he had serious heart
problems began having chest pains and got on a plane to come to
Bellevue. He took a cab and later walked into the emergency room in
shock. He died several days later.
</P>
<P>
   While New York doctors say they have seen no pronounced patterns
of immigrants coming from certain countries or regions, for the
past several years they have noticed a number of South Americans
with AIDS, West Africans with kidney failure and Chinese immigrants
with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they arrive straight from the airport, with no
contacts in New York other than the doctors and nurses who help
them. More commonly, friends or relatives in the city and familiar
with a certain hospital take the patient to the emergency room
within a few days of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the immigrant traffic may be an unintended side effect
of occasional good-will missions by public and private hospitals,
which bring in foreign patients from impoverished or war-torn
countries in need of complicated surgeries or treatments. These
patients get special medical visas, they usually have the support
of a charity, and the cases generate a huge amount of publicity for
the hospitals. It is publicity sometimes seen around the world as
an invitation to free care at New York's emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's apparently good word of mouth about us in Mongolia,
which is nice to know,'' said Pam McDonnell, the director of
communications at Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   The city's public hospitals complain that when medical
immigrants, especially those with serious illnesses, show up on the
doorsteps of private hospitals, they are stabilized and then
sometimes promptly shipped over to a public hospital for the costly
surgery or long stay.
</P>
<P>
   Francesco Santoni-Rugiu, an Italian cardiologist who is leaving
Mount Sinai Medical Center to return to practice in Italy, said
that doctors at private hospitals would like to keep the patients
because they often have challenging medical conditions either no
longer as common in the United States or virtually unheard of, like
leprosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But probably,'' he said, ``the hospital isn't going to be in
favor of admitting these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Likely as not, they end up at Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the social work staff there took a statistical
snapshot of the admitted patient population on one day, Dec. 3. The
report was mostly to determine the size of the homeless population,
but it found something that surprised administrators. Of the 701
patients, 166 were not U.S. citizens and 70 were ineligible for
government entitlements, meaning that they were most likely
undocumented aliens.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say how many of the 70 had come to the country
specifically for medical help, but Patricia Blau, deputy director
of the Social Work Department, estimated that it was probably over
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the medical staff were surprised with the
numbers we found,'' she said. ``But we weren't. The word is on the
streets, so to speak, that if you come in these doors, you will not
be turned away.''

FED MAKES EXPECTED RATE HIKE, BACKS OFF ON FUTURE INCREASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates by a
quarter-percentage point Wednesday, setting off rallies in the
stock and bond markets with a surprise announcement that no further
rate increases are planned in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The boost in the federal funds rate, from 4.75 percent to 5
percent, was a widely anticipated move to slow down the economy and
to head off inflation by causing increases in interest rates on
everything from credit cards to business loans. But the stock
market, reacting with a mixture of relief and euphoria, soared 200
points within minutes after the Fed confirmed investors'
expectations and then dropped its so-called ``bias'' toward more
rate hikes over the next few months. At the end of the day, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 155.45 points, closing at
10,907.80.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two weeks ago, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan
expressed concern that the strong US economy _ sailing along in the
second-longest boom in history _ was in danger of triggering
inflation in wages and prices. The Federal Open Market Committee,
headed by Greenspan, explained its first rate hike in two years in
a written statement. Sharp increases in US workers' productivity
have, for now, eased concerns about a tight labor market, the FOMC
said, and have kept a lid on inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Members cautioned, however, that they remain ``especially alert
to the emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces
that could undermine economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   What surprised investors and economists who monitor every Fed
move was a decision to withdraw its stance in favor of future rate
hikes. At its last meeting, the FOMC had announced a bias toward
higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   David Jones, a Fed watcher for Aubrey Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York,
said the Fed's neutral stance on rates may jeopardize its ability
to fight inflation. ``It was curious the Fed pulled back,'' Jones
said. ``It means they're going to sit on the sidelines a while, but
the danger is this could raise the possibly the economy could
overheat.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Fed's stated goal of heading off inflation,
economists predicted such a gentle action would have only minimal
impact on the economy and on consumer confidence, which is nearing
levels not seen since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers from Connecticut to California said Wednesday that small
businesses, the engines of economic growth, will continue to borrow
at ``incredibly high'' levels despite the slightly higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed typically boosts the federal funds rate _ the rate at
which commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans _ in
an attempt to curb spending by consumers and businesses, which must
borrow to invest in new plant and equpment. Banks, in turn, raise
the rates charged to their best customers _ the prime rate. Fleet
Financial Group, New England's largest commercial banking company,
and other major banks immediately hiked their prime lending rates
to 8 percent. Credit card interest, home mortgages, and other rates
typically follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Economists speculated that the FOMC acted cautiously because the
bond market has done much of its work for it. Since the beginning
of this year, yields on the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond have
marched higher, rising from about 5.12 percent to a current range
of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Higher mortgage rates, for example, were blamed for a recent
dampening in home sales.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market may have overreacted to anticipated Fed moves.
Bonds rallied Wednesday, restoring some losses in their prices
during the first half of the year. The 30-year Treasury bond's
yield dropped Wednesday by almost 10 basis points to 5.96 percent;
that is the first time it has closed below 6 percent since June 18.
(Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices.)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's rate increase was a first move to unwind three
consecutive rate hikes enacted last year _ in September, October,
and November _ amid what the Fed Wednesday described as a
``significant seizing-up'' of US and global financial markets
triggered by collapsing currencies that cascaded from Asia to
Russia and threatened South America.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the dramatic financial crises have been virtually
erased by news that Japan's economy may be in a long-hoped-for
recovery and that fragile southeast Asian economies are also
beginning to climb out of their rut.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, lauded for the remarkable feat of helping to rescue a
troubled world economy, has turned its attention to a US economy
that is charging ahead _ perhaps too quickly _ in reaction to last
year's rate decreases.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan faces a tricky task in navigating interest-rate policy
through an economy that is expanding at a breakneck pace with
virtually no signs of inflation, said William Cheney, economist for
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's decision to withdraw its bias toward further
tightening is tantamount to ``Alan Greenspan admitting he's not
God, and he doesn't know what he's going to do next,'' Cheney said.
Future Fed decisions ``depend on what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, economists said most indicators still point to a
continued boom. Consumer confidence in June scored its eighth
consecutive monthly gain, corporate profits are up, and inflation
remains remarkably low. The index of leading indicators, which
attempts to forecast future economic growth, gained 0.3 percent in
May after decreasing slightly in April, the Conference Board said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But with unemployment rates at 30-year lows, the Federal Reserve
believes there is a danger wages could go higher and spark
inflation if workers' productivity gains taper off. Productivity
has risen more than 2 percent in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Fed's view is productivity gains are not
sustaintainable and there's very little slack in the unemployment
rate anymore,'' said Cynthia Latta, US economist for Standard &AMP;
Poor's/DRI in Lexington, Mass.

HERE'S A TIP, PODNER: DON'T STIFF THE STEER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the last weekend in May when a tourist at the Fort Worth
Stockyards had his photograph taken with Ron Sitton, a
fifth-generation Fort Worth cowboy. Sitton, 45, was astride his
longhorn steer, Pecos Bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work for tips, sir,'' Sitton told the tourist. The tourist
refused to tip. Harsh words were exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is the subject of some dispute. The tourist
told police the steer used its shoulder to pin him to a tree. When
he squeezed free, the tourist said, the steer charged him.
</P>
<P>
   Sitton says that Pecos Bill, being a steer and not a bull,
wouldn't charge anyone and never touched the tourist or endangered
bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, no one was injured. But something about this story
bothered us.
</P>
<P>
   We did not know we were supposed to tip longhorns. We might have
assumed that the longhorn was a city employee, and therefore not an
appropriate subject for a tip.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard of tipping cows but didn't know that meant giving
them money.
</P>
<P>
   This Stockyards incident made us wonder: Just whom else are we
leaving off the tip list, at our potential peril?
</P>
<P>
   Lest we be considered rude, we checked out Emily Post's
Etiquette. And she reminded us of a few folks who should be on the
tip list:
</P>
<P>
   The florist who delivers: $2, even though you are the recipient
of the gift. Some florists won't take the tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tell them thanks, but they should save their money to
send flowers another time. It works. People remember that and call
us,'' said James Johnson of Swofford's Florist in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The guys who move your furniture: $15-50 each, mostly because
they move and arrange your belongings, and etiquette demands that
you acknowledge all that hands-on work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tipping is very common. It's also common to offer lunch and
something to drink,'' said John Garrett of Garrett Transportation,
an Atlas Van lines agent in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The barber or hairstylist: 10 to 15 percent. Most of us know
that but sometimes forget that a similar tip goes to a separate
colorist, and a separate tip of $1-$3 should be offered to the
shampoo person. You do not want them to turn on you. Be nice.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage collectors: $25 or so at Christmas, Post says, although
if your garbage collector is a city employee, as almost all are
either directly or by contract, gratuities normally are not
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't allow our employees to accept tips or to salvage,''
said Dave Balbierz, district manager for Fort Worth Waste
Management.
</P>
<P>
   Carpet installers: $5-$10 apiece for those who pull up old
carpet, put down new and then have the good grace to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   The car wash: $1, usually in a jar where employees pool the
tips.
</P>
<P>
   Room service: 15 percent, cash. Most folks do that, but not
everyone knows that Post recommends that amount even if a room
service charge is added into the bill. After all, they are there in
your hotel room and it is best that everyone stays in a good mood.
</P>
<P>
   In restaurants where there is no table service, Post recommends
a 10 percent tip.
</P>
<P>
   And when you have your photograph taken with a longhorn? Even
with your own camera? Although she offers suggestions on tipping
for 55 different occasions, and etiqutte advice on everything from
wedding invitations to how to eat a papaya, Post does not discuss
tipping cowboys or longhorns. But from where we stand, it looks
like money well-spent.

AUTHORS AIM TO BANISH SLAVERY'S SHADOW ON RELATIONSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her mama taught her ``real good'' how to leave a man, just as
her grandmama taught her mama. What they didn't teach her was how
to make a relationship work.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Brenda Lane Richardson sees it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called her Emma and pictured her waking in the slave
quarter, starting her day by gritting her teeth, bracing for
trouble and knowing she could expect only two responses from men,''
Richardson said about her great-grandmother in a letter to her
mama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who was white would rape or beat her; the one who was
black would have to look the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of slavery, she said _ and her sista-friend Dr.
Brenda Wade agrees _ is the cloud hanging over African-American men
and women for more than 100 years, perpetuating the myth of being
inferior and rendering them almost incapable of having loving
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a book that explores the emotional legacy that slavery
has on intimate relationships among African-American men and women,
Richardson and Wade have melded their life experiences and
expertise to write ``What Mama Couldn't Tell Us About Love: Healing
Advice for Overcoming the Emotional Legacy of Slavery, Celebrating
Our Light'' (HarperCollins, $24).
</P>
<P>
   Their objective is to help end the lingering rift between black
men and women and change the way they relate to one another by
getting them to make peace with their history and embrace their
ancestral strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and Wade, affectionately known as ``The Brendas,''
are scheduled to lead The Greatest Untold Story seminar July 9 in
Seattle at the Unity convention, a gathering of minority
journalists from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Relationships have long been the subject of discussions among
African-Americans, as well as a running topic in the black news
media and a growing number of self-help books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some African-American woman who has given up, who has said
`There are no good men' or `I'm always going to be alone,' will
read the book and realize she can no longer rely on statistics,''
Richardson said. ``While the statistics may say there aren't enough
men available ... God wants us to have love and wouldn't give love
to some of us and leave others wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is an ordained minister, journalist and author of the
award-winning novel ``Chesapeake Song.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade is a family psychologist, Essence magazine columnist and
former TV host of ``Can This Marriage Be Saved?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The key message here is that we are not irrevocably flawed,''
Wade said. ``But because of the unique backdrop of our history,
because of the social context that we live in, African-Americans
have issues that are particular to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although history shapes every human being's experience, the
black experience is singular because of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Wade said that because of the strength and resiliency of
African-Americans, they have not only survived but flourished. But
it doesn't mean there weren't deep emotional scars, different even
from those of Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Said Richardson: ``Sometimes when I speak to white groups, they
come over and say, `We enjoyed what you had to say, but why can't
you people just get over it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell many stories of immigrants, but I try to explain to
them that their relatives came by choice and after being here many
generations and losing their accents, they in effect became
``white'' and that meant all of the privileges that go with being
white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people, on the other hand, were forceably brought here in
chains. We were not allowed to speak our language or practice our
customs. The people who owned us told the world we were uneducable,
that we smelled bad, were prone to violence and were heathens.
Those beliefs became universal.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors say this affects the way black men and women relate
to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Although they believe it is important to acknowledge the
long-term effects of slavery, Wade and Richardson caution that this
isn't a book about blaming white people; nor it just for
African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every white person in America disappeared today,'' Wade
said, ``we'd still not be free because of lingering negative
images.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof, she said, is in the large numbers of depressed
African-American men and women who come through the doors of her
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underneath, there is pain, anger, shame and fear, and unless
we can acknowledge those feelings, we turn it on ourselves,'' she
said. ``What I want African-American women to see is that any
emotion you face loses its power when you acknowledge it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, ``What Mama Couldn't Tell Us About Love'' reflects
the authors' struggle in their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to write ``What Mama Couldn't Tell Us About Love'' more
or less evolved from Richardson's attempt to save her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   From Wade, she said, she learned to take ``that finger of
blame'' she was pointing at her husband and point it at her own
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to ask myself, `What is there about me that attracted me
to this person?' '' she said. ``What do I need to understand about
my own history that led me to this relationship? I realized I had
to learn more about myself and stop blaming my husband. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I began a sort of archaeological dig,'' she said. ``This is a
country where people learn to quickly put the past behind them.
That's good in terms of trying to make money or buy a house, but
not in building a relationship. Our history affects us emotionally,
and it certainly affects us in relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors believe, however, that blacks also inherited
strengths from their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found is that if we could unlearn harmful beliefs we
could unearth some of these tremendous strengths,'' Richardson
said. ``We can use them to improve our relationships, to attract
new relationships and create lives of abundance for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strengths are gifts that we often take for granted, for
instance our faith in God. No matter how high and mighty we get,
that's something that remains with us.''

CHILI PEPPERS ARE RED HOT AGAIN

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along with Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, Pearl Jam and Ministry, the
Red Hot Chili Peppers that helped bring alternative rock into the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1984, they toiled in small clubs, barrelling through
humorous live shows that had them tagged as a novelty act but all
the while honing their funk-punk sound. Luck was on their side in
'91, when they released ``BloodSugarSexMagik,'' their commercial
breakthrough, which exposed a new generation of kids to a rap-rock
sound that has since become common.
</P>
<P>
   As the hits rolled out, the money rolled in, and soon the
pressures of becoming so big so fast took their toll: singer
Anthony Kiedis' drug habit worsened, guitarist John Frusciante
left, and everyone else grew sick of the cycles of being in a
popular rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Frusciante's departure led to the arrival of Jane's Addiction
guitarist Dave Navarro, whose refreshing work on ``Blood's''
follow-up, ``One Hot Minute,'' is the only good thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Time passed. Navarro left. Frusciante rejoined. Kiedis cleaned
up. The time and the changes have done the Peppers a world of good:
``Californication,'' their first disc in four years, is a solid and
refreshing collection of songs that prove the guys are far from
being over.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, ``Cali'' is their most unique effort musically, in
that the band doesn't focus on one style of music. There's a reggae
tinge to ``Around the World;'' the single, ``Scar Tissue,'' is a
sober, melodic pop song; ``I Like Dirt'' and ``Savior'' are
inventive chance-takers; and ``Parallel Universe'' is a hypnotizing
rocker. Bassist Flea's sidewinding bass lines _ the band's
trademark _ are what give the disc cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrically, the band was heavily inspired by their home state of
California. As Courtney Love did on Hole's ``Celebrity Skin,'' the
Peppers don't necessarily rip apart LA as much as they write about
their place in it. There's not a lot of poetry going on here, but
it does beat the heck out of ``Give It Away.''

   Too much consumer anticipation is never a good thing. We've

``Hannibal.''

<P>

by comparison with its more distinguished predecessors, so Thomas
Harris' third Hannibal Lecter novel pales when compared with ``Red
Dragon'' and ``The Silence of the Lambs.'' By objective measure,
``The Phantom Menace'' is a far better-than-average movie. The same
can be said for ``Hannibal'' as a book, if we could just separate
it from the Harris novels that came before.
</P>
<P>
   But we can't. The megasuccess of ``The Silence of the Lambs,''
the 11 years that enthralled Harris fans have spent waiting to see
what happened next to Hannibal the Cannibal and FBI agent Clarice
Starling, the somehow-endearing monster's pursuer/soulmate, the
near-unprecedented media hype in the four months between when
Harris unexpectedly turned over the new novel to his publisher and
``Hannibal'' hit bookstores, have combined to make us expect
nothing less than a masterpiece, and ``Hannibal'' just isn't that.
Instead, it's decent work from a very talented writer who
eventually resorts to trickery and mechanical plot twists for a
flawed, unsatisfying conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Harris picks up the lives of Lecter and Starling seven years
after the not-so-good doctor disappeared after helping Starling
track down a nasty serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill. The
ensuing years have been better to the monster than the agent.
Lecter has resurfaced in Florence, Italy; there, as the mysterious
Dr. Fell, he has been named curator of an ancient library.
Lecter/Fell enjoys his new life; indeed, Harris notes, he has
``hardly killed anybody'' since arriving in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Starling, on the other hand, has been stymied in her career,
enduring a series of dead-end assignments thanks to the enmity of a
government official she alienated while pursuing Buffalo Bill and
her bad habit of saying things she shouldn't to supervisors.
``Hannibal'' begins with Starling participating in a drug raid that
turns bad; a master marksman, she kills five people before the
smoke clears, including a very bad mother who chooses to shoot it
out while cradling her infant son.
</P>
<P>
   Tabloid coverage alerts Lecter to Starling's professional
dilemma. He can't resist sending her a note. Although Lecter is
careful to conceal where he is, this new contact precipitates a
renewed effort to find him, and not just by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Mason Verger, an obscenely rich prior Lecter victim, once lost
much of his face and body to Hannibal the Cannibal. For years he
has nurtured an unhealthy appetite for revenge while alternately
indulging several other obscene hobbies involving small children.
Verger wants Lecter to suffer the same sort of tortuous indignities
and is willing to spend whatever it takes to get what he wants.
When the same government official who has persecuted Starling
becomes Verger's bribed minion, the pieces are in place for an
explosive, bloody outcome.
</P>
<P>
   What we get is heavy on the blood and light on the explosion.
Having created a new monster to join the Lecter/Starling dance,
Harris is unable to blend him into the story mix in any believable
way, even by the elastic boundaries of fiction. This is partly
because Harris is resorting to such an obvious literary trick: In
an attempt to keep Lecter sympathetic to readers, the author makes
Hannibal the target of an even greater monster. Lecter, Harris
wants us to assume, mutilates and/or kills only people ``who
really, really deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Harris' tendency, when scene-setting or
bloodletting, to change tenses in midparagraph. Action described in
the past tense suddenly is written about in the present; this is a
common device used by writers who want to emphasize certain
passages by interrupting reading rhythm. It's useful one or two
times in a book, but Harris tries it by the dozens, and after a
while it becomes annoying rather than mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   Do these things make ``Hannibal'' a bad book? Not at all. Thomas
Harris is an excellent writer, period. Some of his descriptive
passages, especially when introducing readers to Lecter's Florence,
are good enough to be carved in Italian marble. This author is
obviously a scholar; his references to writers, artists,
philosophers and poets both famous and obscure always ring true.
And Hannibal Lecter is a fine, unique character.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Hannibal'' is only a good book, not a fine one. Its
conclusion is a substantial disappointment, more convenient than
curious. To enjoy fiction, readers often have to suspend disbelief,
but Harris pushes that rule too far.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the reclusive author has to care. On its first morning
of publication, ``Hannibal'' was No. 1 on Amazon.com's bestseller
list. It will sell a million copies before fall. Film rights have
been sold for eight figures. Harris can buy Florence and all the
libraries in it if he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he could, and should, have done better. ``Hannibal'' is
an 80 percent effort by a 100 percent writer.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve nudged its benchmark interest
rate up by a quarter of a percentage point Wednesday, but said
there was no clear case for a further rate increase to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the overnight lending rate between banks, known
as the federal funds target rate, had been expected by economists
and investors for weeks. The rise, to 5 percent from 4.75 percent,
came after a series of three, one-quarter-point rate reductions the
central bank engineered last fall during the height of the global
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts expected the Federal Reserve to raise rates by
another quarter point at its next meeting in August, and they were
caught off guard by the suggestion from the central bank Wednesday
that there is no consensus on the need for another increase to slow
the economy's growth.
</P>
<P>
   That suggestion, in the form of a shift to a neutral stance from
a stance toward higher rates, was taken as a green light by
investors on Wall Street, who rapidly bid up stock and bond prices
in the belief that further rate increases this summer are now less
likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average surged after the central bank's
announcement, and closed at 10,970.80, up 155.45. The yield on the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, fell below 6 percent, closing at 5.96
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists warned that investors might have overreacted, and
said that the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility of
another rate increase as soon as August if the economy does not
show clear signs of cooling.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank left unchanged at 4.5 percent its discount rate
on loans to banks. Its quarter-point increase in the Federal funds
rate will put some upward pressure on loan rates for businesses and
consumer credit like auto and home-equity loans. Many large banks
raised their prime lending rates to 8 percent from 7.75 percent in
the hours after the completion of the two-day Federal Reserve
meeting Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But interest rates set directly or indirectly in the financial
markets, like those on mortgages and corporate bonds, will depend
on whether investors judge that the prospects for further
tightening by the Federal Reserve have been diminished and that
inflation is no threat.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has warned over
the last several months that although there is almost no inflation
now, there is an increasing risk that continued robust growth could
push wages and then prices into an upward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Economic indicators have given mixed signals in recent weeks
about the prospects of slowing, and analysts said the Federal
Reserve's shift to a neutral stance Wednesday meant that the
central bank will wait for more data before deciding how to
proceed, not that it is finished tightening policy for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to signal to the market that they haven't
prejudged the next move,'' said William Dudley, an economist at
Goldman Sachs. ``In the end the decision is going to be dependent
on the economic environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said they now expected the Federal Reserve to
tighten policy only when it has tangible evidence of brewing
inflationary pressures, not just an expectation of them.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining its decision, the Federal Reserve's policymaking
Federal Open Market Committee remained open to what has become
known as the ``new age'' economic paradigm: that massive
investments in computers and other technology have made businesses
so much more efficient that the economy can run at much higher
levels than in the past, and at lower rates of unemployment,
without generating inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters,
but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary
pressures,'' the committee said. ``Owing to the uncertain
resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy
going forward, the FOMC has chosen to adopt a directive that
includes no predilection about near-term policy action.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement went on, however, to emphasize that the Fed's
tolerance for strong growth and low unemployment had its limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee nonetheless recognizes that in the current
dynamic environment, it must be especially alert to the emergence,
or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that might undermine
growth,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Fed cut rates three times last fall, the economy has
accelerated, and the financial crisis that started in Asia and
spread around the world has abated. The central bank justified the
rate increase Wednesday in those terms, saying ``the full degree''
of last fall's rate reductions is ``no longer necessary'' to keep
financial markets well oiled and the economy in the United States
on an even keel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, the shift to a neutral policy stance is
no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates when it
next meets on Aug. 24. The central bank has traditionally moved
back to a neutral bias after raising rates even when another rate
increase seems likely. It maintained a neutral stance in 1994, for
example, even as it was doubling the Federal funds rate from 3
percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around the Fed is disclosing its policy bias
publicly after each meeting. In 1994, and until earlier this year,
it kept the bias a secret until after the subsequent policy
meeting, meaning that the central bank was not using it to signal
its intentions to the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Fed's intentions, the market's response Wednesday
was to send stock prices higher, making consumers feel that much
wealthier and willing to spend, and to bring down bond yields,
providing a kick to the economy that could well offset whatever
slowing effect its increase in official short-term rates
accomplishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the process of making this announcement, the Fed has
greatly reduced the odds that the economy is going to slow down,'
said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago. ``The fear of Greenspan has been removed from the
financial markets. That means the restrictiveness on the economy
that had been put in place based on the expectation of higher rates
has been removed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investors could reassess their initial reaction in coming days,
as they often do when it comes to the Federal Reserve's hints about
policy. But they are most likely to take their cue from key
indicators of growth and inflation in coming weeks, starting with
job creation and the unemployment rate for June on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an array of politicians and business executives who had
been pressuring Greenspan to show restraint in slowing the economy
given the absence of inflation took heart from the Fed's signals
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the dearth of inflation and strong but steady growth,
today's decision was, in my judgment, an error, but a minor one,''
said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, which has long argued that the economy's potential
for non-inflationary growth is much higher than the Fed recognizes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reich, the former labor secretary in the Clinton
administration, said the Fed had ``exercised restraint'' in its
rate increase, but said the central bank has yet to recognize that
it should not sacrifice growth and jobs to fighting inflation that
does not yet exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The metaphor suggesting that a little inflation is like the
genie out of the bottle is simply wrong,'' Reich said. ``We know
empirically that inflation can be stopped. More to the point, the
lag between when the Fed acts and the response in the economy is
actually very small, because financial markets are extraordinarily
efficient and respond very quickly.''

WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS NOT SHARING IN ECONOMIC BOOM: STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- While dramatic growth in local technology and
knowledge-based industries has spurred an economic boom pushing the
Boston area far ahead of the national average, a study released
Wednesday suggests the windfall has not fully reached the rest of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The report, conducted by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation
_ a nonprofit organization that analyzes government spending and
the economy _ found the state is composed of two ``sharply
distinctive'' economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency to assume that if the eastern
Massachusetts economy is booming . . . it means it is happening
across the state,'' said Michael J. Widmer, president of the
foundation. ``This study shows that the two different economies
need to think differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater Boston, the so-called ``inside Route 495'' sector, is
powered by high-tech and knowledge-intensive industries, including
management consulting, software, private universities, money
management, insurance, and high-tech manufacturing, which have
proved to be big money makers.
</P>
<P>
   The second economy, ``outer Massachusetts'' _ areas north, west,
and south of Interstate 495 _ has an economic base similar to the
rest of the nation, which is dependent largely on older
manufacturing industries that have not been the recipients of such
striking prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   While unemployment in the Boston area has hovered near record
lows, hitting 2.5 percent in May, other parts of the state posted
higher joblessness: 3.8 percent in Pittsfield, 4.1 percent in
Lawrence, and 5.2 percent in New Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowledge-based industries make up a stunning 79 percent of
the Greater Boston economic base, compared to 44 percent in the
rest of the state and 42 percent in the nation as a whole,''
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   The survey suggested that some of Boston's knowledge-based
industry growth has begun to spill over to the rest of the state,
but not enough to make up for the great economic losses incurred
during the '80s recession.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Ann Economics president Edward Moscovitch, the study's
consultant, said both regions have recovered at relatively the same
rate, with strong employment growth, but outer Massachusetts has
not reached its prerecession employment level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I understood quite how dramatically the rest of
the state had been hurt by the recession,'' Moscovitch said,
highlighting one reason he says it is significant to view the state
as two economies. In some parts of the state, he said, the
``employment rate dropped by 25 percent _ that's what the Great
Depression was.''
</P>
<P>
   Western Massachusetts politicians say this is not news to them.
The difference between the two economies must be acknowledged in
policy-making issues, they say, because they have very different
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are basically two different economies, and it is the
Boston economy that drives everything'' on Beacon Hill, said state
Representative Daniel E. Bosley, a Democrat from North Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to ensure that we take into consideration the outer
reaches of the state. There are very different economic dynamics
and problems,'' Bosley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Nakosteen, a professor at the University of
Massachusetts-Boston, said Boston's economy is stunningly strong
because of its remarkable ability to support new industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been much more difficult to turn those other areas
around,'' Nakosteen said. In the outer areas of the state ``most of
the people that are unemployed or underemployed can't find the work
they want, while Boston can't find enough workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists, though, point out that pockets of outer
Massachusetts have been able to support technology-based economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is quite as simple as inside 495 and outside
495,'' said Alan Clayton Matthews, an economics professor at
UMass-Boston. ``The boom has spread past 495, but hasn't reached
the edges of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the state's central cities have gained ground.
Unemployment for May was 2.9 percent in Worcester and 3.2 percent
in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Outer Massachusetts needs knowledge-based industries to invest
in its communities to create the type of economic growth now
visible in the Boston area, said state Senator Mark C. Montigny, a
New Bedford Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government should be targeting the economic resources of
the private sector and bring them to the outlying areas,'' said
Montigny, chairman of the Senate's Ways of Means Committee.

BUSH SHATTERS FUND-RAISING RECORDS, BASKS IN LIMELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush stunned the
political community Wednesday with news that his presidential
campaign so far has raised $36.25 million _ a record for a
presidential primary race and an amount that could spell the end
for some of his less financially fortunate GOP rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is beyond expectation,'' a clearly pleased Bush said in Los
Angeles on the final day of the second campaign reporting period of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am humbled by the response,'' said Bush, who was midway
through a money-raising campaign swing across California.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can imagine, I'm amazed at the outpouring of support.
This is a campaign that has got a wide range of people what are
willing to help. People from all around the country. I am
gratified, and that's that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And campaign officials noted that the second-quarter total
certainly will increase once all the last-minute contributions are
counted.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has been accused by some of riding on his famous
family name and being vague on the issues, his ability to spin hay
into gold has astonished political observers.
</P>
<P>
   In just four months, Bush has raked in more money than any other
candidate has raised during an entire presidential primary race.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole received $31.3 million in
contributions during an 18-month period in the last presidential
primary, while President Clinton raised $29 million in the same
period, according to Federal Election Commission figures released
by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And by this time in the 1996 race, Clinton had raised $19.5
million, Dole had $13.6 million and Texas Sen. Phil Gramm reported
$11.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   While it was all smiles for Bush staff members on the campaign
trail Wednesday, other GOP presidential campaigns had less
breathtaking news to report.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole had raised between $2 million and $4 million,
former Vice President Dan Quayle had gathered about $3.1 million,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona had less than $5 million and
businessman Steve Forbes and social conservative leader Gary Bauer
each have raised between $2 million and $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio had $1.6 million, former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander had raised more than $2 million and
Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire had received about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore had received up
to $18.5 million so far, and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
has surpassed expectations by raising a little more than $11.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's money came from 75,600 contributors who gave an average
of about $500, according to Don Evans, his finance chairman and
long-time friend. He raised nearly $8 million in the first quarter
and $28.3 million in the second quarter, which ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was very good to its native son. About 30 percent of all
donors were from the Lone Star state and more than a third of the
money _ $11.9 million _ came from Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Federal campaign finance laws limit donations to each candidate
to $1,000 for individuals and $5,000 for political action
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unprecedented. There never has been anything like it
in the history of American politics,'' Evans said. ``I think what
this says is there's a lot of people starved for leadership in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the money still pouring in, Bush may decide to forego
accepting federal matching funds _ a move that would allow him to
raise an unlimited amount of money for his primary campaign. Bush
said he would make that decision in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in Los Angeles what he attributed the record support
to, Bush quipped: ``A wonderful personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hungry for something, and I am gratified,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined to urge his GOP rivals to quit now while
they're behind and endorse his candidacy instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I encourage them to give it their best shot,'' he said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush continued to flex his money-raising muscles Wednesday in
vote-rich California, which is considered strong Democratic
territory. He raised $2.3 million Tuesday night at a Los Angeles
event, and fund-raisers were held Wednesday in Sacramento and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, he visited a south-central Los Angeles
elementary school where a non-profit, public-private partnership
program is retraining teachers in an effort to maximize technology
benefits in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Bush toured the school and briefly spoke to teachers. One of
them, Desiree McNeal, said she was so impressed by Bush's remarks
about educating all children that she may vote for him, even though
she has never before supported a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I wasn't open to him at all because I'm a Democrat,''
she said. ``Now that I heard him speak, I think maybe he does
(care.)''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also held his first extensive news conference of his
California trip, repeating earlier comments that he will not rule
out selecting a vice presidential candidate who favors abortion
rights, even though he opposes abortion except in cases of race,
incest and protecting the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   He also defended himself against critics who say he doesn't have
the background to be president _ a criticism that was fueled last
week when he mixed up the small European countries of Slovenia and
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I mispronounce the name of a country doesn't mean
I don't understand how to lead,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in Sacramento, Bush played football in the blazing heat
with youths involved in a mentoring program. On the first play,
Bush, playing quarterback, barked: ``66-77-36D25, hut, hut.''
</P>
<P>
   He then lofted a touchdown pass to former Heisman Trophy winner
Tim Brown, who now plays for the Oakland Raiders.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Both the stock and bond markets rallied Wednesday
after investors got a surprise they liked from the Federal Reserve.
The central bank signaled that a quarter-point increase in its
short-term interest rate target could be enough to keep inflation
in check.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 21.21 points, or
1.57 percent, to a new high of 1,372.66. The Nasdaq composite index
climbed 44.01 points, or 1.66 percent, to a new high of 2,686.12.
The S&AMP;P's previous high was in May and the Nasdaq's in late April,
both just before the Fed indicated, after its May policy meeting,
that a rate increase was in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 210 points in the 13
minutes after the 2:15 p.m. announcement and finished the day at
10,970.80, up 155.45 points, or 1.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the price of the 30-year bond jumped 1 9/32,
to 90 6/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction
from the price, fell to 5.96 percent from 6.06 percent on Tuesday.
The yield on the 2-year note, which is more sensitive to Fed
interest rates moves, dropped to 5.52 percent from 5.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed announcement also had a calming effect on much more
vulnerable emerging markets, especially in Latin America. Brazil's
Bovespa index jumped more than 300 points after the news, to close
up 2.2 percent. More important, interest rates on emerging market
bonds dropped sharply in comparison to rates on comparable U.S.
Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy makers, meeting in Washington, announced that they
had raised their target for the Federal funds rate, which is the
interest on overnight loans between banks, to 5 percent from 4.75
percent. That move was expected and led several major banks to
raise their prime lending rates a quarter-point to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Fed surprised investors by shifting its
interest rate outlook. Policy makers are now neutral, rather than
leaning toward higher interest rates, as they were coming into
Wednesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts argued that the Fed's announcement does not
mean there will not be another rate increase. That will depend on
how fast the economy continues to grow and how tame inflation
remains.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer
confidence index in June jumped to its highest level in more than
30 years, an indication that consumers may keep spending.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rally in copper, which jumped to a 1999 high of 75.95
cents a pound Wednesday, could be reflecting a worldwide economic
rebound and put some more pressure on prices, at the same time.
Also Wednesday, the price of oil for August delivery broke out of
an eight-week trading rage to a 1999 high of $19.29 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Some more indications on economic growth will come Thursday,
with the release by the National Association of Purchasing Managers
of its manufacturing index for the nation, and on Friday with the
employment data for June.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the rally in interest rates since last week could
keep key rates _ like those for mortgages _ from rising much more,
a fact that would make a significant slowdown in growth less
likely. The yield on the 10-year note Wednesday was 5.78 percent, a
quarter-point below its recent high and less than a quarter-point
above where it was when the Fed gave its May signal of an interest
rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a little bit of this celebration is unwarranted,''
said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at NationsBanc
Montgomery Securities.

UNITED NATIONS STARTS DEBATE ON POPULATION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The General Assembly on Wednesday began
debating an action plan first drawn up five years ago to limit
world population growth, although developing countries remained
deeply divided over some aspects of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the plan _ which seeks to freeze the world's population,
now 6 billion, at 9.8 billion in 2050 by improving the status of
women _ is accepted and currently being put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   But a small group of conservative Muslim and Roman Catholic
third-world countries, backed by the Vatican, continues to oppose
certain aspects.
</P>
<P>
   During negotiations Wednesday those countries, which include
Libya, Egypt, Argentina, Sudan and Nicaragua, pressed on with their
campaign to water down provisions calling for safe abortions, sex
education in schools and contraceptive advice for young people.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening address to this special session of the Assembly,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan recounted some of the progress made in
population control since the first world population conference held
in Bucharest 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that the average family size in
third-world nations had fallen from five children to less than
three. And he said that today 60 percent of couples practice family
planning as opposed to 30 percent then. And infant mortality rates
have improved from 140 per thousand to 80.
</P>
<P>
   But the world's population is still rising by 78 million every
year and much more needs to be done, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stabilize the population of this planet,'' the
secretary-general said. ``Quite simply, there is a limit to the
pressures our global environment can stand.''

PEACE TALKS CONTINUE PAST DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ The deadline to find a compromise to create a
power-sharing government in Northern Ireland passed without
agreement Wednesday night, but British and Irish leaders pressed on
into the morning seeking a deal to revive the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant unionists would not budge on their refusal to form a
government with Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political
wing, until the IRA begins turning in arms, while Sinn Fein was
unable to get a formal commitment from the IRA that it would begin
disarming.
</P>
<P>
   While the absence of an agreement does not bode well for the
future stability of Northern Ireland, there was no indication that
there would be an immediate return to widespread violence.
</P>
<P>
   According to British and Irish government officials, Sinn Fein
had promised that it would try to persuade the IRA to turn in
weapons. But that ``aspiration'' was deemed insufficient by the
Ulster Unionists, the party that represents middle-class
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for a form of words. I'm looking for guns and
explosives,'' said Jefferey Donaldson, the hardliner who last week
rejoined the Ulster Unionist negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, emerged from the
negotiations 90 minutes before the midnight deadline to say that
the unionist demand for weapons before the formation of a
power-sharing cabinet to run Northern Ireland was unrealistic, and
not part of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to everyone that prior decommissioning is not
achievable,'' said Adams, using the common term here for
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Adams spoke, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble
took his place before hundreds of reporters outside the Castle
Buildings complex where the Good Friday Agreement was reached last
year, denying that Sinn Fein had committed itself to disarming the
IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``No such precise offer has been made to us,'' he said. ``We've
seen nothing in writing, nothing concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble had earlier hinted that a statement from the IRA
commiting itself to turning in arms might be enough to cement a
deal, but there was no prospect of that statement being made.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, government sources said, the IRA has indicated to the
British and Irish governments that Sinn Fein would have to be
sitting in the government for about three months before it would
have any realistic chance of persuading IRA members to turn in
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal that was still on the table early Thursday,
Sinn Fein would formally accept disarming the IRA as an objective,
and the 12-member cabinet, including two Sinn Fein members, would
be named next week. That cabinet, and the whole Northern Ireland
Assembly, would sit in September, assuming power for running
Northern Ireland for the first time in 27 years. The IRA would then
be expected to begin turning in arms by early December.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, British Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke to
President Clinton by telephone, and Clinton was expected to talk to
various party leaders throughout the night in an attempt to coax
them toward a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The round-the-clock negotiations in a drab office building on
the finely manicured grounds of Stormont in East Belfast mirrored
the ones that led to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which
created a settlement aimed at ending 30 years of sectarian and
political conflict that has killed more than 3,500 people in the
place the size of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   This week's negotiations were meant to save the cornerstone of
that agreement, the creation of a power-sharing government to take
power back after 27 years of direct rule from London.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, set Wednesday
night's deadline, believing that politicians would put off making
hard decisions unless forced to. They spent the last three days
trying to cajole both Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   While government officials consider Sinn Fein's commitment to
the principle of disarming the IRA by next May a compromise,
unionists said it was an empty promise they had heard before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need something tangible,'' said Stephen King, an aide to
Ulster Unionist deputy leader John Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Trimble and Taylor met with Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, in
an attempt to iron out their differences. But the Sinn Fein offer
was rejected as not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the discouraging turn to negotiations, the British
government official in charge of security, Adam Ingram, said that
the cease-fires by the main paramilitary groups remain intact.
Ingram said the Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal group, will be
expected to maintain order Sunday when it stages a parade that will
be blocked from marching through a Catholic neighborhood in
Portadown. That parade poses the most immediate threat to public
order.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point had been the refusal of the Ulster
Unionists to form a power-sharing government with members of Sinn
Fein before the IRA begins turning in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein argued that the Good Friday Agreement does not link
its participation in government with the decommissioning of IRA
weapons, and the IRA said turning in weapons would amount to a
surrender it did not make.
</P>
<P>
   But the unionists, led by Trimble, the first minister of the new
assembly, said they could not create a democratic government while
one of the main parties was maintaining a private army.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said the republican movement had to decide whether it
would follow Sinn Fein or the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movement must decide, does it prefer the party or the
arm,'' said Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said it was ``D-Day'' for politicians to decide whether
they were going to implement the Good Friday Agreement. Adams and
Sinn Fein contend that if the agreement is implemented as written,
the local government will sit before the IRA is obligated to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, leaders of the IRA's Army Council, its seven-member
ruling body, and leaders of loyalist paramilitary groups met with
British and Irish government officials who were seeking assurances
that they would turn in weapons by next May.

ISSUE COMES DOWN TO THE SAME STICKING POINT: GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ The war may be over in Northern Ireland, but the
fighting is not. In Ireland, it always comes down to guns.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement,
life for ordinary people in Northern Ireland has never been better,
and yet the peace process is stalled. The formation of a
power-sharing cabinet, which will return local government for the
first time since it was suspended in 1972 at the height of the
Troubles, is being held up by a dispute over the IRA's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant unionists, led by David Trimble, the first minister
of the new local parliament, say that democracy cannot take root
when one of the main political traditions, in this case
republicanism, maintains an armed wing. Trimble argues persuasively
that the IRA has to do more than say it is committed to seeking a
united Ireland through democratic means. If the republican movement
has given up the armed struggle, Trimble asks, what does it need
arms for?
</P>
<P>
   But the Good Friday Agreement does not link disarmament to the
setting up of the cabinet, nor does it make the disarmament a
prerequisite for two members of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, to take their seats in that cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams argues just as persuasively as
Trimble that his party won those seats in a democratic election,
and are entitled to take them.
</P>
<P>
   Now that violence has been largely contained, the dispute over
what to do with the IRA's weapons illustrates Northern Ireland's
real problem: the lack of trust.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Friday Agreement is often called a peace treaty, but it
is really a political settlement. It established political
institutions and set in motion a series of events, such as the
release of paramilitary prisoners, the creation of cross-border
bodies to represent mutual interests on the island, and the reform
of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, all of which are crucial to
giving Northern Ireland a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   Besides guaranteeing that Northern Ireland will remain part of
the United Kingdom as long as a majority of its citizens want, the
agreement allows unionists the opportunity to maintain that
majority by convincing enough nationalists that their rights and
aspirations will be respected, and their standard of living higher,
in Northern Ireland. But it also affords nationalists the chance to
convince unionists that a united Ireland makes more sense
economically and culturally, that unionists who account for less
than 2 percent of the British population would have improved status
and representation in a united Ireland where they accounted for 20
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   What the agreement did not do, however, was create trust. The
unionists don't believe the republicans when the latter say they
have given up violence as the way to achieve a united Ireland.
Unionists, wary of the double speak they believe to be a cultural
trait of Catholics, say some IRA members will go back to war if the
scope and pace of change is not to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   The republicans don't believe the unionists when they say that
they have learned from the past, when institutional discrimination
and gerrymandering consigned Catholic nationalists to second-class
citizenship. They see the unionist obsession with the IRA's weapons
as a contrived objection.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists can't seem to understand the deep mistrust that not
only republicans but nationalists of all stripes have of them. Many
don't accept that they discriminated against Catholic nationalists.
They don't see as a double standard that while they are calling for
the IRA's guns to be turned in, more than 100,000 legally-held guns
exist in Northern Ireland, nearly all in the hands of unionist
civilians. Unionists consider those privately and legally held guns
necessary protection.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just what republicans and loyalists who hold guns
illegally consider their weapons _ protection against each other
and against the Irish and British governments, which they trust
only slightly more than each other.
</P>
<P>
   The unionist determination to make the surrender of weapons a
condition for formation of the executive plays right into the hands
of cynics within the IRA who believe the peace process is a con,
that despite all the flowery rhetoric about parity of esteem and a
new way of doing things in Northern Ireland, the unionists still
hold a veto and still always get their way.
</P>
<P>
   But the refusal of the IRA to make even a token gesture on
weapons plays right into the hands of the unionist naysayers who
have tried to sabotage the peace process at every turn by claiming
that the IRA is playing a game in which it will go back to war as
soon as it has wrung every conceivable concession out of the
British and Irish governments.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA argues that turning in its weapons would be tantamount
to a surrender it did not make. The IRA also points out that none
of its previous incarnations were forced to give up guns when they
said they had decided to pursue politics.
</P>
<P>
   Within the IRA, weapons take on a quasi-religious quality. In
1969, when the Troubles exploded, loyalist mobs simply walked in
and took over Catholic neighborhoods in Belfast. Nationalist
families were burned out while the mostly Protestant police stood
back and did nothing. The IRA, which had been dormant for years,
consisted of a bunch of old men with a few rusty guns. Graffitti
went up in nationalist areas suggesting that IRA stood for I Ran
Away.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy-handed treatment by police of civil rights marchers
and the refusal of the police to stop loyalists while
simultaneously cracking down on nationalists breathed life back
into the new Provisional IRA, which built up an arsenal and vowed
never to be caught unarmed again. The humiliation of being caught
unarmed had a profound effect on the IRA. It believes that without
weapons it is out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists say that until the IRA is out of business, there will
be no real democracy in Northern Ireland.

BRUCE WOOD PREMIERES PIECE SET TO GERSHWIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Two years after moving to Fort Worth from
Austin, modern dance choreographer Bruce Wood, 38, expands in two
new directions this weekend with a pair of premieres at Bass
Performance Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It's been an up-and-down year for the Bruce Wood Dance Company,
a midsize modern-dance troupe that keeps 10 dancers employed full
time. Cancellation of a performance at the Majestic Theatre in
Dallas last fall was followed by successful events in Fort Worth at
Bass Performance Hall. Wood continues to occupy a special slot on
the local dance scene _ not competing with the classical Fort Worth
Dallas Ballet, and working with a higher budget and bigger ambition
for national recognition than the older Contemporary Dance Fort
Worth and Jubilee African American Dance Ensemble, the city's other
major modern dance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wood holds to the dream of establishing a company that will tour
internationally from a Fort Worth base.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the two premieres on the weekend program was
commissioned through the Bass Performance Hall Education Program.
Setting ``Rhapsody in Blue'' to the famous score by Gershwin was a
challenge for Wood, who had never had a commission involving a
specific piece of music.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Buratto and Stephen Seleny, who direct the education
program, gave Wood a list of 15 concert works to choose from; he
wrote proposals for five works, and Buratto and Seleny settled on
the Gershwin. After its premiere this weekend, the work will be
performed for schoolchildren, starting in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never set anything 18 minutes long straight through,''
Wood says. ``It took me a while to get into it. I had to dig a
little deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood describes the result as technical and difficult for the
dancers, and as less commercial than previous settings of this
immensely popular music.
</P>
<P>
   The tango-based music of Astor Piazzolla, the Argentine composer
who died in 1992 and who has since become one of the most
frequently performed composers in Europe and America, provided the
inspiration for the other new work, ``Zero Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly erotic, with the female dancers costumed in underwear,
``Zero Hour'' is described by Wood as ``stark, brutal and edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   The one borrowed work on the program is ``Waiting for Sunrise,''
a setting of '50s music by renowned modern-dance choreographer Lars
Lubovitch, with whom Wood worked in New York.

COURT BACKS RIGHT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL IN GUN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a first-in-the-nation ruling that shook the
ever-shifting legal ground on gun control, the state's highest
court ruled Wednesday that the state Attorney General has the right
to impose safety measures on gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision by the state Supreme Judicial Court paves
the way for the implementation of restrictions banning the sale of
cheap handguns and requiring safety locks and hard-to-pull
triggers.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the regulations were bolstered by a state gun
control law enacted last year, the ruling expands the Attorney
General's independent power to impose such restrictions on guns,
which have not been held to the same consumer safety standards
imposed on other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first court in the country to hold that an attorney
general has that power,'' said Dennis Henigan, legal counsel for
the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in Washington. ``It is
significant nationally because many states have similar consumer
protection statutes directed at the prevention of unfair trade
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an ominous ruling for the gun industry, which has
continued to beat back gun control and safety measures in Congress
in recent weeks and in several state legislatures which have passed
laws prohibiting cities from suing the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling underscored the authority of the Attorney
General to apply consumer safety laws to guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problems in this area are that this could give
encouragement to other attorneys general,'' said Robert Ricker,
executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council, the
Georgia-based gun industry trade group that sued to block
implementation of the gun safety guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``And also, it's going to complicate any attempt by the
Massachusetts state legislature to correct or streamline what was
done last year,'' Ricker said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly said the decision recognizes
the power of his office to bring common-sense safety precautions to
the sale of handguns. The safety regulations were imposed by his
predecessor, Scott Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the case itself will return to the Superior Court to work
out some of the actual details -- whether it be childproofing or
requiring that so called `junk guns' be prohibited in this state,''
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricker and other industry spokesmen say that they simply
have not come up with designs that could make a gun child-proof _
as the regulations would require _ or to create locks that keep a
gun out of criminal hands without limiting the owner's
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   If upheld, the regulations could address some of the same
concerns voiced by Boston public health officials and politicians
in cities nationwide who are suing the gun industry to force design
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Welsh, Mayor Thomas M. Menino's policy and planning
director, said the city's suit against gun manufacturers would move
forward, even if tougher safety regulations are adopted because the
city wants to prevent the flow of illegal weapons from other states
with looser laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We claim there's clearly a distribution scheme to flood our
markets with guns that are cheap, easily concealable, and that
don't have safety devices on them,'' said Welsh. ``There's any
number of contiguous states in the country that have absolutely no
regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Harshbarger broke new ground in issuing consumer
protection regulations aimed at banning cheap so-called Saturday
night specials, as well as guns without traceable serial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations also call for child-safe designs, such as
triggers too stiff for a child to pull, and for safety measures
such as an indicator showing the number of cartridges left in the
gun to reduce accidental shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're common-sense safety provisions to deal with
childproofing and trigger locks and safe guns for law-abiding
owners,'' Harshbarger said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects both the will of the legislature and the power of
the attorney general to deal with these issues in a common sense
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the day before the regulations were to be
phased in, the American Shooting Sports Council filed suit,
claiming that the attorney general did not have the authority to
dictate the design and manufacture of products, and that some
regulations conflicted with existing federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Suffolk Superior Court Judge Diane Kottmyer issued
a preliminary injunction blocking the implementation of the
regulations, saying that Harshbarger had overstepped his bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC Wednesday overturned that injunction in a 21-page
decision that sent the case back to Superior Court for further
hearings.

TELLABS TO PAY $575M FOR NETCORE SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within two months of shipping its first product, Netcore Systems
Inc., a 2 1/2-year old developer of data switches to handle
Internet traffic for both long distance and regional telephone
companies, Wednesday said it will be acquired by Tellabs Inc., for
$575 million in Tellab stock.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Netcore, of Wilimington, Mass., is the latest in
a flurry of consolidation moves by major telephone equipment makers
to acquire the next generation of technology that combines voice,
data, and video. Just last Friday, Lucent Technologies Inc.
announced it was spending $900 million to acquire Nexabit Networks
Inc. of Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known Tellabs for more than a year and believe that our
products and technology are an excellent fit with their
equipment,'' said Ash Dahood, Netcore's founder and chief
executive, who will remain at the company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal catapults Lisle, Ill.-based Tellabs into the big
leagues with Lucent Technologies Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp. to
compete against Cisco Systems, the leading supplier of
sophisticated devices called routers that are sold to phone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   With Netcore's product, called the Everest Integrated Switch,
Tellabs will be able to send ``packets'' of voice and data traffic
using either an existing technology called asynchronous transfer
mode, or ATM, on a single network or the newer Internet protocol
technology, or IP, which is easier and less expensive to maintain
than current circuit-switched networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Netcore, Tellabs will be able to go to the regional
telephone companies who are transitioning into the ATM switching
and IP routing over the next 10 years,'' said Polina Ialamova, a
telecommunications analyst at Madison Securities in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   For Netcore investors, the Tellabs acquisition is also a
lucrative deal. Of the $35 million invested in Netcore, Matrix
Partners of Waltham, Mass. was both the early and lead investor.
Its nearly $8 million investment in Netcore is now worth about $100
million in Tellabs stock, according to Andrew Marcuvitz, a general
partner at Matrix.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrific return for us, but then these are strange
times and we are happy to be part of it,'' said Marcuvitz, who
recalled that six months ago, both companies were in negotiations
when Tellabs broke off discussions ``and did not want to take the
plunge.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, several deals between Tellabs'competitors and small
telecommunicaitons suppliers were completed and in April, Tellabs
announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Company president Brian J. Jackman
has stated that he expects sales to triple from $1.67 billion last
year to $6 billion by 2003. Last January, Tellabs officials said
the company would make at least one acquisition, after it failed to
acquire Ciena Corp., a fast-growing telecom networking equipment
maker, in a highly publicized courtship. That failed purchase
raised questions about whether Tellabs would have new routing
technology to compete with larger rivals like Lucent and Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said Wednesday's belated acquisition of
Netcore helped answer those questions. Jackman said the purchase
will dilute the company's per-share earnings by between 1 cent and
2 cents this year. However, Netcore's contribution to earnings in
2000 will have a neutral to slighlty positive impact.
</P>
<P>
   Tellabs shares, which have risen 97 percent this year, closed
Wednesday at 67 9/16, down 1 13/16.

HOUSE ACTION PUTS FLAG, FIRST AMENDMENT ON A COLLISION COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 4)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Shoot if you must this old gray head, but spare
your country's flag,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did Barbara Frietchie cry out against desecration of Old
Glory as Stonewall Jackson marched his Confederate soldiers through
Frederick, Md., a town whose residents were sharply divided in
their sympathies between North and South.
</P>
<P>
   Poet John Greenleaf Whittier recorded Jackson's response to the
elderly woman's fervent appeal:
</P>
<P>
   ```Who touches a hair of yon gray head/ Dies like a dog! March
on!' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident has become a thrilling part of America's folklore
although there are serious questions about the historical accuracy
of Whittier's account.
</P>
<P>
   Like Francis Scott Key's graphic description of the Star
Spangled Banner weathering the British bombardment of Baltimore's
Fort McHenry during the War of 1812, Whittier's poetry defined for
all time the flag as a symbol of American defiance against those
who would destroy the Union.
</P>
<P>
   We have other symbols with equally powerful meanings. One of
them, the First Amendment, has stood for more than 200 years as a
firm protector of the freedom of speech, religion, the press and
the right of assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Now those two great symbols _ the flag and the First Amendment _
are on a collision course with each other.
</P>
<P>
   The substance of the conflict is whether mutilation of the flag,
which has become a practice of rebels who disapprove of actions
taken by the federal government, is an act deserving of punishment
before the law or whether it is protected by the First Amendment as
an act of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   By a 305-to-124 vote, the House has approved a constitutional
amendment which would permit Congress to draft legislation banning
desecration of the flag. Since that tally is larger than the
two-thirds vote required for approval of proposed amendments, the
measure has moved to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   If it also can muster a two-thirds vote of approval, it then
will be up to three fourths of the state legislatures to give their
assent. If that happens, legislation banning desecration of the
flag could become law.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, which has failed to muster a two-thirds vote of
approval for anti-flag-burning amendments in recent years, is
expected to vote on the issue later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Not many Americans realize this weekend, as we celebrate the
223rd anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of
Independence, that two of our most honored institutions could
conflict with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the flag nor freedom of speech is mentioned in the
Declaration of Independence, but both became symbols of American
liberty when the founding fathers were forging a republic from 13
newly freed British colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Since the flag is a visible symbol of America's struggle to
maintain its liberty and its opposition to tyranny, more Americans
probably feel protective of the Stars and Stripes than worry about
the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most thrilling experiences for visitors to the
Washington area is spending time at the Marine Memorial, with its
bronze figures depicting the raising of the Stars and Stripes on
Iwo Jima in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   And we are seeing more and more presidential hopefuls
surrounding themselves with billowing flags and red-white-and-blue
bunting that proclaim their love of the Star Spangled Banner.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment, however, is not a visible symbol. It is
part of our Constitution, which is our Bible of democracy, but is
not something citizens can see each day or something that excites
them to patriotic fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the amendment is as important as the flag.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, however, a classic clash between liberals and
conservatives. In 1989, when the Supreme Court struck down
anti-flag burning legislation as unconstitutional, two of the most
conservative justices, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, were
part of the five-member majority.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being political conservatives, appointed to the
court by Ronald Reagan, they are advocates of what is often
described as ``strict construction'' of the Constitution and
respect for the ``original intent'' of the founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike such giants of the recent past as Chief Justice Earl
Warren and Associate Justices Hugo Black and William Brennan, the
conservative justices believe the court should limit itself to
interpreting the Constitution rather than expanding its precepts
into new laws.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is an old one. We who served our country in the
military in time of war have an especially warm place in our hearts
for the flag we defended. But we should remember that the First
Amendment embodies values for which we fought, including a
guarantee to the right to oppose government actions openly, angrily
and sometimes obnoxiously.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, as former Attorney General Richard Thornburgh once told
a group of us, legislation can be written to protect both the flag
and free speech. If so, we should follow that course. If not, we
should oppose efforts to weaken the First Amendment, which is basic
to the American way of life.

KINGS CAUTIOUS ABOUT FREE AGENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ROGER PHILLIPS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' power play was impotent last season, rushing
defenseman Steve Duchesne is looking for a contract, and NHL
free-agency begins today.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Kings leapt at the opportunity, committing $15
million over four years to Duchesne. This year, given an identical
situation, the Kings will pass on the disappointing Duchesne,
operating under the premise that one $4.25-million buyout in a
lifetime is one too many.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Kings are expected to be extremely judicious this
year during the NHL's free-agent shopping season. They won't sign
Duchesne, and they aren't expected to pursue any unrestricted free
agent who is seeking an expensive long-term commitment.
</P>
<P>
   But then, with Colorado's Theo Fleury far and away the most
impressive talent available, the list is not nearly as tantalizing
as a year ago, when Brett Hull, Doug Gilmour, Ron Francis and
Curtis Joseph topped the slate of unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're interested in a long-term contract for an
older guy,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor said this week. ``I
don't think we're going to be signing an older guy to a five-year
deal. Those contracts in general have not been good for the teams.
We don't have glaring weaknesses at this point but there may be a
couple of areas where we can upgrade ourselves. The biggest need
coming out of last season was to upgrade the offense, and I think
we've done that (by trading with the New York Islanders two weeks
ago for star right wing Zigmund Palffy).''
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean Taylor will be completely inactive. Taylor
said he would like to improve the Kings' skill, speed and grit on
the third and fourth lines, and if he can do so through free agency
without making a long-term commitment, he will pursue the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   One player who would fill Taylor's criteria on the ice (but
probably is seeking a lengthier, more expensive commitment than the
Kings are willing to give) is right wing Pat Verbeek of the Stanley
Cup champion Dallas Stars. Verbeek, 35, made $3.2 million this
season. Taylor was not at liberty to discuss other teams' players
for fear of tampering charges, so there was no comment on whether
the Kings would be interested in Verbeek. ``I can't say we're going
to sign any players,'' Taylor said, ``but I think we're going to
talk to agents and investigate every possibility. If there's a
chance to improve the club and it makes sense, we'll move forward.
It would have to make financial sense as well as the help it would
give us on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to upgrade our team speed and our team
skill. In the past, we've had a lot of big players and gritty
players, but they were not overly mobile. If we can add somebody
into the mix who brings skill but also adds a physical element, I
think that would be a good addition.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the unrestricted free agents, numerous restricted
free agents hit the market today, though no significant ones will
change uniforms for a very simple reason: If they sign an offer
sheet with another team, their team will be certain to match it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the prominent restricted free agents are Boston goalie
Byron Dafoe, Dallas defenseman Richard Matvichuk, Detroit winger
Darren McCarty, Edmonton winger Bill Guerin, Nashville winger
Sergei Krivokrasov, New Jersey winger Jason Arnott, New York
Rangers defenseman Mathieu Schneider, Pittsburgh defenseman Darius
Kasparaitis, Pittsburgh forward Alexei Kovalev and Vancouver winger
Markus Naslund.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor will be busy enough signing his own restricted free
agents, a list headed by right wing Glen Murray, defenseman Mattias
Norstrom, goalie Stephane Fiset and newly acquired center Brian
Smolinski, who is expected to agree to play for the same salary,
roughly $1.75 million, that he received last season from the
Islanders. Other Kings restricted free agents include forwards
Craig Johnson, Vladimir Tsyplakov, Sandy Moger and Steve McKenna.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are not expected to sign veteran unrestricted free
agents Doug Bodger, Russ Courtnall, Ray Ferraro and Dave Babych.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve goalies Manny Legace and Ryan Bach also are unrestricted
free agents.
</P>
<P>

salaries and statistics:

BELFAST PEACE TALKS GO PAST DEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern and Northern Ireland's political
leaders talked past a midnight deadline Thursday in an effort to
break an impasse threatening the peace settlement that has promised
to end sectarian violence in the British province.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement would clear the way to achieving a critical goal of
the April 1998 accord _ the creation of a power sharing executive
for the Northern Ireland Assembly and the transfer of authority to
the new legislature from the British government.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking that path has been the refusal of Sinn Fein to promise
any disarmament by its Irish Republican Army allies before the May
2000 deadline agreed to in the original settlement; the province's
largest party, the Ulster Unionists, demands that Sinn Fein be
barred from taking up its seats in the new cabinet in the absence
of such a pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein has said it cannot deliver that result and that the
2-year-old IRA cease-fire represents a credible commitment to
nonviolence. The Ulster Unionist President David Trimble has
responded, ``No guns, no government.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal being worked on through the third day of intense talks
on Wednesday envisaged a statement by Sinn Fein of unequivocal
acceptance of the IRA's obligation to disarm by the May 2000 date
in the original settlement, in exchange for letting the party take
up its seats in the new cabinet now.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable for disarming and the monitoring of compliance
would be entrusted to the International Commission on
Decommissioning headed by John de Chastelain, a retired Canadian
general who drew up a critical report on the arrangement for
presentation to the negotiators. The first actual handover of
weapons would occur in the fall, and parties that did not live up
to the terms of disarmament could face suspension from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   But while the negotiators settled on the general shape of a
possible deal, they fought in typically hard-bitten manner over the
words to nail it in place. ``Both sides agree on what's necessary
now,'' said a spokesman for Blair. ``What the two sides need to be
persuaded of is the quality of the commitments being made.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, the head of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic
and Labor Party and a winner of the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize, said,
``It's hard for one side in this community to trust the other with
the way they've been fighting each other over the centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Adams and Trimble emerged from the talks late at night to
blame the other for producing the deadlock. But both said the peace
settlement was the best opportunity for peace in Northern Ireland
and stressed that they were still hoping for a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Signing onto a deal of these dimensions posed great risk to
Trimble since it would represent a significant climb down from his
demand for an immediate start to disarmament. It could also bring
about a challenge to his leadership from hardline members of his
party.
</P>
<P>
   Blair telephoned President Clinton Wednesday evening to brief
him on the day's progress. The president has said he was willing,
if asked, to contact individual leaders the way he did through the
end of the negotiations in April, 1998, that produced the original
agreement. Those talks ran 17 hours past their deadline.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All the principals took note of the crucial nature of the day as
they entered the Stormont Castle Buildings. That is where they had
met during the two years it took to produce the so-called Good
Friday agreement aimed at ending three decades of sectarian
violence and where they returned this week to prevent the accord
from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to make this D-day for the people of these
islands,'' said Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. ``It's whether
the imperative of the majority of the people of the North and South
who voted for this agreement and whether the two governments'
commitment to the agreement is stronger than those who want to tear
it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who is also first minister of the new Northern Ireland
Assembly, said that the ``moment of truth'' had arrived for the
republican movement that Adams heads. ``The phrase `republican
movement' means two things, a political party and a private army,''
he said. ``It must decide today which of the two things it prefers.
It cannot keep both any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The midnight deadline was set six weeks ago by Blair, who with
Ahern has been in Belfast since Monday jointly conducting the final
talks as they did 14 months ago. Back then declaring a firm
deadline for a halt to talking produced an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, new legislatures in Scotland and Wales assume their
powers, and in setting the deadline Blair hoped to mark a
historically simultaneous start-up of the Northern Ireland
Assembly. Blair was due in Edinburgh on Thursday morning to speak
at the ceremonial opening of the Scottish Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated that the hard-fought peace agreement has been
followed by 14 months of missed deadlines and stalled motion, the
two prime ministers have suggested that failure to take the next
crucial step would force them to review the whole accord.
</P>
<P>
   It would also leave a menacing vacuum in the public affairs of
the province at the outset of the tensest season in Northern
Ireland, the summer months of the Protestant parades that are
resented and protested by the minority Catholic community.
</P>
<P>
   Blair interrupted his talks Wednesday to meet with leaders of
the Protestant Orange Order to reassure them after the
government-appointed Parades Commission decided on Monday to block
their members from marching from Drumcree Church in Portadown
through the Catholic Garvaghy Road neighborhood this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In years past that march was a showdown that convulsed the
province, and dissident Protestant paramilitaries have threatened
to go on the attack now in response to Monday's ruling. Ronnie
Flanagan, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said on
Wednesday that his force had intelligence that there were people
determined to exploit the occasions with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has flown in 1300 troops to help police, and Flanagan
warned the organizers of the parades to keep troublemakers out of
the marchers' ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who bring large numbers of others onto the street have
a responsibility to look beyond that event,'' he said, ``and if it
is predictable, as it was predictable last year, that there are
malevolent people in the wings willing to use the peaceful protest
as a cover for wreaking violence, then I believe those who would
seek to bring large numbers onto the streets have a responsibility
to take that into account.''

SIBLING ARTISTS ARE CARD-CARRYING WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a national art contest with 70,000 entries, what are the
chances that a brother and sister from Arlington, Texas, would be
two of the 12 winners?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really surprised,'' said Alicia Templin, 14. She and
her brother, David, 12, drew two of the birthday-card designs
singled out by judges in the contest for kids sponsored by
Hallmark. The 12 winning entries will be part of the summer lineup
of greeting cards produced by the reigning U.S. card king.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the judges thought that was pretty weird, too,'' David
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Templins, teen-agers that they are, tend to describe their
success with words such as ``weird.'' Both entered four designs in
the contest, including the two chosen pictures: Alicia's candle
bowing from a cake to its candle friends and David's floppy-eared
dog sitting atop a birthday cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one they chose was actually my favorite one, so it was
kind of weird that they chose it,'' Alicia said.
</P>
<P>
   What may be truly weird, though, is that the two kids are still
surprised by their tandem success. They have won other art contests
together. It seems that if one of them wins something, they both
win. And win they do. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   This year, both placed in a themed art competition at the
Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show and Rodeo. They also
came in first and second in a cover design competition for the
Star-Telegram's Class Acts section for young readers. At the State
Fair of Texas last year, both won in several categories _ in the
adult division.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark's card contest is the most widespread recognition the
Templins have received. As part of their prize, the brother-sister
artists recently toured the Hallmark Cards headquarters in Kansas
City, Mo. And in August, Hallmark will send them to Easton, Penn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where Crayola headquarters are,'' Alicia said. ``I
think we're going to actually get to see how crayons are made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Templins have lived with art all their lives. Their father,
Gary Templin, is a graphic design artist; their mother, Crystal
Templin, is a computer artist. The elder Templins also run an art
school called Art Smart in their home _ ``which is why our house
looks like an art studio,'' Alicia said _ that attracts as many as
120 students during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   David and Alicia help with teaching the classes, and they both
picture art in their distant futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to do clay animation,'' David said. ``So I'm not sure,
but I may want to do that when I grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely want to do something in art,'' Alicia said. ``I
might even want to be an author and illustrator for children's
books.''
</P>
<P>
   For now though, they're just creative kids who tend to finish
each other's sentences and seem unfazed by the weirdness of their
awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got a fifth place or something like that ... . Did I
get two second places?'' Alicia said, trying to recall what she won
at the State Fair of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got two second places,'' David said. ``It was me that got
fifth.''

FUTURE OF USER FEES UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIOUX FALLS, S.D. _ Three-fifths of the way into the emotional
tug-of-war that is the National Forest Fee Demonstration Program,
both sides of the political issue can only guess its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is language proposed to make it permanent and language
proposed to do away with it,'' U.S. Forest Service director Mike
Dombeck told reporters last week during the Outdoor Writers
Association of America's conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year pilot project to raise maintenance funds by
charging access fees to National Forest visitors is scheduled to
conclude in September 2001. However, detractors think the Clinton
administration-backed proposal could be made permanent as early as
this summer. To that end, U.S. Congresswomen Lois Capps (D-Santa
Barbara) and Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs) have reintroduced their
Forest Tax Relief Act to abolish the program.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, the estimated 40 million annual visitors
to the four surrounding National Forests _ Los Padres, Angeles, San
Bernardino and Cleveland _ must pay $5 a day or $30 a year per
vehicle for an ``Adventure Pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck justified the program using what could be called ``80-80
reasoning'': 80 percent of the funds go directly to the forest
where they are collected, and 80 percent of the people surveyed by
the Forest Service and an independent polling group favor the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective is a quality of life issue. Besides,'' Dombeck
said, ``99.99 percent of the (Forest Service) land is available
free.''
</P>
<P>
   That provides little solace for the vocal minority opposing the
fee program.
</P>
<P>
   Alasdair Coyne, conservation director for Keep the Sespe Wild, a
Ventura County environmental group working to eliminate the
``Adventure Pass,'' challenged Dombeck's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lie,'' Coyne said of the forest areas users can visit
free of charge. ``They have 100 National Forest sites around the
country that are under fees of various sorts through the Fee
Demonstration Program. In Southern California, the program
encompasses four National Forests and their entire mass. So, right
there, that probably represents more than one-tenth of a percent of
public land, even if Dombeck is misinformed.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the ``quality of life issue,'' Coyne argues that
implementing National Forest user fees ``is the first step to
commercializing America's public lands, lands which belong to the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Both camps do agree the National Forests need a major financial
boost. Reports indicate the national recreation budget has not
increased this decade, forcing Forest Service officials to use
money normally earmarked for maintenance to cover rising business
expenses, including overhead and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get money to build new stuff, but once you build
it it's difficult to get money to maintain it,'' Dombeck explained.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the money is the point of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to address funding. We've never disputed that,'' Coyne
said. ``We have to persuade Congress to fork over more funding. It
shouldn't come out of National Forest visitors' wallets. It already
comes out of their tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forest Service officials estimate only $12 from every
taxpayer goes toward National Forest services, of which recreation
is but one part.
</P>
<P>
   The question then beckons: Should Americans be responsible for
paying more in taxes to support the National Forests?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of appropriating money that is already available
from tax dollars,'' Coyne answered, ``not a matter of raising
taxes.''

COURT BACKS RIGHT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL IN GUN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to fix garbles)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a first-in-the-nation ruling that shook the
ever-shifting legal ground on gun control, the state's highest
court ruled Wednesday that the state Attorney General has the right
to impose safety measures on gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision by the state Supreme Judicial Court paves
the way for the implementation of restrictions banning the sale of
cheap handguns and requiring safety locks and hard-to-pull
triggers.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the regulations were bolstered by a state gun
control law enacted last year, the ruling expands the Attorney
General's independent power to impose such restrictions on guns,
which have not been held to the same consumer safety standards
imposed on other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first court in the country to hold that an attorney
general has that power,'' said Dennis Henigan, legal counsel for
the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in Washington. ``It is
significant nationally because many states have similar consumer
protection statutes directed at the prevention of unfair trade
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an ominous ruling for the gun industry, which has
continued to beat back gun control and safety measures in Congress
in recent weeks and in several state legislatures which have passed
laws prohibiting cities from suing the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling underscored the authority of the Attorney
General to apply consumer safety laws to guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problems in this area are that this could give
encouragement to other attorneys general,'' said Robert Ricker,
executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council, the
Georgia-based gun industry trade group that sued to block
implementation of the gun safety guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``And also, it's going to complicate any attempt by the
Massachusetts state legislature to correct or streamline what was
done last year,'' Ricker said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly said the decision recognizes
the power of his office to bring common-sense safety precautions to
the sale of handguns. The safety regulations were imposed by his
predecessor, Scott Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the case itself will return to the Superior Court to work
out some of the actual details -- whether it be childproofing or
requiring that so called `junk guns' be prohibited in this state,''
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricker and other industry spokesmen say that they simply
have not come up with designs that could make a gun child-proof _
as the regulations would require _ or to create locks that keep a
gun out of criminal hands without limiting the owner's
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   If upheld, the regulations could address some of the same
concerns voiced by Boston public health officials and politicians
in cities nationwide who are suing the gun industry to force design
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Welsh, Mayor Thomas M. Menino's policy and planning
director, said the city's suit against gun manufacturers would move
forward, even if tougher safety regulations are adopted because the
city wants to prevent the flow of illegal weapons from other states
with looser laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We claim there's clearly a distribution scheme to flood our
markets with guns that are cheap, easily concealable, and that
don't have safety devices on them,'' said Welsh. ``There's any
number of contiguous states in the country that have absolutely no
regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Harshbarger broke new ground in issuing consumer
protection regulations aimed at banning cheap so-called Saturday
night specials, as well as guns without traceable serial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations also call for child-safe designs, such as
triggers too stiff for a child to pull, and for safety measures
such as an indicator showing the number of cartridges left in the
gun to reduce accidental shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're common-sense safety provisions to deal with
childproofing and trigger locks and safe guns for law-abiding
owners,'' Harshbarger said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects both the will of the legislature and the power of
the attorney general to deal with these issues in a common sense
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the day before the regulations were to be
phased in, the American Shooting Sports Council filed suit,
claiming that the attorney general did not have the authority to
dictate the design and manufacture of products, and that some
regulations conflicted with existing federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Suffolk Superior Court Judge Diane Kottmyer issued
a preliminary injunction blocking the implementation of the
regulations, saying that Harshbarger had overstepped his bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC Wednesday overturned that injunction in a 21-page
decision that sent the case back to Superior Court for further
hearings.

SENATE PANEL APPROVES HOLBROOKE, BUT FLOOR VOTE STILL UNCERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard Holbrooke's long-delayed nomination to be
the chief U.S. diplomat to the United Nations won the approval of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, but the date
of a final vote on the nomination on the Senate floor remained
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   While Holbrooke's supporters had hoped that the nomination would
be approved quickly by the full Senate, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott's office reported that a number of lawmakers were
blocking a final vote for unspecified reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One senator, Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, announced last week that
he would block the vote until the State Department resolved a
dispute _ unrelated to Holbrooke's nomination _ involving the
department's treatment of a budget analyst in the U.S. mission to
the United Nations in New York. Grassley has described the analyst
as a whistleblower.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lott said Wednesday that more senators had
decided to follow Grassley's lead and impose a so-called hold on
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, John Czwartacki, said that unlike Grassley, the
other senators took the action anonymously, which is permitted by
Senate traditions. Rules intended to promote consensus in the
Senate permit a single Senator to block a nomination vote
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials involved with Holbrooke's
nomination, speaking on condition they not be identified, said they
were still optimistic that Holbrooke's nomination would be
confirmed shortly by the full Senate and that the veteran diplomat
could begin work at the United Nations this summer.
</P>
<P>
   They said the new delays to the nomination may simply be
bargaining chips by senators interested in promoting special
projects at the State Department or seeking other favors from the
administration. ``We don't think this is anything terribly
serious,'' said one senior official.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote by the Foreign Relations Committee had
originally been seen as the final hurdle in Holbrooke's year-long
quest for the United Nations post.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Holbrooke, the former U.S. ambassador to
Germany and the architect of the 1995 peace agreement that ended
the war in Bosnia, was stalled for months by two federal ethics
investigations. One ended with his exoneration. The other ended
with a settlement in which he agreed to pay $5,000 to settle civil
charges that he had violated federal lobbying laws.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and supporters of Holbrooke had feared that the panel's
chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., might try to kill the
nomination, as he killed other prominent Clinton administration
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   But Helms, who once said that he could not recall a nomination
``with so much ethical baggage attached to it,'' signaled in June
that he would support Holbrooke. And when it came time for the
committee to vote Wednesday, the nomination was approved along with
several others on a voice vote, with no opposition and no debate.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley has insisted that he will not lift his hold on
Holbrooke's nomination until the State Department agrees to
reinstate the budget analyst, Linda Shenwick, to her job in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Shenwick, a 20-year veteran of the State Department, is being
transferred against her wishes to Washington, an act she describes
as retaliation by the department for sharing information with
lawmakers and reporters about waste and fraud at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Grassley's colleagues said Wednesday that they were
urging him to drop his ``hold'' on Holbrooke's nomination, arguing
that it was improper to hold the nomination hostile to a civil
service dispute that should be resolved elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is irresponsible to hold up a nomination for an important
position in order to try to settle a personnel dispute,'' said Sen.
Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign
Relations Committee. ``I hope and expect Senator Grassley will
cease and desist.''

 McCAIN MAKES CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM A TOP ISSUE  
(sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. _ Putting the overhaul of the campaign finance law
squarely at the center of his presidential bid, Sen. John McCain
Wednesday called on the Republican rank-and-file to rise up against
a system he branded ``an elaborate influence peddling scheme in
which both parties conspire to stay in office by selling the
country to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that Texas Gov. George W. Bush said that his
campaign had raised $36.3 million, dwarfing all his rivals, McCain
portrayed himself as a fighter against the status quo and began an
effort to turn his signature issue into a rallying cry for
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told there is no room for this issue in Republican
primaries,'' McCain told several hundred people crammed into town
hall here. ``Well I intend to make room for it,'' he said, drawing
cheers, applause and whoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will call for the reform of our political system everywhere
I go in this campaign,'' the Arizona senator said. ``I will ask my
supporters to make campaign reform their top priority, and I'll
challenge my opponents to declare their independence from the
political welfare state. Because I'm not running for president to
be someone. I'm running to do something. This is your country, my
friends and I'm running for president to give it back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's effort to pass legislation to ban the unlimited
donations to political parties known as ``soft money'' and put a
tighter rein on issue advocacy advertisements has so far been
futile. It has put him sharply at odds with the Republican
congressional leadership, which staunchly supports a system that
has proved an advantage to their party. His stand has also
alienated the leaders of such powerful Republican constituency
groups as the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, the senator cast a bet that the issue could
catch fire with rank-and-file conservatives and set him apart from
the other candidates in the crowded Republican field. He accused
lawmakers of his own party of sacrificing their ideals to placate
large donors.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in part because of his chairmanship of the Senate
Commerce Committee, has emerged as the second most well-financed
Republican candidate, raising $6.5 million, including a $2 million
transfer from his Senate campaign account.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation he is sponsoring would make no changes in how
presidential candidates raise money for the primary campaigns. It
would ban ``soft money'' _ the unlimited, and unregulated,
donations the political parties take to get around the limits that
the law sets on donations to candidates and parties for federal
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his years in Congress, McCain is trying to position
himself as a challenger to status quo politics. Hanging from the
front of town hall on Wednesday was a picture of him as a rakish
young Navy pilot before he was shot down in Vietnam and held as a
prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed his struggle to cut down the money in politics as
another test of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it were true that Americans don't care about campaign
finance reform _ and I don't for one moment believe it is,'' McCain
said, ``I would not give up this fight. I would rather not be
president than win that high office on false pretenses. How could I
ask Americans to enlist in the fight against national cynicism
while I support the underlying cause of the public's disgust with
politics?''
</P>
<P>
   Several times, McCain emphasized that he was a conservative. He
called on Republicans to support his bill and show that ``you still
believe in the cause Ronald Reagan fought for, the cause you
elected a Republican Congress to serve, the cause of less
government and more freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the issue seem more concrete to voters, he charged that
during the writing of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, ``every
company affected by the legislation had purchased a seat at the
table with soft money.'' As a result, he said, the lower prices
promised by competition did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Republican-controlled Congress had increased the
number of special interest provisions inserted into spending bills.
He also scored Congress for wasting billions of dollars on unneeded
weapons systems. And on tax policy, he said, the failure to make
larger tax cuts or to reshape the tax code was the result of tax
breaks for special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the promises we could keep and the good we could do if
politicians stopped treating the federal Treasury as a duty-free
shop for soft-money donors,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not spare President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore, whose aggressive fund-raising practices in 1996 provoked
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans care very much that the Lincoln bedroom has
become a Motel 6 where the president of the United States serves as
bellhop,'' McCain said. Referring to Gore's attendance at a
fund-raiser in a Buddhist temple he added, ``Most Americans care
very much when monks and nuns abandon their vows of poverty and pay
tens of thousands of dollars to have communion with the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance legislation that McCain sponsors with Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., died in a Senate filibuster last year.
Its House sponsors had hoped to pass it before Memorial Day to put
pressure on the Senate. But Speaker Dennis Hastert put the issue
off until September. McCain on Wednesday signaled that he would now
try to bring the issue to the Senate floor next month.

SCURRY BRACES FOR CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the United States wins the Women's World Cup at the Rose
Bowl, goalkeeper Briana Scurry promises not to run naked down
Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, as she did in Athens, Ga., after
the U.S. won the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Scurry's previous streaking experience happened only
because a reporter caught her off guard early one morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Illustrated called me at, like, eight in the morning
one day when I was half-asleep and asked me what I would do if we
won,'' said Scurry. ``I didn't want to be like everybody else, so I
said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey Briana, when have you ever been like everyone else?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' she said, laughing. ``Goalkeepers are different. I'm
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Scurry and her U.S. teammates face Germany in the
quarterfinals of the 1999 Women's World Cup at Jack Kent Cooke
Stadium in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Scurry, a master of making her job look easy, has compiled a
75-8-5 record in five years as the Americans' top keeper, recording
51 shutouts. That causes some to wonder if she gets bored with the
U.S. attacking so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm like, `OK, do something,' '' admitted the
27-year-old. ``Come at me with a ball -- anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Scurry said she doesn't mind the inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have nothing to do, that means everyone's doing their
job,'' she said. ``I can sit back and watch all day; that's fine
with me. You know, I'm not back there smoking cigarettes like
people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry is able to laugh about it, but she realizes her days of
spectating from afar are behind her. After giving up one goal in
three previous Women's World Cup Group A qualifying matches, the
U.S. faces a tougher task in defeating Germany to avoid
elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Looming in the future is perhaps a date with Brazil on Sunday
and either China or Norway in the July 10 final at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is going to need me in this tournament,'' said
Scurry. ``Teams are going to get to us a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't have a lot to do when we're playing (at this
stage), I'm surprised. I know it's going to be big-time games; I
know I'm going to be battling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more one-on-ones, a lot more breakways, a lot
more players going right at me. I'm going to need to be at my
best.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Tony DiCicco admits he has to get Scurry more
involved, even when the game is in the opponents' end of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't had to venture too far from her goal line,''
DiCicco said. ``We're asking her to expand her influence into the
entire penalty area, and in some cases beyond. We don't need a
(Jorge) Campos, but we do need her to cover more ground back there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Briana is key for us and we need her to be at her best.''
</P>
<P>
   Soaking up the atmosphere off the field, Scurry enjoys being in
the spotlight. She's relishing her role as one of the only
African-Americans on the team. Fellow goalkeeper Saskia Webber is
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Scurry was born in Texas, attended grade school in Minneapolis,
then started her high school soccer career in Dayton, Ohio, where
she was one of six African-Americans in a student body of 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in white suburbia,'' she says. ``But I never had any
doors closed to me growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she's hoping to open the doors for other African-Americans,
few of whom play soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been one of the only mainstays on this team the last five
years, so it's definitely something people notice,'' said Scurry of
being African-American. ``In all the articles you read, it's
mentioned. But I want to embrace that role. I want to be a role
model. I want to do well for my community to show we can excel at
any sport, even if it's a sport that very few African-Americans
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll start a windfall of activity for soccer in the
inner city. All I want to say to African-Americans is give this
sport a try.''
</P>
<P>
   She did just that, giving up her first love, basketball, to give
soccer a shot in high school. And while most U.S. National team
players earn their invitations through U.S. youth or club programs,
Scurry turned a brilliant high school career into a scholarship at
Massachusetts. It was there she blossomed, finishing her career
with a 0.56 goals-against-average to impress DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the fact I sort of made it through the back
door,'' said Scurry. ``I wasn't in the circles of known players. I
was a small town girl from Minnesota. I just kept playing and
hoping and performed to the best of my ability. I'm a true
depiction of that kid who fought her way to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Since there was more pavement than grass growing up, Scurry was
a heck of a basketball player, but she chose soccer because she was
better on a national level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold five or six basketball records at my high school,''
said Scurry. ``My mom keeps telling me to try the WNBA.''
</P>
<P>
   So what would have happened if she had chosen basketball?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be in the WNBA, there's no doubt. I would have been a
power forward and I had a good vertical (jump) to guard centers.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry hasn't ruled out a WNBA career after soccer, but first
things first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to win this thing,'' Scurry said of the World
Cup. ``It's here, we're ready, now it's just a matter of getting it
done.''

DIVERSITY RULES IN NICK PROGRAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Cosby is playing with Gak, hiding a chocolate golf ball in
the gooey mess on talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell's desk and talking
about his new animated series, ``Little Bill.'' Based on Cosby's
books of the same name, the series is being developed by
Nickelodeon's new New York-based digital animation studio, with
plans to begin airing it in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby talks affectionately about the character he has created,
saying he ``thinks a lot. He wants to know, but he doesn't know.''
Cosby says that he went to other ``network people'' with his
project before he found a home for it with Nick Jr., the
Nickelodeon network's preschool programming block. ``The Nick Jr.
people are absolutely wonderful about this fellow,'' Cosby says.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful, indeed. With the addition of ``Little Bill'' to the
network's lineup, Nickelodeon executives are out to show once again
that good, risk-taking television can mean a healthy bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Since the network debuted _ and especially in the past decade _
Nickelodeon executives have broken the traditional rules of
children's programming, rewriting the formulas for success by
putting girls in starring roles and creating a kind of colorblind
TV wonderland populated by characters of diverse colors and
cultures. Kids are black, white _ sometimes even blue. It's a
world, execs say, where every kid, like ``Little Bill,'' fits in.
</P>
<P>
   It's apparent that the philosophy has worked as a programming
strategy. Nick is the 900-pound gorilla of children's television,
controlling 56 percent of viewers ages 2 to 11 who watch children's
programming. It's a billion-dollar multimedia business taking in
more than half of all advertising dollars spent on kids' TV.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for its success is that Nick has just one
demographic: Kids. Nick has to be adventurous to keep the rugrats
tuned in and interested.
</P>
<P>
   Nick also has the additional benefit of selling blocks of time
during the day, rather than individual shows, to advertisers. New
programs don't need instant advertiser support. As one exec says,
``by letting something live in Nick Jr. for a while, we don't have
to worry about getting the big rating right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Those explanations may seem reason enough to justify
cutting-edge editorial content, but the folks at Nick say it's more
than that. They say the risk-taking comes from a deep conviction
that shows need to be ``authentic.'' They say it's less about
taking calculated, demographic-pleasing risks than it is about
telling great stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to connect kids to kids and to their world
through entertainment,'' says Cyma Zarghami, vice president and
general manager for the network. ``We have to reflect kids' world
both in the way things look and in the stories we tell. That could
mean anything from a single-parent home to a diverse mix of
characters in any situation.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that Nick execs pay attention to statistics and
research about who kids are and what they're doing, but adds that
Nick's growth in creating programming that reflects diversity has
been ``much more organic.''
</P>
<P>
   History seems to bear out her assertions. Take the 1994 launch
of ``Gullah Gullah Island,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Johnson, senior vice president of Nick Jr., says that Nick
bigwigs were looking at the effect a show like ``Barney'' had with
its music, and were simply looking for an authentic musical family
to star in the network's preschool show when they came across Ron
and Natalie Daise in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   It was the character of the couple that made them right for
Nick, Johnson says, rather than a desire to create the first
preschool program to revolve around an African-American family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron did a lot of the taking care of their son. He was a manly
man doing family-oriented things,'' Johnson says. Nick decided to
locate the show in Buford, S.C., where the Daises live and where
Ron is a historian of Gullah, a culture descended from West Africa
that is indigenous to the Sea Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not just going into the project to show color. We were
putting color and culture together in a way that made it feel more
exciting and genuine,'' Zarghami says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo,'' a show launched in 1996
starring Irene Ng (''The Joy Luck Club,/) had the same ``organic''
development.
</P>
<P>
   The show, says Zarghami, was originally titled ``The Mystery
Files of Shelby Wink.'' When directors decided to recast the lead,
they found Ng and decided to change the show's concept to reflect
her East Asian culture.
</P>
<P>
   Nick's edgy content got its biggest boost about five years ago
when a partnership was formed between Nick and Tollin/Robbins
Productions. Programming executive Albie Hecht turned to Mike
Tollin and Brian Robbins, the former star of ``Head of the
Class,''to create a sketch comedy show for kids. The result was
``All That,'' a show featuring ethnically diverse cast members, an
ultracool theme song by TLC and live performances by hip-hop bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the Nickelodeon landscape was pretty white bread
at the time,'' Robbins says. ``We wanted to make a very urban
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins found Nickelodeon execs simpatico with his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the places I've worked,'' Robbins says, ``Nick is the
most free place to sort of develop and grow a show without all the
nerves and panic you get in other places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All That's'' success led to other Tollin/Robbins pitches,
which led to successful projects including the spinoff show,
``Kenan &AMP; Kel,'' the spinoff film, ``Good Burger,'' and last year's
``Cousin Skeeter,'' all of which have brought more viewers _ and
money _ to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zarghami insists that the bottom line is good stories.
``The thing about those characters in `All That' is that they tell
great kids stories. As long as we continue to tell great kids
stories, we'll continue to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   She says this is exactly what brought Cosby to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Zarghami was in the meeting with Cosby when he pitched ``Little
Bill.'' Cosby talked for a long time about his books and what he
wanted to do with the TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to tell his stories,'' Zarghami says. ``And
when he got here, he realized we were the people who would bring
his stories to life.''

HEART VALVE DEFECT LESS PREVALENT THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than two decades, the major medical journals have been
filled with reports of the high incidence and devastating
complications of a heart condition called mitral valve prolapse. It
was called the most common heart defect in young people and the
most common heart-valve disease among people of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 14 million to 28 million Americans were believed to
have the condition. And scientists, physicians and journals warned
that it could lead to a number of serious illnesses, including
heart failure, stroke, reduced blood flow and infection of the
heart. Patients were advised to monitor their condition, see their
doctors regularly and to be sure to take antibiotics before any
minor surgery or visits to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that most of the people who thought they had
the heart condition _ and lived in constant fear of its
consequences _ did not.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers reported Thursday in The New England Journal of
Medicine that only about 2 percent of the population _ rather than
the 5 percent to 15 percent (and in some cases the estimates were
much higher) _ were found to have the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the study showed that even among people who do have
it, occurrences of most of the serious complications said to have
resulted from the condition are no higher than they are among those
who do not.
</P>
<P>
   Mitral valve prolapse is a condition in which a valve that
allows blood to flow from the upper left chamber of the heart to
the lower chamber is abnormally long and floppy. In some patients,
mitral valve prolapse may cause the blood in one chamber, the left
ventricle, to leak backward into the upper left, the atrium. This
can upset the rhythm of the heart, overwork and weaken the heart or
cause it to become infected.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who have the condition described symptoms like
shortness of breath, chest pains and palpitations. But these
symptoms can have other causes as well _ anxiety or fatigue, for
example _ and do no necessarily indicate a heart-valve malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this study we may have tempered the notion that mitral
valve prolapse is the most common cardiac valvular abnormality in
industrialized countries,'' said Dr. Lisa A. Freed, the lead author
of the report.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The diagnoses of prolapse cases increased sharply in the late
1970s and early '80s as new ultrasound technology enabled
physicians to examine hearts easily and noninvasively.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Dr. Emelia Benjamin, the senior investigator, the
earlier studies had been done with a form of echocardiography
called M-mode technology that often resulted in overdiagnosis. The
new research made use of technical refinements designed to
minimized the false results.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3,491 participants whose hearts were observed, the
examiners found only 84, or 2.4 percent, with mitral valve
prolapse. And among those 84, the rates of resultant medical
complications were no higher than those in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found previous estimates were incorrect in
suggesting that the heart condition occurs more commonly in women
than men; incidence was found to be the same in men and women, the
authors said. A companion study in the journal found that the
condition is not more common in people under 45 years old who had
suffered strokes or ministrokes, contradicting conclusions from
previous research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very compelling information,'' said Dr. Claude
Lenfant, director of the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. ``It
means that people who have been diagnosed with mitral value
prolapse should consult with their physician to discuss their
health status.'' He said that further studies should be done to
corroborate the findings and achieve a fuller understanding of the
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, some patients' conditions were worsened by
misdiagnoses and a failure to detect the true cause of their
symptoms, though this question has not been studied, Dr. Freed
said. She added that patients diagnosed as having the valve
condition were most commonly treated with antibiotics to ward off
infection that might be caused by the leaking of blood from one
chamber back into another.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do have the condition, this remains the primary
treatment: It is when the leaking becomes severe and results in
infection that serious complications can occur.

HOUSE OK'S GOP-BACKED ABORTION MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When George W. Bush faced the abortion question, he
answered in non-committal terms, saying it would not be a litmus
test for a running mate. Elizabeth Dole was equally subdued, saying
abortion is low on her list of legislative priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort by Republican presidential candidates to distance
themselves from the fiery abortion debate faced its first serious
challenge Wednesday _ not from political opponents but from the
House of Representatives, where a Republican-backed measure to
limit abortion rights for minors was overwhelmingly approved.
</P>
<P>
   And in the coming months, as the legislation heads to the Senate
and other bills are introduced, Republican candidates might find
they are doing an impossible balancing act: being antiabortion and
non-controversial at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the issue that won't go away,'' said Gary Bauer, a GOP
presidential candidate who has made ``family values,'' and abortion
in particular, a central campaign theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that the issue is on the Hill means it's fodder
for reporters' questions,'' agreed Stuart Rothenberg, a political
analyst. ``I think Bush and Dole have made it pretty clear they
don't want to get bogged down talking about these more inflammatory
questions. But they are going to have to respond to it whether they
like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill approved Wednesday would make it illegal for an
adult to help a pregnant teenager dodge her state's parental
consent laws by going to another state for an abortion. A pregnant
minor in Massachusetts, for example, could no longer evade the
state's abortion requirements _ that one parent give consent or a
judge grant special permission _ by having an adult drive her to
Vermont, where parent consent laws don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, any adult other than the girl's parents or
guardians who took her across state borders for that purpose could
be charged with a federal misdemeanor. The maximum penalty would be
a year in jail and $100,000 in fines, plus parents whose daughters
had abortions could file a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed 270-159, with 206 Republicans and 64
Democrats in favor, but it fell 12 votes short of being safe from
the veto threatened by the Clinton administration. Two members of
the Massachusetts delegation, Representatives J. Joseph Moakley of
South Boston and Richard E. Neal of Springfield, voted for the bill
that also passed in the House last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not right to love some abstract devotion to abortion
rights more than the safety and security of that child and the
honor of the parents,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Armey of
Texas. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, also from Texas, said about
taking a girl to another state for an abortion without her parents'
permission: ``This is criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Such strong terms on abortion have to date been excluded from
the mainstream Republican presidential campaign. Bush, the
front-runner with vast amounts of campaign cash, seems unharmed by
accusations from the conservative wing of the party that he does
not oppose abortion enough. Asked earlier this year whether
opposing abortion would be a requirement for his vice presidential
running mate, Bush's response was downright bland: ``I rule nothing
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush might not escape so easily as the Republican-controlled
Congress continues to thrust hot-button social issues into
limelight. So far this year the House has addressed putting prayer
in schools and legislating a national day of ``solemn prayer,
fasting and humiliation before God.'' The same may be true for
Dole, as well as another GOP candidate, Representative John Kasich
of Ohio, who according to a spokesman is ``pro-life but feels that
the debte has become too boisterous, too divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, for one, is nearly building his campaign around holding
other candidates accountable for their stances on abortion. A
spokeswoman for Senator Bob Smith said his presidential campaign
has every intention to ``keep talking about abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the other candidates _ Buchanan, Keyes, Bauer _
already have talked about abortion,'' Karen Hickey said, referring
to Patrick J. Buchanan and Alan Keyes. ``I don't think anyone
fighting for the Republican platform can avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress seems poised to keep raising the issue. The issue of
what opponents call partial-birth abortion is likely to come up for
debate later this year. The bill that passed Wednesday now goes to
the Senate, where similar legislation died last year. But Democrats
expect the measure to pass this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the White House vetoes the legislation called the
``child custody protection act,'' the ramifications could be felt
among the Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Bush's perspective, there is nothing he can do,'' said

U.S. CONCERNED BY SOUTH KOREAN MISSILE PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is increasingly worried
that South Korea may be pushing ahead with several missile projects
that could further fuel an arms race on the Korean peninsula, just
as North Korea appears to be preparing another launch of a
long-range missile.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they will raise their concerns that
a South Korean missile program could destabilize an already
dangerous situation when South Korean President Kim Dae-jung visits
Washington on Friday. Two weeks ago, the South sank a North Korean
vessel in a firefight along their coastal border that resulted in
more than 20 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   While Presidents Clinton and Kim will publicly declare that they
have agreed on a common strategy for dealing with the North, one
senior administration official said that the South Koreans feel
``unduly constrained'' by a two-decade-old agreement that sharply
limits their ability to deploy a powerful fleet of missiles to
deter Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The political pressure in Seoul to deploy such missiles is bound
to grow if the North fires a Taepo Dong 2 missile over the Sea of
Japan in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Campbell, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Asian
and Pacific affairs, on Wednesday became the first administration
official to acknowledge publicly that U.S. intelligence had
detected ``some preparations'' for a launch in coming weeks or
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd view any potential launch of either a satellite or a
missile as a very serious act with very real consequences for U.S.
foreign policy toward North Korea,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   The North's first launch, on Aug. 31 last year, took U.S.
intelligence agencies by surprise and triggered outrage in Japan.
The test seemed intended to demonstrate that the North could strike
Tokyo and any of the bases where 55,000 U.S. troops are stationed
in Japan. Japan threatened to pull out of an accord in which it is
providing much of the financing to build electric power stations in
the North, the quid pro quo for Pyongyang's agreement to freeze its
nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Former Defense Secretary William Perry, who is now Clinton's
special adviser on North Korea, warned North Korea's leadership
during a visit to Pyongyang in June that a second missile test
could endanger the administration's effort to begin a slow
normalization of relations with the Communist country, including a
gradual lifting of economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Perry will meet with Kim on Friday, after the South Korean
president attends a working lunch at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said Wednesday that despite the warnings, North Korea
could have several motivations to defy the United States and its
allies and proceed with the test launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very real desire to put a satellite in space,'' he
said, a reference to the North's claim that last year's launch
propelled a small satellite into low-earth orbit, where the North
claims it broadcast songs hailing the achievements of North Korea's
founder, the late Kim Il Sung. ``There is also a desire to develop
their missile program,'' Campbell added, noting that as North Korea
watched the demonstration of U.S. air power over Belgrade, the
country ``feels perhaps more vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they try to convince North Korea to end its missile
tests, Washington is also scrambling to urge Kim to resist growing
political pressure in Seoul to develop longer-range missiles that
can strike targets throughout the North. In the late 1970s, after
Washington discovered and terminated a South Korean effort to build
a nuclear weapon of its own, Seoul agreed not to build missiles
with a range greater than 180 kilometers, or about 108 miles. That
limit puts the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, just out of reach
of South Korea's existing missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
   On April 10, however, South Korea launched a surface-to-surface
missile, the Hyonmu, from an island off its west coast. It traveled
only a short distance, but reports at the time suggested that its
fuel tank was only partially filled, so that the United States
would not discover the true range of the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The United States informally protested the launch, but said
nothing about it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   More than two months later, some U.S. intelligence officials are
casting doubt on the initial assessment that the South deliberately
limited the test to avoid U.S. suspicions. But Kim's government,
while considered a close military allies and economic partner, has
not shared much information with the Pentagon about its plans for
its missile program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is friction because as the North Koreans' capability for
inflicting damage continues,'' a senior U.S. military officer said
this week, the South Korean government is ``trying to exert a
certain independence from the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior military official said he believed that South
Korea has ``a fairly determined national program to create
capabilities that are competitive with the North Korean
capability.'' They also do not want to be overly dependent on the
United States to supply all of their weaponry, officials said. Some
South Korean officials have complained that the United States is
not being tough enough on the North about its missile program,
while pressuring Seoul to contain its own development programs.
</P>
<P>
   Such tensions have periodically broken out between Washington
and Seoul over the past decade. But the relationship with Kim
Dae-jung, a former democracy activist and dissident, has been much
warmer. U.S. officials insisted this week that their concerns over
the missile program did not constitute a major breach with South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. officials said that the United States might be willing
to extend the permissible range of South Korea's missiles to
roughly 180 miles. That might ease some of the domestic pressure on
Kim, while keeping South Korea within the limits of the Missile
Technology Control Regime, the international agreement to restrict
missile proliferation. Neither North Korea nor South Korea has
signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to work with them to give them the flexibility
they need but to insure they remain consistent with international
norms,'' a senior State Department official said. But even that
concession, some U.S. officials fear, could be used as an excuse by
the North to continue testing its longer-range missiles.

BERGER ANSWERS COMMITTEE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT SECURITY IN NUCLEAR
WEAPONS LABS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Mich.) (rk) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, made an unusual closed-door appearance Wednesday
afternoon before a Senate committee to answer questions about how
the White House has handled the allegations of nuclear espionage by
China.
</P>
<P>
   One official who attended the meeting, before the Select
Committee on Intelligence, said that Berger repeated previous
accounts of how he first learned about the issue in April 1996 and
first informed Clinton in July 1997, after receiving a more
detailed briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The session was polite, but had some tart moments, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators wondered why Berger was not more concerned after
the 1996 briefing, the official said, with one senator noting that
Berger thought the 1996 briefing was important enough to be relayed
promptly to Congress but not serious enough to tell the president.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, the Department of Energy told Berger that China had
likely stolen design information about America's most sophisticated
nuclear weapon, the miniaturized W-88 warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Berger backed Energy Department efforts to improve security in
1996, but he told the senators he did not interpret the briefing
with the same degree of urgency that some others have, the official
said. In news interviews, Berger has said the briefing was general
and preliminary, while other participants have said it was more
specific. The senators had copies of the slides used as part of the
briefing, but White House aides have said there is no formal
transcript of the session.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a presidential intelligence advisory board said
Berger's briefing in 1996 was not detailed enough to trigger a
broad presidential directive to tighten security at the nation's
weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1997 briefing did prompt Clinton to issue such a
directive in February 1998, though the advisory board found ``it
should have been handled with more dispatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Senate committee and of the advisory board
have said they are concerned about the lack of adequate records at
the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Berger has had to change his account of when Clinton was first
informed about the espionage, a revision White House aides say
resulted from there being no record of Berger's 1997 discussion
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who chairs the intelligence
committee said in an interview after Berger's appearance: ``I
thought we had a good meeting, but I think the fact remains that a
lot of these issues were handled at the NSC in a sloppy, if not
inept, way.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to discuss what transpired at the meeting, which was
technically not a hearing. Normally, aides to the president do not
testify before congressional committees. Presidents typically cloak
their deliberations with aides under the doctrine of executive
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Berger, P.J. Crowley, said: ``It was a good,
constructive meeting and Mr. Berger used the opportunity to explain
to members how the administration took appropriate actions in 1996
and 1997 to address a serious problem of lab security and
counterintelligence in a very serious way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said, ``Mr. Berger clearly and
effectively responded to the questions as to what actions he took
in 1996.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Using deception to ferret out personal information,
from Ennis Cosby's credit card records after his murder to the home
addresses of organized crime detectives in Los Angeles, a private
detective built a $1 million-a-year business here selling
information that ended up in the hands of everyone from the tabloid
press to a reputed member of the Israeli Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Working out of his private detective's office in suburban
Aurora, James Rapp took in daily requests from people who wanted
the confidential phone numbers for celebrities and victims of
high-profile crimes, like the Columbine High School shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp obtained records on the visits of television's ``Ally
McBeal'' star, Calista Flockhart, to a doctor in Beverly Hills,
Calif., at a time when the tabloids were filled with articles that
she had an eating disorder, investigators and prosecutors said.
They said Rapp sold information about the Princess of Wales and her
boyfriend in the hours after their deaths and information about
JonBenet Ramsey, the 6-year-old beauty queen slain in nearby
Boulder. He even obtained the phone records of Kathleen Willey, the
former White House volunteer who said President Clinton had made an
unwanted sexual advance to her, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear who received Rapp's information. But when the
authorities raided the offices of his Touch Tone Information in
May, they discovered a list of more than 1,200 private detective
agencies across the country that were buying confidential
information about Hollywood celebrities, estranged spouses, debtors
and deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Among the investigators on the list was a Denver private
detective who had been employed occasionally as a consultant by
ABC-TV, though there is no evidence the network ever used Rapp's
information. The authorities say some of the information about
celebrities has been used by The National Enquirer and The Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp, 39, and his wife, Regana Rapp, were indicted by a
Jefferson County grand jury on Friday on two counts each of
racketeering in a case that is the first known criminal prosecution
against the growing business of peddling confidential information.
If convicted, the couple face up to 24 years in prison and a $1
million fine. Rapp was imprisoned in 1982 for violating probation
after conviction of auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp said that he and his wife had not broken any laws.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the Rapps is the biggest test of whether
practices that on their face are deceptive are also illegal. Rapp's
employees obtained the information through a subterfuge known in
their business as a pretext: calling banks, phone companies and
other businesses and claiming to be the customer whose records were
sought.
</P>
<P>
   A former Touch Tone employee said in an interview that a female
colleague who sat next to him cried constantly as part of her act.
Nearby, the ex-employee said, an elderly man faked a foreign accent
and pretended to be confused to get information.
</P>
<P>
   The case was put together by state authorities from a
little-used state law on impersonating someone to obtain
information and a common federal statute on wire fraud. It could
break new legal ground by helping to define how far private
investigators can go in using deceit and trickery to obtain
confidential data.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, coupled with seized documents and interviews
with law-enforcement investigators in recent days, provides a
picture of how the Rapps turned lying into a lucrative business.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, it is not illegal to lie about identity, except if
impersonating a police officer or government official. Colorado
hopes to build a successful prosecution because it is one of few
states that make it a crime to impersonate someone else for gain.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Rapp case, deceptions by private investigators and
information brokers have not been prosecuted and no federal law
specifically prohibits impersonating someone to get confidential
information. ``A lot of things most Americans assume are illegal or
wrong are not prohibited by law,'' said Evan Hendricks, editor of
Privacy Times, a Washington newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people engaged in reprehensible conduct to profit from
all sorts of tragedies,'' Dennis Hall, the Jefferson County deputy
district attorney who led the investigation, said in an interview.
``They broke the law by impersonating someone to get private
information and selling it for profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Aristedes W. Zavaras, executive director of the Colorado
Department of Public Safety, said the case represented the
strongest evidence yet that stringent controls are necessary to
safeguard private information and maintain public confidence. ``The
indictments here send a loud and clear message that these practices
must stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of growing concerns over privacy, Congress is
considering laws to prohibit using pretexts to obtain confidential
information.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp, in a brief interview, called the charges ridiculous and
said his activities were legal. He said his lawyer had advised him
not to discuss the indictment, but in an earlier interview, before
the charges were filed, he maintained that there is nothing
inherently wrong with using deception to get confidential
information.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even at this early stage, the case provides an unusually rich
window into the secretive world of information brokers, a new breed
of investigators who have grown into a multimillion-dollar industry
by trafficking in confidential information obtained through lies
and access to the latest public and private computer databases.
</P>
<P>
   A price list seized by the police shows the Rapps offered to get
unpublished telephone numbers and addresses for $85, a monthly bill
for local or long distance phone calls for $75, bank statements for
$100, stock transactions for $200.
</P>
<P>
   Results were guaranteed. Company records showed revenues
averaging $20,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive techniques used by the Rapps and their company
led the Federal Trade Commission to file a civil lawsuit against
the Rapps and the company in April. The agency charged that using
pretexts represented an invasion of consumer privacy. The case,
which is pending, will help determine regulatory authority over
information brokers and private detectives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Touch Tone first came to the attention of the Colorado Bureau of
Investigation last January. The Los Angeles Police Department asked
for information about the company after records seized from a
private detective's home showed that Touch Tone had provided home
addresses, phone numbers and pager numbers for detectives on the
police department's organized crime squad, according to an
affidavit filed in the Rapp case by Robert Brown, the Colorado
agent in charge of the investigation here.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the information was obtained for Assaf Waknine,
an Israeli identified by the Los Angeles police as an organized
crime member, according to Brown's affidavit. Waknine used the
information to harass detectives and create a ``clone'' of one
detective's pager that received his pages in an attempt to discover
the identity of an informant, according to the affidavit and
interviews with law-enforcement officials here.
</P>
<P>
   In early March, the Colorado authorities set up a sting on Touch
Tone. With the assistance of a cooperative private investigator,
Jane Cracraft, they asked Rapp to obtain bank records and monthly
phone records for a woman. Rapp agreed and explained the way he
worked, according to court records and taped conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The first step, he said, was for him or an employee to assume
the identity of the customer and persuade the customer service
representatives at the banks and phone companies to give them the
customer's information.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We get them to read each and every item off the customer's
account for every month you want,'' he told Ms. Cracraft, who
responded, ``You must be pretty good with your scams.''
</P>
<P>
   With a laugh, Rapp said, ``After 20 years you get pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   True to his guarantee, Rapp provided accurate bank and phone
records for the woman, who was actually an employee of the Colorado
Bureau of Investigation. The cost was $460.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Touch Tone operated out of a dingy three-room office suite in
Aurora. One room contained files for active cases, which were
destroyed after Touch Tone received payment. Another contained
phones and faxes for incoming information requests, which were
logged and routed to Rapp and employees in the adjoining, larger
room.
</P>
<P>
   The larger room was where Rapp oversaw the pretext calls. In the
office jargon, obtaining phone records was known as ``busting a
number'' and getting bank account information was ``breaking the
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Rapp was a brazen whiz at lying. Jeff Harley,
who worked briefly at Touch Tone, told the authorities that once
when he was unable to ``bust'' an unpublished phone number to find
the name and address of the customer, Rapp grabbed the file from
him and got the information on the first try.
</P>
<P>
   Some former employees told the authorities that they had
responded to classified advertisements seeking private
investigators, while others had been sent to Touch Tone by
temporary employment agencies. One former office temp told
investigators that Rapp said to him, ``I need to know how well you
can lie.''
</P>
<P>
   A common ploy used by Touch Tone was to claim to be an irate
husband whose wife had just left him for another man and demand
records of long distance calls because he was not going to pay for
calls to her boyfriend, according to an affidavit in the case. Rapp
liked female employees because they could play on emotions by
crying, Harley said.
</P>
<P>
   The lies worked largely because the callers dealt with customer
service representatives at various businesses who are trained to
provide help. When Touch Tone investigators ran into an unwilling
person, they simply hung up and called again to get another
representative, former employees told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A list of phone numbers for hundreds of banks, phone companies
and credit card businesses nationwide was found in the search at
Touch Tone in May.
</P>
<P>
   When Touch Tone callers pretended to be someone in another city
and wanted information faxed, they used a company that forwards
faxes from dozens of sites around the country, according to the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp employed as many as 20 callers, who were called
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Many Touch Tone employees worked from their homes on a
commission after being trained, said Brown, the Colorado agent, and
his partner, Patrick Maroney.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp's former wife, Holly, told a Denver television station this
week that he had used their young daughter to make calls years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the clients from the seized files are private detective
agencies, the users of the information ranged from tabloids like
the Globe and National Enquirer to banks and insurance companies
seeking information about their own customers, according to records
obtained in the search and interviews with private investigators
who used Touch Tone.
</P>
<P>
   One client was Al Schweitzer, a prominent Denver detective who
does investigative work for television and tabloids. Dahlia Roemer,
a spokeswoman for ABC-TV, said Schweitzer had worked twice as a
consultant for the ABC News program ``20/20'' but that he had not
done investigative work for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer said he had done some investigative work for the
network, but that he never used Touch Tone to get information for
ABC. He added that he stopped using the company more than two years
ago after disagreeing with Rapp over some of his methods.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that one of the largest users of Touch Tone was a
Florida detective agency, Action Research Group. Its Touch Tone
bills for the first four months of this year totaled more than
$20,000. Joe Vepante, the owner of Action Research, said he mainly
got information for banks on people who had bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Former Touch Tone employees said information on celebrities and
victims of accidents had been extremely valuable because it could
be sold over and over. For instance, in a letter to one client
about the JonBenet Ramsey slaying, Rapp listed 14 categories of
items for sale, ranging from phone and credit card records for the
girl's parents to phone records for the family's private detective
and the home address and phone number for the Boulder police
detective investigating the death.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of the Rapps spelled out how they obtained some
information about the Ramseys. Within days of the child's death on
Dec. 26, 1996, callers from Touch Tone used pretexts to obtain
American Express credit card records for her parents, John and
Patricia Ramsey, according to the charges. Those records showed
that purchases were made at a Boulder hardware store several days
before the child's death.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 14, 1997, a Touch Tone investigator called McGuckin
Hardware pretending to be ``John'' and asking for information
concerning two American Express charges. The investigator followed
up with a letter identifying the charges and seeking the invoices.
The letter was signed ``John Ramsey.''
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, the hardware store provided the information on
the purchases, which investigators said later found its way into an
article in the tabloid Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Olmstead, who operates a research firm called Press
Pass Media in Palmdale, Calif., acknowledged that Rapp sent him a
letter offering the Ramsey information for sale but Olmstead said
he did not buy any of it.
</P>
<P>
   Olmstead acknowledged that he often bought phone numbers and
addresses from Touch Tone on behalf of news media clients, whom he
would identify only as some tabloids and mainstream media.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys make promises, but James really delivered,''
said Olmstead, who said everything he bought was used in legitimate
news media inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Maroney of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said
in an interview said Touch Tone records showed that Olmstead bought
American Express records and phone records for Ennis Cosby, the son
of the actor Bill Cosby, after the younger Cosby was slain along a
Los Angeles freeway in January 1997. Olmstead denied acquiring
information about Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Brown said, Touch Tone obtained unpublished phone
numbers, phone records and home addresses for victims of the
Columbine High School shooting in April. He said the information
was obtained for Olmstead.
</P>
<P>
   Olmstead confirmed buying the Columbine information, but he said
it had been for legitimate news purposes. ``Reporters wanted to
speak with these families or send them requests for interviews,''
he said. ``No one was harassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado authorities said constructing the indictment was
complex and unusual. Hall, the lead prosecutor, said some people
had to be convinced that obtaining confidential information by
lying broke the law.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, he said the charges hinged on a state law
that prohibits impersonating someone for profit or to harm them and
on the broad federal wire fraud statute, which makes it a crime to
use a telephone to commit an illegal act.
</P>
<P>
   The racketeering indictment was based on what prosecutors said
was a pattern of violating the state and federal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to put a monetary value on privacy, but it was
clear that the Rapps violated the law in the way they obtained
information,'' Hall said. ``What's against the law is how they got
the information.''

   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, on
Wednesday formally declared an end to the Arkansas phase of his
wide-ranging investigation as he accepted two new guilty pleas from
Webster Hubbell, once the No. 3 official in the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, a longtime Arkansas friend of the Clintons, pleaded
guilty to a felony count that accused him of concealing from
investigators legal work that he and Hillary Rodham Clinton did in
connection with a complex Arkansas land deal that investigators
said was a sham transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr and Hubbell, whom he had indicted three times,
improbably shook hands warmly inside the courtroom on Wednesday,
they fell to bickering outside in separate news conferences as to
what the guilty plea meant, differing over whether it involved Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the count to which he pleaded guilty included
references to Mrs. Clinton's legal work while she was a lawyer in
Arkansas, Hubbell asserted that he did not admit to that part of
the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters that it was ``absolutely not true'' that he
pleaded guilty to lying to regulators to cover up Mrs. Clinton's
involvement, and only admitted concealing a separate matter from
regulators. ``Mrs. Clinton did nothing wrong in connection with
that or any other transaction,'' Hubbell said.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr, following Hubbell to a bank of microphones in front
of the courthouse, said Hubbell pleaded guilty to the entire felony
count, including the section that referred explicitly to Mrs.
Clinton and her work on the land deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell also pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count from a
separate indictment charging that he failed to pay federal income
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James Robertson accepted a recommendation from Starr's
office that Hubbell, a second-time offender, serve no jail time. He
has already served 18 months in jail for defrauding his partners in
the Arkansas law firm where he once worked with Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell will only have to pay a $100 mandatory special
assessment fee on the charge of deceiving regulators, and $25 on
the tax charge. The court did not order him to make restitution of
the $820,000 he is said to owe in back taxes, but he is expected to
face a civil enforcement action from the Internal Revenue Service
on that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who has spent more than five years investigating the
Clintons and their associates, told the court that he welcomed the
plea agreement largely because he has decided it would be in the
public interest to bring the work of his office to an end soon. He
said this was especially important in light of the fact that
Congress has decided to let the independent counsel statute lapse
at midnight on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More surprisingly, Starr said he was uncertain that he would get
a jury to convict Hubbell. The last two cases Starr's office
prosecuted ended in mistrials as jurors could not agree on a
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent experience has indicated to us that it is
extraordinarily difficult to identify and find jurors who are able
to set aside totally their understandings and preconceptions, and
the like,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   He also told reporters he had two avenues of investigation open
and an obligation to write a final report about his wide-ranging
inquiry, which began with an Arkansas land deal known as Whitewater
and eventually included President Clinton's intimate relationship
with Monica Lewinsky. Last December, the president was impeached by
the House of Representatives on the basis of a referral made by
Starr about the Lewinsky matter, but he was acquitted by the Senate
on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Starr declined to discuss the two remaining investigations. But
lawyers involved in the cases have said they center on whether Mrs.
Clinton was truthful in denying a role in dismissing employees from
the White House travel office, and the behavior of Nathan Landow, a
Democratic fund-raiser from Maryland, in Starr's investigation of
allegations that Clinton had groped a White House volunteer,
Kathleen E. Willey, in the Oval Office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The disagreement as to precisely what Hubbell was admitting
guilt about has to do with the wording of the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In court on Wednesday, Robertson asked Hubbell if he pleaded
guilty to Count 1 of the indictment, and he responded, ``I do.''
Count 1 refers explicitly to Hubbell's concealment of work done by
himself and ``the 1985-86 billing partner,'' which was Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The written plea agreement says that ``defendant Webster L.
Hubbell agrees to plead guilty to Count 1'' of the indictment. But
it goes on to say that he will admit that he failed to disclose to
federal banking regulators that his law firm represented someone
who was linked to a business that the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. was investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell contended that he confessed only to that transgression
and not to the remaining parts of Count 1. Starr responded that it
would be unusual to have a defendant admit to each element of a
count. In fact, Count 1 is 89 paragraphs long.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela H. Bucy, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches law
at the University of Alabama, said it was routine to have a
defendant ``allocute'' or specify only a portion of what he is
pleading guilty to. ``Both sides are being pretty clever here,''
she said. ``The way the plea agreement is crafted they can both
claim victory for their point of view.''

THE JOYS OF HUNTING ON PUBLIC PROPERTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM MATTHEWS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO _ It has become an Independence Day ritual for me
to get up before first light, take a .22-caliber rimfire rifle and
a handful of ammunition and go hunting for cottontail rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   I can't help but reflect on the importance of this act.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting is approached with a certain reverence and ritual. But
the fact that California's first hunting season of the year for
mammals and furbearers opens July 1 _ in time to celebrate our
nation's birthday _ is something that has taken on a greater
importance because it embodies so much of what makes this country
strong.
</P>
<P>
   I will be hunting game that by law is owned by all of us on
public land _ in the San Bernardino National Forest, not far from
my home. Our freedoms still intact, we have privileges my ancestors
from England and Germany did not share. I have a stake in the
ownership of this country, both in the ability to vote freely in
selecting our leadership and to call these public lands and the
wildlife therein my own. These are things that are still novel
concepts in much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is usually just starting to transition from total darkness to
that first hint of sunlight when I carry the .22 out to my truck
and start the engine. I'll think of how my grandfather would have
been considered a poacher had he hunted rabbits, stealing out on
the moors of an English estate to pot a family dinner.
</P>
<P>
   It was his ancestors who first settled on these shores and
rebelled against oppressive government and set pen to parchment in
defining a new form of government. Wildlife and most land are
privately owned throughout Europe; the American concept that
wildlife is publicly owned and that hunting is a right of every man
is radical in much of the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Each year I spend too much time musing about these things while
I'm still-hunting along the brushy hillsides for rabbits. I seldom
get many shots off, even though there is an abundance of game.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably I'll start thinking about a barbecue slated for later
in the day and begin focusing on the task at hand. The hunter's
blood flowing through my veins takes over for a while, and I'm
absorbed in the process that has shaped mankind well before there
were governments. I hunt with my eyes and ears, even sniffing the
air, and my mind is clear and attentive.
</P>
<P>
   I'll usually position myself above an intersection of trails and
sit down with the binoculars and start looking for rabbits like I
would for deer.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is usually three rabbits, though the limit is five. But
two will probably be enough; I will stop at that number and be back
home before 7 a.m. There, I will piece out the carcasses and put
them in marinade.
</P>
<P>
   Later that afternoon _ the neighborhood alive with family and
friends and laughing children _ I will stand over the grill,
smelling the fresh meat, and look at the American flags hanging on
the houses and smile.

 U.S. AGENCIES KNEW OF CHILE JUNTA'S ABUSES IN '70s, RECORDS SHOW  
 (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The CIA and other government agencies had detailed
reports of widespread human rights abuses by the Chilean military,
including the killings and torture of leftist dissidents, almost
immediately after a 1973 right-wing coup that the United States
supported, according to once-secret government documents released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,800 documents, which the Clinton administration decided
last year to declassify and make public, could provide evidence to
support the prosecution of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who seized power
in the coup and was arrested in Britain last October. Spain is
seeking his extradition, charging that his junta had kidnapped,
tortured and killed Spanish citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were released as Clinton administration officials
confirmed that the Justice Department has been conferring with
Spanish authorities, in part to exchange information about
Pinochet, including his possible involvement in the 1976 car-bomb
assassination in Washington of a former Chilean ambassador to the
United States, Orlando Letelier, and a colleague, Ronni Moffitt, of
the Institute for Policy Studies. Because the department considers
the Letelier investigation to be ongoing, the government withheld
documents related to the murders, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Historians and human rights advocates, who were busily trying to
sort through the nearly 20,000 pages released Wednesday by the
National Archives, agreed that the documents did not offer
startling revelations about U.S. ties to the Chilean junta under
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, the documents provide rich new detail to
support the long-held view that the United States knew during and
after the coup about the Chilean military's murderous crackdown on
leftists.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, 1973, 10 days after the coup, a once-secret CIA
report said: ``The prevailing mood among the Chilean military is to
use the current opportunity to stamp out all vestiges of communism
in Chile for good. Severe repression is planned. The military is
rounding up large numbers of people, including students and
leftists of all descriptions, and interning them.''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that ``300 students were killed in the
technical university when they refused to surrender'' in Santiago,
the capital, and that the military was considering a plan to kill
``50 leftists'' for every leftist sniper still operating.
</P>
<P>
   In a summary of the situation in Chile a month after the coup, a
CIA report dated Oct. 12 found that ``security considerations still
have first priority with the junta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between people killed during attacks on security
forces and those captured and executed immediately has become
increasingly blurred,'' it continued. The report said the junta
``has launched a campaign to improve its international image; the
regime shows no sign of relenting in its determination to deal
swiftly and decisively with dissidents, however, and the bloodshed
goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a CIA report dated March 21, 1974, insisted that ``the
junta has not been bloodthirsty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has been the target of numerous charges related
to alleged violations of human rights,'' it said. ``Many of the
accusations are merely politically inspired falsehoods or gross
exaggerations.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5,000 people were killed in the coup, including
Chile's democratically elected president, Dr. Salvador Allende,
whose body was recovered from the bombed remains of the
Presidential Palace, which had been attacked by military jets.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more died or were tortured at the hands of the
military during Pinochet's 17-year rule. Last week, the Chilean
College of Medicine reported that at least 200,000 people had been
tortured by government forces at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Nixon administration, the CIA mounted a covert
operation to keep Allende from taking office and, when that failed,
undertook subtler efforts to undermine him. The CIA's director of
operations at the time, Thomas Karamessines, later told Senate
investigators that those efforts ``never really ended.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has never provided a full explanation of what it knew
about human rights abuses carried out by the Chilean military
during and after the coup. But internal government documents
released since have shown that the agency's knowledge of the
violence was extensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration announced last December that, as a
result of the arrest of Pinochet, it would declassify some of the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The administration described the move as an attempt at
government accountability, and it was the first sign that the
United States intended to cooperate in the criminal case being
built against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the documents released Wednesday _ 5,000 of
the 5,800 _ came from the files of the State Department. The CIA
released 490 documents, the FBI 100 and the Pentagon 60.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups said they were surprised by the paucity of
documents declassified by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA has the most to offer but also the most to hide,''
said Peter Kornbluh of the National Security Archive, a
public-interest clearinghouse for declassified documents. The
documents that were released Wednesday, he said, ``show that the
CIA was well-apprised of the vicious nature of the Chilean
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's public affairs office did not respond to phone calls
early Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released Wednesday date from 1973 to 1978, ``the
period of the most flagrant human rights abuses in Chile,'' said
James Foley, a State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said in a statement that ``a limited number of
documents have not been released at this time, primarily because
they relate to an ongoing Justice Department investigation'' of the
murder of Letelier and Ms. Moffitt.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, speaking on condition that they not be
identified, said that the inquiry was active, in part as a result
of information available to the United States from Spanish
prosecutors seeking to try Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In April, they said, a senior criminal prosecutor from the
Justice Department, Mark Richard, traveled to Spain to meet with
Spanish authorities to discuss whether Washington and Madrid could
swap information in their investigations. Prosecutors here have
long been interested in whether there is evidence that Pinochet or
his deputies ordered the murders in Washington because Letelier was
an opponent of the Pinochet regime.
</P>
<P>
   The killings here are believed to have been part of an
orchestrated campaign of violence known within the Pinochet
government as Operation Condor, in which opponents of the junta
were targeted for assassination in and out of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department document dated Aug. 18, 1976, only a month
before Letelier's murder, shows that Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger and other senior department officials were warned of
``rumors'' that Operation Condor might ``include plans for the
assassination of subversives, politicians and prominent figures
both within the national borders of certain Southern Cone countries
and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch, who unearthed the document,
said it ``shows the United States was very aware of the terrorist
activities that General Pinochet and his colleagues were engaging
in there, as well as abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Letelier assassination, the CIA determined that
Operation Condor had become a rogue network that could carry out
other violent acts in the United States, and warned its European
counterparts that they faced a similar threat.

COAST GUARD ISSUES WARNING FOR HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In preparation for the nation's deadliest weekend on the water,
the Coast Guard and other national agencies are warning
recreationists that drinking and boating don't mix.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty people could die on American waterways this Fourth of July
holiday weekend, according to estimates by the Boat Owners
Association of the United States. Statistics compiled by the U.S.
Coast Guard indicate about 30 percent of those fatalities will
involve alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   While safety-equipment failure, changes in weather, rough water
and faulty boat design play a part, the majority of boating deaths
are attributed to such intangibles as operator judgment, awareness
and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Lt.j.g. Ken O'Connor of Coast Guard Station Long Beach will pull
his first stint as command duty officer on a July 4 weekend, but
he's confident in the station's ability to handle any incidents or
rescues from Morro Bay to San Clemente and out 200 nautical miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures compiled by the National Safe Boating
Council, most fatal accidents in small boats over the past several
years have been caused by falls overboard or capsizings. Very few
boating accidents involve vessels colliding.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of these deaths did not occur in bad weather.
They happened during calm conditions on small, inland bodies of
water in boats measuring less than 16 feet long, when passengers
reached too far over the gunwale or while standing up to net a
fish.
</P>
<P>
   In boating accidents among youths, the statistics get more grim.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report from the state Department of
Boating and Waterways, operator inexperience was a factor in 84
percent of accidents involving boaters aged 17 and under. By
comparison, the same cause was attributed in 41 percent of
accidents involving boat operators of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five youths involved in fatal accidents in California in
1998, three were 15 or younger and two of those three were on
vessels that had no adult aboard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For more information on safe boating, call the Alexandria,
Va.-based Boat Owners Association of the United States at (703)
461-2878 or visit its Web site, www.boatus.com, which offers a free
boating safety self-test course with more than 50 multiple choice
questions.

 &HT;    2 arrested in biggest drug bust at Atlanta airport in 5 years
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two people toting small carry-on bags walked into the
waiting arms of federal drug agents at Atlanta's Hartsfield
International Airport, nabbed in the largest cocaine bust there in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Clement, 48, and Jamilla Jones, 25, were arrested Tuesday
as they stepped off a flight from St. Thomas carrying 66 pounds of
the drug, said John Andrejko, special agent in charge of the
Atlanta office of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Clement and Jones face federal charges of conspiracy to
distribute cocaine, possession with intent to distribute cocaine
and importation of controlled substances into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, believed to be drug couriers, had stashed the cocaine
in the luggage, the zippers glued shut, Andrejko said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very unique way of transporting the drug because you
could not open the bag. You had to cut it open,'' he said. ``The
drug was packaged in 1- and 2-kilo quantities. It was the largest
cocaine bust since 1994 at the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   But federal agents fear the quantity confiscated could be a
portent of larger drug shipments expected to come in through
Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the airport has been jockeying to provide more
direct flights from Atlanta to the Caribbean and Latin America,
said airport spokesman Miguel Southwell. Hartsfield last year added
direct service to six Latin American countries and expanded its
frequency of flights to Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the airport more attractive as a shipping point for
drug traffickers, Andrejko said.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment confiscated Wednesday was headed for North
Carolina, Andrejko said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though drug traffickers haven't abandoned the Mexican
border-southwest U.S. connections, the Caribbean and Latin America
as shipping points started gaining popularity in the last year and
a half,'' Andrejko said.

BUSH BREAKS FUND-RAISING RECORDS, CREATING HUGE OBSTACLE TO
CHALLENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON, MCCAIN, GORE-EVERGLADES) 
(rm) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ George W. Bush announced Wednesday that his
campaign has amassed $36.3 million in four months, smashing all
records in presidential politics and assuring that he will have the
resources to dominate, if not overwhelm, the Republican field
throughout the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   The amount is so enormous _ more than any other candidate has
ever collected over an 18-month primary season _ that some
Republican strategists predict it will force other candidates to
bow out long before the first votes are cast early next year. A
huge treasury also makes it virtually certain that Bush will forgo
federal matching subsidies and the spending limits that accompany
them. That would mean that his campaign could far exceed the
ceilings of nearly $50 million in the primary season and not worry
about specific spending caps in pivotal battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's Republican opponents, while admittedly daunted by his
fund-raising prowess, accused his campaign of trying to steamroller
them through a system that some described as flawed _ or even
corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, in a speech in New Hampshire on
Wednesday, vowed to make campaign reform a central issue in his
quest for the Republican nomination. Again and again, he said, he
will campaign against what he declared was ``an elaborate
influence-peddling scheme in which both parties conspire to stay in
office by selling the country to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher who is the
only other candidate who plans to forfeit public subsidies, found
fault with the Bush money machine. ``What George Bush has proven
today is not that he can raise money, but that he is inextricably
tied to Washington lobbyists and special interests,'' said William
Dal Col, Forbes' campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush numbers came one day after several newspapers,
including The New York Times, reported in articles about fund
raising by various campaigns that the Bush campaign would take in
more than $20 million, which still would have been a record.
Campaign officials insisted that they did not put out misleading
figures, saying they did not want to be accused of toying with
expectations. ``We did not want to mislead anybody,'' said Karen
Hughes, the campaign's communications director, explaining that she
and her colleagues told reporters only that ``we've exceeded our
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous record was set by Bob Dole, the Republican nominee
in 1996, who collected $31.3 million over an 18-month period. Even
as an incumbent, President Clinton that year took in $29 million in
the entire primary period. By this time in 1995, Clinton had taken
in $19.5 million; Dole had raised $13.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am humbled by the response,'' Bush said at a news conference
in Los Angeles before he traveled to Sacramento to raise still more
money at a lunch and to San Francisco Wednesday night for a
fund-raising dinner. ``I am, as you can imagine, amazed at the
outpouring of support. This is a campaign that has got a wide range
of people that are willing to help.'' He added, ``People are hungry
for something and I am gratified.''
</P>
<P>
   Marla Romash, deputy chair of Vice President Al Gore's campaign,
insisted that her candidate did not need so much money to compete.
She said Gore, who has collected only half as much as Bush, will
adhere to federal spending limits. And she predicted that the Bush
campaign would ``probably raise and spend somewhere near $70
million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're seeing a lot of people writing a blank check to
a blank slate,'' Ms. Romash said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Bush addressed another sell-out crowd of
roughly 800 people at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While his advisers have said privately for weeks that he would
not need federal money, Bush came the closest thus far to
acknowledging that. ``I will make a decision on that in mid-July,''
he said, adding, with a smile, ``I think this helps make the
decision easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the burden of a spending ceiling, Bush can continue
soliciting huge amounts of money throughout the primary season. The
only candidates who have refused federal money in the past have
been Forbes, Ross Perot and former Gov. John Connally of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet it should be a cautionary tale for Bush that Connally, who
was widely viewed as a formidable contender in the 1980 Republican
primaries, ended up capturing only one delegate _ at a cost of $13
million.
</P>
<P>
   Don Evans, a Texas oilman who is Bush's national finance chair,
said he had no idea how much the governor would ultimately raise.
``There's an unprecedented amount out there,'' he said. Evans said
he did not have breakdowns of how much the campaign raised in each
state.
</P>
<P>
   The actual report that covers the second quarter of the year
does not have to be filed with the Federal Election Commission
until July 15. But Evans said donations were received from more
than 75,000 individuals in every state, with an average
contribution of $480. He said 70 percent of the contributors were
from outside Bush's home state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The only other candidate who will be able to compete financially
with Bush is Forbes, who has vowed to be competitive with Bush.
They are the only two Republicans who will have the money to buy
extensive television advertising in this expensive _ yet vitally
important _ state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proved to be such an able fund-raiser that he has piled
up nearly twice as much as the 11 other Republican contenders
combined. They have raised, collectively, about $20 million thus
far, not including transfers from their existing campaign
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even the fund-raising figures do not tell the full story of
how Bush is in an enviable position financially. While figures were
not available, the Bush campaign has been rather careful in not
spending money too early. Other campaigns are already having
trouble making ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Bush had no apologies for his success in
a system that critics say has become corrupt. ``People are going to
have to develop a level of trust with anyone who seeks public
office,'' he said. ``That is really what leadership is all about.
If people think that a candidate is going to be corrupted by a
$1,000 contribution they should not vote for that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stayed clear of endorsing some of the changes in the law
put forth by McCain. Yet the governor said he would advocate some
reforms. He called for ``instant disclosure on the Internet'' of
contributions. He said the $1,000 limit that an individual can give
to a presidential campaign _ a figure that has not changed since
laws enacted after Watergate more than two decades ago _ should be
raised.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush opposes elimination of political action committees or
of unregulated soft money donations, he said he would favor banning
what he described an ``involuntary contribution'' to federal races.
That would be when a worker from a corporation or labor union is
forced to give money but does not know where it will end up. ``I
believe that the soft money accounts given by corporate America
where there is no active participation by the stakeholder would be
a good reform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial outpouring for Bush has been apparent on his
debut, three-day campaign swing up and down California this week.
At one fund-raiser after another, he was welcomed by large, excited
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Bush held a dinner at the Century Plaza Hotel
in Los Angeles, for years a must-stop on the political fund-raising
circuit. But Brad Freeman, Bush's finance chairman in the state,
told the crowd, ``There have never been more people seated in this
room. We've added eight tables to the stage.''

   GORTON (Washington) _ At age 71, Slade Gorton would be retired
from many jobs in the outside world. But in the Senate, where
septuagenarians could form their own caucus, Gorton is young enough
to be the son of one of his colleagues, Strom Thurmond. As Gorton
gears up to run for fourth term -- at the end of which he would be
79 -- he is bracing for the inevitable questions about his age and
fitness. Gorton is making sure he isn't vulnerable on that score.

SEC IS INVESTIGATING MICROSOFT'S ACCOUNTING PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. announced Wednesday that the Securities and
Exchange Commission was investigating the company's accounting
practices involving the stating of financial reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts said the SEC investigation could be part of its
effort to restrain so-called ``cookie jar'' accounting, which can
have the effect of smoothing over differences between strong and
weak quarters. Microsoft has consistently denied any such intent
and insists that it has adhered to ``conservative'' accounting
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conference call Wednesday with financial analysts
and reporters, Greg Maffei, Microsoft's senior vice president and
chief financial officer, said the company had learned of the SEC
inquiry in the past two months and knew few details, including how
long it would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously a company that is known for conservatism and
I would be surprised if someone was to examine our books and
suggest otherwise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As is its custom in such matters, the SEC declined to comment on
whether an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   But Maffei said Microsoft believed that the SEC had begun its
investigation in January in a response to a wrongful discharge suit
filed by Charles Pancerzewski, a former Microsoft internal auditor.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, brought in 1996 and settled last November on terms
not made public, alleged that the Redmond, Wash., software
publisher had manipulated revenue reserves totaling hundreds of
millions of dollars to make its profits appear more stable.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff said that after reporting his discovery to his
superiors, he was given an unscheduled performance review and asked
to resign. He accused Microsoft of wrongful termination, age
discrimination and breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   In January, The Wall Street Journal said Pancerzewski's attorney
had cited a 1995 e-mail message from a former chief financial
officer, Mike Brown, to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, which read:
``I believe we should do all we can to smooth our earnings and keep
a steady-state earnings model.''
</P>
<P>
   Pancerzewski, who has recently served as a city councilman in
Mukilteo, Wash., was traveling Wednesday and could not be reached.
His lawyer, Pete Vial, said Pancerzewski had been in Washington,
D.C., but said he could not confirm whether his client had spoken
with the SEC because of a confidentiality agreement in the
settlement of his lawsuit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The SEC and its chairman, Arthur Levitt, have undertaken an
overall push to crack down on what they consider earnings
manipulation by companies. The issue ``certainly has Mr. Levitt's
attention,'' said Peter H. Knutson, an associate professor emeritus
of accounting for the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has been very vocal in its criticism of various
accounting practices that may allow companies to smooth out their
results, both bringing several high-profile cases against specific
companies and calling for clearer rules for companies to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday, the SEC reached a settlement with W.R. Grace &AMP;
Co. involving allegations that the company used excess reserves
from a subsidiary to smooth out its results. The company neither
admitted nor denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has also recently brought attention to accounting
practices in the banking industry, where banks may be taking
excessive reserves against future loan losses in order to put aside
something for future periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking at many companies,'' said Joseph Grundfest, a
law professor at Stanford University and former member of the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   While there are accounting rules that govern how and when
companies should book revenues, there is also a lot of flexibility
given to management and their accountants to determine just how to
apply those rules.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of reserves are to reflect a company's true revenues
_ how much it will actually end up collecting in a given period if
customers return merchandise or fail to pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   But these accounting practices do ``open up the door to earnings
management, if not done right,'' said Jack T. Ciesielski, who
writes the Analyst's Accounting Observer, a Baltimore newsletter on
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   In Microsoft's case, the company may have reserved too much,
which would mean that it may have understated its actual profits.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has set aside approximately $4 billion in what it
calls ``unearned revenues'' as a result of the way it sells both
its Windows operating system products and its Office suite of
software applications.
</P>
<P>
   The company often sets revenues aside to account for upgrades
and components that may be delivered later during the product life.
It also sells some products on a license or subscription basis, and
sets revenues aside there as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft also sets aside nonpublic reserves for bad debts,
returned products and other related business contingencies and it
is possible that the SEC investigation is related to those
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement Wednesday that the company said was
unrelated to the SEC investigation, Maffei said Microsoft was
making a series of changes in its accounting practices that would
have only a small impact on its financial results.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company would reclassify earnings and costs for
several of its smaller businesses, including product support,
consulting, certification and consumer Internet service provision,
from 1997 to the present. The changes will have only a small effect
on the company's financial results, which will be reported July 19,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will add about $761 million to the company's
revenues for the first three quarters of 1999, but will also have
an impact on its expenses, so the net impact will be an addition to
its earnings of about one cent per share, Maffei said.

INS' HANDLING OF SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER TO BE INVESTIGATED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department will investigate the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's handling of suspected
serial killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, who was released by the
agency in early June even though he was wanted in a Texas slaying,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, under fire over the matter,
said she requested the investigation by the department, of which
the INS is a part.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's internal auditors will help the Justice
Department's inspector general review procedures and identification
systems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   INS had Resendez-Ramirez in custody June 2 near El Paso but
allowed the illegal immigrant to return to Mexico after a check by
the agency's $65 million identification system failed to turn up
his long criminal record or three past deportations. He is now
sought in at least eight slayings, five in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner's request followed a vitriolic attack Wednesday on her
agency's handling of the case by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio
and chairman of the House panel that oversees INS.
</P>
<P>
   Smith blamed federal incompetence or apathy for the suspected
serial killer's continued freedom and recent slayings, assailing
INS as ``one of the worst-run government agencies in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a frequent INS critic, said the agency's decision to
release Resendez-Ramirez enabled him to hop on freight trains and
allegedly keep killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an agency that is either incompetent or doesn't
care,'' said Smith, who chairs the House Judiciary Subcommittee on
Immigration and Claims. ``We have an agency in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Since June 21, Resendez-Ramirez has been on the FBI's 10 Most
Wanted Fugitives list, suspected in the deaths of five people in
Texas and two in Jackson County, Ill. He also is a suspect in a
1997 slaying in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the attention of federal and Texas authorities Jan. 7
when he was named as a suspect in the slaying of Dr. Claudia Benton
of West University Place, an enclave of Houston. Fingerprints in
the woman's stolen Jeep Cherokee connected Resendez-Ramirez to the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   A federal arrest warrant was issued May 27, the FBI's Houston
office reported. But the warrant apparently did not come up during
the INS check six days later.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno,
whose Justice Department includes INS, should be held responsible
for ``mismanagement and endangering the lives of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith pinned much of the blame for Resendez-Ramirez's release on
INS's Automated Biometric Identification System, or IDENT, intended
to enable the agency to access criminal records of illegal
immigrants. IDENT apparently failed to reveal Resendez-Ramirez's
criminal record, said Smith, who added he no longer believes the
claims of INS officials who had told Congress that the computer
system was operational.
</P>
<P>
   ``IDENT is faulty either because the Justice Department has
terrible judgment or because the administration is not serious
about arresting criminal aliens,'' said Smith. ``Either way, it's
the American people who suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also expressed mock surprise at the apparent failure of
IDENT system in light of the Justice Department's successful
application of the less-expensive, $37 million computer program
that instantly checks the criminal records of would-be gun
purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration wants the FBI to check the
background of every law-abiding sportsman buying a hunting rifle in
the United States,'' Smith said. ``Why can't it also make the INS
and the FBI check the criminal records of anyone who is arrested
after entering the United States illegally?
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez's rap sheet dates to August 1976 when he was
arrested by INS agents at the Brownsville, Texas, port of entry and
returned to Mexico. Since then, he has served about eight years in
U.S. prisons for burglary, auto theft, aggravated assault, falsely
claiming to be a U.S. citizen, illegal gun possession and
fraudulently trying to obtain Social Security cards.

WHITE HOUSE TO PRESENT $7.8 BILLION PLAN FOR EVERGLADES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of negotiations among
environmentalists, farmers and thirsty Florida cities, the Clinton
administration will formally present a plan on Thursday to redirect
billions of gallons of water a day into the Everglades in what
supporters say is the largest effort at environmental restoration
in history.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for spending $7.8 billion over 20 years, half the
money coming from Florida and half from the federal government,
largely to undo a 1,700-mile network of canals and levees built
from the late 1940s to the early '70s to prevent floods and provide
water and land for homes and farms.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers say the system, which flushes out to sea water
that used to meander through the Everglades, has cut the population
of wading birds by more than 90 percent, hurt marine fisheries and
coral reefs by reducing the salt content near shore, and threatened
what is left of the Everglades itself, a vast ecosystem that has no
parallel in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about here is restoring the nation's most
endangered ecosystem,'' said Stuart D. Strahl, vice president of
the National Audubon Society, who is based in Miami. ``The
Everglades have been ditched, diked and drained.''
</P>
<P>
   Without re-plumbing, Strahl said, not only will the Everglades
die, but the farms and cities will also run out of water. ``This is
probably the poster child for sustainability in our hemisphere
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even sugar farmers, often the natural opponents of those who
want to preserve the Everglades because the farms compete for the
water and their runoff pollutes the ecoystem, are in close
agreement on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With over 50 inches of rain a year, it's unconscionable that
we're running out of water,'' said Malcolm S. Wade Jr., a senior
vice president of the U.S. Sugar Corp. When the shortages come, he
said, the growers will not have the political muscle to compete for
the water. ``We've got to be successful,'' Wade said, ``or we've
got problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades transcends politics, and the plan has bipartisan
backing, including support from the camps of two presidential
hopefuls. One is Vice President Al Gore, who said in a statement
released Wednesday: ``Working closely with with the people of
Florida, we have made great strides in restoring this incomparable
landscape. But if future generations are to know the Everglades as
our predecessors did, we must go the next step and restore the
precious flows that are its very lifeblood.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is Florida's Gov. Jeb Bush, the brother of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the leading contender for the Republican
presidential nomination. Members of Jeb Bush's staff were in
Washington on Wednesday to drum up support in Congress, which will
be asked soon to approve the first $1.2 billion for early projects.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 4,000-page plan, no one is sure what the finished
project will look like, partly because no one is sure how to mimic
the natural water cycle of flow, flood and drought that the last 50
years of work has destroyed. The project, which Gore will present
to Congress, includes ``adaptive management,'' meaning provisions
for making big changes as the work goes forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to insure that the right amount of water gets to the
right place at the right time,'' said David E. Guggenheim,
president of The Conservancy of Southwest Florida, explaining the
complications of a first-of-a-kind effort.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, the plan calls for capturing and keeping in the
Everglades most of the 1.7 billion gallons of water now carefully
sent to the Atlantic or the Gulf of Mexico. In the late 1940s that
seemed like a good idea, but Michael Collins, an official of the
agency that manages water flows in the Everglades, said, ``The gap,
the time that we started realizing something was horribly wrong,
was less than 10 years, maybe less than five, after construction.''
</P>
<P>
   An early sign was damage to the ocean environment where salt
water was diluted by bigger-than-natural flows of fresh water.
Guggenheim said, ``We've managed to make fresh water a pollutant.''
</P>
<P>
   But agreeing on what needs to be done is just one step; the next
question is how. The plan calls for storage techniques never tried
in the Everglades, like a surface reservoir of 62 square miles,
just 4 to 8 feet deep. Even some supporters think the water might
evaporate or seep into the porous soil before it could be useful.
</P>
<P>
   The initial design is for more than 60 separate projects,
including removing dikes and building barriers at the eastern edge
of the Everglades, where urbanized Miami gives way to sawgrass and
alligators. Backers do not even agree among themselves, though, on
which dikes should be removed and which barriers erected.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service,
both parts of the Interior Department, have come to support the
plan, after changes made since a draft was issued in April. Top
officials of the two agencies cited a promise to divert a bigger
volume of water to the Everglades, and a commitment to expedite
land acquisition to protect the Everglades, among other steps. Just
what land should be bought, and how much, is still contentious.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: RESTLESS RADICALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is one thing political observers should have learned in
the '90s, it's to never underestimate the talent Republicans have
for squandering a big advantage.
</P>
<P>
   George Herbert Walker Bush was invincible after the triumph of
the Persian Gulf war. And yet there was Bill Clinton, only recently
escaped from the Gennifer Flowers scandal, being sworn in as
president on Jan. 20, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the Republicans won control of both houses of Congress
for the first time in 40 years. But Newt Gingrich and his gang
behaved like the leaders of a thuggish revolution rather than the
winners of an election. They misread the public. They shut down the
government. The advantage shifted back to the wily Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republicans have a presidential candidate in George W.
Bush, who is on an early roll. He may have stumbled once or twice
over the ``Kosovoians'' and the ``Grecians,'' but he accumulates
cash with astonishing quickness, and he's far ahead in the polls.
If the election were held today, he would win.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans should be delighted. But the radicals are
restless. A page 1 headline in The Times on Tuesday said: ``GOP's
Right Talks of Bolting Faithless Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The story, by Richard L. Berke, began: ``Many politically active
conservatives say they are increasingly frustrated and distressed
by the early dominance of George W. Bush in the Republican
Presidential race. They accuse their party of sacrificing principle
in the name of pragmatism, prompting some to talk of mounting a
third-party campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. is not conservative enough for these folks. They're
looking for a lunatic and they'd rather lose than settle for
anything less.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party is already right wing. It's already the
party of the mega-corporations and the ultra rich. It's already the
party that opposed a tiny increase of 90 cents in the minimum wage
and that tried to eliminate Federal nutrition standards for school
meals.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope the extremists follow through on their threat
of a third-party challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in what the GOP has been up to lately should
take a look at the Senate. For more than a week the Republicans and
the Democrats were locked in a nasty fight over proposals to give
patients certain new health care guarantees. Quick, which party was
in favor of substantially strengthening patients' rights and which
was on the side of the insurance companies and the health
maintenance organizations?
</P>
<P>
   I hope that wasn't too tough.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate fight was not over the merits of the legislation,
but over the Republican majority's refusal until Tuesday night to
even allow debate on a series of Democratic proposals aimed at
curbing abuses by insurance companies and HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   There is strong support among the public and among health care
professionals for the Democratic proposals, known as the patients'
bill of rights. The Republicans have offered much weaker
legislation and have not been anxious to permit a public airing of
the differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all leading patient and medical groups have
supported the Democratic proposal _ Senator (Tom) Daschle's
proposal,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy on the Senate floor on Monday.
``These groups do not care whether Democrats or Republicans are on
a piece of legislation. They just want a strong bill. And virtually
every single leading medical group in our country supports ours.
None supports theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago I spoke by phone with Steve Grissom of Cary, N.C.
He is 50 years old and suffers from leukemia and AIDS, which he
contracted through a blood transfusion. Grissom is locked in a
harrowing dispute with his insurance providers over payment for
medical equipment and a continuing supply of oxygen that could
determine whether he lives or dies.
</P>
<P>
   Said Grissom: ``I've been a Republican all my life. I don't
think I've ever missed a vote. Now is the first time in my life
that I've considered changing my party affiliation, because I see a
real lack of compassion in the Republican Party. They're hearing
from the HMOs and they're hearing from the lobbyists with their fat
checkbooks, and they're not hearing from people like me who are in
desperate need of this kind of consumer protection.''  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE AGING VETERAN AND A ROOKIE

<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The raucous cheering from behind the
ivy-covered wall had long since given way to polite applause, and
this was the surest sign that Boris Becker was on his way out on
Center Court.
</P>
<P>
   On Court 5, one long mis-hit away from tennis' most hallowed
turf, Alexandra Stevenson was completing a Houdini-like performance
that was Becker's trademark when he first won Wimbledon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Becker win?'' asked Stevenson,
qualifier-turned-quarterfinalist, having barely survived a match
point and outlasting Lisa Raymond in three sets. ``I hope he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker was at that moment misplaying his last Wimbledon point, a
backhand half volley wide, and surrendering to Patrick Rafter in
straight sets. With a shrug and a smile, the likable German said
farewell to the court that 18-year-old Alexandra Stevenson has
dreamed of playing on since she was the 9-year-old charge of Pete
Fischer, Pete Sampras' former coach.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting the proximity of Court 5 and that this is her first
appearance in the main Wimbledon draw, Stevenson said, ``I've never
been close.''
</P>
<P>
   She won't make Center Court Thursday in her quarterfinal match
against Jelena Dokic, but Stevenson can count on remaining in the
middle of deepening intrigue. Her coming-out party as a tennis
professional has turned, sadly, into an enervating inquiry on race
and sex.
</P>
<P>
   These are subjects that sell spectacularly at Wimbledon, and
elsewhere. ``Let's please talk about my tennis,'' Stevenson pleaded
Wednesday after reading a statement to clarify earlier statements
made by her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Too late. The dialogue that began with comments Samantha
Stevenson claimed were misrepresented has escalated into a tabloid
feeding frenzy. And a Florida newspaper report, as well as The
Associated Press, Wednesday claimed that the name Julius Winfield
Erving II is listed as the father on the birth certificate of
Alexandra Winfield Stevenson, who was raised solely by her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball legend was quoted by The AP as saying, ``This is
not the time to talk to anyone about personal business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' Alexandra Stevenson said after her 2-6, 7-6
(10-8), 6-1 takeout of Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' said Samantha Stevenson, standing in the lobby
of the players' tearoom, about the time Venus Williams walked by,
with an impish smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear there's more up with you today,'' Williams told her
friend's and fellow quarterfinalist's mother. ``You're having quite
a week.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone understands the position Alexandra Stevenson is in, it
is Williams. You may recall that her run to the final in her first
U.S. Open two years ago became a forum for her father, Richard, to
literally phone in charges of racism on the women's tour.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stevenson, a freelance sports journalist whose work
appears in The New York Times, said Wednesday that the last thing
on her mind was controversy, or attention. She said she was ``being
generous with colleagues,'' some of whom attached sexual innuendo
to comments she made about protecting her daughter from other women
in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   As for her revelations on tennis racism, which included a racial
epithet directed at her mixed-race daughter a year ago at the
Wimbledon junior qualifying, she said much of that was nothing that
people had not heard before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't take back what I said because I didn't say anything
wrong,'' Samantha Stevenson said.
</P>
<P>
   No one here has argued that, and no one should. At the very
least, an insider's perspective is entitled to a proper hearing. I
just wonder if this was the appropriate time, and place.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Stevenson wanted to talk more Wednesday about her
parts in high school plays, and why wouldn't she? She already had
chilling personal material, with Fischer in jail for child
molestation and her best friend and childhood hitting partner, Eric
Basica, suffering from cancer and e-mailing her from back home in
California. Before this week, people knew little, if anything,
about Alexandra Stevenson. Now, maybe they know too much.
</P>
<P>
   The case that this has distracted from her tennis is more
difficult to make. Stevenson Wednesday shrugged off a disquieting
first set, saved the second-set tie breaker, at 5-6, with a running
forehand pass and then crushed Raymond with a grass-court power
game that Becker once made a living on here.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, in fact, had recently noticed Stevenson, a can't-miss
6-footer with heavy, blistering strokes, on a nearby practice
court, and had commented to someone that the American teen-ager
reminded him of himself. The mid-1980s version, that is. Not the
one who waved goodbye to Center Court, at about the time Alexandra
Stevenson moved one step closer, baggage and all.

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO RESTRICT MINORS' ABORTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to
make it a federal crime for an adult to take a minor to another
state for an abortion to bypass a parental-notification law in the
girl's home state.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in three weeks that the House considered
an emotional social issue that sharply divides conservatives from
liberals. As was the case with gun control two weeks ago and flag
burning last week, the abortion debate was dominated by heated
oratory, but it seemed unlikely to lead to the enactment of any
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill was approved by the House last year and died in a
Senate filibuster. Even if the Senate passes the bill this year,
the White House has said the president will veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's House vote, 270-159, was well short of the
two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 states have laws that require girls under 18 to
notify their parents and, in some states, get their parents'
consent before they can have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that thousands of women a year travel from states
with such laws to those without them to have abortions. Women from
Pennsylvania, for example, often go to New York, New Jersey or
Maryland; those from Missouri go to Illinois; those from Virginia
go to the District of Columbia, and those from Massachusetts go to
New Hampshire or Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many of these cases involve minors who do not
want to tell their parents. But some abortion clinics advertise in
neighboring states that they do not require parental notification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is criminal, and this practice has to stop,'' said Rep.
Tom DeLay, of Texas, the Republican whip. ``Parents have a right to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. , argued that
``there are times when a pregnant teen-ager cannot go to her
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no disagreement, however, over a point made by Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who opposed the legislation. ``The real
purpose of this bill,'' Nadler said, ``is to make it as difficult
as possible for a young woman to get an abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would not penalize the girls who had abortions but
would subject those who were convicted of taking them across the
state line to up to a year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides recited horror stories. Proponents told of a
12-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who was taken for an abortion to
New York by the mother of a boy who had raped her. Opponents told
of girls who could not tell their parents of their pregnancies and
who were injured in illegal or self-induced abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents emphasized that the measure would apply even to
close relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill could throw grandmothers in jail for helping their
granddaughters,'' said Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., a grandmother
herself.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 206 Republicans and 64 Democrats voted for the bill;
14 Republicans, 144 Democrats and an Independent voted against it.

U.S. INVESTIGATORS NOW SEEK INSURANCE FRAUD SUSPECT IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Miss., Tenn.)   (bl)  
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal investigators hunting for Martin Frankel, the
Connecticut money manager wanted in a huge insurance fraud, believe
that they have traced him to Europe and are actively pursuing leads
there, law enforcement officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the hunt for Frankel were among several revelations
in the fast-moving scandal Wednesday, as a Connecticut criminal
lawyer disclosed that he has been authorized to represent the
financier and Mississippi regulators said that they had filed
orders to liquidate three insurance companies in his crumbling
corporate empire.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel has been missing since May 5, when firefighters were
called to his mansion in Greenwich, Conn., and found smoldering
documents stuffed in fireplaces. Since then, federal prosecutors
and regulators in several states concluded that Frankel fled as a
years-long scheme to drain cash from a series of insurance
companies he controlled was coming unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   To date, no one is completely sure how much money is missing
from the insurance companies, but court records and insurance
regulators place the number in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The government officials declined to specify which European
countries are the focus of their search or whether an arrest is
imminent. But the fact that an active hunt appears to be under way
in Europe is a strong sign that Frankel may have left behind clues
of his destination or has made mistakes while on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's apparent decision to contact the Connecticut lawyer,
Hugh Keefe, is the first sign that he has interest in maintaining
some contact with federal prosecutors pursuing the case.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Keefe said he was recently contacted by
Frankel, and was asked to represent him. Keefe said that although
he has not been formally retained, he has agreed tentatively to
represent Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Keefe said he had not met with Frankel in person, and does not
know how the money manager learned of him. He declined to discuss
any details of their conversations, but said that Frankel ``seemed
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   While Keefe has been in contact with federal authorities
involved in the case, he denied a report Wednesday in The Hartford
Courant that Frankel has asked a lawyer to contact federal
prosecutors to discuss possible surrender terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has absolutely not expressed an interest in turning himself
in,'' Keefe said. ``That is absolutely false.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Keefe declined to specify the reasons he
contacted the government on behalf of Frankel. But he said that, in
such cases in general, a client reading news stories about warrants
being issued for their arrest may wish to have a lawyer find out
details, such as the underlying charge and the name of the lead
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's decision to approach a lawyer ran counter to the
advice he has provided to at least one of his former associates. A
lawyer retained by a former girlfriend said that his client was
called by Frankel shortly after he fled his home.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the woman said that Frankel urged her not to hire
her own lawyer, and that he would provide one for her. The lawyer,
who spoke on condition that neither he nor his client be
identified, said that Frankel cautioned the woman that ``lawyers
are our enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who met Frankel through a personal ad, told her
lawyer that in the same conversation, she also spoke to at least
one of the women who disappeared with Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left on the cell phone numbers of several of the women
identified as having fled with Frankel went unreturned, and
attempts to reach them through their pagers also failed.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi filed its final orders of liquidation against the
three insurance companies late Tuesday, after insurance regulators
determined that the companies are insolvent and efforts to revive
them would be futile.
</P>
<P>
   The companies were subsidiaries of insurers controlled by Thunor
Trust, a Tennessee investment vehicle that federal investigators
believe were secretly controlled through a complex corporate
structure by Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   The liquidation order the final administrative step in taking
control of the companies and the first step toward raising money to
pay policyholders claims. ``This starts the clock toward paying
claims,'' said Mississippi Insurance Commissioner George Dale.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies involved are Franklin Protective Life
Insurance Co. and Family Guaranty Life Insurance Co., both units of
Franklin American Corp., and First National Life Insurance Company
of America, a subsidiary of International Financial Corp.
Regulators declared them insolvent with total liabilities of $21.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Rusty Haydel, the executive director of the Mississippi
Life and Health Insurance Guarantee Association, said he believed
money would be available to pay some claims within a week or so.
But he said it would probably be at least two or three months
before the reserves of the three companies have been replenished.

 &HT;    World could grow old ungracefully with population explosion
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Baby boomers have ushered in most every major trend
over the past 50 years. But it was their grandparents who were part
of the most radical demographic change of the past half-century _
the dramatic increase in longevity.
</P>
<P>
   This trend raises a tough question. Fortune (July 19) asks: Will
the elderly live so long that society can't cope?
</P>
<P>
   Recent evidence points to a population explosion among senior
citizens that may amount to the biggest demographic change of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``One projection says there will be nearly 37 million boomers
aged 85 and over by the year 2050 _ more than twice the
government's best guess,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Writer David Stipp says economic disaster may result unless far
more stringent policies are put in place now on everything from
raising the retirement age to trimming Social Security and Medicare
entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Fortune looks at how Coca-Cola's chief executive
officer, M. Douglas Ivester, is weathering ``a storm of troubles,''
including but not limited to the recent recall of company products
in Belgium and France. Despite a company overflowing with trouble,
says Fortune, Ivester swears that he's in firm control of ``the
most noble business on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   A market upside down
</P>
<P>
   One of the big changes on Wall Street in the last three months
was the rotation of stock buying into industrial, or cyclical,
stocks after big, blue chip growth stocks had dominated the market
for so long. Investors were suddenly afraid that their highly
valued growth stocks would be hammered by rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Smart Money (July), in its midyear investment guide, says it
would be a mistake for investors to bail out of one category of
stocks and into another, since the new group may be the next to go
out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   The message is to diversify, the magazine says. It recommends 10
``undervalued'' stocks in five industry groups: Lear and Dana in
the auto parts group, Black &AMP; Decker and Maytag in consumer
cyclicals, Newport News and L-3 Communications in defense, Ispat
International and Metals USA in steel, and Synopsys and BMC
Software in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ In a rare profile of Warren Buffett, Business Week (July 5)
says the billionaire investor is becoming more of a buyer of
companies than an investor in stocks. His Berkshire Hathaway has
acquired seven diverse companies for a total of $27.3 billion in
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worth (July/August) offers readers its ratings and forecasts
for 840 mutual funds, with advice from five mutual fund gurus.
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies with ``dot.com'' in their names aren't the only
successful start-ups these days. Inc. (July) profiles 10 successes,
including a superstore for flowers, an ice cream maker, a store for
pets and a service station for boats.

CHRISTIAN MUSIC HITS A HIGH NOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, when he first hit the national Christian music
scene, Steven Curtis Chapman figured that if he worked as hard as
he could, toured till he dropped and got really lucky he might,
just might, someday sell 40,000 copies of a CD and be able to pack
'em in at youth conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't turn out that way.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out a whole lot better.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Chapman _ who has sold more than 4 million CDs,
won three Grammys and regularly sells out large halls _ will
headline Celebrate Freedom '99, which is expected to draw 100,000
people, by far the largest one-day pop music event in North Texas
all summer.
</P>
<P>
   The free all-day concert will be at Southfork Ranch in Parker,
Texas. Sponsored by Christian radio station KLTY/94.1 FM, CF '99
will feature more than a dozen acts, including such top names as
Avalon, Twila Paris and Rebecca St. James.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of where he and Christian music were at the dawn of
the decade and where they are now is not lost on Chapman, a
personable Kentucky native who could easily be the one-man
personification of the genre's astounding growth in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun and interesting to see where God will
take this music,'' Chapman says. ``We don't want to lose sight of
why we're doing this, but it is exciting for me to hear a dc Talk
record on a pop station and see their videos alongside mainstream
acts. In terms of growth, we're all still amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   As well he might be. According to the Recording Industry
Association of America, gospel/Christian music has gone from $160
million in annual sales in the late '80s to nearly $900 million
last year. Christian music sales total more than classical, New Age
and jazz combined. Half of all Christian music sells in mainstream
retailers, such as Tower Records, Wal-Mart and Blockbuster. And the
top three markets for Christian music are New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Christian performers such as Michael W. Smith, dc Talk, Jars of
Clay, Point of Grace and Chapman regularly sell more than 300,000
copies of their CDs, often a lot more, and draw sellout crowds at
arenas and amphitheaters once reserved for rock bands.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there's the mainstreaming of gospel via
performers such as Kirk Franklin. Twenty years ago, a gospel
performer selling a million copies of a record was unthinkable.
Franklin has now done it several times, and other artists, such as
Fred Hammond and God's Property, have been nearly as popular.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has been possible for several reasons, not the least
of which was how angry and despairing rock music was at the dawn of
the '90s. Chapman and KLTY promotions director Keith Nelson point
to what Chapman calls the ``void'' left by grunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were sick of the `die, die, die' negativity of metal
and grunge,'' Nelson says. ``Christian music brought positivity to
the forefront and filled a tremendous need in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was more than just young people seeking an alternative to
Pearl Jam, says Frank Breeden, president of the Gospel Music
Association. Baby boomers, he says, were growing older and raising
families. They were looking for answers and stability that hadn't
been provided by culture _ music and everything else _ of the
hedonistic '70s and greed-filled '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Christian music, he says, was simply part and parcel of that.
</P>
<P>
   From a practical standpoint, the decade has also seen an
improvement of the sonic quality of Christian recordings. Chapman
and Breeden say that at the outset, frankly, Christian records
simply sounded weak next to those by secular singers and bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real awakening taking place around the turn of the
decade among the major labels,'' Breeden says. ``A lot of people at
labels were saying, `We have to do better than this _ we can't do
it with lame art.' Labels allocated a lot more of their budgets for
production and better producers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Breeden says one of the most important aspects of the rise
of Christian music was the full-scale participation of the genre in
SoundScan beginning in 1996. SoundScan is a computerized system of
tracking CD sales; it shows exactly who is selling how much, and
where.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd never had point-of-sales tracking before,'' he says. ``It
was important because it confirmed Christian music sales were as
strong as we thought they were. ... It also gave us immediate
feedback about what was selling where, which led to detailed
marketing and promotion around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect of all this was greatly increased sales _ but just as
important, the assumption that the music would sell and that people
could and would listen to both religious and secular music. In the
'80s, Chapman says, a Christian artist such as Amy Grant who
crossed over to pop was criticized more sharply (and more often)
than today, when it's common to see and hear Christian artists
competing with secular ones.
</P>
<P>
   And that, in a way, has led us to Chasing Furies, a sibling trio
that will be on the Celebrate Freedom bill. Sarah, Josh and Rachel
Meeker grew up in Fort Worth but left for Colorado four years ago,
formed the band in 1997 and signed with Sparrow Records (home to
Chapman and numerous other top acts) in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Performers such as Chasing Furies represent a generation of
Christians who grew up with the idea that pop and Christian music
could go hand in hand and who used more secular influences in their
music and their overall approach than any other generation of
Christian performers.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Meeker, 22, is the Furies' main songwriter and vocalist _
and her cultural/musical background includes listening to both the
dance-pop of Depeche Mode and the lighter, breezier acts such as
Over the Rhine and Innocence Mission.
</P>
<P>
   Meeker says she wants the band to appeal to hip young people _
and knows that, in some cases, it's a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time that I quit listening to Christian music _
the quality just wasn't where I wanted it,'' she says. ``And when I
started singing I wasn't sure a Christian label would want us. Or
that they'd support a band that wants to play in clubs and minister
to those people. There's whole groups of people that can't or won't
go to churches _ they're in the (clubs) of every city, and that's
where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, she says, won't ever listen. But that's OK; at
least, she says, Chasing Furies is in a position to try to reach
those who have an open mind about Christian music. Which is to say,
more people than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is a searching generation,'' she says. ``If
the music is from our hearts, it'll be stuff that other people want
to have. It has meat to it, and I think people grasp that.''

 &HT;    Lower sales to hit Coke's bottom line
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co., for only the second time in more than a
decade, said Wednesday that its worldwide case sales will fall for
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drop in second-quarter volume will occur in Europe,
where the company recalled 14 million cases following a health
scare in Belgium, France and several other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The recall will depress profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings per share in the quarter will reflect the loss of
sales in several key markets resulting from the European
situation,'' the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Case sales will drop an estimated 6 percent to 7 percent in
Europe, pulling down total worldwide volume by 1 percent to 2
percent. Before the recall, analysts had been predicting about a 3
percent decline in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Volume will be flat ihat only one interest rate boost will be
enough to fight inflation _ a decision that puts corporate profits
back in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But some strategists worry the Fed's lone rate increase was too
small to have the intended inflation restraining impact. If so,
that could make further rate increases necessary _ and at greater
cost to the markets.
</P>
<P>
   That's the mixed review given to the Fed's decision on Wednesday
to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage
point, to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the Fed eased the threat of further rate
increases any time soon by dropping the ``bias'' toward tighter
credit that it adopted in May after a flurry of bad inflation news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings have got the stage pretty much to themselves now,''
said Charles L. Hill, research director of First Call, an
organization that tracks analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Fed had retained the bias towards higher rates, people
would still be talking about interest rates. Now earnings will be
the focus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect sent stocks surging along a broad front. The
technology-loaded Nasdaq composite rose 1.7 percent, outperforming
the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 1.4 percent.
Both the Nasdaq composite and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 set
records.
</P>
<P>
   The gains probably would have been bigger had the Fed's rate
increase not been so widely anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market also rallied, sending 30-year Treasury yields
back below 6 percent for a time. The mark closed at an even 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the quarter-point rise in the federal funds rate
_ what banks charge each other for overnight loans _ will
eventually ripple through the economy in the form of higher rates
on auto, appliance and home equity loans. Business loans will also
rise. Major banks reacted by announcing they would raise their
prime rate to 8 percent from 7.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a quarter percentage point is going to make it
so people can't afford to buy more goods,'' said Gary Thayer, chief
economist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``But I do think
some families might decide to delay purchases, waiting for a better
bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This increase won't stop consumer spending,'' said Bruce
Bittles, market strategist for J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co. in Nashville. He
cited Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's well-known concern that the
stock market's wealth effect on consumer spending is one of the
economy's big problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Legacy South strategist Phillip M. Larkins
questioned the Fed's decision to return to a neutral posture on
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had raised rates half a percent and then gone back to
neutral, or raised rates a quarter point and kept the bias
tendency, it would have made more sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase was almost universally anticipated, mostly
because of Greenspan's June testimony before Congress in which he
defended the concept of a ``pre-emptive'' strike against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement Wednesday, the Fed explained that it
dropped the rate bias because ``much of the financial strain'' that
hurt the economy in last fall's global economic crisis had eased.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also noted that while labor markets have continued to
get tighter, productivity growth ``has contained inflationary
(wage) pressures'' caused by the tight markets. Now, with higher
rates and rising bond yields out of the way, investors can focus on
the second-quarter earnings reports that will be released over the
next five or six weeks, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said second-quarter earnings reports ``will be terrific,''
rising 15 percent year-over-year, compared with 10 percent in the
first quarter. He said profit growth probably will rise 20 percent
year-over-year in the third quarter. According to Sam Stovall, a
sector strategist for Standard &AMP; Poor's, the rise in interest rates
will probably have the least impact on industries that make
consumer products that are always in demand _ drugs, personal care
items, beverages, tobacco, paper.
</P>
<P>
   The worst performers are likely to be industries that depend on
an expanding economy, such as heavy machinery, consumer cyclicals
such as autos and appliances, banks and other interest-sensitive
sectors, and transportation.

HOUSE TO TAKE UP FINANCIAL OVERHAUL LAW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than 20 years of failed votes in
Congress, and hundreds of millions of dollars spent on lobbying,
lawmakers are on the verge of the first broad display of support to
remake the nation's financial system.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a Senate vote on May 6 to approve sweeping
deregulation that would make it easier for banks, insurers and
securities companies to enter each other's businesses, the House
will take up its own version of the measure on Thursday. The bill
has been written by both Republicans and Democrats, and it has
enjoyed broad support from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   If the House approves the legislation, as some lobbyists,
administration officials and lawmakers predicted Wednesday, it
would be the first time in more than 20 years that both houses of
Congress, in the same term, voted to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act
of 1933 and nearly six decades worth of other legislation rooted in
the nightmarish experiences of the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   No one who favors a new law is celebrating yet. The
legislation's course through Congress has always been perilous, and
a few big obstacles remain. In particular, the House and Senate
bills contain other important, and possibly irreconcilable
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists in both houses have embarked on a
strategy of delaying resolution of the most contentious issues that
have in the past stymied the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many longtime veterans of the struggles over
changing the financial services industry said Wednesday that the
chances were better ever that Congress might act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train seems to be on the track toward a far more
concentrated financial services industry,'' said Kenneth Guenther,
a top lobbyist for the Independent Community Bankers Association,
who has spent 18 years in legislative battles over the issue. ``If
it passes, the push will be to resolve the difficult issues in
conference and have the conference write the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the proposed legislation to overhaul the financial
system was little more than a powerful vehicle for the fund raising
efforts of many lawmakers, as the industry lobbyists fought
furiously to a stalemate. In the last session of Congress alone,
the three industries have poured $86 million into campaign war
chests, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonpartisan research group.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the political investment may be paying off. With
traditional lines blurring between the insurance, securities and
banking businesses, industry lobbyists who were once at odds are
now largely in accord on most of the central issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so close to having legislation, closer than we've ever
been before,'' said Dan Zielinski, a spokesman at the American
Insurance Association, which represents 375 property and casualty
insurers. ``It's because the market has advanced to such a degree
that everyone has decided it's in their interests to have this
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are differences that must be worked out for there
to be a new law. President Clinton has threatened to veto the
Senate measure, which was adopted by a 54-44 vote along party
lines. In the fight between the Treasury Department and the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Senate sided with Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, giving his agency a greater regulatory
role in monitoring nationally chartered institutions.
</P>
<P>
   It also diluted the requirements that banks make loans to
minorities, farmers and others who have had relatively little
access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the House approved a bill by a single vote, but the
measure died in the Senate. This year, as privacy issues have
dominated the agenda for both regulators and lawmakers, the House
measure is the subject of a big last-minute fight over whether it
should enable customers to prohibit the sharing of information
about them between affiliated companies and outsiders, such as
telemarketing firms.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans want to give
consumers the ability to curtail the sharing of information, so
that, for instance, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit would not
be able to share information with Citigroup's Travelers unit.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups oppose such a provision and have pledged to
campaign against any legislation that forbids affiliates of the
same company from sharing customer information. As a result, an
alternative has emerged that would give customers the right to only
block information from being provided to third parties. But large
financial conglomerates would still be able to share the
information between affiliated companies.
</P>
<P>
   If the privacy issues are worked out, then lobbyists, members of
Congress and administration officials said they expected the
legislation to pass by a wide margin.

CANCELING FIREWORKS FOR EGRETS IRKS MANY IN DALLAS SUBURB 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARROLLTON, Texas _ This year, the Independence Day celebration
in this Dallas suburb will be for the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
   There will be flag waving, music, speeches and food, but, in
deference to its feathered transients, Carrollton will forgo the
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council voted this week to eliminate a 12-minute
pyrotechnic display from its two-hour Fourth of July party Thursday
night at a city park that is also home to an egret rookery.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very upset about it,'' said City Councilman Andrew
Olivo, the only member who voted in favor of the fireworks at a
special meeting Sunday. ``There is no legal reason for not doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   No legal reason, perhaps, but abundant political and public
relations motives.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Carrollton became embroiled in a long-running
controversy after it bulldozed an egret rookery. Residents of
nearby neighborhoods had complained about the noise and odor from
the stand of trees where the birds gathered each spring to hatch
their young.
</P>
<P>
   In violation of the 1918 Migratory Bird Act, work crews advanced
on the rookery before sunrise July 23. Trees were felled and pushed
into a pile, along with many young birds nesting in them.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of egrets took flight and circled overhead, filling
the morning sky with a density that some residents mistook for
smoke. At least 300 birds were killed and 250 injured.
</P>
<P>
   As public outrage grew, the city spent nearly $130,000 to care
for injured birds and release the survivors back into the wild.
Last month, the city paid a $70,000 fine levied by the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have certainly learned a lot in the past 10 months, and our
community will greatly benefit from our heightened environmental
sensitivity,'' Mayor Milburn Gravley said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some Carrollton residents think that sensitivity has
reached the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' said John Kampschroeder, commander of the
Carrollton VFW Post. ``They're walking on tiptoes. I can't
understand the birds getting all this attention and we have to
alter our lifestyles.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the bulldozing controversy, the city designated
land for a new rookery and created the Wildlife and Environmental
Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, that committee looked at the plans for the
fireworks show and approved them, said Randy Beckham, owner of
Pyrotex Inc., which had a $12,000 contract with the city to stage
the display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not going to destroy the rookery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Beckham conducted a test at the site, which is 1,900
feet from the rookery. A brief series of explosions startled the
egrets, many of which flew from their roosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Lanier (chairman of the Wildlife and Environmental
Advisory Committee) was willing to allow the show. But by the next
morning, I knew it was off,'' Beckham said.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A special meeting of the City Council was held Sunday and the
fireworks portion of the celebration was scuttled. The city
apparently will still have to pay Pyrotex Inc. the contract amount.
</P>
<P>
   Olivo, the lone dissenting voice, said he believes the council
was too sensitive to its ``previous problem'' with the egrets.
While the noise and lights from the fireworks may have frightened
the birds, he said, the display would not have been an act of
aggression against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not going after the birds,'' he said. ``It's a
national holiday. Everybody else is doing it. It's the last Fourth
of July celebration in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Kampschroeder, while critical of the City Council's decision,
said he could ``see their point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This city has taken a torpedo (over egrets),'' he said. ``What
if something happened? What if a fire started in those trees where
they roost? You can bet that everyone would say that Carrollton
planned it to get rid of those birds. I can understand why they
would be concerned.''

ANNAN TURNS UP PRESSURE FOR MORE AID TO KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Warned on Wednesday that urgent action was
needed to reintegrate refugees flooding back into Kosovo, U.N.
members were cajoled or shamed into pledging additional money and
personnel to help secure and assist a democratic, multi-ethnic
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the conference, organized by Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, the 18 self-declared ``Friends of Kosovo'' had almost
doubled their contributions to what will be an armed international
police force in the Serbian province _ boosting the promised forces
from 1,000 to 1,938. That total, however, is still about 1,000
short of the 3,110 police that the United Nations estimates are
needed to stop revenge killings and looting and to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, members of the world body failed to agree
Wednesday on the nature and scope of international assistance for
Yugoslavia as long as Slobodan Milosevic remains president.
</P>
<P>
   Pledges of additional support came from the foreign ministers
and other senior officials who attended the conference, the first
review of international relief and rehabilitation efforts since
June 10 when the Security Council approved a resolution authorizing
the United Nations to run a civilian administration in Kosovo along
side KFOR, the NATO-led military force. While KFOR is supposed to
have some 50,000 troops, less than half of them have been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Annan organized the conference largely to encourage donors to
increase their contributions. ``These are pledges, and we cannot
deploy and distribute what we do not have,'' Annan told the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was unable on Wednesday to name the U.N. chief
representative to Kosovo. According to senior U.N. officials, he
had planned to announce that he had chosen Martti Ahtisaari, the
Finnish president, but Ahtisaari was said to have withdrawn from
consideration after France demanded that he resign as president in
order to devote himself full-time to the post.
</P>
<P>
   France has its own candidate: Bernard Kouchner, its health
minister, whom Annan named on Wednesday as one of four candidates
he is considering. The others are Paddy Ashdown, Britain's retiring
Liberal Party leader, Emma Bonino, an Italian who heads the
European Commission for Humanitarian Affairs, and Jan Pronk, the
Dutch housing and environmental minister.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Several foreign ministers and senior diplomats at the four-hour,
closed-door conference praised the U.N. effort on the ground,
especially the performance of Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N.
undersecretary-general whom Annan assigned as temporary chief
representative until the post is filled.
</P>
<P>
   While some diplomats had urged Annan to give the diplomatically
sensitive post to de Mello, a Brazilian, the Europeans, who are
financing most of the Balkans reconstruction, insist that a
European get the job.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the meeting, Annan said the ministers
had disagreed over what constituted ``humanitarian'' assistance and
whether Serbia should receive it.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that Japan, Britain, the
Netherlands and other Europeans wanted to insure that Belgrade got
no reconstruction or other assistance as long as its leader is
Milosevic, who has been indicted on war crimes charges. But Russia
and China pushed for a broad definition, insisting that because
Kosovo is part of Serbia, Serbia should receive aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some ministers sounded more like `friends of Serbia' than
`friends of Kosovo,''' a senior American official complained.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright reiterated Washington's
view that Serbia should receive no help that would ``bolster the
position of the current regime in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   But Annan disagreed, saying that unless Serbia received minimum
assistance _ such as money to rebuild bridges over the Danube, and
electrical and water plants that NATO jets destroyed, neither
Kosovo nor the Balkans would recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pointless to take in loads and loads of medicine if
people are taking in dirty water and then get sick,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright announced today that the United States would send 550
American police and trainers to Kosovo. Germany pledged 200, after
U.N. officials noted that it was one of the few European states not
to have volunteered any.
</P>
<P>
   To guarantee the safety of the police and that of the Kosovars,
Annan said he had decided that the international force should carry
weapons, the first time that a U.N. police force will do so.

FRONTIER AGREES TO TALKS ON BUYOUT OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frontier Corp. said Wednesday that its management and
advisers would begin exploratory discussions with Qwest
Communications International after reviewing the revised $12.7
billion hostile offer made by Qwest last week.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a step forward for Qwest, the fourth largest
long-distance telephone company, which is trying to woo not only
Frontier, but also U S West from the embrace of its rival, Global
Crossing. But Frontier made clear that the discussions with Qwest
were preliminary. Still it could foreshadow what U S West, the
smallest of the Bell telephone companies, is likely to decide when
its board meets this week to discuss whether to entertain
discussions with Qwest too.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier, the fifth largest long-distance carrier, agreed in
March to be acquired by Global Crossing in a stock swap valued at
$11.1 billion. U S West also agreed to merge in May with Global,
which offered $30 billion in stock. Under the terms of their merger
agreements with Global, both U S West and Frontier were barred from
talking to Qwest unless Qwest's bids could reasonably be expected
to be superior to Global's offers. Qwest's first bid June 13 _ a
combination of cash and stock _ did little to inspire U S West and
Frontier, so Qwest revised its bid last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discussion and careful consideration of information not yet
available to Frontier are necessary before the board would be able
to make any final determination,'' Frontier said Wednesday. At the
same time, the company said it was proceeding with its merger with
Global Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, whose executives have remained relatively
silent yet assured in the past few weeks, issued a statement saying
it was confident that ``once the Frontier board completes its
exploratory process, it will reaffirm our existing agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing and Qwest are racing to build a global
fiber-optic network to transmit data via the Internet, and U S West
and Frontier have the cash and customers that each company needs.
Qwest chief executive Joseph Nacchio said he was pleased with
Frontier's decision and eager to begin discussions. He said
Frontier chief executive Joseph Clayton called him early Wednesday
morning after Frontier's board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But as of late Wednesday, neither company had signed the
confidentiality agreement necessary to begin talking. Qwest's
proposed confidentiality agreement with Frontier, said people close
to the talks, has a ``stand still'' provision that says Qwest
cannot initiate a tender offer or submit a revised proposal, even
if Global Crossing raises its bid. Qwest has balked at that
provision, which could stall its plans to begin sharing company
information by today.
</P>
<P>
   If U S West's recent conversations with investors are indicative
of what executives there are thinking, U S West may also be open to
Qwest's overture. Representatives of U S West have been quietly
polling the company's largest investors in the past week regarding
a proposed three-way combination of Qwest, U S West and Frontier,
said an investor.
</P>
<P>
   The investor said the question U S West was wrestling with was
which combination would become the better company in the long-run.
Qwest is further along in its development than Global Crossing,
although several of Global's projects are expected to be completed
within the year. In addition, U S West is mulling over whether the
two kinds of stock proposed in the Global Crossing merger provide
the best alternative for shareholders, said the investor.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the first time U S West and Qwest talked about a
combination. People close to the talks said that U S West chief
executive Solomon Trujillo had had discussions with Nacchio the
weekend before U S West agreed to merge with Global Crossing.
Trujillo, those people said, told Nacchio that he was considering
merging with a company he did not identify and asked if Qwest was
interested in talking. Those people said that Nacchio did not have
enough time to analyze the proposed combination before the Global
announcement.

COMMENTARY: TWO MEN, WALKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two men who admitted corrupting our politics during
the Clinton years have copped their guilty pleas and are cheerfully
walking free _ without having to implicate any higher-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In Webster Hubbell's case, the crony and serial felon the
Clintons appointed to run their Justice Department in 1993
triumphed over the independent counsel because Ken Starr was sure
he could not get a jury to convict Hubbell, and he wants to close
up shop as fast as he can.
</P>
<P>
   So we will never know if the $100,000 that the Riady family paid
Hubbell was, in Thomas Jefferson's phrase, ``hush money'' _ to keep
him from telling prosecutors about the part played by his Rose Law
Firm ``billing partner,'' Hillary Clinton, in his sham deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Starr threw in the towel just as Jane Sherburne,
former deputy White House counsel in charge of delaying
investigations, apparently unburdened herself about her Hubbell
worries to Bob Woodward in his new book, ``Shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton had ... said something to encourage paying
Hubbell,'' writes Woodward, ``he could be personally involved in
some kind of obstruction of justice. . . . Sherburne called (the
president's personal attorney, David) Kendall. Could he ask the
president whether he knew about any payment to Hubbell from Riady's
Lippo Group? Did Clinton instruct anybody to help Hubbell?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kendall said he would ask ... He got back in touch with
Sherburne later. `I've checked it out,' he said convincingly. `It's
not a problem.'''
</P>
<P>
   But then Clinton told a news conference, ``I didn't personally
know anything about it until I read about it in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She called Kendall to remind him,'' writes Woodward, ``... she
had asked Kendall to check it out. Kendall said he recalled.'' She
asks: `` `but how could that be true given the conversation we
had?' Kendall reacted angrily, suggesting that there was some
disconnect ... Sherburne thought that Kendall was one more person
who didn't tell her the full story.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, with no White House tapes and with Hubbell's zipped lip,
Starr was unable to unearth the full story. But what could John
Huang, the Riady employee placed in the Commerce Department and
later as DNC fund-raiser, tell us about the Clinton-Hubbell-Riady
hush-money connection?
</P>
<P>
   That's where the second walk comes in. Despite the strong
protests of FBI Director Louis Freeh and prosecutor Charles La
Bella, Attorney General Janet Reno has kept tight political control
over the carefully botched Chinagate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Reno Justice announced that John Huang, who raised
millions in Asian money for Clinton that had to be returned, will
plead guilty to raising just $7,500 illegally. His recommended
sentence: a year's probation and a small fine.
</P>
<P>
   In return for this slap on the wrist, will he reveal what he
knows about the Hubbell money; or what transpired in the Sept. 13,
1995, Oval Office meeting with Clinton and Riady, or why he got
regular CIA briefings and called former Lippo associates? Don't
hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   Justice's walk-don't-talk prosecutors have interviewed him
extensively, they tell the court, but we will never see those
transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Congress? Up to now, Huang has taken the Fifth to
avoid testifying, but surely now that he has admitted guilt of a
campaign finance crime, he can be called to testify. His sentencing
is scheduled for Aug. 2 in Los Angeles before Federal Judge Richard
Paez; could not his sentence depend on his willingness to tell the
whole truth to Congress?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. Reno, working with Democrats, has a way to prevent
that. Huang insists on immunity from further prosecution, which
Chairman Dan Burton of House government Reform is prepared to give.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice, which has already said there is no espionage
element to Huang's case, now says it prefers he not get immunity to
testify. Excuse: the old, contemptuous ``ongoing investigations''
dodge. And Democrats on the committee can use that to block a grant
to Huang, thereby keeping the lid on him and protecting Clinton and
Al Gore from embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The Riadys' Hubbell and Huang, together again. Both walk;
neither talks; and a five-year cover-up succeeds.  &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ A team of FBI agents sent to Kosovo last week to
investigate possible war crimes has completed its examinations at
two burial sites, concluding that many of the victims died of
gunshot wounds to the head, law enforcement officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings support the accusations of wartime atrocities
alleged in an indictment against the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, by the international war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The team of investigators, who are preparing to return to the
United States, examined two sites in Djakovica in the western part
of Kosovo, including a house that on April 2 was the scene of
executions of women and children, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The team examined remains, in some cases determining the age,
gender and identity of victims. The FBI officials said Wednesday
that the victims ranged from 2 to 86 years old. The evidence will
be turned over to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The agency indicated that some investigators might return if the
tribunal asked the FBI to investigate other sites.

JOAN CHEN TURNS TO LOVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB GRAHAM  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ Just after the first film Joan Chen directed
has opened, the news comes that she has signed up for her second, a
love story starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder.
</P>
<P>
   The budget will be $50 million, exactly 50 times the cost of her
debut feature, ``Xiu Xiu: The Sent-Down Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could make 50 movies with that money,'' she says at a
neighborhood cafe near her home in San Francisco. ``This time, I'm
going to blow it all on one.''
</P>
<P>
   If she is at all pressured by the conflicting demands of cell
phone calls from her agent about the latest project, answering
questions about her troubles with China over the first film and
taking care of her new baby, she doesn't show it. She's
good-humored and focused.
</P>
<P>
   It's not accurate to describe Chen as an
actress-turned-director. The star of Bernardo Bertolucci's ``The
Last Emperor'' and David Lynch's ``Twin Peaks'' intends to keep
acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I keep directing, I will age 10 years sooner,'' says the
38-year-old Chen. But right now, the opportunity is too good to
pass up.
</P>
<P>
   The Gere-Ryder project, called ``Autumn in New York,'' will
start shooting there after Labor Day. The autumnal angle is that
love arrives late for the character Gere plays, a womanizing
restaurateur in his late 40s. Ryder is an art student in her early
20s.
</P>
<P>
   Working conditions on the new movie promise to be somewhat
better than they were for the first. Chen and her crew bent the
rules to film ``Xiu Xiu'' on the border between Sichuan and Tibet,
and the displeased Chinese authorities cracked down on her.
</P>
<P>
   They imposed a sizable fine and banned her from working in
China, where she was born and became a big star while still in her
teens. It is extremely unlikely that ``Xiu Xiu'' will ever be shown
there, although video cassettes will surely circulate on the black
market.
</P>
<P>
   Gere, a famous follower of the Dalai Lama, has had his own
troubles with the Chinese. His 1997 movie ``Red Corner,'' about an
American framed for murder in China, was never allowed to be shown
there, either.
</P>
<P>
   Chen says ``it is pure coincidence'' that she and Gere, who
already had been involved in the ``Autumn'' project for two years,
will now be working together. She does not expect it to interfere
with her efforts to improve her standing with Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is a great job opportunity,'' she says. ``I don't
want to politicize it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Chinese have reduced her fine by 50 percent, to
$50,000 _ ``It's still a big traffic ticket, believe me.'' She
plans to go back for face-to-face talks about the work ban, which
she describes as ``temporary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Xiu Xiu'' (pronounced show-show) is about a 15-year-old
Chinese girl who is ``sent down'' to a province on the Tibet border
during the Cultural Revolution. The girl is supposed to become a
horse herder but is ill-used by a series of men passing through the
isolated camp she shares with a Tibetan herdsman. In its own way,
it is a love story, too.
</P>
<P>
   The film attracted attention on the festival circuit and went on
to win top awards from the Taiwan film industry, including best
picture, director, actor and actress. Some people think the Chinese
government would have been content to ignore ``Xiu Xiu'' but the
Taiwan awards made the film newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The film commemorates the last generation to come of age during
the discredited Cultural Revolution, which limped to an end in
1976. Chen identifies with that generation herself, although she
was never ``sent down.'' At age 15, Chen left high school to appear
in her first movie and became famous when it was released.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Shanghai, where both her parents still work as
physicians, and has been a resident of San Francisco for the past
seven years. She lives in the Cow Hollow district with her husband,
cardiologist Peter Hui, and their 8-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Chen credits the self-discipline she learned from her parents
not only for her ability to steer a movie to completion under
difficult conditions but also for the success of her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents told me that happiness requires discipline. In my
profession, I travel so much, I'm away so much, how to keep my
marriage, how to maintain this thing, this happiness, is through
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was weak or lost discipline, I would have lost my
marriage. I was away for five months for `Xiu Xiu,' and we must
have the discipline to be faithful to each other. Both of us are
still quite young, and I think desirable for other people.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one of Chen's understatements _ her luminous beauty as
the No. 1 wife in ``The Last Emperor'' made her an international
star.
</P>
<P>
   Her San Francisco connections are strong _ her daughter, Angela,
was born here _ and touch on her professional life in unusual ways.
She found Lu Lu, the young star of ``Xiu Xiu,'' in a San Francisco
school that teaches English to immigrants. (``Xiu Xiu'' is in
Chinese with English subtitles.) Just the other day she met Ryder,
star of her next movie, for the first time at the home of Ryder's
parents, who turn out to be neighbors of Chen's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xiu Xiu'' is not a story about the Red Guard, Chen says.
``That has been told many times. What hasn't been told is the story
of the children.'' It is about the loss of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said Lu Lu had ``the physical vulnerability and the
innocence'' for the role but also ``the inner toughness.'' In that
regard, it is impossible to escape the idea that Chen is describing
herself as well.

 &HT;    Decaf tea has some of same benefits as regular
 &HT;    By Karen Collins
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does decaffeinated tea contain the same health-promoting
substances found in regular tea?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Researchers say that although a small amount of the
natural phytochemicals in tea may be lost in the decaffeination
process, content in decaf tea is only slightly lower. Laboratory
research suggests that the phytochemicals, called flavonoids, found
in tea could help prevent stomach cancer (and possibly colon
cancer) by blocking the effects of carcinogens and by working as
antioxidants (like vitamins C and E) to prevent cell damage that
can lead to cancer. Other research suggests these flavonoids may
help fight heart disease by keeping blood cholesterol in a
less-damaging form. Human studies so far, however, are unclear
about just how strong the actual benefits are.
</P>
<P>
   For now, experts emphasize that while tea _ regular or
decaffeinated _ could be a positive addition to a healthy diet, it
cannot compare with the major impact of eating a mostly plant-based
diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there supplements I can take to make me burn more
calories?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Chromium and ginseng are recommended by some salespeople
and magazine articles, but research has shown that they have no
effect on calorie-burning rate. Neither does ephedra (also called
ma huang), despite its stimulant, caffeinelike effect; and ephedra
has been linked with serious health risks.
</P>
<P>
   Metabolic rate seems to be partly inherited, but is decreased by
over-zealous dieting and as a result of some eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your calorie-burning rate at its natural level by staying
physically active (ideally including some form of strength
training) to maintain muscle tissue, and eat a balanced diet that
meets nutritional needs. If you do this, and eat according to
body's hunger signals for how much you need, your weight should
stay at a healthy level regardless of exactly how fast you're
burning calories.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If smoked foods are not recommended, what about liquid smoke
flavorings?
</P>
<P>
   A: Foods that are smoked or grilled over an open flame and smoke
contain substances known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons _ PAH
for short _ that can initiate the development of cancer cells, and
frequent consumption of smoked foods is linked to a possible
increase in risk of stomach cancer and perhaps other cancers.
Liquid smoke flavoring is made from water and smoke concentrate, so
it does contain PAHs, but studies have found that the small amount
each person would use is insignificant. If you miss the smoked
taste in certain foods that you used to prepare with smoked meats,
you can feel comfortable using liquid smoke in soups, sprinkled on
fish, and so on. You might also explore other seasonings to flavor
your food, such as onions, garlic, ginger and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I select a dish based on low-fat foods like pasta, chicken
or vegetables, does the sauce really matter?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely! Hollandaise and bearnaise sauces contain egg
yolks and a quarter- to a half-stick of butter per serving. The fat
in Alfredo sauce comes from cream, butter and Parmesan cheese. You
can get about 30 grams of fat just from these sauces! If you really
crave one of these dishes, enjoy it on occasion. But the fat
content of your meal will be much lower if you stick with sauces
that are tomato-based (such as marinara) or broth-based. White clam
sauce is another good choice; it contains olive oil, but generally
in a modest amount, and it's a healthier fat than butter.
</P>
<P>
   These Ask a Dietitian questions were answered by Karen Collins,
M.S., R.D. of the American Institute for Cancer Research.

 SAN FRANCISCO _ as well.

   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   She and her crew traveled twice to the Tibet border, to catch
the changing seasons. They didn't let the Chinese authorities know
exactly what they were doing, nor did they get script approval.
Some of the footage was smuggled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be hard, but I didn't know enough to
expect that it would be this hard,'' she says now. ``It was
incredible pressure being the producer, the director and the
caretaker.''
</P>
<P>
   The caretaker? ``Yes, I was responsible for everything, from
money and the political situation to providing coffee, cookies and
chocolate bars in my backpack. Lunch came from 2 1/2 hours away,
and by the time it arrived it was cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, lunch was yak. ``Yak meat actually tastes good,'' Chen
says. ``It's actually quite tender. Yaks are so huge, it looks like
the meat would be tough. It's mostly boiled. We brought some spice
with us, mostly soy sauce and sugar. We had to eat it every day, so
we instructed the kitchen to try to make it a little differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of a Tibetan herdsman, who falls in love with Xiu Xiu
but for reasons the film explains cannot act on it, was played by a
Tibetan classical actor with the one-word name Lopsang. Chen
describes Lopsang as a man ``who is one with nature _ he has inside
him a Buddha.''
</P>
<P>
   He not only provided a line for the film _ ``Everywhere is the
same'' _ but when he is not working as an actor he assists a
Tibetan sky burial master. (In the traditional sky burials, corpses
are dismembered and left on mountain peaks for the vultures.)
</P>
<P>
   Chen says Lopsang studied classic theater and became the most
famous Shakespearean actor in China. ``In `Hamlet,' there is this
ghost that comes back, this father figure, and they see death at a
different level, in a spiritual way. He has this simplicity and
honesty that actually is very rare in a civilized society. He
wouldn't even know how to say a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL ADD END) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chen, surprisingly, describes herself as ``not sociable.'' In
San Francisco, she spends as much time as she can taking care of
her baby. ``I like staying at home,'' she says. ``Actually, it's a
very boring and stable life.'' When she goes out, she likes to
visit her neighborhood cafe, where she is discreetly welcomed but
not fussed over, or goes to a bookstore on Clement Street. She also
rides the Muni.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to take the bus because then I can listen to music on
earphones or sometimes read and not have to think about driving or
parking.''
</P>
<P>
   She listens to the Western classical music she grew up with _
Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and Dvorak _ and has a tendency to reread
the books she loves. She has read Nabokov's ``Lolita'' ``probably
seven times'' and Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ``Love in the Time of
Cholera'' five times.
</P>
<P>
   She also likes art books. ``As a director, if I develop in this
area, there are images that inspire me. Edward Hopper. Georgia
O'Keeffe, Andrew Wyeth. That's how I learned America.''

THE BIG CITY: A BOY'S FANTASY TURNED HARDHEADED URBANITES
SOFTHEARTED
</HEADLINE>
  (With HONDURAN-IMMIG)  
(nk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that all of us supposedly savvy New Yorkers have
been conned by a 13-year-old Honduran who speaks no English, what
is there to say to him? Only a simple, heartfelt message:
</P>
<P>
   Bienvenido a Nueva York! Nuestra casa es tu casa!
</P>
<P>
   No one belongs in this city more than Edwin Daniel Sabillon, the
teen-ager who arrived telling of an epic journey from Honduras.
Those details happen not to be true, but his is still a
quintessential New York success story.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin got off the bus Sunday afternoon with $24 and a bag of
cookies. By Tuesday, without benefit of a single phone call from
Howard Rubenstein, his trip was making front-page news:
``Incredible Journey,'' one headline aptly put it. The mayor and
the police commissioner were attending to his needs; literary
agents were wondering if the book and movie rights would command
six or seven figures.
</P>
<P>
   Without a single pitch meeting, Edwin devised an irresistible
plot: Village boy loses family in hurricane, journeys across
continent, wanders big city looking for dad. ``Wizard of Oz'' meets
``Huckleberry Finn'' meets ``Home Alone II.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the story needs a little adjustment, but it still has
commercial potential. It's a variation of ``The Music Man.'' This
time, instead of the slicker going to the provinces to hustle the
bumpkins, the bumpkin comes to the city, but the result is the
same: The slickers are seduced by the bumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   It is a reasonably happy ending, partly because Edwin now stands
to get help for the genuine troubles in his life, partly because
his tale is a useful reminder that New Yorkers can be the world's
biggest saps. While putting on a tough front, we're prone to
falling for a tale like Edwin's because it touches our hidden
fears.
</P>
<P>
   The story of a naif lost thousands of miles from home resonated
with the many people here _ half the population _ who came from
somewhere else. Far from the safety net of families, New Yorkers
competing for scarce jobs and paying exorbitant rents could play
out through Edwin their own worst-case scenarios: One or two
calamities, they imagine, and they too could be wandering the mean
streets, impoverished and homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists have always worked hard to satisfy the appetites of
tender-hearted New Yorkers, but it is not easy to maintain the
production of newsworthy pathos. The facts all too often get in the
way, as I discovered when I was assigned to the homeless beat
nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The beat had plenty of grim stories, but the victims were
generally not the sort of victim that readers identify with: a
sober, industrious person in desperate shape because of bad breaks
and society's indifference. The homeless men I met seemed afflicted
mainly by drugs, alcohol and mental illness. They didn't spend a
lot of time cursing the indifference of society.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, I found a promising candidate named Jimmy, an
affable, articulate young guy living in a shantytown on Donald
Trump's land along the Hudson River in the West 60s. His wooden
shack had a closet neatly arranged with dress shirts, ties and a
half-dozen suits.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy seemed to be over the cocaine problem that had landed him
in the streets. He had a part-time job at a soup kitchen, where he
ladled out food and talked about how much he enjoyed helping his
homeless neighbors still struggling with their demons. He said that
he wanted to find a full-time job and move into an apartment, but
that he was being thwarted by prejudice against the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to work,'' he said, ``but if you don't already have
a home and an address, you can't get past the job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to document this injustice, I accompanied him on a
job-hunting expedition. We started at the state unemployment
office, which sent him to the Swingline factory in Long Island
City. He was promptly hired.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the sad story I'd anticipated, but I kept monitoring
his progress. Three days later he quit the job. ``I don't like the
commute,'' he explained. A week later he disappeared from the
shantytown along with his wardrobe and his neighbors' possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors in the shantytown were furious at the theft, but
they did not share my astonishment at his duplicity. Nor were they
surprised that a member of the press had fallen for a line. They
seemed to realize one of the secrets of media relations in New
York: To make it here, sometimes all you have to do is make it up.

 &HT;    Today is V-Day as TV sets get censoring chips
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As of today, federal law requires that half of all
televisions larger than 13 inches have the V-chip, an electronic
tool to censor violent programming, offensive language and sexual
situations. The other half must be equipped by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some tips from the V-chip Education Project,
co-sponsored by the Center for Media Education and the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation. For more information:
www.vchipeducation.org or at (877) 282-4478.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the V-chip work with the TV ratings?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ratings that flash on screen at the beginning of a show _
V (violence), S (sex), L (crude language), SD (suggestive dialogue)
or FV (``fantasy'' violence) _ contain an electronic signal that
registers how the program has been rated. V-chips receive and
understand the electronic rating signals.
</P>
<P>
   By following the screen directions, parents can ensure that
programming rated is included in their V-chip programming
``strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to block all shows that contain violence?
</P>
<P>
   A: No matter how you program your V-chip, some shows with
violence, including those shown on BET and NBC, and even some
children's shows, will not be filtered out by simply selecting
``V'' or ``FV.'' News and sports are exempt. The best way to block
most violence is to use the age-based ratings to determine what
programs are not appropriate for your children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it activated when I turn on my TV?
</P>
<P>
   A: The chip won't operate unless you select the option to
activate it. Then, a display of the ratings menu will appear,
allowing you to pick those you wish to block.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do I prevent my children from undoing the V-chip?
</P>
<P>
   A: You must have a personal ID number, just as you would with an
automatic banking card. This will be your password to change
settings and activate the V-chip.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do I have to buy a new TV to get a V-chip?
</P>
<P>
   A: A V-chip set-top box can be attached to your old TV set.
Check to see which stores carry them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I override the V-chip settings if I want to watch a
program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Turn it off by entering your code number and following the
directions for your TV set. Reactivate it the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will V-chip-equipped sets cost more?
</P>
<P>
   A: Manufacturers say the technology will add little, if
anything, to price.

   FED RAISES INTEREST RATES BUT IS NEUTRAL ON THE FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, led by Alan Greenspan, nudged its benchmark
interest rate up by a quarter-point but said there was no clear
case for another rate increase to keep inflation at bay, catching
many economists and investors off guard. The shift to a neutral
stance from a stance toward higher rates was taken as a green light
by investors on Wall Street, who rapidly bid up stock and bond
prices. The Dow Jones industrial average surged 210 points in the
13 minutes after the central bank's announcement and finished up
155.45 points, while the Nasdaq composite index and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index reached new highs.
</P>
<P>
   COKE ESTIMATES A DROP IN SALES
</P>
<P>
   Citing the recall of its soft drinks in Europe _ the biggest in
company history _ Coca-Cola estimated that its beverage sales fell
1 percent to 2 percent in the second quarter. Sales in the
company's European division are expected to fall 6 percent to 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   FRONTIER PLANS TALKS WITH QWEST
</P>
<P>
   Frontier said that its management and advisers would begin
exploratory discussions with Qwest Communications International
after reviewing Qwest's revised $12.7 billion hostile offer. The
move is a step forward for Qwest, which is in a rivalry with Global
Crossing for both Frontier and U S West.
</P>
<P>
   STOCK AND BOND UNDERWRITING SLOWS
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's core business _ the underwriting of stocks and
bonds _ slowed slightly in the second quarter as market interest
rates rose. Securities firms and banks issued $553.1 billion of
bonds and stocks, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data, a
drop of nearly 11 percent from $620 billion in the second quarter
of 1998. It was also down 9 percent from the first quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the spring quarter was another banner period for
stocks, as the main gauges all climbed between 5 percent and 12
percent, shattering records along the way. But the gains masked
unusual market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   BOEING AND AIRBUS IN SQUABBLE
</P>
<P>
   A surprise deal by Boeing to buy 17 of Airbus's jets from
Singapore Airlines in order to sell 10 new Boeing 777's to the
carrier has raised fears on Wall Street about a return to the
fierce price cutting that took place in the mid-1990's and
ultimately proved ruinous to the earnings of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   MERRILL IN $15 MILLION SETTLEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch announced it was settling Federal charges for $15
million. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused the firm
of helping finance and profiting from 1995 copper trades intended
to inflate copper prices artificially.
</P>
<P>
   EX-PRIME MINISTER HEADS MONOPOLY
</P>
<P>
   Cementing the relationship between the Kremlin and big business,
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former Prime Minister, was installed as
chairman of Russia's biggest company, the natural gas monoply
Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL DEAL ON INTERNET SEEN
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon and WebMD, which are combining in an attempt to
dominate the use of the Internet by the health care industry, are
reported to be buying Greenberg News Networks, a privately held
medical news service, for $250 million in stock. The
Healtheon-WebMD stock deal was valued at $3.9 billion when the
companies agreed to it in May.

   EUROPE CUTS DUTY-FREE SHOPPING

SAFETY FIRST: BULLS TAKE DUKE'S BRAND AT NO. 1

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They passed on the risk and potential of Lamar
Odom, the explosiveness of Steve Francis and an open invitation to
Wally Szczerbiak's world. In the end, the Chicago Bulls went
straight to the low post to rebuild their franchise, taking the
burly Duke forward Elton Brand on Wednesday night with the No. 1
pick of the National Basketball Association draft.
</P>
<P>
   After days of speculation over who would be taken first, or
whether he would trade the pick, Bulls General Manager Jerry Krause
went the safest route possible in selecting the 6-foot-8 inch,
275-pound Brand, the college player of the year, before a nearly
sold-out gathering at the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the heritage and the championships, there is a lot of
pressure,'' Brand, who left Duke after his sophomore season, said
of playing for the Bulls. ``I'm looking forward to meeting that
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great anticipation. I didn't know who would go 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver picked Francis, the skywalking Maryland junior, with
the second choice, and Charlotte nabbed UCLA point guard Baron
Davis with the third pick. Odom, the draft's biggest enigma from
Rhode Island _ who wavered until the last minute about whether he
even wanted to enter the draft _ was taken fourth by the Los
Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Bulls drafted Michael Jordan, they weren't the best
team in the NBA,'' Odom said when asked about the Clippers'
tradition of losing. ``They have a new great arena, I'll be living
in L.A. If you ask for more than that, you're greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of the evening involved the Toronto Raptors passing
on Szcerzbiak, the Miami of Ohio all-American, and plucking
Jonathan Bender out of Picayune (Miss.) High School. Their plan was
to then trade Bender to the Indiana Pacers for Antonio Davis. The
Pacers, forgoing experience and maturity for the promise of youth,
were apparently ready to gamble on the 6-foot-10, 205-pound
18-year-old, who broke Michael Jordan's scoring record in the
McDonald's High School All-American Game.
</P>
<P>
   Szcerzbiak, the first senior taken, was drafted sixth by the
Minnesota Timberwolves. The host Wizards had the seventh pick, and
their selection of Connecticut swingman Richard Hamilton nearly
brought the house down with applause. Hamilton increased his stock
dramatically with a superb run through the NCAA tournament,
culminating in UConn's first national title. The only decibel level
close was when Francis raised his arms as he walked up to the
podium to shake the hand of Commissioner David Stern; in one,
scintillating year at Maryland, he became a D.C.-area fan favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Cavaliers took Utah's Andre Miller with the eighth
pick. Miller, the senior all-American, was part of a very strong
point guard contingent that included Davis, Duke's William Avery
and Arizona's Jason Terry.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Suns took the University of Nevada-Las Vegas forward
Shawn Marion with the ninth pick and the Atlanta Hawks, one day
after moving Mookie Blaylock to Golden State for Bimbo Coles, Duane
Ferrell and their No. 21 pick, took Terry with the 10th pick.

UNIFIED EUROPE ENDS MOST DUTY-FREE SHOPPING

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE FERRYBOAT DOVER, in the English Channel _ Wednesday
was the last day of duty-free shopping bounty that Europeans have
savored for five decades, and Stella Horton knew it.
</P>
<P>
   With determination and vigor, Mrs. Horton, long a buyer of
duty-free goods on the ferries that ply the Channel, set about
snapping up what she assumed would be the final bargains in the
closing hours before these sales within the 15-nation European
Union end at midnight Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Into her shopping basket went cigarettes at $2.50 a pack instead
of $6.50 in Britain and scotch at $20 instead of $30 a bottle.
Total outlay: $160. Total saving over British retail prices: $180.
</P>
<P>
   So slick was the duty-free shopping that she and her companion,
Dennis Pointer, both retirees from Ramsgate, England, didn't even
have to disembark when this car ferry _ a floating temple to
discount sales of everything from single malts to CDs _ berthed
briefly at Calais, France, then turned back for the 22-mile run to
Dover, England.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mrs. Horton and Pointer were shopping, duty-free
operators like the P&AMP;O Stena Line, which runs this ship, and
airport authorities across Europe were scrambling _ worried about
what the end of duty-free shopping in and offshore European Union
nations would mean for their own prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's decision to end such shopping was made
eight years ago on the basis that duty-free sales skew Europe's
vaunted single market. The International Duty-Free Confederation, a
trade group made up mainly of airports and ferry companies, fought
unsuccessfully to preserve the system, arguing that more than
140,000 jobs in the $6.5 billion annual business would be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Many have sought to devise alternate ways of selling such goods.
Some are absorbing part of the costs themselves to keep discounted
prices in their stores. German ferry operators are contemplating
switching the destination of their ``butter cruises'' to
neighboring Poland, outside European Union limits, just as Finnish
ferry operators now say they will run duty-free shopping trips to
Estonia, also outside the union.
</P>
<P>
   Some British airport stores will continue to offer duty-free
goods to travelers leaving the European Union for countries like
the United States, Switzerland or Russia, while subsidizing
discounted liquor and other goods, though not cigarettes, to
travelers within the 15 countries _ all at the same airport stores.
</P>
<P>
   French and German airport operators forecast higher prices for
liquor and tobacco for travelers within the European Union, but
according to Wolfgang Schwalm, a spokesman for Frankfurt Main
International Airport, retailers will ``reduce profit margins to
maintain the current price level'' on such luxury goods as perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most curiously, ferries like this one will, as of
Friday, offer goods at French hypermarket prices _ two-thirds that
of many British shop prices because of lower excise taxes in France
_ but only when the vessel is halfway across the Channel and out of
British territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   For Europe's supposed single market, that means Britons will pay
taxes to the French authorities for goods they consume back home in
Britain, robbing their own tax collectors of revenue. The price of
some purchases like Scotch whisky will stay the same, while
cigarettes become more expensive, but still less costly than in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a farce,'' said Jim Biggs, 48, from Deal in Kent,
who was planning to shop in a low-priced French hypermarket
Wednesday before returning to England. ``I think a group of men in
gray suits made a decision without understanding the economic
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   But the end of duty-free shopping also means the end of the
limitations that European authorities placed on just how many
duty-free cigarettes and bottles of liquor and perfume travelers
could import _ generally 200 cigarettes, one liter of spirits and
two liters of wine for each person.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they bring in the French taxes, we'll be able to bring in
as much as we like,'' said Melvyn Lethaby, a crane driver from
Dartford who was shopping with his daughter, Michelle May, and who
had just bought 24 cans of Foster's lager for half the British
price. (British customs officials say this is not exactly true:
travelers will be expected to honor an informal _ and nominal _
limit of 10 liters of spirits, 110 liters of beer and 800
cigarettes.)
</P>
<P>
   BAA PLC, the British airport authority that runs Heathrow,
London's principal airport, and six others, says it plans to spend
around $70 million a year on subsidizing the prices paid for some
goods, though not cigarettes or low-cost liquor, for sale to the 20
percent of passengers traveling within the European Union. The hope
is that ``where we are going to lose out by discounting, the
volumes will increase,'' said Abigail Rowland, a BAA spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   And Gail Isted, a spokeswoman for P&AMP;O Stena Line, which is a
unit of Peninsular &AMP; Oriental Steam Navigation Co., said,
``Duty-free was low volumes with high margins,'' acknowledging what
many travelers had suspected for years: that duty-free purchases
were not always the bargains they seemed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the spread of duty- and tax-free sales from
liquor and tobacco to silk scarves and cameras had built a growing
business on the balance sheets of ferry and airport operators and
airlines. P&AMP;0 Stena Line, for instance, says that the $200 million
people spend each year on shopping, food and drinks contributes
one-third of its income.
</P>
<P>
   And BAA has increased landing fees by 5 percent to compensate
for lost income from duty-free sales, deepening the fear that
whatever is ultimately lost from ending the system will be passed
along to fliers in the form of higher fares.
</P>
<P>
   European duty-free shopping for travelers was introduced in
Ireland in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   But with the concept of a European single market taking shape in
the early 1990s, duty-free sales began to seem to some European
officials like an anomaly that gave some businesses an unfair
competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The argument went back and forth. In the end, Denmark persuaded
wavering members of the European Union to stand firm against the
urging of retailers and travelers that tonight's deadline be
extended. The Danes did so at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't buying their Danish bacon no more,'' Pointer said.
``That's for sure.''

AID BILL LISTING YUGOSLAVIA AS TERRORIST STATE PASSES SENATE

   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday night overwhelmingly passed
a $12.7 billion foreign aid bill that designates Yugoslavia a
terrorist state.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also acknowledges American support for one of the
world's most notorious intelligence services, in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 97-2.
</P>
<P>
   The bill eliminates $1.9 billion from President Clinton's
request for foreign operations, cutting money for counterterrorism,
peacekeeping operations, carrying out Mideast peace accords and
stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The White House called it ``grossly inadequate'' and threatened
a veto.
</P>
<P>
   The provision declaring Yugoslavia as a terrorist state would
bar American aid there and let Kosovars sue President Slobodan
Milosevic for damages in American courts. The bill includes $20
million for training and equipping a Kosovo security force that its
authors say could include members of the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The White House opposes giving guns or money to the rebel army,
because NATO is struggling to disarm the force. The administration
also objected to the Senate's designating Yugoslavia as a terrorist
nation, a traditional State Department role.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is chairman of the Foreign
Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, said he
saw no difference between Yugoslavia and nations officially
designated as state sponsors of terrorism like Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly,'' McConnell said, ``I am hard pressed to understand
the difference between thugs' blowing up a village with car bombs
and thugs' shelling and burning a village to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the foreign aid bill seeks to use dollar diplomacy to
compel political change in allies and enemies alike. Congress
cannot make foreign policy, but it uses the power of the purse and
the force of law to shape it.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking passage, another chapter of the bill criticized
``U.S. support for the Peruvian National Intelligence Service,''
known by its Spanish acronym, SIN. The United States has not openly
acknowledged a liaison with SIN.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights
Watch, Jose Miquel Vivanco, called the admission shocking.
</P>
<P>
   The service has a reputation as an instrument of violent
right-wing repression and, despite its ostensible role as a
counternarcotics force, as an institution corrupted by cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really indefensible for us to be supporting a corrupt and
repressive organization like the Peruvian intelligence service,''
said Eliot Abrams, who as assistant secretary of state for Latin
America in the Reagan administration defended American ties to
right-wing forces. ``The Congress ought to cut off this
relationship now, before more damage is done to Peruvian democracy
and to the reputation of the United States. You cannot fight drug
trafficking by supporting a corrupt and repressive organization
that is destroying the bases for a democratic Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also provides $50 million for training foreign troops,
although it warned against abuses by Indonesian forces schooled
under that program.
</P>
<P>
   On a 55-43 vote, the Senate set aside an amendment to lift the
ban on travel to Cuba by Americans. Many Republicans and some
Democrats forcefully opposed the amendment, citing longstanding
loathing for President Fidel Castro of Cuba and his policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give no quarter to the oppressive government,'' said Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A sponsor of the amendment, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the
ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, said the rationale for the
ban was long gone. ``Let's have the courage to admit the Cold War's
over,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   In many aspects, the bill provides less money, with more
restrictions, than the White House wanted. For example, it
threatens to cut economic aid to Moscow if Russian troops interfere
with NATO's operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The measure allots $1.92 billion in military aid and $960
million in economic aid to Israel, $1.3 billion in military aid and
$735 million in economic aid to Egypt and $150 million in economic
aid for Jordan. But it eliminated $350 million that the
administration had sought to help put into effect the peace accords
that Israel and the Palestinians signed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation includes $150 million in aid to Kosovo, $85
million for Albania, $60 million for Romania, $55 million for
Macedonia, $45 million for Bulgaria and $35 million for Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   It would spend $220 million on the Peace Corps, $20 million less
than the White House sought, and $175 million for anti-terrorism
programs, a cut of more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   It would provide $610 million for the Red Cross and the United
Nations to help refugees, with $60 million for those settling in
Israel. It listed $10 million for Iraqi opposition groups and $6.5
million to support democracy advocates in Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The House has not acted on its version of the bill.

LAW FIRM IN TOBACCO CASE MAY SEEK ADDITIONAL FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The law firm seeking $460 million in legal fees from
an arbitration panel for its work on the Massachusetts tobacco
settlement said Wednesday it will consider seeking additional fees
from the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly said he would vigorously
oppose any such effort by Brown Rudnick Freed &AMP; Gesmer, which has a
contract with the state to share 25 percent of Massachusetts' $8.3
billion payment from the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the panel decides, it will be a massive amount of
money and at some point, enough is enough,'' Reilly said. His
predecessor, Scott Harshbarger, negotiated the 25
percent &UR;  &LR; contingency-fee contract in 1995 with five law firms to
pursue the case.
</P>
<P>
   A three-member arbitration panel, created out of the national
settlement between the states and the tobacco industry to negotiate
legal fees, was expected to announce its decision soon in the
Massachusetts case. The legal fee, to be paid by the tobacco
industry, is expected to be the largest ever received by
Massachusetts law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Rudnick and the four other firms are asking for about $2
billion from the industry, claiming it is a ``fair and reasonable
fee.'' Under the attorney general's contract, the firms would be
entitled to an additional $2.075 billion, or one-quarter of the
money that Massachusetts is scheduled to collect from the national
settlement well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Sobol, lead attorney for Brown Rudnick in the tobacco
case, said Wednesday that he accepts Reilly's reaction. ``It's
understandable that someone would need to act in a protectionist
way but, on immediate reflection, recognize the huge goal that we
collaboratively achieved,'' Sobol said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will take some time for the new leadership (at the
attorney general's office) to understand the depth'' of the
agreement ``and the true victory that was achieved,'' Sobol said.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger Wednesday said he agreed with Reilly's position to
resist making any payments from the settlement funds to the
lawyers. The arbitration panel, he said, was created to resolve the
issues of fees and take the place of the contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope they would find that kind of resolution
agreeable,'' Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   Sobol and Brown Rudnick Chairman Andre C. Jasse said the value
of the firm's arbitration award will not be known for at least 18
months, or until lawyers for all the states have undergone the
process. Only then, they said, will the firm know how much it will
receive per year under the $500 million annual cap established for
dispersing these legal fees nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Over 25 years or more, Sobol said, the award might be worth only
35 percent of its 1999 face value.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Rudnick, which will receive 23 percent of the award, spent
millions of dollars and invested tens of thousands of work hours in
a case that many legal observers believed was a long shot at best
when undertaken in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said he respects the risks the law firms took and the
work they performed. But he said both state law and the rules of
professional responsibility restrict lawyers to a ``fair and
reasonable fee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am concerned, the arbitration panel will determine
what is fair and reasonable in these circumstances,'' Reilly said.
``And that should be the end of it. There should be no further
claims to any moneys that are due to the state of Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasse said Brown Rudnick's award from the arbitration process
might be subject to legal attack from the industry and other
states, and that ruling out an attempt to collect more money from
Massachusetts is premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have ongoing talks with the attorney general,'' Jasse
said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Sobol argued, the measure of a monetary award is
not in dollars alone. ``If one looks for a quantitative measure,
the first and best measure is the results achieved,'' Sobol said.
</P>
<P>
   And those results, according to Brown Rudnick, include a
settlement that is toppling cigarette billboards, targeting teenage
smoking, establishing national foundations to combat tobacco use,
and funneling billions of dollars to the states to offset the cost
of treating smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds to me like a good victory and the best
quantitative way to measure whether a lawyer has done his job or
not,'' Sobol said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said health care experts have estimated the value of
the settlement to be $65 billion in medical savings and other
costs, and in hundreds of thousands of life years for Massachusetts
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Sobol and Jasse said the firm will establish a committee to
study the merits of charitable requests, many of which have already
been received by Brown Rudnick. ``The firm has a long history of
giving to the community, and we clearly intend to seriously
consider that,'' Sobol said. ``There are a lot of important causes
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration panel, meeting in Denver, was scheduled to
announce its Massachusetts award by 2 a.m. EST Thursday. In
addition to Brown Rudnick, the other law firms hired for the
Massachusetts case are Schneider Reilly Zabin &AMP; Costello and
Thornton Early &AMP; Naumes, both of Boston; Ness Motley Loadholt
Richardson &AMP; Poole, of Charleston, S.C.; and Lieff Cabrasser
Heimann &AMP; Bernstein of San Francisco.

FIRED EMPLOYEE SUES FIDELITY INVESTMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A former midlevel Fidelity Investments executive and
one-time rising star who was fired last year for cheating on his
income taxes is suing the mutual fund behemoth, alleging that he
was unjustly forced out.
</P>
<P>
   The former executive, Robert G. Flater, was a $900,000-a-year
senior manager who was responsible for Fidelity's international
defined-contribution pension services, a unit with operations in
Canada and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Flater, 40, filed suit on Tuesday against the nation's biggest
fund firm in Suffolk County Superior Court. He is seeking
unspecified damages for wrongful discharge, breach of contract,
civil rights violations, emotional distress, violation of privacy,
and defamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we haven't seen the complaint, we don't believe it has
any merit or is legally justified,'' said a Fidelity spokeswoman,
Anne Crowley. She said that Flater's tax problems were not related
to Fidelity's operations.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, Flater was indicted on several misdemeanor and
felony accounts pertaining to his nonpayment of personal taxes and
failure to file tax returns between 1992 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He was arraigned on the charges in May 1998, paid the back taxes
and $50,000 in fines, and was immediately released, according to a
copy of his lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity fired Flater, who had been based in London, one month
later. He has been unemployed ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-evasion charges covered filing periods preceeding
Flater's employment at Fidelity. The Boston resident, who graduated
from Harvard Business School, joined Fidelity in December 1996 from
AT Kearney, where he was a vice president of the consulting firm's
financial institutions group.
</P>
<P>
   Flater's lawsuit said Flater was highly regarded at Fidelity,
where senior executives had considered promoting him to chief
executive of the firm's Japan operations. Flater sat on Fidelity's
European Operating Committee, an important group that takes
strategy and operational decisions. He reported to Robert L.
Reynolds, a top Fidelity executive who oversees Fidelity's $322
billion retirement business, the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more or less, we feel, terminated illegally,'' said one
of his attorneys, Philip A. Tracy Jr., of Boston law firm DiMento &AMP;
Sullivan. Tracy confirmed Flater's tax problems but said Fidelity
had no right to fire him because it was a personal, not corporate,
matter.

 MARKET PLACE: SECURITIES UNDERWRITING DIPPED IN 2nd QUARTER  
 (bl)  
 By SHOLNN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street's core business _ the underwriting of
stocks and bonds _ slowed slightly in the second quarter as market
interest rates rose.
</P>
<P>
   Securities firms and banks issued $553.1 billion of bonds and
stocks, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data, a drop of
nearly 11 percent from $620 billion in the second quarter of 1998.
It was also down 9 percent from the first quarter of this year. The
firms' performances were particularly weak in June, at $157 billion
in new issues, the smallest monthly total so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates knocked a chunk
out of the debt business. Over all, the volume of corporate debt
issued fell 11 percent, to $495.3 billion, in the quarter from a
year earlier. The amount of new high-yield securities, the
low-rated issues sometimes referred to as junk, fell 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of the year, only Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and
Salomon Smith Barney had more than $100 billion in debt
underwriting volume, while four firms did so last year. Morgan
Stanley's debt underwriting fell 28 percent from a year ago, while
that of Goldman, Sachs dropped by about 32 percent in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated decision yesterday by the Federal Reserve
to raise a key short-term interest rate by one-quarter of a
percentage point could have helped clear the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors became cautious as interest rate fears took over the
market, especially by the last month of the second quarter,'' said
Ernesto Cruz, head of equity capital markets at Credit Suisse First
Boston. ``With the completion of the Fed's action we might see some
stability in interest rates and recovery in new issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch continued to lead securities firms in total
underwriting volume. In the second quarter of the year the firm
handled about 14 percent of the stock and bond volume. Salomon
Smith Barney placed second, followed by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
and Goldman, Sachs. Credit Suisse First Boston knocked off Lehman
Brothers to finish in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly rankings of securities firms, known as league
tables, are closely watched within the industry as an indicator of
which banks and brokerage houses are strongest. Goldman, Sachs led
Merrill Lynch by one key measure, underwriting fees, in large part
because of its lucrative business with hot Internet stocks. In the
first half of the year, Goldman, Sachs saw a 22 percent gain in
fees to $900 million. The other top firms reported sharp declines
in fees. Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, which finished second
and third respectively, saw fees drop by more than 25 percent in
the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the coveted role of underwriting initial public offerings of
stock, Goldman dominated in the most recent quarter. It underwrote
$5.6 billion worth of new issues for 35 percent of the total
market. Goldman brought public Etoys and TheStreet.com, among
others. But its biggest issue was the $3.7 billion public offering
of Goldman itself. Without its own issue, Goldman would have edged
out Morgan Stanley, which handled $1.8 billion in initial stock
offerings, by just $200 million in the latest quarter. Morgan
Stanley had about a 12 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman came close to doubling its market share in the much
bigger field of underwriting stock offerings by companies that are
already public. In all, the industry underwrote $56 billion in the
latest quarter, $3 billion less than a year earlier, in what are
called secondary equity offerings. After Goldman came Morgan
Stanley, which took second place away from Merrill Lynch. Salomon
Smith Barney and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette completed the top
five.
</P>
<P>
   Merger and acquisition activity fell by 19 percent, to $552
billion in the second quarter, from $681 billion a year ago, based
on the value of the announced deals. Goldman, Sachs won the race,
but lost market share, barely edging out Merrill Lynch. Goldman
handled $193 billion in U.S. deals, for a 34.9 percent share,
besting Merrill by a 0.1 percent.

 OLD FACES IN THE NEWS: Networks' venerable anchors could be
the  last of their breed  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anchors away?
</P>
<P>
   Not at the top rung of television journalism _ not in this
decade, and not in the last half of the 1980s, either.
</P>
<P>
   A generation has come of age without a change among the major
anchors at ABC, CBS and NBC. And while the newscasts switch times
and titles at CNN, the cable network's main anchor has been in
place for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Only Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley lasted about as long at
the top as Peter Jennings, Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Bernard Shaw.
Chances are, the stability of the current configuration will never
be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the anchor jobs have their rewards, including the
excitement of the news business and the allure of heavy paychecks.
Jennings, Rather and Brokaw are believed to make in the
neighborhood of $7 million a year. Shaw, whose salary may be less
than a million, is the ``poor'' man of the anchor bunch.
</P>
<P>
   But the jobs would also be daunting to ordinary working stiffs.
The work demands are fierce, a free weekend can be a rarity, the
work is sometimes dangerous, ratings are a constant if
unacknowledged worry, anchors' lives are governed by unexpected
events and, to a ridiculous extent, they are expected to be
authorities on practically everything.
</P>
<P>
   The last period of anchor turmoil was from 1980 to 1983. Shaw,
who'd been a reporter at CBS and ABC, joined CNN at its inception
in 1980. Jennings had been the London wheel on ABC's three-man
anchor team, becoming solo anchor after Frank Reynolds died in
1983. Brokaw was teamed with Roger Mudd in 1982 and appointed sole
anchor a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, as usual, was embroiled in the most controversy. He
replaced Cronkite, the most trusted news figure of his era. And
although Cronkite had been contemplating retirement or at least
semi-retirement for years, many people believed that Cronkite was
shoved aside prematurely in 1981 to make room for the brash Rather,
who'd been courted by ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Cronkite's heir apparent had been Mudd; some within CBS
resented Mudd being passed over for Cronkite. One of them was Mudd
himself, who quit and went to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   All that is far behind Rather now. His problems these days are
with the ratings, with the decline of broadcast network news in
general and with the slippage of the networks' evening newscasts in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   The audiences are smaller, the newscasts aren't the priorities
they once were, and much of the emphasis has shifted to the
prime-time newsmagazines as well as to the morning news programs.
</P>
<P>
   And with competition from cable, the advent of digital TV and
prospect of fusing TV and computers, the broadcast networks'
long-range commitment to hard-news coverage is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dinner hour is over,'' Kyle Pope of the Wall Street
Journal wrote in the current issue of Media Studies Journal. He
meant Americans' archaic habit of ingesting their electronic news
at 5:30 or 6 p.m. News, Pope wrote, ``is becoming a niche game'' in
a ``made-to-order TV news landscape'' where set-piece newscasts
aren't a factor.
</P>
<P>
   That seemingly could spell the end of the bigfoot news anchors.
Arguably, Jennings, Rather and Brokaw will be the last of their
breed. Shaw, whose role is more limited, is closer to the future
model.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, these news plow horses are in the same
harnesses they've worn for about two decades each.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll be the first to go? They all seem secure for the moment.
But if you must bet on the first departure, put the money on
Rather. It's easy to figure. He's the oldest, and the ``CBS Evening
News'' occupies third place in the Nielsen ratings. A year or so
ago, CBS nearly let Rather go to CNN, before raising his pay and
re-signing him.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens to Rather, he'll always carry a unique
distinction. He covered the John F. Kennedy assassination, the
Vietnam War, Watergate and dozens of major stories since he became
CBS' chief anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the Greek historian Herodotus and scan the world
pageant to the present. Probably no one, ever, has personally
witnessed more history than Dan Rather. There's a perk to add to
the paycheck.

MARRIOTT PLANS TO BUY WORTHINGTON HOTEL IN FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SANDRA BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, texas _ Marriott International plans to buy The
Worthington hotel, one of Fort Worth's most recognizable pieces of
real estate and a cornerstone of downtown revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Center Hotel Co., an entity of the Bass Cos. of Fort Worth, has
agreed to sell the 504-room, four-star upscale hotel to Marriott,
the hotel told its employees in a letter. The two sides expect to
complete the deal in the next few months, probably by Aug. 25, the
letter says.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kolba, an executive with the Bass Cos., which is controlled
by Fort Worth's billionaire Bass family, declined to offer many
details regarding the sale Wednesday, except to confirm that the
hotel sent letters to employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all I can say is, we are in very, very, very
serious negotiations with Marriott,'' he said. ``These negotiations
have gone on and on. We can see light at the end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolba emphasized that the sale is not final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either party can walk away from a deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives with Washington, D.C.-based Marriott could not be
reached to comment. Marriott officials referred calls to Kolba.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jameson, hotel president and general manager, says in the
letter sent to the hotel's 400 employees that once the deal is
final, employees will have to apply for positions with Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   However, all hourly employee will probably receive jobs when the
employment process is completed, the letter says.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel will schedule an employee meeting, at which Marriott
representatives will talk about the company, employment
opportunities and the transition process, the letter says.
</P>
<P>
   Which one of its nameplates Marriott would attach to the hotel
is unclear. Marriott operates hotels internationally through 13
nameplates, and The Worthington's letter to employees does not
specify which brand Marriott would use.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott operates three high-end hotel nameplates: Marriott
Hotels, Resorts and Suites; Renaissance; and Ritz-Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott Hotels, Marriott International's most visible
nameplate, is the company's line of upscale full-service hotels. It
has 246 upscale hotels in the United States and 85 internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance _ an upscale line of full-service hotels for
business travelers, group meetings, and resort travelers _ has 34
upscale hotels in the United States and 49 internationally.
Renaissance hotels typically offer multiple restaurants, business
centers, swimming pools and health clubs, and conference and
banquet facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ritz-Carlton, Marriott's renowned luxury nameplate, has 20 U.S.
hotels and 15 internationally. Amenities include 24-hour room
service and twice-daily housekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about a Worthington sale had circulated for a few years
but resurfaced in April, when Marriott took over the management of
the historic, renovated Blackstone Hotel in downtown Fort Worth.
The Courtyard by Marriott chain operates the Blackstone.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Region, executive director of the Hotel Association of
Tarrant County, said Wednesday that he is saddened to think about
The Worthington changing hands, referring to the property as one of
the best-operated hotels in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few hotels operate with a quality team as The
Worthington,'' he said. ``It seems like a closing of an era. I'm
sure Marriott will do a fine job; they are one of the better hotel
operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction of The Worthington began in 1978. The property
became an anchor in the Bass family's Sundance Square, the center
of a revitalization of downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel opened in 1981 as the Americana. The name was changed
to The Worthington in 1985, and the hotel became independently
owned and operated by the Basses.
</P>
<P>
   The Worthington would be the first sale of any Bass Family
property in the Sundance Square development, Kolba said.

</P>
<P>
   FAMILY STATUS: Married (wife Jean), two children.
</P>
<P>
   ANCHOR SINCE: 1981.
</P>
<P>
   BIG MOMENTS: Coverage of Hurricane Carla in 1961, for local TV
in Houston, brought him to attention of CBS News; famous news
conference confrontation with President Nixon (Nixon: ``Are you
running for something?'' Rather: ``No, sir, Mr. President, are
you?'') in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   STYLE POINTS: Reportorial intensity, Southern manners,
occasional penchant for bizarre incidents, flair for organizational

roadkill'').
</P>
<P>
   LEISURE TIME: Fly-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   CONTRACT EXPIRES: 2002.
</P>
<P>
   POST-ANCHOR CAREER: Insists that he wants to stay in journalism
as long as he's physically able. Jokes that he might become
Associated Press bureau chief in Alpine, Texas (population 5,637).
Actually, in Ratherese, that's about as likely as a stick with one
end.
</P>
<P>
   LIKELY SUCCESSOR: CBS correspondent John Roberts, not exactly a
household name, is being given some serious resume polishing. The
weekend anchor was sent to Serbia to cover the NATO bombing and has
just been named chief White House correspondent.

   TOM BROKAW, ``NBC Nightly News.''
</P>
<P>
   DATE OF BIRTH: Feb. 6, 1940, Yankton, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY STATUS: Married (wife Meredith is a former Miss South
Dakota), three children.
</P>
<P>
   ANCHOR SINCE: 1982 (sole anchor since 1983).
</P>
<P>
   BIG MOMENT: Was on the scene for dramatic coverage in Berlin in
1989, when exuberant Germans began tearing down the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   STYLE POINTS: Easygoing delivery, unflappable demeanor. Huge
capacity for work earlier in career won him half-joking nickname
``Duncan the Wonder Horse.'' Known as adroit NBC infighter. The
best ``pipes'' of all the anchors, though slight speech impediment
led to the josh that ``he doesn't use all 26.''
</P>
<P>
   LEISURE TIME: Fishing in Montana, travel to rugged, exotic
destinations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   CONTRACT EXPIRES: 2002.
</P>
<P>
   POST-ANCHOR CAREER: Would be ideal host for National Geographic
programs or cable travel and adventure series.
</P>
<P>
   LIKELY SUCCESSOR: Brian Williams, neat as a pin and anchoring at
MSNBC, is the most thoroughly groomed man-in-waiting since Prince
Charles.

   PETER JENNINGS, ``ABC World News Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   DATE OF BIRTH: July 29, 1938, Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY STATUS: Married (Kayce Freed, a ``20/20'' producer, is
his third wife), two children from previous marriage.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   BIG MOMENT: Was in Cairo when Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was
assassinated in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   STYLE POINTS: Canada dry. A high school dropout who was derided
as a slick ``pretty boy'' during his first, disastrous anchor
stint, Jennings earned respect as ABC's Beirut bureau chief for six
years; has reputation as biggest internationalist among the news
anchors, and for understanding Arab points of view.
</P>
<P>
   LEISURE TIME: Boating, listening to jazz.
</P>
<P>
   CONTRACT EXPIRES: 2002.
</P>
<P>
   POST-ANCHOR CAREER: Could turn to writing after the success of
``The Century,'' which was authored by Jennings and (mostly) Todd
Brewster.
</P>
<P>
   LIKELY SUCCESSOR: Hard to say. ABC splurged on talent for two
decades before cutting back recently, yet has no obvious
anchor-in-waiting. Diane Sawyer, a dutiful soldier these days on
``Good Morning America,'' would have to be considered.
</P>

   BERNARD SHAW, CNN.
</P>
<P>
   DATE OF BIRTH: May 22, 1940, Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY STATUS: Married (wife Linda), two children.
</P>
<P>
   ANCHOR SINCE: 1980.
</P>
<P>
   BIG MOMENTS: Covered early hours of Operation Desert Storm from
high-rise hotel in Baghdad, Iraq, with John Holliman and Peter
Arnett in 1991; shocked everyone in second presidential debate of
1988 by asking Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis if the rape and
murder of his wife, Kitty, would turn him in favor of capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   STYLE POINTS: Bluntness _ admitted after his Baghdad coup that
his wife had been in anguish because he was in harm's way and
added, ``No story is worth the loss of a human life. We were
pushing the margin in Baghdad. ... I have decided that I will never
put her and our children through that kind of stress again.
Never.''
</P>
<P>
   LEISURE TIME: Gardening, reading, listening to jazz.
</P>
<P>
   CONTRACT EXPIRES: CNN refuses to say.
</P>
<P>
   POST-ANCHOR CAREER: Could vanish from public view, except to
pick up honorary doctorates, and devote himself to private life
with his family.
</P>
<P>
   LIKELY SUCCESSOR: Judy Woodruff if it's any time soon; she's
already sharing anchor duties with him. It's a crapshoot past that,
though Willow Bay is regarded as a rising star at CNN.

STOCKS RALLY OVER FED'S MODEST RATE HIKE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve nudged up a key interest rate
for the first time in more than two years Wednesday but still
managed to tickle investors by dropping its stated ``bias'' toward
higher rates down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the celebratory mood on Wall Street, economists warned
the Fed action still leaves open the possibility for a further rate
increase later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   As widely expected, Fed policy-makers voted to raise the federal
funds rate _ that's the interest rate banks charge one another for
overnight loans _ by a modest quarter of a percentage point to 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, however, left the less-used discount rate unchanged at
4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a curve ball that's been coming at us for the last
two months,'' said Bob Dickey, managing director for technical
analysis for Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis. ``Everybody saw it
coming. It was not a surprise. In fact, it was a relief that we
finally got it out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Close on the heals of the Fed, numerous commercial banks _ led
by Bank of America _ announced plans to raise their prime lending
rates a quarter of a point to 8 percent. The prime is a bank's
benchmark rate often used to determine everything from car loans to
credit card rates.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the Fed lowered interest rates three times for a
total of three quarters of a percentage point because of concerns
about the effects of the world economic crisis on financial markets
here at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, much of the financial strain has eased, foreign
economies have firmed, and economic activity in the United States
has moved forward at a brisk pace,'' Fed officials said in a
prepared statement. ``Accordingly, the full degree of adjustment is
judged no longer necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had all but telegraphed the central
bank's intent to raise rates during testimony on Capitol Hill two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little children in Guatemala could have told you that,'' noted
Larry Wachtel, market analyst for Prudential Securities in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors were fearful the Fed would try to raise rates a
half a percentage point, although such moves are not consistent
with Greenspan's style.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors were pleasantly surprised, however, by the Fed's
announcement that it was assuming a ``neutral'' stance on monetary
policy, assuming no bias toward higher or lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of
conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the (Federal Open
Market Committee) has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no
predilection about near-term policy action,'' Fed officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors took that statement to mean the Fed was not _ as
feared _ starting what would be a series of incremental rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had dropped about 50
points prior to the announcement, rebounded more than 200 points to
close at 10,970.80, up 155.45 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite, dominated by technology stocks, rose 44.11
to hit an all-time high of 2868.12, while the Standard &AMP; Poors 500
rose 21.29 points to close at a record 1,372.74.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market, meanwhile, rallied in response to the Fed
action.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 9/32
points, or $12.81 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.96 percent from 6.06 percent
late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But investors may be reading more into the Fed's statement than
policy makers actually intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no clue, no trend, no reason to give us any kind of
direction,'' Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, back in 1994, the Fed raised interest rates six times
and assumed a neutral stance after every move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't necessarily mean that they're done,'' said Bryan
Jordan, economics analyst for Banc One Investment Advisors in
Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fed policy makers are conceding they are confused by
the current state of the economy, with its strong growth, extremely
low unemployment rate and barely perceptible inflation rate,
economists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we get a number that looks a little scary we get
another number that seems to balance things off,'' Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Fed officials will be watching the latest
unemployment data. If that information shows the labor market is
continuing to tighten, that could indicate pressure on employers to
raise wages, which could then spark more inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Fed decision makers also will be watching oil prices over the
next several weeks, since spikes in energy prices can affect costs
in numerous industries.
</P>
<P>
   Crude prices Wednesday jumped 85 cents a barrel to hit $19.29 a
barrel, their highest level since November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials opted to raise rates despite pleas from all parts
of the political spectrum. The National Association of
Manufacturers insisted a rate hike ``is simply not warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes argued the Fed
``has no business hurting the economy in the name of a theory _ the
so-called Phillips curve, which posits there is a correlation
between prosperity and rising inflation _ that history has proven
to be utterly bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney warned: ``Working families will
pay the price of a mistaken tightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, the outgoing Treasury secretary, and Janet Yellen,
the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, said in a joint
statement: ``We believe that the economy will continue on a sound
path.''

 PRIVATELY HELD FORBES CONSIDERS IPO  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The Internet has a way of making old established businesses do
funny things.
<P>
   Take Forbes, for instance. Not only has the venerable New York
business magazine taken the unusual step of letting publisher Rich
Karlgaard keep his home base in Burlingame, but now the privately
held company is seriously considering an initial public offering
for its online units.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the markets are still strong, ``we look to do an IPO
this fall,'' Karlgaard said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has retained the investment bank Goldman, Sachs to
handle the offering, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is run by four brothers, the sons of legendary editor
Malcolm Forbes and the grandsons of B.C. Forbes, who founded the
magazine in 1917. (One brother, Steve Forbes, is running for the
Republican presidential nomination, but Karlgaard couldn't talk
about that.) ``It's like a big family farm,'' Karlgaard said. ``The
idea of not being a private company is so alien to the brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   But after watching newcomers like TheStreet.com and CBS
MarketWatch.com score millions of dollars in the stock market,
Forbes is ready to loosen its resistance to public ownership, if
only for the Internet division.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes.com is bulking up to an editorial staff of 40. It's
headquartered in New York, and it has a new executive editor, Kevin
McKean, who built Money magazine's Web site, and a new West Coast
bureau chief, former San Francisco Chronicle reporter David
Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   It's also launched an edgy new ad campaign that features young
slacker-types with slogans such as ``No salary earning, old
underpants wearing, billionaire on paper CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   An IPO would not only provide cash for further online expansion
and promotion, Karlgaard said, but ``it's critical to attract
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to Net stock status is accompanied by a general
improvement in the magazine's technology coverage, led both by
Forbes' new editor, William Baldwin, and by new Silicon Valley
bureau chief Elizabeth Corcoran, late of the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Although the magazine owes much of its style and success to
former editor Jim Michaels, who retired last year after 37 years at
the helm, Karlgaard said Michaels' emphasis on value investing and
his contrarian views led Forbes to fall behind in its technology
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had probably a too-negative tone about technology companies
in the '90s,'' said Karlgaard. ``It was the only thing Jim ever
called wrong in a glorious 40-year career.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlgaard, 44, who today marks his first anniversary as Forbes'
publisher, brought impressive tech credentials to the job. He had
co-founded Upside magazine in 1989, and went on to launch the
bimonthly tech supplement Forbes ASAP in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He said Forbes still will bring a contrarian tone to its Silicon
Valley coverage, and he derided competitors _ particularly Fortune
_ as ``cheerleaders.''
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, if you can't persuade the market that Internet stocks
are overvalued, you might as well create your own.
</P>
<P>
   SALON STRIKES BACK: After his company's initial public offering
last week, Salon.com President and CEO Michael O'Donnell took some
time off at Lake Tahoe. But he found the mosquitoes irritating: ``I
think I have that kind of skin that they love to go after.''
</P>
<P>
   The tiny stings come after several months in which media
mosquitoes have also been nipping at Salon.com. Its IPO may have
been trashed more than any other since Wired's was hounded from
ever reaching the market.
</P>
<P>
   Critics ripped Salon's business model as basically selling ads
for online literature _ a model, they said, that doesn't take
advantage of the medium, and is basically the same basis for such
money-losing journals of opinion as the National Review.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the IPO priced at a mere $10.50 and the stock
continued to fizzle, critics gloated that they were right.
(Yesterday it closed at $9.50, up 38 cents.)
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, freed from the shackles of the pre-IPO quiet period,
pointed out that the offering raised $26 million for the company,
on the heels of a $14 million private placement, and it did it
while Internet stocks were getting hammered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sector was down 30 percent from the time we filed to the
time we went out,'' he said. Salon now boasts a valuation of $102
million.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MEDIA01 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Salon will now double its sales staff and start updating stories
more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said the company's 1.3 million unique users dwarf the
readership numbers at many elite offline magazines (Harper's, for
instance, has 215,000 readers), and that the magazine gets its
revenues from a variety of sources: online advertising, e-commerce
(it takes a cut when it refers purchasers to other sites, such as
online bookstores), subscriptions (through its subsidiary, The
Well) and through syndication deals with other media, such as
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed at how our media brethren took potshots
at us during the quiet period,'' O'Donnell said. ``A lot of media
were cheering for us to fail. It was disappointing for them ... But
we don't harbor any resentment. We're just going forward and doing
our job.''
</P>
<P>
   PO KNOWS WIRED: In some way, the party Wired magazine threw for
author Po Bronson last week resembled countless other Silicon
Valley launch fetes, even as it spoofed them.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Bronson was launching his book, ``The Nudist on
the Late Shift,'' with a soiree at the appropriately named Buck's
Restaurant in Woodside.
</P>
<P>
   People munched cookies emblazoned with a reproduction of the
Wired cover featuring Bronson and four of his subjects. Stacks of
hardcover books were given away like so much Silicon Valley
software. In his reading, Bronson was continually interrupted on
his cell phone in a staged haggle with a source over a story.
</P>
<P>
   He also produced a 44-pound box of nondisclosure agreements he
had to sign, which every Valley company always tries to foist on
journalists and any other person who represents a threat to the
secrecy of their plans.
</P>
<P>
   He honored none of them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With this book, Bronson, an accomplished novelist (``The First
$20 Million Is Always the Hardest''), has dived back into
nonfiction. ``The true story was always more interesting than the
made-up story,'' said Bronson. ``The little twists and turns that
really happen are such gems.''
</P>
<P>
   YEAH, BABY! It's been a long time coming, but the deal to make
Wired Digital a part of Lycos is all but complete. The Wired
shareholders put aside their bickering ways and voted Tuesday to
accept an estimated $285 million in stock. Look for an official
announcement today.
</P>
<P>
   Wired Digital _ once known as HotWired, and now cleaved from the
pioneering tech magazine _ employs 160 people, including 125 in San
Francisco. Inktomi, which provides the company with some technology
for its HotBot search engine, treated the San Francisco employees
to a free daytime showing of ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' at the new
Metreon cinema on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER CONVERT: Count Marshall Loeb among the latest to leave
the tactile satisfactions of print for the options-rich world of
dot-com journalism. Loeb, most recently the editor of the
prestigious Columbia Journalism Review, and before that the editor
of Fortune and Money magazines, now becomes a daily columnist for
the San Francisco financial news Web site, CBS MarketWatch.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been dying to do a lot of real-time writing,''

   RADIO STARFISH: Philippe Kahn, the founder of such tech
companies as Borland International and Starfish Software and a man
who always seems to have the word ``flamboyant'' attached to his
name, debuted Monday as a radio talk show host on Santa Cruz's KSCO
1080 AM news and talk radio.

   On day one, instead of the info highway, Kahn stirred up
listeners with talk of a real highway, what he called, ``The death
trap _ Highway 17.''

   MEA CULPA: It doesn't get much worse than this. In last week's
column, I wrote about the Online News Association's efforts to
bring credibility to Internet journalism, and then I singled out
the corrections policy at the Industry Standard.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, I made a really dumb mistake. I referred to
Jonathan Weber, the editor in chief of The Standard, as Jonathan
Steinberg. (There really is a Jonathan Steinberg in the online
media world; he's the chief executive of Individual Investor. Why
Steinberg crept into my brain when I should have been typing Weber
is a mystery to me.)
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MEDIA01 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  If anything, I proved what everyone already knows: Newspapers
have been making mistakes since long before online journalism even
existed.
</P>
<P>
   GROK RULES: Since I owe Weber one, I might as well get it over
with. The Standard won six awards from the American Society of
Business Press Editors last week. While most of the booty was for
regional awards, the Standard's punchy e-mail newsletter Media
Grok, which critiques the technology press, won a national prize as
best original news section or newsletter.

RAPTORS-PACERS TRADE SPEAKS VOLUMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Toronto Raptors sent out a strong message Wednesday night
that they are tired of waiting. The Indiana Pacers sent a message
they are ready to start thinking about the future. Each team found
the other had what it wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers started their rebuilding program with the biggest
trade of the night, sending longtime strongman Antonio Davis to the
Raptors for the No. 5 pick. Toronto, selecting for the Pacers, then
took high schooler Jonathan Bender, who has some scouts drawing
comparisons with Kevin Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   It was a telling signal from the Pacers that what they had
wasn't enough in a league that is leaning more and more towards
athleticism. They found that out in their stunning loss to the
Knicks. Antonio Davis, who makes $4.2 million, became expendable
when Dale Davis decided not to exercise an opt-out clause in his
already substantial contract.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was soon joined by Serbian center Aleksandar Radojevic,
taken by Toronto with the 12th pick. The Raptors still don't have
the point guard they want, but still may be able to do something
with their cap space, although Davis eats away at some of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to send a message to our veteran players that we
want to win,'' said Toronto coach Butch Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors still have John Wallace, Charles Oakley and Michael
Stewart as free agents.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting is the Pacers' decision not to stand pat and
see their loss to the Knicks as an aberration. President Donnie
Walsh has long been seeking more athletic players, particularly at
small forward, which is where most NBA scouts feel Bender will
eventually play.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have now used their first round pick on high school
players in each of the last two years, having taken Al Harrington
last season. Bender's stock had risen steadily as draft time
approached and Celtics' scout Leo Papile said that the Lakers were
trying to trade up to No. 2 to get the 6-11 forward from Picayune,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana-Toronto deal was the only one which impacted the top
half of the draft. The Chicago Bulls, keeping everyone guessing to
the end, started things off by taking Duke's Elton Brand. The
ever-secretive GM Jerry Krause said the decision was a tough one,
but added Brand has long arms and big hands, a plus in any system.
</P>
<P>
   Brand was as much of a consensus No. 1 as possible in this
chaotic draft, but said, ``I didn't have the slightest idea'' when
asked if he thought he'd be taken by the Bulls. He will be their
power forward and will be joined along the front lines by St.
John's Ron Artest, who was taken 16th.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest shocker, by far, was Cleveland's selection of Trajan
Langdon at No. 11. The Cavs had taken Andre Miller at No. 8, the
pick they got from Boston in the Vitaly Potapenko-Andrew DeClercq
trade. Langdon was not thought to be a lottery pick - he went ahead
of more heralded Duke teammates William Avery and Corey Maggette -
and wasn't even present at the MCI Center, which is where the top
draftees were assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Cavs general manager Jim Paxson said the decision was made
solely due to Langdon's exquisite shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he was the second best shooter in the draft behind
Wally (Szczerbiak),'' Paxson said. ``He gives us someone who can
stretch defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggette went two spots later, 13th overall, to Seattle, giving
Duke three lottery picks in the same draft. It marks the first time
in the history of the lottery, which was instituted in 1985, that
three players from the same school have been chosen. In addition, a
fourth Dukie, Avery, went 14th to the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   The saga of Lamar Odom, thought by many to be the most talented
player in the draft, ended quickly when he went fourth to the
Clippers. Odom had once been rated No. 1 by many scouts, but then
saw his stock drop in the last two weeks when he missed several
workouts, saw his agent resign, and then toyed breifly with the
possibility of returning to Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   This was a draft heavy in point guards and the top five were all
gone by the 14th pick. Steve Francis went immediately after Brand
to Vancouver and didn't look all that enthralled about it. The
Grizzlies rebuffed countless offers for the pick, and may
eventually deal Francis for the veteran power forward they feel
they need. Antonio Davis would have fit in nicely there.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Davis of UCLA (No. 3 to Charlotte), Miller (No. 8 to
Cleveland), Jason Terry (No. 10 to Atlanta) and Avery (14th to the
Wolves) were swooped up quickly. Radojevic was the first center
followed by another foreigner, Frederic Weis of France, who went to
the Knicks at No. 15.

 &HT;    Rocker gets lesson in art of deception
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ On the plane ride here four days ago, Greg Maddux
found himself counseling John Rocker on the art of deception.
Rocker may have learned how to throw a slider for strikes but, as
he was harshly reminded recently, that is hardly half the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg was saying that when I come in when the game isn't on the
line, like with a five- or six-run lead, I should make a conscious
effort to pitch away from your pattern,'' Rocker said. ``Maybe go
out there and see if you can throw a full inning with no breaking
balls, so the hitters can't (A) get a look at the breaking ball,
and (B) catch what counts I throw it on.''
</P>
<P>
   That was something for Atlanta's closer to chew on the day after
his worst outing in the majors, serving the Expos a five-run ninth
inning, highlighted by Vladimir Guerrero's two-out game-winning
three-run homer. Rocker faced the Expos twice last week at home,
giving up a couple of hits, a walk but no runs.
</P>
<P>
   That had to be enough exposure for the Expos to decipher him. He
was victimized in his last visit to Olympic Park too, giving up a
ninth-inning homer to Chris Widger Sept. 9 in a 3-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like whatever I threw,'' he said, ``they were
exactly looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the last questions posed on Rocker's scouting profile was
his ability to bounce back from failure. The depth of Rocker's
postgame anger Tuesday exceeded the major league norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you,'' manager Bobby Cox said, ``I think he
thrives on that, being hard on himself and being pysched up. Some
guys have to do that. He may be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm somewhere in that stage of my career where I'm
still trying to put up good numbers,'' Rocker said. ``Every
appearance to me is an opportunity to get my ERA down or protect it
from going up. Of course I'm a little more focused when it's a one-
or a two-run game.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Smoltz
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the elbow feels ready. No, he doesn't know how to make it
better.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz answered all the usual day-after questions after his
premature departure following just five innings Tuesday. It should
be known that coming out wasn't his idea, even while his elbow
stiffened up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to go another inning,'' Cox said. ``He was saying he
could go another one or two. But I said `No, let's shut it down
right now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, despite the stiffness _ Smoltz was shooting baskets
and passing a football Wednesday without difficulty _ he fully
expects to make his next start in New York Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is just pitch as much as I can and be ready for the
end of the year, don't jeopardize anything down the line,'' Smoltz
said. ``And that's just what Bobby did (Tuesday) night.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday night, the Braves had not lost a game after
leading by at least four runs in the ninth since April 18, 1993....
In the first eight games since Javy Lopez went on the disabled
list, Eddie Perez has caught 97.3 percent of the club's innings (71
of 73).... Since Ozzie Guillen began getting steady work at
shortstop in late May, he has picked up 98 points in his batting
average to .250.... Lopez, on the disabled list since June 21 with
a sprained knee, did not accompany the Braves to Montreal but might
join the team in New York for the weekend.

 &HT;    Pressure is on U.S. team in quarterfinal vs. Germany
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ The U.S. women's soccer team says it loves
nothing better than playing under pressure. The players might have
a chance to find out tonight in the World Cup quarterfinals against
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   They did it in the Atlanta Olympics, ousting Norway in a
dramatic overtime semifinal, then edging China in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   More than 55,000 fans are expected at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium
for the 7 p.m. opener of the quarterfinal doubleheader. A win by
the Americans would put them in the semifinals on July 4 against
either Brazil or Nigeria, who play at 9:30 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening the World Cup before a U.S. women's sporting-event
record of 78,972 in Giants Stadium, the American women have become
one of the biggest sports stories of the summer. They played before
an average crowd of 65,000 in group play, and ticket sales have
been brisk at Stanford Stadium and the Rose Bowl, where they would
continue their quest for the title.
</P>
<P>
   Their 3-0 win over North Korea on Sunday earned a rating of 1.92
on ESPN2, the best for a soccer match on the network that showed
the men's World Cup last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hearing that people who have never watched soccer are
starting to pay attention,'' U.S. defender Joy Fawcett said.
``We've always known what a great sport soccer is, and it's great
that other people are starting to see it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which gave up a last-second goal in a 3-3 draw with
Brazil on Sunday is coming off its best game thus far and is
quietly confident about its chances
</P>
<P>
   German defender Steffi Jones, whose father is an American, knows
enough Yank slang to say: ``We ain't gonna hide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are 8-3-1 against Germany, earning a win and a tie
in two friendlies on U.S. soil last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're on the stage,'' American striker Cindy Parlow
said. ``But we don't feel any more pressure than what we put on
ourselves.

 &HT;    Host Paraguay stumbles as Copa nears
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you believe Roberto Acuna's side of the story, he's
had to eat so much fish training for Paraguay's host role in the
Copa America that he's growing gills.
</P>
<P>
   The playmaking midfielder quit the team earlier this week,
citing coach Ever Almeida's fish-only diet. It's the latest bizarre
twist to the prelude of South America's biennial championship,
which began Tuesday under a cloud of prominent player no-shows and
other assorted disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   Before a booing crowd of 40,000 in the capital of Asuncion
Tuesday, Paraguay was held to a 0-0 draw with Bolivia, while Peru
held off Japan, one of two non-continental teams invited, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert, his country's sporting
god, also is on the sidelines, protesting the money the government
is spending to host the 16-nation event.
</P>
<P>
   Acuna said a little more variety in his diet shouldn't be that
hard of a request to accommodate. ``They won't let me eat anything
else, but I can't eat fish all the time, and I certainly can't go
hungry,'' he said in a parting shot.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Brazil is bringing Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos
and a number of other top players, but striker Leonardo quit over
the weekend, apparently unhappy at being passed over for captain.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina will likely be able to contend, despite the omission
of strikers Gabriel Batistuta and Hernan Crespo, who apparently
have not gotten on the good side of coach Marcelo Bielsa.
Midfielder Juan Veron is recovering from a car accident, and
defender Jose Chamot and forward Claudio Lopez are sitting out,
fatigued after the recent end of the Spanish season
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay is hosting the 89-year-old Copa America, which ends on
July 18, for the first time, amid political and financial chaos.
Creaky stadiums got hasty renovations, and Brazilian fans had
enough serious concerns over security that they considered staying
home until government officials pledged more police protection.
</P>
<P>
   In March, vice president Luis Argana was assassinated, and a
former army general helping to organize the tournament was
implicated in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to prompt Chilavert, the star of Paraguay's
second-round performance in the World Cup last year, to announce
his boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Fiorentina signs 2
</P>
<P>
   Two forwards on the outs with their club teams were picked up
last week by Fiorentina, which is seeking a new partnership up
front with Gabriel Batistuta. Italian Enrico Chiesa, released by
Parma after scoring 18 goals, came with a transfer tag of $18.8
million, while Yugoslav international Predrag Mijatovic was seeking
new employment after being relegated to the bench at Real
Madrid.... AS Roma spent roughly $10 million in outbidding Juventus
for Nigerian midfielder Sunday Oliseh of Ajax Amsterdam. Juve did
re-sign striker Alessandro Del Piero, who missed virtually all of
the season with a knee injury, to a four-year contract
extension.... Lazio, freed up with transfer cash after Christian
Vieri moved to Inter Milan, might be on the verge of picking up
Arsenal forward Nicolas Anelka and has added Swedish national team
and ex-Bologna forward Kennet Anderson.... French World Cup
defender Laurent Blanc has transferred to Inter Milan for a
reported $3 million.... Former Italian women's team star Carolina
Morace has been named coach at third division U.S. Viterbese,
becoming the first woman to coach a men's team in Italy's pro
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Valencia win also a loss
</P>
<P>
   After his team topped Atletico Madrid 3-0 Saturday to win the
Spanish Cup, Valencia manager Claudio Ranieri appeared to be
switching sides and moving to the troubled team in the Spanish
capital, which went through four coaches this season.... Mallorca
goalkeeper Carlos Roa, who has hinted at being torn between playing
the game and honoring his Seventh Day Adventist beliefs, has
retired to do full-time church work. Roa, who starred for Argentina
in the World Cup in '98, had attracted interest from several top
European clubs and was voted the top goalkeeper this season in the
Primera Division.
</P>
<P>
   England: Hoddle rebuffs Forest
</P>
<P>
   Former England manager Glenn Hoddle has rejected overtures by
Nottingham Forest to take over the club, which was relegated to the
First Division. Forest striker Pierre van Hooijdonk, who alienated
the team by holding out the first part of the season, has moved
back to Holland, joining Vitesse Arnhem for roughly $5.5
million.... Aston Villa, which lost goalkeeper Mark Bosnich to
Manchester United, has signed David James.
</P>
<P>
   France: Dugarry cited for doping
</P>
<P>
   Olympique Marseille striker Christophe Dugarry became the sixth
French player in the last two years to test positive for anabolic
steroids, when traces of nan-drolene were found in his system.
Dugarry, who could be suspended for six months, denied the report.
``I will do everything to show faults in the inefficiency of the
anti-doping controls,'' he told the French sports daily L'Equipe.

 &HT;    U.S. team's work focuses on early defensive lapses
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Getting to the U.S. defense early _ if not
always often enough _ has been the best way opponents have tested
the Americans in group play. It's a strategy that a more potent
Germany figures to follow tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team has shown few noticeable flaws so far, but some
gaps in its back-four alignment have been a lingering concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we need to be organized, because Germany is very
organized and precise on the attack,'' starting right defender Joy
Fawcett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams have been coming in to play us very fired up, and it's
taken us some time to get settled in.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said he plans no major lineup changes
from the first two matches, even though they revealed those same
vulnerabilities. Nigeria scored a goal in the second minute before
the U.S. team rallied for a 7-1 win. Denmark also made a threat in
the opening moments before falling 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the Germans to come out and expose us early,'' said
DiCicco, who has had the team working on defensive clearances
during training this week. ``We've got to take better care of the
ball earlier in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany also gave up an early goal on Sunday to Brazil before
surging ahead to build the 3-2 lead that it squandered on a
last-play goal that tied the game in stoppage time.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans will be missing one of their key offensive players,
midfielder Martina Voss, who is out with a pulled thigh muscle. But
the attacking tandem of Birgit Prinz and Bettina Wiegmann has been
strong, as has Inka Grings in a supplementary role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team has some weakness,'' German defender Steffi Jones
said. ``We hope we will find the Americans' real quick and make a
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   You want to talk to _ me?
</P>
<P>
   The wide-eyed look on Kate Sobrero's face seems permanently
fixed as the young starting central defender revels in her first
major playing experience with the U.S. squad.
</P>
<P>
   She just completed her college career at Notre Dame and has been
quickly embraced by her better-known teammates. Yet there are still
times she admits to being in awe of her surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being interviewed. Are you kidding?'' asked Sobrero, 23,
who is expected to start tonight after sitting out Sunday's win
over North Korea with a sprained ankle. ``When I got injured, it
was on the front page of USA Today. I mean, that's really hard for
me to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobrero, who has gone through light workouts this week, said she
is ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance boost Parts of the upper deck at Jack Kent Cooke
Stadium have been opened to ticket sales, with an expected crowd of
55,000 on hand for tonight's doubleheader. That number would
substantially boost the slow attendance figures in Washington,
which averaged about 18,000 for two doubleheaders in group play.
Those attendance figures were the lowest of any of the eight
venues.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke Stadium, the three-year-old home of the Redskins, holds
80,000, but its downsized World Cup capacity is listed at roughly
41,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many tickets had been sold as of Tuesday, a number
similar to the figures for the semifinals at Stanford Stadium,
where the U.S. team would play on Sunday. More than 60,000 tickets
have been sold for the July 10 finals in the Rose Bowl, much of it
driven by the possibility of a U.S. appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women have averaged 65,000 in their three group
matches.

FUTURE OF HONDURAN BOY WHO TOLD TALL TALE IS MURKY, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  (See also HONDURAN-IMMIG-COLUMN) 
 (nk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The future of Edwin Daniel Sabillon was as murky as
his tall tale of a 3,200-mile journey Wednesday, as New York City
officials began deliberating whether the 13-year-old boy should be
returned to relatives or allowed to begin a new life here as a
foster child.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators spent the day trying to sort out the boy's
elaborate, but now discredited, account of a solo journey from
Honduras to New York to find his only living relative, his father,
that devolved into a sad story of a Florida runaway apparently
traumatized by his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said the boy's family in Honduras had expressed
interest in taking care of Edwin. One of Edwin's aunts in Hialeah,
Fla., with whom he had been living when he ran away on June 24,
said she was due to have a baby in two weeks and did not believe
she could care for him in her two-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the aunt, Aurora Sabillon, 23, said she hoped the
authorities would be able to find another home for him, perhaps in
New York, perhaps with a family of some means. ``I cannot have
Edwin, because maybe he is going to run away again,'' she said,
``and we don't have enough money to take care of him and the baby
that I am going to have.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said it would be days before there was a decision
on Edwin's future. Until then, he will stay with the
Spanish-speaking foster family he was placed with after he turned
up alone in New York on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran officials also spoke with Edwin on Wednesday as they
began considering their options. Although the boy's grandmother,
Paula Vasquez, has expressed interest in his return, Julio C.
Enamorado, the Honduran vice consul general in New York, said
officials had been unable to contact her in the small town of San
Buenaventura. Enamorado said the Honduran authorities also had not
been able to contact Edwin's mother, who is believed to live in the
northern Honduras town of Choloma.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives have said Edwin's mother gave the boy up when he was 3
months old, although the teen-ager initially told a much different
story to the New York police, describing his mother as dead, a
victim of Hurricane Mitch. When he finally broke down and told
detectives the truth on Tuesday night, one police official said,
the boy acknowledged that his mother was alive and said that he had
seen her several times.
</P>
<P>
   Enamorado said he found Edwin to be in good emotional and
physical health. ``He is very coherent and, of course, very
imaginative,'' he said. ``It is a 360-degree change from what we
heard on Monday, and we are shocked, but we'll support him, of
course. It's our obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives have said that Edwin had a problem accepting the death
of his father, Grevis Sabillon, last October. Even though Edwin
attended Sabillon's funeral in Honduras, his aunt said he would
often fantasize that his father was still alive. But the family
remained mystified about his impulse to go to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Edwin's relatives in Orange County, about 100 miles
north of the city, said Wednesday that they believed that the boy
may have been trying to reach them in Newburgh, where his father
once lived. The family of the boy's cousin, Ramon Sabillon, said
they would be interested in taking Edwin in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough room,'' said Hugo Quinonez, the stepson of
Ramon Sabillon, who boarded the boy's father in the basement of his
four-bedroom home several years ago when Edwin's father was working
in the area. Quinonez said the boy had told relatives at the
funeral of his plans to follow in his father's footsteps. ``He told
my uncle, `I just want to bury my father and then I am going to the
United States to live out his dreams,' '' Quinonez said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials Wednesday arranged a psychological screening for
the boy to determine if he needs counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the city's Administration for Children's Services
said they would ask Florida officials to assess whether any of his
relatives in Hialeah would be a suitable guardian. Edwin has a
second aunt there, but she could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   As a general practice, child welfare officials try to place a
child with a relative. If that is not possible, a child can be
classified as abandoned and then placed into foster care, officials
said. In this case, the process is complicated because Edwin is not
a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said that they had not been brought into
the case yet and that it was premature to offer specific comments.
But as a general policy, Mark Thorn, an Immigration and
Naturalization Service spokesman, said, ``We try to keep children
with their families.''

MISCUES COST YANKEES AS TIGERS ROLL  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul O'Neill unleashed a sturdy throw from right
field to third base, but it bounced off the glove of Scott Brosius
and skipped high in the air. Andy Pettitte was casually backing up
the play and tried to corral the ball, but it trickled past his
fingers and sailed into the box seats. The ball spilled a fan's
beer onto a boy's new Yankees cap, and the soggy kid looked as
gloomy as the Yankees felt. Especially Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish pitching, listless fielding and untimely hitting
plagued Pettitte and the New York Yankees Wednesday in an 8-2 loss
to the Detroit Tigers at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had won seven straight games, but they looked rusty
and played poorly in succumbing for only the fifth time in the last
18 games.
</P>
<P>
   On a lazy, gray afternoon, 39,749 fans journeyed to the Bronx to
watch the first-place team that had been so reliable lately.
Instead, many left after Tony Clark pounded a two-run homer off
Pettitte into the black center-field bleachers in the seventh
inning. The 429-foot homer terminated Pettitte's dreary start and
assured the Yankees of remembering this day for everything that
went awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was ugly,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``I'm glad we haven't
seen many of these. I hope it's a while before we see another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   From Pettitte pitching inconsistently and fielding questionably,
to Chuck Knoblauch making another glaring throwing error, to Bernie
Williams misjudging a fly ball into a rally-starting double, to the
Yankees stranding an astounding 15 runners off Brian Moehler and
four relievers, the game was filled with sequence after forgettable
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we got them all out,'' Joe Girardi said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were so disenchanted with their dismal performance
that many vacated the quiet clubhouse quickly, and some of the
players who remained had little to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous,'' Knoblauch muttered when he saw about 25
reporters near his locker and then refused to comment on his 15th
error, which leads all second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte answered three questions before ending a two-minute
interview, miffed at the fans who booed him after he gave up seven
earned runs in 6 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do whatever they want,'' Pettitte said. ``I'm out
there battling as hard as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Operating without his important cut fastball, Pettitte had to
depend on his sinker and his curveball, and it was a struggle.
Although some of the runs were aided by sloppy defense, including
Pettitte's, walks also contributed in three of the four innings
Detroit scored off the left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers scored a run in the first when Pettitte froze on Dean
Palmer's chopper and had it ricochet off his glove. After the
Yankees overcame Knoblauch being doubled off first on a fly ball
and tied it, Pettitte had a meltdown in the second.
</P>
<P>
   He walked the No. 9 batter, Deivi Cruz, on four pitches, plunked
Juan Encarnacion with a 1-2 cutter and walked rookie Jason Wood to
force in a run and make it 2-1. Bobby Higginson then lined a ball
off Pettitte that Knoblauch neatly grabbed and fired to first for
the out.
</P>
<P>
   But the misfortune returned in the fifth. Encarnacion stroked a
fly ball to center that Williams got a poor jump on, and it fell
for a double. Pettitte then made a shoddy decision by fielding
Wood's bunt and throwing late to third. Both runners were safe and
a walk to Higginson filled the bases. After Palmer's sacrifice fly
made it 3-1, Clark grounded to shortstop for what should have been
an inning-ending double play. It was not.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch received an underhanded toss from Derek Jeter, but he
whipped a sidearm throw across his body that was at least 12 feet
off line. Tino Martinez stretched and dived and still did not touch
the ball so the fourth run crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's erratic throwing is an issue that continues to haunt
the Yankees. ``All I want to do is get this thing fixed,'' Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte walked Higginson in the seventh and Palmer singled to
right. That is when O'Neill's throw hopped around like a popcorn
kernel before knocking over a cup of beer and dousing one of the
caps that was given away to kids Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The wet boy was a fitting metaphor for the Yankees on what Torre
called ``a weird day.''

ANALYSIS: FCC'S GIVE AND TAKE IN PHONE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first blush, the $72 billion deal announced Tuesday with the
Federal Communications Commission seems a high-stakes gamble _ with
SBC Communications Inc. betting as much as $2.3 billion that it can
compete in 30 new markets within 30 months for the right to acquire
Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
   And in truth, SBC is agreeing to steps as radical as any phone
company has ever taken to appease the FCC in return for regulatory
approval for a takeover. In addition to the commitment to expand
into new markets, including New York, it accepted a long list of
highly technical alterations to its network and business structure
that seem sure to increase competition within its territory and
that will require many dollars and many hours of engineering work
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got hit in significant ways,'' said SBC general counsel
James Ellis. ``These are fair, but the list goes on and on and on.
This is going to require one heck of a lot of management time as
well as expense dollars to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the whirlwind context of the modern telecommunications
industry, with tens of billions of dollars on the table, Wall
Street saw the deal as but a small burden for SBC.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many of the conditions did not really appear to be
big concessions on the part of SBC.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in May 1998, on the very day it announced the
Ameritech deal, SBC said it wanted to expand into 30 local phone
markets outside its region _ albeit over a slightly more leisurely
36 months _ under a plan it called the national-local strategy.
While the FCC's penalties for noncompliance are significant, the
company does not face a much greater challenge in avoiding those
penalties than it had already embraced in its business plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing new about the national-local plan except a
guarantee that it will actually be performed.'' said Bob Atkinson,
the lead commission lawyer who negotiated the pact.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to concur with that assessment. SBC's shares
rose $2 each Wednesday, to $69, on the New York Stock Exchange,
while Ameritech's stock rose $3.50, to $73.50. Shares of Bell
Atlantic, which under the deal could be a victim of SBC's
expansion, rose $4.9375, to $65.375, perhaps on investors' hopes
that Bell Atlantic's pending merger deal with GTE Corp. will remain
relatively untrammeled.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was far murkier for consumers, because the extent of
SBC's local service plans are fuzzy at best. While the company
might very well want to compete aggressively with Bell Atlantic in
the New York market for local phone service, for example, this
agreement does not require that. Instead, it creates a basic
framework for SBC to create competition to the other local phone
giants but gives the company a lot of potential latitude to aim at
the most lucrative segments of the market.
</P>
<P>
   As for the FCC, it certainly did not roll over.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the combined SBC-Ameritech, which would
control about a third of the nation's local telephone lines, must
comply with a list of 28 conditions or face cash penalties of as
much as $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the most extensive conditions yet applied to a
communications merger. But at some level the commission had to
compromise. It could have tried to impose more rigorous
pro-competition conditions _ but perhaps at the price of spending
months or years in court defending them. If politics is the art of
the possible, this deal represented the art of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the practical and the doable solution,'' said Scott
Cleland, a communications policy analyst in Washington for the Legg
Mason Precursor Group. ``They would love total regulatory powers,
but under the law they can't do whatever they want, and so they
have to essentially cut deals in order to get most of what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's most aggressive option would have been to
predicate approval of the merger on SBC's meeting the extensive
conditions required for the Bells to sell long-distance service. No
Bell has yet passed the regulatory test involved, which requires a
Bell to convince the commission that it has fully opened its market
to competition.
</P>
<P>
   SBC was dead set against any such conditions and, as befits its
pugnacious nature, it appeared set to fight them.
</P>
<P>
   But SBC did agree to some intermediate steps meant to open its
own market to competition. Perhaps the most interesting was its
agreement to sell high-speed data services only through a separate
subsidiary that will deal with the parent company on an
arm's-length basis identical to how the parent company deals with
independent carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the subsidiary will not have to sell access to its
Internet systems to other companies. (Under the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, the Bells have to make their systems available to
competitors.)
</P>
<P>
   But for consumers the most important part of the deal remains
SBC's commitment to expand outside its region. Though the details
remain vague, within 30 months of the deal's closing, SBC will have
to deploy, or buy the use of, a local phone switch in each of the
30 markets. In addition, it will have to deploy other devices in 10
locations in each of the 30 cities. It will also have to resell
existing local service under an SBC brand to any consumer in those
cities who wants it.
</P>
<P>
   But phone companies are geared toward offering service on their
own systems, and SBC picks the 10 switching centers it wants to
use. In New York, that could mean residential areas of Brooklyn and
Queens, but it could also very well mean Wall Street and midtown
Manhattan, with an eye to big business customers.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday's deal includes no commitments on spending for
marketing or on the development of sales forces.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, MCI Worldcom Inc. offers local phone
service in New York but makes only lackluster efforts to market it
to consumers. It is very hard, if not impossible, to find
billboards, radio or television advertisements or direct mail
campaigns pitching MCI's residential local service. Then again, MCI
has not made a high-profile deal with the federal government to
offer local service. &QL;

GUN FLOW TO CRIMINALS LAID TO TINY FRACTION OF DEALERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ga., N.C., Mass., Calif., W.Va., Ind., Ill., Fla.)  (nk) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A study performed for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms has found a compelling pattern of evidence demonstrating
that guns used to commit crimes move quickly from manufacturers to
juvenile offenders and older criminals through a relative handful
of corrupt dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The finding is particularly significant in light of the bitter
gun-control debate in Congress, suggesting that many of the
proposed solutions _ child safety locks, for instance, or a ban on
the import of high-capacity ammunition clips _ do not address the
most important problem: some dealers' repeated sales to criminals
or to ``straw purchasers'' buying on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The report found, for example, that a mere 389 federally
licensed dealers, of 104,855 such dealers around the country, had
sold half of all guns used in crimes in 1996 and 1997 that could be
traced by law enforcement to their initial sale.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that more than a fifth of all guns recovered in
crimes in those two years had been purchased from a licensed dealer
less than a year earlier, and that almost half had been bought from
dealers within three years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the study concluded that 49.1 percent of guns
involved in crimes that could be traced to the original dealer were
used in those criminal acts within 50 miles of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it had been widely believed that for the most
part, criminals and juvenile offenders stole their guns, and that
with 230 million guns in America, there was little that law
enforcement could do to stanch the flow to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report shows that dealing with illegal gun trafficking is
not hopeless and that there are a limited number of dirty dealers
and detectable patterns of trafficking,'' said David Kennedy, a
senior researcher at the John F. Kennedy School of government at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared for the firearms agency by a researcher at
Northeastern University, places special emphasis on what the agency
terms ``time to crime'': the length of time from the first sale by
a dealer to the point at which a gun is recovered in a crime. A
short time to crime, which the ATF defines as less than three
years, is considered an indicator of possible illegal activity by
dealers or traffickers, and a time of less than a year a very
strong indicator.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the study said, it is highly significant that 49.6
percent of all guns traced by the firearms agency in 1996 and 1997
were used in crimes less than three years from their date of
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   A scant 110 dealers, or 0.1 percent of the total, each sold more
than 50 guns with an average time to crime of less than one year.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Glenn L. Pierce, co-director of the Center for
Criminal Justice Policy Research at Northeastern, provides the most
detailed examination to date of the conclusion that a tiny number
of dealers are responsible for a disproportionate number of guns
used by criminals. That conclusion was suggested in an earlier ATF
report and in a report issued this spring by Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., who has been among the nation's leading advocates of gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Schumer and six co-sponsors introduced in the Senate
a bill that would crack down on any dealer to whom at least 25 guns
used in crimes were traced in any one-year period. The legislation
would allow the firearms agency to conduct an unlimited number of
inspections of such dealers' records _ the current limit is one a
year _ and would make it easier for the agency to suspend their
licenses, a process that is now extremely difficult. In addition,
the bill would prohibit all straw purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the study's most compelling data involved the time to
crime of certain kinds of guns. In California, for example,
inexpensive, rapid-firing Lorcin 9-millimeter pistols recovered in
crimes in 1996-97 were found to have been sold by dealers an
average of only 170 days beforehand. Similarly, Lorcin
9-millimeters had an average time to crime of only 202 days in
Mississippi, 318 days in North Carolina and 331 days in West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``fad'' gun, popular with criminals and juvenile
offenders, is the Hi Point .380. In Georgia, it showed up in crimes
an average of 215 days after being sold by a dealer. The average in
Indiana was 226 days, and in Illinois 309 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This information shows it is just not a tenable argument for
these manufacturers to say they are not aware of what happens to
their guns,'' said Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence
Prevention Research Program at the University of California at
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Firearms manufacturers have repeatedly said they do not know
what happens in the use of their guns, and cannot be held
accountable for it, because they sell only to wholesalers, who in
turn sell to retail dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers also contend that even after a crime is
committed with one of their guns and they are reached by an ATF
official performing a trace through use of the weapon's serial
number, they have no way to know what has happened because the
firearms agency does not tell them of any crime.
</P>
<P>
   A senior agency official said this argument was not credible.
``Every single gun recovered by law enforcement that we trace is a
crime gun,'' the official said. ``The manufacturers do not question
our agents whether these are crime guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The report's finding that 49.1 percent of all crime guns that
can be traced to a dealer were used by the criminal within 50 miles
of the sale comes as a surprise to specialists. Earlier findings
showed that many guns used by criminals in big East Coast cities
with strict gun-control laws, like New York, Washington and Boston,
were originally purchased in Southern states with lax gun laws,
like Florida, Georgia and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that this pattern of long-distance
trafficking indeed exists, saying a quarter of all guns traced as a
result of criminal acts end up more than 500 miles from the
original dealer. But, the report says, there is really a dual
pattern of gun trafficking, with an even greater number of guns
sold to criminals or straw purchasers by local dealers near the
criminals' homes.
</P>
<P>
   The report also provides the first information comparing the
role of pawnbrokers who hold federal firearms licenses with that of
regular dealers. Crime guns were traced to only 13 percent of
regular dealers in 1996-97, the report found, but were traced to 35
percent of pawnbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear is whether the dealers with large numbers of
crime guns traced to them are simply stores with a large volume of
sales, or whether they instead are simply inclined to be involved
in illegal activity. The report also does not distinguish between
sales made by dealers in stores and at gun shows.

LIFE, ANGLING SIMPLE AFFAIRS IN S. DAKOTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, S.D. _ ``There oughta be bass in here, fellers.''
</P>
<P>
   They were designed to be comforting words under less than ideal
conditions, when the fish weren't biting and the sun was warming
the humid air to 90 degrees and the boundary waters of Lewis and
Clark Lake to 70 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Area angler Ron Livingston repeated the phrase several times as
he maneuvered his boat through the cattails along this wide spot in
the Missouri River that separates South Dakota and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The words did provide some solace in the long stretches between
the four bass I hooked on the day using Texas-rigged plastic
salamanders and hand-painted lime-green spinnerbaits that
Livingston sells as a hobby for $1.50 apiece. And they were
prophetic when I landed my first-ever smallmouth bass _ a bronze
2-pound beauty that somersaulted through the air and didn't know
when to stop fighting, even when I lipped it into the boat for
release.
</P>
<P>
   But highs and lows aside, this was more than a fishing trip. It
was a learning experience about one of the nation's largest
waterways and the folks who call its banks home.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston and the Missouri River he fishes almost daily are
gentle giants.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying 300 pounds on a 6-foot-3 frame, with coveralls, a
rolled-up, beat-up, sweated-up work shirt, chapped hide and a red
neck, the 43-year-old bass angler is an imposing sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here they seem to grow big fellows,'' said the third in
our party, Ocean, N.J., attorney Bill Feinberg, after getting a
good look at our navigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and we all got little boats,'' answered Livingston, a
strong-armed road-grader for Bonhomme County.
</P>
<P>
   But his mild demeanor and friendly manner befit the good-natured
country attitude that prevails in the nation's interior.
</P>
<P>
   The river also is large and tame. Dammed for flood control and
hydroelectricity, the mighty Missouri is lined with reservoirs,
including Lewis and Clark Lake, along which is found Livingston's
home town of Springfield here in Southeast South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Its upper stretches hardly resemble a lake or a river, however.
A marshy delta has formed from the deposition of upstream
sediments, causing a hodgepodge of islands, flats and sandbars cut
by channels, shoots and backwater that are continually rearranged
by the Missouri's varying current.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said he zigzags to his fishing holes ``just like a
mouse running through a maze.'' No need to worry about keeping a
secret spot secret; even maps wouldn't help decipher this mess.
First you would have to safely navigate the shallows that often are
strewn with submerged stumps and other deadheads in a foot of
water. Only foolish anglers make this venture without spare
propellers for their outboard engine and trolling motor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really getting to be a problem,'' Livingston said of the
silt that is working its way down the lake. ``It's hell on motors
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Oak-, elm- and ash-lined Lewis and Clark Lake is a creation of
Gavins Point Dam, which was hailed as a ``100-year dam'' when
completed in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they gave much thought about what would happen
after that,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start fiddling around with nature, it's
never-ending,'' Feinberg observed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are several theories and prospects drifting around
South Dakota to extend the life of the reservoir, including routing
sediments around it via pipelines. Yet the wide-ranging
recommendations are expensive and have few time lines. ``It's a
really difficult situation to solve,'' said Herb Bollig, manager of
Gavins Point National Fish Hatchery in nearby Yankton, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Because it has characteristics of a river and a lake, the Lewis
and Clark impoundment attracts a diversity of fish _ from
smallmouth bass, catfish, sturgeon, sauger and the
prehistoric-looking paddlefish that prefer running water to
largemouth bass, walleye, Northern pike and a variety of panfish
that love standing water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real, real diverse type of situation and it has a lot
to do with water yield,'' said Gerald Wickstrom, a fishery
biologist with the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Department in
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a fish aquarium almost, ain't it?'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   To target its bass, one must be prolific at fishing fast water
for smallmouths and slower flows for largemouths. Even then, there
are no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much habitat that it's often tough to find them,''
Wickstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case on this day, when only eight bass were boated
by three fishermen. Other days it can be explosive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these here reeds and stuff hold a lot of bass,''
Springfield's Richard Leasure said as we motored past his boat.
``Usually we get a lot of luck, 40-, 50-, 60-bass days, you
betcha.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It does happen, believe me, boys,'' echoed Livingston, who got
the bug to craft his own tackle while helping his granddad catch
Missouri River catfish for commercial table fare using handmade
willow hoop nets.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter Livingston made 22,000 leadhead walleye jigs and
painted 44,000 eyes in his 12-by-18 garage. Dotted with several
impressive mounts, including an 18\-pound Northern, the building is
detached from the house on a half-block of property he purchased 15
years ago for $3,800. Now the place is worth a whopping $38,000
with the improvements he's made.
</P>
<P>
   He's seen the river change dramatically from the days when his
great-grandfather raised corn where waters now flow. ``The
fishing's better than ever, now,'' Livingston said, offering as
evidence the 7\-pound largemouth he hooked a few weeks back. But
his comment came with more than a little trepidation over the
future of his cherished Lewis and Clark Lake.
</P>
<P>
   So, yeah, I did believe there was better fishing. But on this
fine day in the heartland, there were more important matters _ and
simple manners _ than catching bass.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoors Editor Brett Pauly's column appears Thursdays in the
Daily News.

TRYING TO REGAIN CONTROL OF A GENIE WAY OUT OF THE OWNERS' BOTTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss.) (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Silas was at the office early Wednesday morning preparing
for his first draft as head coach of the Charlotte Hornets. With
his team picking third, Silas was excited to be in position to
snatch one of the great young players in the NBA draft. He got his
wish, selecting Baron Davis, the 6-foot-2{-inch point guard from
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   This is the wave of the future and Silas is glad to be part of
it _ this year. ``If I'm in this position next year,'' he said,
``if we're ever in this position again to pick in the lottery, I
might as well go look for a job.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a lot of hand-wringing over the NBA's young blood
problem. So many young players entering the league after one or two
years of college, some jumping directly to the pros from high
school. Last week, during the championship series, David Stern, the
NBA commissioner, proposed an age minimum, that players under 20
could not enter the NBA. The notion behind the age lockout is that
the players would be forced stay in school and mature.
</P>
<P>
   Silas doesn't like the idea. ``I don't necessarily think that a
blanket age requirement is going to fly, legally, No. 1, and 2, I
don't think it's necessary,'' he said. ``You have to take each
individual case. You have some kids coming in at a very young age
that are very mature and can handle a situation. The flip side is
that you have kids who do stay in school for four years and they
come in and they still are not mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Silas said he wasn't appalled that Jonathan Bender, the
17-year-old senior out of Picayune (Miss.) High School was drafted
No. 5 by the Toronto Raptors. Silas pointed out that those baseball
and hockey players who go from high school to the big leagues avoid
scrutiny and are not the object of ridicule or debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is up in arms when a kid who is talented in
basketball says, `I want to forgo college and I want to start
making a living,''' Silas said. ``Why is it OK in one instance and
it's not OK in the other? I don't understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA owners' real concern is not player maturity. The concern
is the diminishing control over talent as the league gets younger.
Latrell Sprewell is the chairman, and Allen Iverson is the
president of a generation of players who seem unwilling to be
controlled as players once were, by fear and intimidation. Many are
no longer in awe of the prototypical front office hierarchy
authority figure: usually white, male _ though not always _ with
whom they have little in common outside of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a kid today who is much more aware,'' Silas said.
``You can't just tell these kids that `It's going to be my way or
the highway. They still need guidance and discipline but you've got
to explain things to a young guy. They aren't going to just run
through that brick wall, like we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Silas has seen the evolution. He was drafted in 1964 by the St.
Louis Hawks in the second round (12th pick overall) and ended his
career with Seattle in 1980. ``It was a different day and different
time,'' Silas said. ``You're talking about the 60s, when the
revolution was just coming. You thought the people in power were
all-powerful, that you had no say and you were just happy to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Silas said the shift began in 1975, when the owners opened their
wallets and David Thompson signed an enormous contract with Denver.
``From that point on, the big dollars came in and that's when you
saw the change come,'' Silas said. ``Kids were making enormous
amounts of money, the league began marketing them more, they were
seen a lot more on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   In Silas' view, the NBA's problem is not the players but the
coaches and various front office types for whom they work. ``Most
of the powers that be in our league are 1, afraid and 2, they don't
want to rock the boat because they really think they need these
kids to keep their jobs,'' Silas said. ``They do not understand our
players. The players are going to test you and most of the time,
when the test comes, most coaches don't know how to handle it. They
will turn their back, shy away and think that the problem is going
to go away. If you meet these problems head on, the problems get
solved one way or the other. If you don't meet these problems head
on, you're not going to have a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see an influx of head coaches that
know how to handle these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is undergoing a more profound transition than we
realize. The league is becoming younger, faster, more versatile.
There is no need to change rules to increase scoring. Change
attitudes. ``Coaches dictate style of play,'' Silas said. ``They
dictate scores. When you let these kids run up and down the court
and fire away, you're going to have better games, more scoring, and
it's going to be a much more exciting game. That's all that
happened to the Knicks: Jeff let those guys play. Let the talent
flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Young blood is coming. The marketing, the money, the allure, the
exposure has made players eager to get better, imitate, improve,
perform feats of ballet that Michael Jordan never imagined. Imagine
that: Lamar Odom, 19, a 6-10 forward, was drafted by the Los
Angeles Clippers at No. 4
</P>
<P>
   So stop the hand-wringing, commissioner. Stop the talk about
locking out the teenagers. You help set all this in motion; can't
stop it now.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Dr. Dick Barnett used to say: ``Too late: fall back,
baby.'' &QL;

MERRILL LYNCH IS SETTLING COPPER TRADING COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which was accused by federal regulators of
helping finance and profiting from 1995 copper trades intended to
inflate copper prices artificially, announced Wednesday that it was
paying $15 million to settle the complaint without admitting or
denying the charges made by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the announcement, the company said it was also settling, for
an additional 6.5 million pounds ($10.2 million), a similar action
brought by the London Metal Exchange, which had been ground zero
for the manipulative trading in copper futures by Sumitomo Corp.
and its rogue trader, Yasuo Hamanaka.
</P>
<P>
   Hamanaka, once nicknamed `` 5 Percent'' in wry homage to the
amount of the copper market _ both actual supplies and futures
contracts _ he controlled, pleaded guilty to criminal charges in
Japan in 1997. He is serving an eight-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in the enforcement division of the CFTC had charged
that Merrill Lynch, through subsidiaries, provided Sumitomo with
$500 million in financing and credit, even though responsible
personnel knew enough about the activities of Sumitomo and a
start-up copper trading company, Global Minerals &AMP; Metals Corp., to
conclude that the copper trading activity was suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint issued May 20, the CFTC charged that Martyn
Phillips, a Merrill Lynch employee, discussed copper trading
strategies with Global's chief trader, Carl Alm. The focus of the
discussions, the regulators charged, was how to control copper
supplies and drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of an order filed by the commission Wednesday,
executives at Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner &AMP; Smith Ltd., a
London-based subsidiary, and Merrill Lynch International, based in
New York, knew that ``the manipulators owned most LME copper
warrants'' and ``were withholding such copper warrants from the
market'' and that consequently ``the price of copper was higher
than it would have been absent these activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The CFTC complaint also contended that Merrill Lynch was
profiting from the trades and providing trading advice.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Wednesday, Merrill Lynch said it ``entered into
the settlements to bring closure to these regulatory proceedings
and to avoid the expense and distraction of protracted
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The complex arrangement fell apart in June 1996, leading to a
sharp drop in copper prices that ended up costing Sumitomo about
$2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, Sumitomo agreed to pay a $150 million fine to
resolve its complaints, without admitting or denying any of the
allegations. Of that total, $25 million has been set aside to pay
judgments awarded any plaintiffs who successfully sue Sumitomo.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators' complaint against Global Minerals &AMP; Metals; its
principal, R. David Campbell, and Alm is still pending, according
to Phyllis Cela, the acting director of the CFTC's division of
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in May, when the complaint was filed, H. Peter
Haveles Jr., a lawyer for Global Minerals, said the regulators'
complaint was ``based on an `Alice in Wonderland' view of the
facts.''

ADVERTISING: STRONGER GAINS IN AD SPENDING SEEN FOR '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A leading forecaster of advertising spending has
raised his estimate for 1999 after cutting it earlier because of
concerns about the worldwide economic turmoil last fall.
</P>
<P>
   With those qualms virtually vanquished, and amid reports of
robust first-quarter ad spending in myriad media, Robert Coen,
senior vice president and forecasting director at the
McCann-Erickson USA unit of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising,
is raising his predicted gain for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the last time Coen offered predictions, ``we saw
signs the economy was questionable,'' he said Wednesday in a
presentation at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan, ``and we were
cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But 1999 is turning out to be so much stronger than anybody
expected,'' he added. ``We have a lot more stimulus than anyone
thought possible six months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, Coen also increased for a fourth consecutive
time his figures for how much marketers spent to advertise in 1998.
And taking his first look at 2000, Coen was bullish, forecasting
that ad spending would be stimulated significantly by elections,
the Summer Olympics, millennium hoopla and even advisories about
Year 2000 computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ad spending is carefully monitored because it is considered a
reliable way to assess the condition of the overall economy,
particularly the propensity of consumers to spend. Coen's optimism
dovetails with other signs that the economy remains robust, such as
the announcement Wednesday by the Conference Board that its index
of leading economic indicators rose three-tenths of a percent in
May after a small decline in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace looks very strong,'' said Coen, whose
projections are closely watched because he has been tracking
advertising and media trends for five decades for McCann-Erickson
Worldwide Advertising, now part of the McCann-Erickson World Group
unit of  &UR; Interpublic Group  &LR; of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Coen predicted that marketers would spend a record $213.9
billion this year compared with a revised figure of $201.6 billion
for 1998, which represents a 7.5 percent increase from the $187.5
billion spent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   National ad spending in 1999 is now expected to rise 6.4
percent, to $126.6 billion, compared with Coen's December estimate
of 6 percent. And local ad spending is now expected to grow 5.7
percent, to $87.3 billion, up from his previous forecast of 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   If Coen's 1999 forecast is correct, advertising as a percentage
of gross domestic product would reach a record 2.39 percent,
compared with 2.37 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, when Coen made his first estimate for 1999 ad
spending, he projected an increase of 6 percent. That was trimmed
to 5.5 percent in December because of the financial crises in the
Asia-Pacific region and Latin America, coupled with global stock
market swoons. In his presentation, he revised the figure to a gain
of 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While that gain would be the slowest growth since a 5.2 percent
increase in 1993, it would still be notable for a ``hammock'' year
between Olympics and elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraged by the upside revisions,'' said Karen Ficker,
managing director for advertising, publishing and new media at
Furman Selz in New York, which becomes ING Barings on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's talking about stabilization in Asia-Pacific now, if
not improvement,'' said Ms. Ficker, who attended the Coen
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   In revamping his 1999 figures, Coen cited first-quarter media
spending in several important national ad categories, including
airlines, computers, drugs and remedies, movies, resorts and tours,
restaurants and telecommunications. He also pointed to sharp gains
in categories like banks, brokers and mutual funds, cigarettes and
liquor.
</P>
<P>
   All that helped increase ad revenue in the first quarter for
cable television networks by 28 percent, newspapers by 12.6
percent, magazines by 7.7 percent and yellow pages by 7.1 percent.
In the local realm, there were good first-quarter results for
media, including radio, up 15 percent; yellow pages, up 5 percent,
and newspaper retail ads, up 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to ad spending overseas, Coen predicted an improvement,
based on the brightening outlooks for countries like Malaysia, the
Philippines and South Korea and continued growth in countries like
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Spending outside the United States should total $212 billion, he
said, up 4.1 percent from a revised figure of $203.7 billion for
1998. That spending last year was a decline of 3 percent from $210
billion in 1997 and was the second consecutive decline after three
years of gains.
</P>
<P>
   Coen's worldwide total estimate for 1999, then, is $425.9
billion, up 5.1 percent from his final figure for 1998 of $405.3
billion, which would be the largest growth since 1995. The spending
last year represented a gain of 2 percent from $397.5 billion in
1997, the smallest annual increase since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Coen's initial worldwide forecast for 1999, made in June 1998,
was $440.5 billion, which was lowered to $435.9 billion in
December.
</P>
<P>
   And peering forward for the first time at 2000, Coen offered a
``guesstimate'' for snappy growth at home of 7.5 percent, to $230
billion, and respectable growth abroad of 5.7 percent, to $224
billion. The total: $454 billion, up 6.6 percent from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of similarities between 2000 and 1976,'' Coen
said, when ad spending in the United States was fueled by
Bicentennial campaigns as well as Olympic and election ads.
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst who attended Coen's presentation, Michael J.
Russell Jr., said that he agreed with the 7.5 percent increase
predicted domestically for next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Year 2000 factors, said Russell, advertising
analyst in New York for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Company,
Madison Avenue will benefit from such new ``brand pipelines'' as
spending to promote prescription drugs to consumers and Internet
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet IPOs and business plans say `Give me money to
advertise,''' he added. ``There was never a time before when that
happened.'' &QL;

VAUGHN'S ENJOYMENT DAMPENED BY LOSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big Man ambles into the dugout of the Anaheim Angels, and
sits alone on the bench, peering stolidly out at teammates going
through their pregame ritual in preparation for the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   He will be on the field taking batting practice in a few
moments, but he's now taking a reflective pause, a somber-faced man
lost in his own thoughts about an Angel season that has not
unfolded as scripted in the bright optimism of spring.
</P>
<P>
   You approach the Big Man cautiously, figuring he's not in a mood
for mindless chit-chat, figuring that all those millions of dollars
that he's earning from the Angels aren't enough to neutralize the
frustration he must be enduring over his team's floundering ways.
</P>
<P>
   You shake his hand, and wonder if he can spare a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He nods amicably.
</P>
<P>
   You've interviewed enough ball players across the seasons to
know that you don't open such a session with a hardball question in
the tense atmosphere in which Mo Vaughn and the Angels find
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   You know the Big Man is a passionate competitor who's on edge,
and so you begin gently by asking him the differences he's found
between residing in Boston and Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have more of an open mind out here,'' says Mo
Vaughn, who's living in Newport Beach. ``I'm treated more as a
regular person out here. I can go anywhere, and people leave me
alone. In Boston, forget about it! It got so bad there I hated
leaving my house. I often felt like a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is way less stress out here on me. People out here are
accustomed to being around celebrities because there are so many of
them in both athletics and the movie business. People out here
don't give a damn if you wear green or pink hair. I love living out
here. It's just so much easier on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the Big Man was supposed to transform the Angels
into a serious contender in the A.L. West Division and give them
that left-handed power-hitting inspirational team leader that they
had notably lacked in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But a torrent of injuries to vital performers Jim Edmonds, Tim
Salmon, Gary DeSarcina, Ken Hill, Tim Belcher and, yes, Vaughn
himself has resulted in the Angels falling into last place in their
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely been tough ... very tough,'' acknowledges
Vaughn, shaking his head slowly. ``You come here, you expect big
things, and it just hasn't happened. It's disappointing, no doubt
about it. But we just have to keep playing hard, and not give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the injury to myself (a severely sprained left ankle in
the opener against Cleveland) has definitely slowed my production,
and also slowed the things I like to do in the clubhouse. I like to
get into the guys' head, tease them, even taunt them into playing
harder. But how can I do that when I myself was out for a while and
when I myself was struggling?''
</P>
<P>
   It was all supposed to fall apart in Boston when Mo Vaughn
signed with the Angels, but the Red Sox have been keeping pace with
the New York Yankees in the East Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Man says he's not surprised by the performance of his
former team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo Vaughn taught the Red Sox players how to play,'' he says.
``By that, I don't mean I taught them how to play baseball. What I
taught them was toughness and how to be consistent when under fire.
It took three or four years to do it, but the Red Sox are a team
with a bunch of tough guys who aren't afraid of anybody. I'd like
to think I played a major part in instilling that toughness in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Mo Vaughn's desire to instill a similar toughness into an
Angel team that has a sacred history of softness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so different out here,'' says Vaughn. ``If we were
struggling in Boston like we have been here this season, the Boston
fans would have crucified us. They'd have called us every name in
the book, and booed us unmercifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not here. People just seem to take it in stride. Don't get
me wrong. I know the fans here aren't happy with the way we've been
playing. But they come out to the park, and you don't hear any of
the nasty remarks you would if you were struggling in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Man still thinks the Angels will straighten themselves
out, even though their suspect pitching staff indicates otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stay positive in this game,'' he says. ``Or it'll
eat you up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are your feelings about Terry Collins?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him,'' says Vaughn quickly. ``He reminds me of me. He
just wants to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Man, who's listed at 6-1 and 245 even though he appears
heavier, insists he prefers Orange County to Boston despite his
team's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more fun for me out here,'' says Vaughn. ``I'm never
bothered, no matter where I go. It's not big news what I do here. I
was in a fishbowl in Boston. It would be perfect out here for me if
we just started to win more often ...''

LANGUAGE CAMP PROVES POPULAR WITH BOTH PARENTS AND KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECILIA GOODNOW  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Camille Lucas, 6{, isn't shy about demonstrating her
grasp of Russian. With aplomb, she rattles off a Russian phrase in
an accent that sounds impressively authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask her to translate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forget what it means,'' Camille says good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Wednesday was just her third day of World Language
Summer Camp, a total-immersion program that immediately gets kids
playing games, singing songs and performing skits in one of eight
foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun!'' says Camille, pausing on her way into Seattle's
Meany Middle School, where the two-week camp is housed.
</P>
<P>
   Without prompting, she launches into a spirited ``good-morning''
song, with Russian lyrics set to the tune of ``Frere Jacques.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful program,'' says her mother, Lisa Hashizume.
``It's so focused.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take any selling to convince parents of the benefits
of the two-week language camp, which offers classes in Swahili,
German, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Russian _
all for the low, low price of $15.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you better stand back. That ominous rumble is the sound
of 1,500 parents scrambling for one of 560 slots _ first come,
first served. Spanish, Japanese and Mandarin were the top three
language choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent this (application) in the first day I got it,'' said
Lenore Sargent, who knew the benefit of exposing kids to languages
at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt hampered because I learned Spanish late in life,'' she
said, ``and I'm still not as fluent as I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Brief though it is, this exposure to Spanish may help her
daughter Kayla, who's almost 9, feel more at home when the family
embarks on a six-month stay in Europe next year.
</P>
<P>
   The language camp, for children entering grades 1 through 5,
started Monday. As of Wednesday, Spanish remained a very foreign
tongue to Kayla.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's having a hard time because she doesn't understand
anything,'' Sargent said, ``because they're very clever and they're
only speaking Spanish. But I taught her how to say, `I don't
understand.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Yates, 8, and her 10-year-old brother Casey are learning
Spanish for practical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to Mexico every once in a while so I figured it would be
probably the first place we'd take them,'' said their mother, Linda
Hebish, who speaks poco Spanish herself.
</P>
<P>
   The federally funded World Language Summer Camp started small
two years ago in the Seattle suburbs of Bellevue and Federal Way
with classes in Korean and Mandarin. Last year, when the program
moved to Meany, it grew to include five ``seldom-taught''
languages.
</P>
<P>
   This year the camp added three more languages _ Spanish, German
and Swahili _ with financial support from the John Stanford
International School, named after the late superintendent of
Seattle Public Schools.
</P>
<P>
   When the International School opens, in September 2000, it will
incorporate many of the language-immersion activities being
demonstrated at this summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   The camp also is a proving ground for native speakers who are
being trained to teach their languages in the regular classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Meany is abuzz with kids counting in unison, naming colors and
playing circle games in their respective adopted tongues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a world tour just going from classroom to classroom,''
said Wolfgang Hirsch, a German-language consultant for the state
who helped get the camp off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the Swahili class, students have paired off to learn the game
mancala, which involves moving dried beans from one compartment to
another of the egg cartons that serve as game boards. Explaining
the rules in Swahili is a stretch for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we get two turns?'' a boy asks teacher Temma Pistrang, a
former Peace Corps volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Pistrang doesn't translate her reply, but her meaning is clear:
``No English.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids keep their spare beans in a paper cup, which they call
nyumba, the Swahili word for house.
</P>
<P>
   That word also shows up in a play they're rehearsing, which
involves a lake (ziwa), a frog (chura) and a rabbit (sungura).
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids went home last night and memorized some of their
parts,'' Pistrang said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Disney's ``The Lion King,'' Swahili wasn't totally
unfamiliar to the kids. Pistrang said they all came in knowing the
name Simba. From there, they went on to learn colors and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday we jumped rope, counting,'' Pistrang said. ``Some of
them jump rope very fast, so they had to count fast.''
</P>
<P>
   One parent, Ellen Aagaard, said her 6-year-old son, Ben Corwin,
wanted to take Swahili because he'd learned some African songs at
Laurelhurst Elementary School, also in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real bonus is this (camp) has a lot more diverse student
population than Laurelhurst has,'' Aagaard said. ``There's a really
strong feeling of community with the whole school district.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben, tugging impatiently at the school's front door, had no
interest in small talk, in any language. He was too eager to get to
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go!'' he said, pulling his mother inside.
</P>
<P>
   Kids at the camp are grouped by language and by age, with
activities tailored to their developmental level. All the classes
are active, however. Teachers use a technique called ``total
physical response,'' which means students don't just parrot what
teachers say, they act it out.
</P>
<P>
   Students respond when the teacher instructs them to stand, sit,
turn around or take a turn at a game. Along the way, the children
learn one-word answers to more complex directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are quiet and don't want to respond, and some are
shouting out the answers on the very first day,'' said Steven
Whiting, Japanese head teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one expects students to become fluent after only two
weeks of camp, Whiting said, ``We hope they'll be comfortable with
the language and will have no fear of learning a language.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the state's strong foreign-trade connections and high
interest from parents, Washington schools offer little
foreign-language instruction before high school, camp leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   According to brain researchers, that's too late for optimum
learning _ and almost certainly too late to speak the language like
a native does.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch said schools should expose children to a second language
in the early grades, when they acquire language more easily, and
continue instruction through high school, with the adopted language
woven into the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kodama, principal of the John Stanford International
School, said the summer camp's glut of applications shows there's a
ready audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confirmed,'' she said, ``that learning a world language is
very important to people.''

KARIYA SIGNS NEW DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- For months Mighty Ducks president and general manager
Pierre Gauthier insisted that there was no reason to worry. That
Paul Kariya would be signed, sealed and delivered by the time
training camp began in September.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier delivered on his promise nearly two months early when
Kariya signed a three-year contract on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms were not released but Kariya's new deal is
reportedly in the $32-33-million range, making him one of the
highest, if not the highest-paid, players in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Kariya and the Ducks were unable to agree to terms
until Dec. 11 after the left winger had already missed 32 games of
a season that turned out to be a disaster for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of us wanted that situation (a holdout),'' said
Kariya. ``The most important thing now in my career is to play and
help the team win games.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides set things in motion after the season when Kariya
and Gauthier spoke about beginning contract discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed both parties wanted the same thing, something that
had some length of time to it,'' said Gauthier. ``And we were going
to get to it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks accelerated when Gauthier met face-to-face with Kariya's
agent, Don Baizley last Friday in Boston, and an agreement was in
place by Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the player wants something and and the team wants the
same thing you can get things done,'' said Gauthier.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was done so quickly that Kariya, who has been
concentrating on working out and rehabing his broken foot, admitted
the news surprised him a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caught me off guard,'' said a beaming Kariya at the Edison
Field press conference when asked if he felt he got fair-market
value. ``I think the contract is perfect and I hope that at the end
of the contract that Disney and the Ducks are pleased with what
they got.''
</P>
<P>
   As a restricted free agent, Kariya's options were limited. He
could have signed an offer sheet once the free agency period began
today. But the Ducks had the right to match and Kariya admitted he
couldn't imagine playing elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart I knew I would be here,'' said the five-year
veteran, who has scored 168 goals and 373 points in 302 games for
the Ducks. ``It's a tremendous place to play, I love it here.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's no doubt Anaheim management loves having Kariya
wrapped up for three years, even though it means both Teemu Selanne
and Kariya's contracts will expire after the 2001-2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is our leader, our captain and as we attempt to reach our
goals I can't think of anybody else I'd want to captain our ship,''
said Gauthier.
</P>
<P>
   It's an Anaheim ship that is in much smoother waters than it was
in 1997, when the Ducks fired Ron Wilson just weeks after they had
advanced to the second round of the playoffs. And it's a difference
that Kariya can't have helped but noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really pleased with the direction of the team and I feel
confident that in the next three years we will be be a contender
for Stanley Cup,'' he said. ``We are making the right moves to get
us to a Stanley Cup and as an athlete that's all you want, a chance
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Many feel there was pressure placed on Kariya in '97 to sign a
deal that would set a standard for the league's superstars. This
time around that was not the case and Kariya believes that was a
factor in getting the new deal done quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing that helped was that there were contracts in
place we could compare with,'' he said likely referring to
contracts signed by Jaromir Jagr and Peter Forsberg last season and
a handshake deal that Eric Lindros made offical on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Kariya, always considered a serious sort, openly spoke about
his outlook on life changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think every year I'm going to become a better
person, player, handle the media better, the fans better,'' he
said. ``The contract and head injury (in Feb. 1998) gave me some
perspective on what is important and not to take things so
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sort of take a little Teemu (attitude) and ease up a bit and
enjoy myself and have some fun.''
</P>

 HEALTHEON AND WebMD PLAN TO BUY NEWS SERVICE  
 (bl)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Healtheon Corp. and WebMD Inc, the companies that are combining
in an attempt to dominate the use of the Internet by the health
care industry, are buying Greenberg News Networks, a privately held
medical news service, for $250 million in stock, people familiar
with the deal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon, based in Santa Clara, Calif., agreed in May to buy
WebMD, of Atlanta, for stock then valued at $3.9 billion. Healtheon
has focused mainly on using the Internet to automate medical
transactions, like insurance claims. WebMD operates a site that
offers information to doctors and to patients, with revenues both
from subscription fees and from advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to use the extensive medical information
created by Greenberg's Medcast service to enhance the WebMD Web
site, which has sections aimed at both medical consumers and
doctors. They will also create a medical news service that will
distribute articles to other news organizations, to increase
WebMD's exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Medcast employs 50 full-time editors, writers and graphic
designers and 20 freelance correspondents. WebMD and Healtheon have
much smaller groups of editors and rely mainly on content from
other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, also based in Atlanta, was started by Alan Greenberg,
a former vice chairman of Whittle Communications, where he was
publisher of Esquire magazine. At Whittle he was also involved with
the Medical News Network, a cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Medcast uses what has come to be called push technology to load
health news and information to doctors' computers when they are not
using them. It has developed elaborate multimedia tools to offer
physicians video news updates and interactive three-dimensional
medical diagrams. Like WebMD, it has sold subscriptions as well as
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon was started by Jim Clark, the founder of Netscape
Communications Corp., and David Schell, a doctor who is also a
partner in the venture capital firm of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP;
Byers. WebMD was founded by Jeffrey Arnold, an Atlanta health care
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Given the astoundingly high valuations that Wall Street has put
on these companies, none of them has managed to attract many
customers. MedCast says it has 2,000 active subscriptions and
commitments from another 6,000 to buy its $300-a-year service.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD has fewer than 10,000 subscribing physicians. It does,
however, have commitments from Microsoft Corp. and Du Pont Co. to
buy $330 million worth of its $30-a-month service to give to
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Greenberg will be timed to close when the
WebMD-Healtheon merger closes at the end of the third quarter.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ For many people living in border towns across the
United States, owning their own home is part of the American dream.
But with incomes low, home prices high and mortgages difficult to
get, the fantasy is out of reach for many.
 &HT;    Corporacion GEO hopes to change that. The US$280 million (sales)
Mexico City-based company, the largest home builder in Mexico, is
working with Atlanta-based Beazer Homes USA to construct affordable
homes all along the U.S.-Mexico border and in Florida, too. The two
companies threw an initial $13 million into the venture, 60 percent
of which is owned by Beazer, 40 percent by GEO.
 &HT;    The two have already broken ground on a development in El Paso,
acquired land for a second development and are negotiating to buy a
third tract. Their short-term goal: to have 1,000 homes in the
ground by the end of the year. Their longer-term goal: to be
building 3,000 homes a year across the United States generating
sales of $150 million by 2001.
 &HT;    Expanding into the United States is an aggressive move for any
Latin American company, particularly in as competitive, cyclical
and inherently local an industry as home building. But Enrique
Carral, vice chairman of GEO-Beazer, as the joint venture is
called, says he's got the right target country and his low-income
houses are the right product. ``The U.S. and Europe are the only
parts of the world performing,'' he says. ``The market is
tremendous because no one is attending to the affordable homes.''
 &HT;    Sobani Warner, a Latin America construction analyst at New
York-based brokerage firm Bear Stearns, is excited about GEO's U.S.
prospects. ``It's a market that is underserved, the mortgage system
is better than in any of the other Latin American countries and
there's government support,'' she says. ``You see a lot of Latin
companies trying to diversify their revenue stream. So if (GEO) can
make a profit out of it, why not?''
 &HT;    GEO is well on its way. It's already sold 100 of the 430 homes
it's building in the Oasis Ranch development in El Paso and hopes
to deliver the first by the end of July.
 &HT;    But GEO is offering more than the boxy, concrete-block homes
that made it famous in Mexico. While they're using the same basic
Lego-like technology, the homes will have many more features, from
built-in closets, washer-dryer connections and central air
conditioning and heat to fenced-in yards and landscaping. The homes
will also be considerably bigger _ 1,200 square feet on average,
versus only 500 in Mexico. They'll also cost a lot more _ $39,000
for a two-bedroom home, versus $15,000 in Mexico. Still, ``The
alternative to that is a trailer,'' says Carral, who was a
construction manager at Mexico City's Santa Fe retail development
before joining GEO 10 years ago.
 &HT;    This is not Carral's first development outside of Mexico. The
53-year-old manager spent 15 months in Santiago, Chile getting
GEO's first international housing development off the ground with a
local joint-venture partner, Constructora SALFA. So far, it's been
a hit: GEO has delivered 4,400 homes and expects to move another
1,200 this year, despite high interest and unemployment rates as a
result of an economic slowdown in Chile. Argentina may be next.
 &HT;    Even with a local partner, operating conditions in the U.S. have
proven to be tricky for the Mexican homebuilder. Carral says the
permitting process is particularly onerous, with the approval for
the first development taking six months to secure, versus what
would take only a month in Mexico. He also complains about the
inspection process. ``Before you pour any slab, you have to get an
inspection from the city. Before you start the slab of the second
floor, you have to have that first floor approved,'' he says. ``It
adds time to the process.''
 &HT;    But because it's building low-income housing, GEO-Beazer is
receiving rich subsidies from the city, the state and federal
government-owned mortgage provider Fannie Mae, which is extending a
$3 million credit line through its Housing Impact Fund.
 &HT;    Now that it's hit a groove in El Paso, GEO is scouting for new
sites. Its first aim is Houston, which, like El Paso, has a large
Hispanic population but not a lot of affordable homes.
 &HT;    GEO's going to face some stiff competition. Last March,
Houston-based U.S. Home Corp. announced it was acquiring 13.3
percent of GIG Desarrolladores Inmobiliarios (GIDI), a Zapopan,
Jalisco-based homebuilder, for $12.8 million. As part of the deal,
the duo said they would build low-income housing along the border.
 &HT;    The two didn't waste any time. They've already delivered homes
in Dallas, have broken ground in Houston and are looking at sites
in San Antonio, El Paso and Arizona. Within five years, they aim to
deliver 2,000 units per year in 25 developments in 10 different
cities across the U.S., including the states of Florida, California
and New Mexico.
 &HT;    Bear Stearns' Warner is putting her money on GEO. ``They have a
great house, and they've been able to show that minor adaptations
of that house can sell in Chile,'' she says. ``If they can deliver
a decent home at a low price, there's a wide open market in North
America.''

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ Para muchas personas que viven en ciudades fronterizas
de Estados Unidos con Mexico, tener casa propia es su mayor sueno.
Pero con los ingresos a un nivel bajo, los precios de las casas por
las nubes y la dificultad de conseguir hipotecas, el sueno es para
muchos una quimera inalcanzable.
 &HT;    Corporacion GEO espera cambiar esa situacion. La compania, con
sede en la Ciudad de Mexico, es la mayor constructora de casas en
ese pais y tiene ventas de US$280 millones. Trabaja con Beazer
Homes USA, de Atlanta, para construir viviendas asequibles a lo
largo de la frontera y tambien en la Florida. Las dos companias
hicieron una inversion inicial de US$13, el 60 por ciento de la
cual pertenece a Beazer y el 40 por ciento restante a GEO.
 &HT;    Los dos ya han iniciado obras en El Paso, han adquirido terrenos
para una segunda obra y negocian la compra de un tercer terreno. Su
objetivo a corto plazo: tener listas 1.000 casas para fin de ano.
Objetivo a largo plazo: construir 3.000 casas al ano en EU,
generando ventas de US$150 millones para el 2001.
 &HT;    Extenderse hacia EU es una decision intrepida para una compania
latinoamericana, sobre todo en un sector tan competitivo, ciclico y
local como la construccion de casas. ``Estados Unidos y Europa son
las unicas partes del mundo donde la economia funciona. El mercado
es enorme porque nadie se dedica a construir casas a precios
modicos,'' afirma Enrique Carral, vicepresidente de la junta
directiva de GEO-Beazer, la firma conjunta.
 &HT;    Sobani Warner, analista del sector latinoamericano de la
construccion en la firma de corretaje Bear Stearns, de Nueva York,
ve con gran optimismo las perspectivas de GEO en EU. ``Es un
mercado que no recibe gran atencion, el sistema de hipotecas es
mejor que en cualquier pais latinoamericano y hay apoyo del
gobierno,'' dice. ``Muchas companias latinoamericanas tratan de
diversificar su fuente de ingresos. De modo que si GEO puede sacar
ganancias de esa actividad, por que no?
 &HT;    GEO avanza a grandes pasos. Ya ha vendido 100 de las 430 casas
que construye en la urbanizacion de Oasis Ranch, en El Paso, y
espera entregar la primera a fines de julio. Pero GEO ofrece mas
que las casas tipo cajon que la han hecho famosa en Mexico. Aunque
usa la misma tecnologia modular basica, las casas tendran mas
detalles: armarios empotrados, conexiones para lavadora y secadora,
aire acondicionado y calefaccion central, patios cercados, etc. Las
casas tambien seran mucho mas grandes: unos 111 metros cuadrados,
en vez de 46 en Mexico. Tambien costaran mucho mas: US$39.000 por
una casa de dos dormitorios, mientras en Mexico cuestan US$15.000.
Pero ``la alternativa es una casa movil,'' dice Carral, ex gerente
de construccion en la Ciudad de Mexico, antes de entrar en GEO hace
10 anos.
 &HT;    Esta no es la primera urbanizacion de Carral fuera de Mexico. El
gerente de 53 anos paso 15 meses en Santiago de Chile trabajando en
la primera urbanizacion de GEO en el extranjero con un socio
chileno, Constructora SALFA. Hasta ahora ha sido un exito: GEO ha
entregado 4.400 casas y espera entregar 1.200 este ano, a pesar de
las altas tasas de interes y del elevado indice de desempleo debido
a la desaceleracion economica en Chile. Argentina podria ser el
proximo.
 &HT;    Incluso con un socio local, las condiciones operativas en EU han
resultado ser dificiles para la constructora mexicana. Carral dice
que conseguir los permisos es oneroso, que la aprobacion de la
primera urbanizacion tarda seis meses, mientras en Mexico solo toma
un mes. Tambien se queja del proceso de inspeccion. ``Antes de
poner un bloque, el municipio tiene que hacer una inspeccion. Antes
de poner la placa del segundo piso, el primer piso tiene que estar
aprobado,'' dice. ``Eso demora mucho la obra.''
 &HT;    Pero como construye casas para personas de bajos ingresos,
GEO-Beazer recibe jugosos subsidios del municipio, del estado y del
proveedor de hipotecas Fannie Mae, propiedad del gobierno federal,
que extiende una linea de credito de US$3 millones a traves de su
Fondo de Impacto en la Vivienda. Ahora que ha asegurado su posicion
en El Paso, GEO busca nuevos horizontes. Su primer objetivo es
Houston, donde tambien hay una numerosa poblacion hispana, pero
pocas casas a precios modicos.
 &HT;    Pero GEO tendra que enfrenta una fuerte competencia. En marzo,
U.S. Home Corp., de Houston, anuncio la adquisicion del 13,3 por
ciento de GIG Desarrolladores Inmobiliarios (GID), una constructora
de Zapopan, Jalisco, por US$12,8 millones. Como parte del trato,
las dos companias dijeron que construirian casas para personas de
bajos ingresos a lo largo de la frontera.
 &HT;    Las dos no perdieron tiempo. Ya han entregado casas en Dallas,
han iniciado obras en Houston y buscan lugares en San Antonio, El
Paso y Arizona. Dentro de cinco anos, esperan entregar 2.000
unidades anuales en 25 urbanizaciones en 10 ciudades de la Florida,
California, Nuevo Mexico y otras partes de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Warner, de Bear Stearns, apuesta por GEO. ``Tienen una gran casa
y han demostrado que esa misma casa, con pequenas adaptaciones, se
puede vender en Chile,'' dice. ``Si pueden ofrecer una casa decente
a un precio modico, tienen un mercado enorme y abierto en
Norteamerica.''

LANGUAGE CAMP PROVES POPULAR WITH BOTH PARENTS AND KIDS

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Camille Lucas, 6{, isn't shy about demonstrating her
grasp of Russian. With aplomb, she rattles off a Russian phrase in
an accent that sounds impressively authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask her to translate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forget what it means,'' Camille says good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Wednesday was just her third day of World Language
Summer Camp, a total-immersion program that immediately gets kids
playing games, singing songs and performing skits in one of eight
foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun!'' says Camille, pausing on her way into Seattle's
Meany Middle School, where the two-week camp is housed.
</P>
<P>
   Without prompting, she launches into a spirited ``good-morning''
song, with Russian lyrics set to the tune of ``Frere Jacques.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful program,'' says her mother, Lisa Hashizume.
``It's so focused.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take any selling to convince parents of the benefits
of the two-week language camp, which offers classes in Swahili,
German, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Russian _
all for the low, low price of $15.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you better stand back. That ominous rumble is the sound
of 1,500 parents scrambling for one of 560 slots _ first come,
first served. Spanish, Japanese and Mandarin were the top three
language choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent this (application) in the first day I got it,'' said
Lenore Sargent, who knew the benefit of exposing kids to languages
at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt hampered because I learned Spanish late in life,'' she
said, ``and I'm still not as fluent as I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Brief though it is, this exposure to Spanish may help her
daughter Kayla, who's almost 9, feel more at home when the family
embarks on a six-month stay in Europe next year.
</P>
<P>
   The language camp, for children entering grades 1 through 5,
started Monday. As of Wednesday, Spanish remained a very foreign
tongue to Kayla.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's having a hard time because she doesn't understand
anything,'' Sargent said, ``because they're very clever and they're
only speaking Spanish. But I taught her how to say, `I don't
understand.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Yates, 8, and her 10-year-old brother Casey are learning
Spanish for practical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to Mexico every once in a while so I figured it would be
probably the first place we'd take them,'' said their mother, Linda
Hebish, who speaks poco Spanish herself.
</P>
<P>
   The federally funded World Language Summer Camp started small
two years ago in the Seattle suburbs of Bellevue and Federal Way
with classes in Korean and Mandarin. Last year, when the program
moved to Meany, it grew to include five ``seldom-taught''
languages.
</P>
<P>
   This year the camp added three more languages _ Spanish, German
and Swahili _ with financial support from the John Stanford
International School, named after the late superintendent of
Seattle Public Schools.
</P>
<P>
   When the International School opens, in September 2000, it will
incorporate many of the language-immersion activities being
demonstrated at this summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   The camp also is a proving ground for native speakers who are
being trained to teach their languages in the regular classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Meany is abuzz with kids counting in unison, naming colors and
playing circle games in their respective adopted tongues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a world tour just going from classroom to classroom,''
said Wolfgang Hirsch, a German-language consultant for the state
who helped get the camp off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the Swahili class, students have paired off to learn the game
mancala, which involves moving dried beans from one compartment to
another of the egg cartons that serve as game boards. Explaining
the rules in Swahili is a stretch for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we get two turns?'' a boy asks teacher Temma Pistrang, a
former Peace Corps volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Pistrang doesn't translate her reply, but her meaning is clear:
``No English.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids keep their spare beans in a paper cup, which they call
nyumba, the Swahili word for house.
</P>
<P>
   That word also shows up in a play they're rehearsing, which
involves a lake (ziwa), a frog (chura) and a rabbit (sungura).
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids went home last night and memorized some of their
parts,'' Pistrang said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Disney's ``The Lion King,'' Swahili wasn't totally
unfamiliar to the kids. Pistrang said they all came in knowing the
name Simba. From there, they went on to learn colors and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday we jumped rope, counting,'' Pistrang said. ``Some of
them jump rope very fast, so they had to count fast.''
</P>
<P>
   One parent, Ellen Aagaard, said her 6-year-old son, Ben Corwin,
wanted to take Swahili because he'd learned some African songs at
Laurelhurst Elementary School, also in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real bonus is this (camp) has a lot more diverse student
population than Laurelhurst has,'' Aagaard said. ``There's a really
strong feeling of community with the whole school district.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben, tugging impatiently at the school's front door, had no
interest in small talk, in any language. He was too eager to get to
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go!'' he said, pulling his mother inside.
</P>
<P>
   Kids at the camp are grouped by language and by age, with
activities tailored to their developmental level. All the classes
are active, however. Teachers use a technique called ``total
physical response,'' which means students don't just parrot what
teachers say, they act it out.
</P>
<P>
   Students respond when the teacher instructs them to stand, sit,
turn around or take a turn at a game. Along the way, the children
learn one-word answers to more complex directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are quiet and don't want to respond, and some are
shouting out the answers on the very first day,'' said Steven
Whiting, Japanese head teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one expects students to become fluent after only two
weeks of camp, Whiting said, ``We hope they'll be comfortable with
the language and will have no fear of learning a language.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the state's strong foreign-trade connections and high
interest from parents, Washington schools offer little
foreign-language instruction before high school, camp leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   According to brain researchers, that's too late for optimum
learning _ and almost certainly too late to speak the language like
a native does.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch said schools should expose children to a second language
in the early grades, when they acquire language more easily, and
continue instruction through high school, with the adopted language
woven into the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kodama, principal of the John Stanford International
School, said the summer camp's glut of applications shows there's a
ready audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confirmed,'' she said, ``that learning a world language is
very important to people.''

VENTURA WANTS REFORM PARTY TO MOVE HEADQUARTERS FROM TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the highest-ranking elected Reform
Party official, wants the party to move its headquarters from Texas
to Florida and away from its founder, Dallas billionaire Ross
Perot.
</P>
<P>
   But Reform Party Chairman Russ Verney .MDNM/said there isn't
much to move because the party basically ``exists in cyberspace.''
The party evolved from Perot's failed presidential bids in 1992 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have in Dallas is my personal presence and a post
office box. We do everything else by Internet site,'' Verney said.
``I guess he's talking about moving a post office box to Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura suggested the move in a letter to delegates to the
Reform Party's national convention in Dearborn, Mich., scheduled
July 23-25. At the convention, delegates will elect a chairman and
decide on party rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura endorsed Jack Gargan .MDNM/of Florida to replace Verney
as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like me, Mr. Gargan believes party rules should vest power at
the grassroots level ... and create a fair and open playing field
for any candidate who may seek the party's nomination for
president,'' Ventura wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has said he wouldn't support another Perot presidential
candidacy. In his letter, he said the party ``has declined
dramatically in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota governor said he will ``remain reluctant to fully
embrace the National Reform Party'' if Gargan is not elected
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   A confidant of Perot's, Verney has headed the Reform movement
since it started as the United We Stand America Party. Verney, who
is a personal consultant to Perot, said he has not decided whether
to seek another term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent seven years at the head of this movement, and my
goal is to bring on leadership to take it to the next level. When
I'm confident we've got to that point, I'll step aside,'' he said.

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Statistically, the spring quarter was another banner
period for stocks, as the main gauges all climbed between 5 and 12
percent, shattering records along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But the gains, capped by Wednesday's surge after the Federal
Reserve chose the mildest of expected options on monetary policy,
raising rates a quarter of a percentage point, masked unusual
market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market, where high-technology issues dominate,
tumbled below its March 31 level each of the three months in the
second quarter before ending at a new peak.
</P>
<P>
   Its gyrations were marked by gut-wrenching declines in many of
the most prominent Internet stocks and coincided with a steady rise
in interest rates that pushed yields up one-half to three-quarters
of a percentage point across the board.
</P>
<P>
   But while many of these onetime high-fliers remained far below
their peaks _ Amazon.com, for example, skidded to $125,125 from
$172.1875 _ the Nasdaq market as a whole finished the quarter ahead
9.1 percent, with more than half of this gain in the final three
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main theme was the rebound in technology,'' said Robert J.
Froehlich, vice chairman of Kemper Funds, noting that stocks
trading at high multiples of annual earnings are particularly
susceptible to rising interest rates. ``That should be bad news for
tech, but these things rallied right in the face of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the quarter, however, rising rates took a heavy toll
on both established growth stocks and more speculative ones, as
many investors shifted money into stocks of companies tied to the
economic cycle. Their reasoning was that the economy was growing so
fast that these laggards might finally get some leverage to raise
product prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this turbocharged rotation out of the high
price-earnings growth stocks and into the lagging cyclicals,'' said
Charles J. Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S.G. Cowen
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, &UR;  &LR; for example, skidded from a high of $150.125 in
mid-April, to $95.125 in mid-June, while Alcoa &UR;  &LR; rallied from a low
of $40.75 in early April, to as high as $67.9375 in mid-June. The
differential between the drug company's percentage loss and the
aluminum company's percentage gain come to more than 100 percent, a
stunning gap that Pradilla said was no doubt far greater than any
plausible change in economic conditions. By the end of the quarter
Pfizer was up to $109 and Alcoa down to $61.875.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the quarter ended many cyclicals were fading, perhaps
having benefited more from a lack of other places to put money that
had come out of growth stocks than conviction that pricing-power
inflation might be on its way.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which is skewed toward
big growth companies, finished the quarter with a 6.7 percent gain,
surpassing its 4.6 percent first-quarter gain. This means that if
the second half of the year is as good as the first half, this
index, so widely used as a benchmark, will once again confound
forecasters and advanced more than 20 percent for a fifth straight
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average posted the best performance of
the three major gauges, rising 12.1 percent but failing by the
narrowest of margins, one-tenth of 1 percent, to regain enough
ground to end the quarter above its record, 11,107.19 set on May
13.
</P>
<P>
   Significant amounts of the money that was switched into
cyclicals in the quarter went into smaller-company shares, with
some value-oriented portfolio managers declaring that this
long-neglected sector might finally be getting its due. Indeed, the
Russell 2000, the most widely cited index for this group, gained a
hefty 15.1 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a growing view as the quarter ended that the
Federal Reserve would one way or another make sure that the
economy's 4 percent growth rate was throttled back. A slowing
economy is a poor climate for small companies.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Internet casualties in the quarter _ America Online,
for example, ended 35 percent lower than its April 6 peak of
$175.50 _ the drug group took a heavy hit.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson-HBOC slumped 52.3 percent; Pfizer, 24.4 percent; Amgen,
20 percent; Eli Lilly, 19.9 percent, and Merck, &UR;  &LR; 10.8 percent as
talks heated on proposals that could involve federal price controls
on prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The top winners in the S&AMP;P 500 had the following gains in the
quarter: National Semiconductor, 168.5 percent; Nalco Chemical,
94.8 percent; Case, 92.1 percent; Millipore, 62.7 percent; Raychem,
60.7 percent, and Cummins Engine, 60.5 percent.

SECURITY CHECKS REQUIRED OF TERROR SUSPECTS' LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Citing the risk of a ``disastrous security breach,''
a federal judge in Manhattan ruled Wednesday that lawyers for
defendants in the embassy bombings and terrorism case must submit
to government security clearances.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for three of five defendants accused of the bombings and
other acts of terrorism protested that it was unconstitutional for
the government to force them to answer detailed questions about
their travels, friends, drug use and other personal details before
being allowed to review classified documents.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last
Aug. 7 killed more than 200 people and injured more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In ordering the security clearances, the judge, Leonard Sand of
U.S. District Court in Manhattan, said he was making ``no
commentary on the reputations'' of the defense counsel. But he
suggested that his ruling was based on the extraordinary
circumstances of the terrorism case before him. The government is
preparing to try the five defendants while it is also conducting a
worldwide search for other suspects, including Osama bin Laden, who
is believed to have masterminded the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact remains that it is practically impossible to remedy
the damage of an unauthorized disclosure,'' Sand wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We refuse to await the possibility of repairing what in this
case might be a particularly disastrous security breach,'' he
added, ``when reasonable measures could have prevented the
disclosure altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the security clearances arose after the office of
Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said it would
require each defense lawyer in the case to undergo full background
checks before making available to them classified materials that
might pertain to their clients.
</P>
<P>
   The three defense lawyers protested, arguing that the same
Justice Department prosecuting their clients should not also be
given the ability to effectively veto the lawyers' participation in
the case by denying them a clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, professor of legal ethics at New York
University School of Law, said that given the circumstances of the
case, Sand's ruling had struck the right balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrorism prosecution meeting the Constitution,''
Gillers said. ``How do you reconcile the sheer lawlessness of
terrorism with the fundamental constitutional guarantees our nation
affords?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Young, the lawyer for Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, argued that
the law did not require security clearances, and that forcing him
to disclose overseas trips he had made or meetings he had held
could compromise his defense strategy, violating his and his
client's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working here under an adversarial system,'' Young told
Sand in court last week. ``When the government starts setting
standards on what sort of trustworthiness or any other quality I
have to possess,'' he added, ``it is unalterably changing the
balance of the adversarial system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. White's office had warned that members of bin Laden's
group were in communication with one another, and that the
continuing investigation could be compromised by leaks. One of the
prosecutors, Kenneth Karas, told the judge that the clearances were
``the best way to maximize the protection of highly sensitive
information that is relevant to an ongoing investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors said they would insure that confidential
information provided by the defense lawyers to investigators doing
background checks was not disclosed to the prosecutors handling the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Sand found that the defense's concerns were outweighed by the
government's reasonable objective of guarding against unauthorized
disclosures of classified information. He did, however, call for
additional steps to insure that information was not disclosed to
the prosecutors, and suggested modifying certain questions to
``minimize needless intrusion'' into the lawyers' backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The judge added that he, not the Justice Department, would be
the final arbiter on disputes over the clearances, and said a
defense lawyer could appeal a denial of a clearance to him. This
suggests that he could allow such a lawyer to participate in the
case, using some other method to protect secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White's office had no comment Wednesday, nor did Young, the
lawyer who most forcefully fought the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer, Paul McAllister, who had not joined the fight
against the clearances but had also waited to submit the necessary
clearance forms, feeling that the process was onerous, said he
finally applied this week, even before the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the handwriting on the wall,'' he said. ``I sent my
application in on Monday. Fingerprints today. It's pretty clear to
me. God knows what will happen when they interview my mother.''

GORTON MAKING SURE HE'S NOT VULNERABLE ON HEALTH ISSUE AT
RE-ELECTION TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ At age 71, Slade Gorton would be retired from
many jobs in the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Senate, where septuagenarians could form their own
caucus, Gorton is young enough to be the son of one colleague,
96-year-old Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   As Gorton gears up to run for a fourth term _ at the end of
which he would be 78 _ he is bracing for the inevitable questions
about his age and fitness. The questions could be particularly
pointed because, Democrats say, Republican Gorton used the age
issue in his successful 1980 campaign to unseat Sen. Warren
Magnuson, who was then 75.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton denies that, but is making sure he isn't vulnerable on
the same score this year. Gorton made a minor splash last year when
he scaled the first 15 feet of the 65-foot climbing rock at REI in
Seattle, and he has challenged journalists curious about the age
issue to join him on one of his daily jogs.
</P>
<P>
   This reporter did run with Gorton recently, and found that after
a six-mile run around the Mall in Washington, D.C., Gorton was
huffier about the historical inaccuracies in his favorite movie,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' than he was from the physical exertion.
Gorton jogged steadily at a moderate speed, and offered a running
commentary on a variety of matters, including the new sculpture
garden at the National Gallery (skeptical) and the scaffolding on
the Washington Monument (positive).
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said that, despite a heart attack in 1994, poor eyesight
and a hole in his palate that causes a persistent, throat-clearing
cough, he is in good health.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the heart attack, he takes two pills a day, an
aspirin and a medication designed to lower his cholesterol. Always
thin _ Gorton said he hasn't gained weight since high school _ he
said he has nonetheless altered his diet in an effort to reduce
foods that might increase his blood cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton evinced no concern about his health, and although he said
he expects the next term would be his last, he passed up an
opportunity to pledge not to seek re-election to a fifth term in
2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my niche, the thing I enjoy doing most, the thing I
think I do best, so I don't see any reason to pay attention to the
clock,'' he said. ``I feel physically strong and mentally alert, so
there we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton did pledge complete candor about his health, and said
he or his staff would talk with reporters about any health problems
that might arise. He pointed out that he was open with reporters
when he had a heart attack several months after his re-election in
1994 _ allowing his staff and doctors to brief the news media, and
inviting reporters to question him on the first day he was released
from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he is not sure what caused the heart attack, because
``there were no previous signs of this. I've never smoked, I drink
very rarely, I run all the time and my cholesterol was perfectly
within normal limits.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had an angioplasty after the heart attack to clear
his arteries, and then began taking the aspirin and the
cholesterol-reducing drug and more carefully watching his diet. He
said he did treadmill tests to monitor his heart condition
semiannually for several years, and now does them annually, and
that no problems have been spotted.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said the hole in his palate, which causes a noticeable
interruption of his speech pattern, is congenital. He said his
eyesight has been poor enough that he has worn glasses since age 5
and he now wears both contact lenses and reading glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The one declared Democratic challenger to Gorton, state
Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn, is 50. Another potential
challenger, former Rep. Maria Cantwell, is 40. Party officials are
treating the issue somewhat gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age as a rule doesn't matter, unless there's a hypocrisy
issue,'' said state Democratic Party Chairman Paul Berendt. ``When
Slade Gorton ran against Warren Magnuson, they made age an issue,
and it really opens Slade to the question of whether he should be
seeking another term.''
</P>
<P>
   Berendt also made it clear that Gorton's lengthy political
career could be used to depict him as out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time of greater sensitivity toward term limits, and when
everything in society is moving rapidly, that begs the question, is
this someone who is stuck in the '50s or '60s instead of the
'90s?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton flatly denies making an issue of Magnuson's age in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two very senior senators then, and one of our ads said
it was time to begin to build new seniority while Scoop Jackson is
going to be around, but I am quite certain that we never had an
advertisement that referred to Senator Magnuson's age,'' Gorton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told afterwards by some of his people that they were
convinced we were going to have a television ad with him getting
off the plane with excruciating slowness after the Mount St. Helens
eruption, but it was not something we ever considered doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gorton consultant at the time, Arthur Finkelstein, did hire a
camera crew to take a picture of Magnuson shuffling off Air Force
One when President Carter came out to inspect damage from the May
1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. But it was never used in an ad.
(Magnuson suffered circulatory problems in his legs. His lower
right leg was later amputated.)
</P>
<P>
   Gorton often had his picture taken while jogging during the 1980
campaign. Democratic Rep. Al Swift was called on to tape a TV ad in
which Swift told voters: ``Let's concede the point. Slade Gorton
has a great pair of legs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Gorton's TV spots featured a grandpalike figure in a
rocking chair. The narrator said that the time had come for
Magnuson to come home, and that Gorton had the vigor to become
``Washington's next great senator.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, before Gorton was officially in the race, he was quoted
in the Yakima Herald-Republic as saying of Magnuson:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looked like he's on death's door for 15 years, but I want
him alive. He is the best person for me to run against. If he
should die, and the governor were to appoint the incumbent, I think
it would be more difficult for me to win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton at the time did not deny making the comment, but said it
had been in an off-the-record editorial conference, and in response
to a questioner who said Magnuson ``looked like death warmed over.
Then he asked who would run if he were to die and wouldn't that be
better for me and the answer to that was `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, Gorton insisted that he was not making age an
issue in the campaign. ``Absolutely not,'' he said at the time. ``I
don't think it's appropriate to talk about personal qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton now says that although he is older than when people in
the private sector traditionally retire, it is not old for the
Senate, where at least four senators older than 70 are likely to
seek re-election. Increasingly, older people are seeking to remain
active in other realms as well, Gorton noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people in society as a whole are deciding that
they want careers after age 65, and that's simply a function of the
combination of the aging of the American people and the fact that
people are in better health,'' he said. ``This isn't something
that's confined to politics by any stretch of the imagination.''

U.S. BANKCORP AGREES TO SETTLEMENT, WILL BREAK TIES WITH
TELEMARKETER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch and U.S.
Bankcorp announced Wednesday that they had settled that state's
lawsuit against the bank for allegedly selling private customer
information to telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, U.S. Bancorp, the Minneapolis-based owner
of 194 U.S. Bank branches in Washington state, will no longer
disclose customer information to third parties for the purpose of
selling non-financial products.
</P>
<P>
   The bank can still disclose customer information to affiliates
selling financial products, but must notify customers of their
right to refuse to have their information disclosed. Financial
products would include stocks, loans, insurance, and other products
having to do with mortgages, such as appraisals.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit filed earlier this month, Hatch accused U.S.
Bancorp of selling customer inforation, including bank account
numbers, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, marital status,
occupation, and account balances, to a MemberWorks Inc., a
Connecticut-based telemarketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   In return, U.S. Bank was paid $4 million plus commissions of 22
percent of net revenue on sales made by MemberWorks, the suit said.
The telemarketer sold club memberships.
</P>
<P>
   In settling the suit, US Bancorp did not admit to any of the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank severed its relationship with MemberWorks a day
after the suit was announced, said bank spokesman Dan Waage.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Mierzwinski, a lobbyist for the consumer group US PIRG,
hailed the settlement as a good one for consumers that undermines
the posture the banking industry is taking in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   An intense battle was under way in the U.S. House rules
committee Wednesday night over the Markey amendment, which would
require that bank consumers be given the right to ``opt out'' of
having their information shared with bank affiliates. Banks have
already agreed consumers should be able to opt out of having their
information disclosed to independent telemarketers selling
non-financial products.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the banks are claiming the Markey amendment would destroy
banking as we know it,'' Mierzwinski said. ``The fact that U.S.
Bank has agreed to an across-the-board opt-out proves that you can
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee, D _ Wash., who is a co-sponsor of the
Markey amendment, said it's critical to include bank affiliates in
the privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't plug this loophole, banks could buy a
telemarketing firm, make it a wholly-owned subsidiary, and the same
sin would have been committed,'' Inslee said.
</P>
<P>
   Mierzwinski said that public indignation about companies
disclosing consumer's financial information has been rising sharply
in recent weeks. A majority of rank-and-file House members would
vote for the Markey amendment, Mierzwinski said, but House
leadership, heavily lobbied by the banking industry, may well
succeed in preventing the amendment from coming to a House vote, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups will continue the fight in the Senate and
also will attempt to attach the privacy protections to other
legislation the banking industry wants, such as a bankruptcy bill,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building support for this over time. It's moved from a
fringe issue to center stage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer has reported on a variety of complaints
by consumers in recent months about the use of their credit card
and bank information.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers said they were billed for club memberships by
MemberWorks and BrandDirect Marketing, another Connecticut
telemarketer, that they didn't order or want.
</P>
<P>
   Other consumers complained that they gave Ticketmaster their
credit card number to order concert tickets only to find out later
that they were also being billed on their credit card for a
magazine subscription they didn't want.
</P>
<P>
   Waage, the U.S. Bancorp spokesman, said the bank is glad to be
out of the business of giving information to MemberWorks,
BrandDirect Marketing, Damark, and Health Benefit Services,
telemarketers that sold club memberships, travel products,
magazines and other non-financial products.
</P>
<P>
   They generated complaints from consumers and brought in
comparatively little revenue, he said. Oftentimes, consumers who
complained simply had forgotten that they had ordered the products,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.S. Bancorp's settlement with the state of Minnesota,
the bank also has agreed to contribute $1.5 million to Habitat for
Humanity in Minnesota, $500,000 to the state of Minnesota to help
pay the cost of bringing the suit, and $1.03 million to charities
in the 17 states in which the bank does business. It does the most
business in Minnesota, Oregon and Washington, Waage said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also will be required to give refunds to customers who
bought any of the services from MemberWorks and were dissatisfied
with them and did not use them.

GORTON MAKING SURE HE'S NOT VULNERABLE ON HEALTH ISSUE AT
RE-ELECTION TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ At age 71, Slade Gorton would be retired from
many jobs in the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Senate, where septuagenarians could form their own
caucus, Gorton is young enough to be the son of one colleague,
96-year-old Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   As Gorton gears up to run for a fourth term _ at the end of
which he would be 78 _ he is bracing for the inevitable questions
about his age and fitness. The questions could be particularly
pointed because, Democrats say, Republican Gorton used the age
issue in his successful 1980 campaign to unseat Sen. Warren
Magnuson, who was then 75.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton denies that, but is making sure he isn't vulnerable on
the same score this year. Gorton made a minor splash last year when
he scaled the first 15 feet of the 65-foot climbing rock at REI in
Seattle, and he has challenged journalists curious about the age
issue to join him on one of his daily jogs.
</P>
<P>
   This reporter did run with Gorton recently, and found that after
a six-mile run around the Mall in Washington, D.C., Gorton was
huffier about the historical inaccuracies in his favorite movie,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' than he was from the physical exertion.
Gorton jogged steadily at a moderate speed, and offered a running
commentary on a variety of matters, including the new sculpture
garden at the National Gallery (skeptical) and the scaffolding on
the Washington Monument (positive).
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said that, despite a heart attack in 1994, poor eyesight
and a hole in his palate that causes a persistent, throat-clearing
cough, he is in good health.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the heart attack, he takes two pills a day, an
aspirin and a medication designed to lower his cholesterol. Always
thin _ Gorton said he hasn't gained weight since high school _ he
said he has nonetheless altered his diet in an effort to reduce
foods that might increase his blood cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton evinced no concern about his health, and although he said
he expects the next term would be his last, he passed up an
opportunity to pledge not to seek re-election to a fifth term in
2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my niche, the thing I enjoy doing most, the thing I
think I do best, so I don't see any reason to pay attention to the
clock,'' he said. ``I feel physically strong and mentally alert, so
there we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton did pledge complete candor about his health, and said
he or his staff would talk with reporters about any health problems
that might arise. He pointed out that he was open with reporters
when he had a heart attack several months after his re-election in
1994 _ allowing his staff and doctors to brief the news media, and
inviting reporters to question him on the first day he was released
from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he is not sure what caused the heart attack, because
``there were no previous signs of this. I've never smoked, I drink
very rarely, I run all the time and my cholesterol was perfectly
within normal limits.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had an angioplasty after the heart attack to clear
his arteries, and then began taking the aspirin and the
cholesterol-reducing drug and more carefully watching his diet. He
said he did treadmill tests to monitor his heart condition
semiannually for several years, and now does them annually, and
that no problems have been spotted.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said the hole in his palate, which causes a noticeable
interruption of his speech pattern, is congenital. He said his
eyesight has been poor enough that he has worn glasses since age 5
and he now wears both contact lenses and reading glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The one declared Democratic challenger to Gorton, state
Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn, is 50. Another potential
challenger, former Rep. Maria Cantwell, is 40. Party officials are
treating the issue somewhat gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age as a rule doesn't matter, unless there's a hypocrisy
issue,'' said state Democratic Party Chairman Paul Berendt. ``When
Slade Gorton ran against Warren Magnuson, they made age an issue,
and it really opens Slade to the question of whether he should be
seeking another term.''
</P>
<P>
   Berendt also made it clear that Gorton's lengthy political
career could be used to depict him as out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time of greater sensitivity toward term limits, and when
everything in society is moving rapidly, that begs the question, is
this someone who is stuck in the '50s or '60s instead of the
'90s?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton flatly denies making an issue of Magnuson's age in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two very senior senators then, and one of our ads said
it was time to begin to build new seniority while Scoop Jackson is
going to be around, but I am quite certain that we never had an
advertisement that referred to Senator Magnuson's age,'' Gorton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told afterwards by some of his people that they were
convinced we were going to have a television ad with him getting
off the plane with excruciating slowness after the Mount St. Helens
eruption, but it was not something we ever considered doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gorton consultant at the time, Arthur Finkelstein, did hire a
camera crew to take a picture of Magnuson shuffling off Air Force
One when President Carter came out to inspect damage from the May
1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. But it was never used in an ad.
(Magnuson suffered circulatory problems in his legs. His lower
right leg was later amputated.)
</P>
<P>
   Gorton often had his picture taken while jogging during the 1980
campaign. Democratic Rep. Al Swift was called on to tape a TV ad in
which Swift told voters: ``Let's concede the point. Slade Gorton
has a great pair of legs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Gorton's TV spots featured a grandpalike figure in a
rocking chair. The narrator said that the time had come for
Magnuson to come home, and that Gorton had the vigor to become
``Washington's next great senator.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, before Gorton was officially in the race, he was quoted
in the Yakima Herald-Republic as saying of Magnuson:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looked like he's on death's door for 15 years, but I want
him alive. He is the best person for me to run against. If he
should die, and the governor were to appoint the incumbent, I think
it would be more difficult for me to win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton at the time did not deny making the comment, but said it
had been in an off-the-record editorial conference, and in response
to a questioner who said Magnuson ``looked like death warmed over.
Then he asked who would run if he were to die and wouldn't that be
better for me and the answer to that was `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, Gorton insisted that he was not making age an

don't think it's appropriate to talk about personal qualities.''

the private sector traditionally retire, it is not old for the
Senate, where at least four senators older than 70 are likely to
seek re-election. Increasingly, older people are seeking to remain

combination of the aging of the American people and the fact that

BULLYING RUINS THE WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) While waiting for a slow order at a fast-food
restaurant, I observed the shift manager's style. No wonder the
pace was glacial and the employees floated like zombies under
barked orders. No wonder the sign in the front window screamed
``Now Hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy was a bully _ a garden-variety,
kick-down-your-sand-castle kind of playground bully who ticked off
and scared classmates in the fifth grade. Trouble was, he was a
20-something strutting peacock now.
</P>
<P>
   Age, much less corporate rank, doesn't mellow some bullies.
About once a month I hear from a worker who is desperate to flee a
bully boss. Or I read a press release announcing winners of a
worst-boss contest. Or a friend shares a browbeating moment from
her workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Bullying isn't just an annoying personality trait. It's a kind
of violence. The International Crime Survey of the International
Labor Organization polled workers about job-related bullying. In
some of the 32 countries, about half of the workers questioned said
they had been victims and three-fourths said they had witnessed it.
</P>
<P>
   Bullying is most terrifying in a boss-subordinate relationship.
The boss's control over assignments, raises and promotions puts
power in his or her hands. But peer bullying also ruins workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever the bully is, remember what psychologists say: Bullies
are people in pain. For some reason _ often low self-esteem _ a
bully needs to make others cower to puff up himself.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the hard part: To squelch a bully, we're told to listen
and maybe even commiserate a bit. The arrested development that's
making the bully do what he or she does is a cry for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict resolution expert Erik Van Slyke says you can't
outargue a bully. The bully's ``fight or flight'' mechanism kicks
in. He goes on the defensive, and he'll win. He's had more
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Van Slyke, author of Listening to Conflict: Finding Constructive
Solutions to Workplace Disputes, says you must figure out what the
bully wants and needs.
</P>
<P>
   Author Stanley Bing wrote in an Esquire magazine piece that
understanding the bully doesn't mean toadying up to him. It does
mean you can do things to ease the bully's ``troubled way.''
</P>
<P>
   Better, I think, is to push back _ carefully _ enough that the
bully doesn't pick on you. Bullies look for weak points and
weaklings. You knew it when you were 10. It's still true.
Resistance (compassionate resistance, according to Van Slyke) may
divert the bully's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a bully may have lots of targets. The most
effective power against that kind of bully is the power of the
organization. An entire staff, or the right person up the chain of
command, can stop mean and demeaning behavior.
</P>
<P>
   What if the bully owns the place and there isn't anyone else
with say or sway over him? If you're working in that reign of
terror, your best course is to quit. Find a different job first.
Then tell the bully and, if possible, his boss exactly why you
left.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that help-wanted sign hanging in the fast-food
restaurant? I hope it hangs there a long, long time. I'll bet
somebody from headquarters notices.

VALERIE HOGAN, WIDOW OF GOLF GREAT BEN HOGAN, DIES AT 87
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Valerie Hogan, widow of golf legend Ben
Hogan, died Wednesday at her Westover Hills home. She was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were pending Wednesday night. The Hogans
were members of University Christian Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   While her husband was alive, Mrs. Hogan shunned the limelight,
avoiding interviews and making public appearances only with him.
Ben Hogan died in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Mrs. Hogan had taken a more public role. In
November, she appeared at an announcement by Spalding of the return
of the Ben Hogan Co. to Fort Worth from Richmond, Va. Mrs. Hogan
appeared in TV interviews with ESPN and NBC this year commemorating
her husband's career. She offered information about Hogan's victory
in the 1953 British Open at Carnoustie, Scotland, the site of this
year's British Open.
</P>
<P>
   In June, she traveled to the Memorial Tournament in Dublin,
Ohio, where Ben Hogan was honored. She then went to the opening of
the Ben Hogan Room at Golf House in Far Hills, N.J., the
headquarters of the United States Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The travel last month had been rather hard on her,'' her
secretary, Sharon Rea, said Wednesdayday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hogan took strong exception to media portrayals of her
husband as cold-hearted or unemotional. She declined to cooperate
in a biography of Ben Hogan that was published in 1996 and later
criticized it as an inaccurate portrayal of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Golfing great Byron Nelson, once a fellow caddie with Ben Hogan
at Glen Garden Country Club in Fort Worth, said: ``She's always
been quiet and done such a great job of seeing after Ben. It's
always sad when you say goodbye to people who have been your
friends for all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of C.M. and Jessie Fox, Mrs. Hogan was born July
26, 1911, in Fort Worth. She graduated from Central High School and
briefly attended Texas Christian University. She and Hogan met at
church and were married April 14, 1935.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of her life, Mrs. Hogan devoted herself to her
husband, traveling with him to tournaments, sharing the hardships
of the professional golf tour in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Ben Hogan's career blossomed. In 1949, the
couple were able to buy their first home, on Valley Ridge Drive in
Westover Hills. But before they could move in, their car was in a
head-on collision with a bus outside Van Horn, Texas, as they
returned to Fort Worth from a golf tournament in Phoenix. Hogan
threw himself in front of his wife to protect her and was seriously
injured. Mrs. Hogan suffered only bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan recovered to rejoin the professional golf tour in 1950 and
in June of that year won his most famous victory, in the U.S. Open
at Merion Golf Club in Philadelphia. He went on to win nine major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Hogan accompanied her husband, she seldom went out
on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was simply too nervous, and it was too hard to follow the
play,'' she once said. ``I found that it was easier to keep track
of things in the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Her most notable civic activity was serving as chairwoman of the
Jewel Charity Ball from 1959 to 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been so proud of her that she's been able to keep alive
Ben's name since he's been gone,'' Marty Leonard, daughter of
Marvin Leonard, a founder of Colonial Country Club, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like she completed her mission for him, and now it's
time to go join him.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Mrs. Hogan appeared at the champions dinner after
the Colonial tournament. Chairman Scott Corpening said Mrs. Hogan
addressed the competitors and tournament officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it was the first time she had been in that room
without Ben,'' Corpening said. ``She got very emotional. There
wasn't a dry eye in the house.''

KARIYA SIGNS NEW DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 TERMS IN THIRD GRAPH-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- For months Mighty Ducks president and general manager
Pierre Gauthier insisted that there was no reason to worry. That
Paul Kariya would be signed, sealed and delivered by the time
training camp began in September.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier delivered on his promise nearly two months early when
Kariya signed a three-year contract on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya's new deal is worth $30 million over three years. The
contract equals the agreement signed by Peter Forsberg of Colorado
this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Kariya and the Ducks were unable to agree to terms
until Dec. 11 after the left winger had already missed 32 games of
a season that turned out to be a disaster for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of us wanted that situation (a holdout),'' said
Kariya. ``The most important thing now in my career is to play and
help the team win games.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides set things in motion after the season when Kariya
and Gauthier spoke about beginning contract discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed both parties wanted the same thing, something that
had some length of time to it,'' said Gauthier. ``And we were going
to get to it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks accelerated when Gauthier met face-to-face with Kariya's
agent, Don Baizley last Friday in Boston, and an agreement was in
place by Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the player wants something and and the team wants the
same thing you can get things done,'' said Gauthier.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was done so quickly that Kariya, who has been
concentrating on working out and rehabing his broken foot, admitted
the news surprised him a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caught me off guard,'' said a beaming Kariya at the Edison
Field press conference when asked if he felt he got fair-market
value. ``I think the contract is perfect and I hope that at the end
of the contract that Disney and the Ducks are pleased with what
they got.''
</P>
<P>
   As a restricted free agent, Kariya's options were limited. He
could have signed an offer sheet once the free agency period began
today. But the Ducks had the right to match and Kariya admitted he
couldn't imagine playing elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart I knew I would be here,'' said the five-year
veteran, who has scored 168 goals and 373 points in 302 games for
the Ducks. ``It's a tremendous place to play, I love it here.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's no doubt Anaheim management loves having Kariya
wrapped up for three years, even though it means both Teemu Selanne
and Kariya's contracts will expire after the 2001-2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is our leader, our captain and as we attempt to reach our
goals I can't think of anybody else I'd want to captain our ship,''
said Gauthier.
</P>
<P>
   It's an Anaheim ship that is in much smoother waters than it was
in 1997, when the Ducks fired Ron Wilson just weeks after they had
advanced to the second round of the playoffs. And it's a difference
that Kariya can't have helped but noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really pleased with the direction of the team and I feel
confident that in the next three years we will be be a contender
for Stanley Cup,'' he said. ``We are making the right moves to get
us to a Stanley Cup and as an athlete that's all you want, a chance
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Many feel there was pressure placed on Kariya in '97 to sign a
deal that would set a standard for the league's superstars. This
time around that was not the case and Kariya believes that was a
factor in getting the new deal done quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing that helped was that there were contracts in
place we could compare with,'' he said likely referring to
contracts signed by Jaromir Jagr and Peter Forsberg last season and
a handshake deal that Eric Lindros made offical on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Kariya, always considered a serious sort, openly spoke about
his outlook on life changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think every year I'm going to become a better
person, player, handle the media better, the fans better,'' he
said. ``The contract and head injury (in Feb. 1998) gave me some
perspective on what is important and not to take things so
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sort of take a little Teemu (attitude) and ease up a bit and
enjoy myself and have some fun.''
</P>

DAUGHTER OF AN AMERICAN LEADS GERMANY INTO GAME AGAINST U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas) (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ Under different circumstances, Steffi Jones
might have found herself in the American lineup for Thursday's
quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup, instead of anchoring the
German defense.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of fans might have been cheering for her team,
not against it. Perhaps she, too, could be riding a tidal wave of
popularity instead of trying to sustain a ripple of interest back
home.
</P>
<P>
   But, really, there are no regrets. Her father, a former American
serviceman named Ray Jones, left the family when Steffi was 4 and
she was reared by her German mother, Lilo, in Frankfurt. She did
not meet her father until she was 21, and he is more like a friend
than a father, she said.
</P>
<P>
   They are speaking frequently by phone during the World Cup and
he has watched her play on television. If Germany keeps advancing,
maybe he will attend a match, she said, but, for now, he lives in
San Antonio and is tethered to his job.
</P>
<P>
   When Jones began playing soccer at age 4 in Frankfurt, it was
with boys. Not until she was 14 did she even know that there were
teams for girls in Germany. At 18, she had to make a choice. Should
she attempt to make the American national team or play for Germany?
For someone who had lived her whole life in Germany, it was an easy
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad never called,'' she said. ``I didn't know him too well.
There's no sense becoming a U.S. citizen if you don't know anyone
there. I'm proud to play for the German national team.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 11 inches, Jones is a rangy defender who possesses
sufficient skill to move forward and score, which she did in a 3-3
draw with Brazil on Sunday. In 1997, Jones was named the most
valuable defensive player in the European championships, which
Germany won.
</P>
<P>
   Tony DiCicco, coach of the American women, said he might have
been interested in Jones, who is 26, but added: ``We never knew
about her until she played against us. By then it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's match at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in Landover, Md., is
urgent in both the short term and long term for women's soccer in
Germany. One of the eight quarterfinalists in the Women's World Cup
will not qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney because
Australia, as the host team, has an automatic bid. Losing badly to
the Americans could knock the Germans out, puncturing the bubble of
interest in women's soccer at home.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Germany finished second to Norway at the 1995
Women's World Cup, interest in the women amounts to a sliver of the
interest in the men's team, which has won three world
championships. While the U.S.-North Korea match was televised live
in the middle of the night to Germany on Sunday, the more engaging
Germany-Brazil match was shown on tape delay, team officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of Germany's major newspapers sent a reporter to cover
the Women's World Cup, according to Willi Hink, the head of the
women's division of the national soccer federation. The country's
most popular soccer magazine virtually ignores the women, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't beat the USA, I think everything will be forgotten
in three weeks,'' Hink said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Germans win, he said: ``Many people don't understand
that the USA is the leading team in women's soccer. They say, `USA,
they can't play soccer.'''
</P>
<P>
   The women's game was largely dismissed in Germany until 1989,
Hink said, when goalkeeper Marion Isbert scored the decisive goal
in a penalty kick shootout against Italy in the semifinals of the
European championships. Her picture made the front page of the
country's largest-selling newspaper, Hink said, and she became a
national hero.
</P>
<P>
   Participation among girls and women has risen to approximately
800,000, compared with 7.5 million in the United States. The German
women's league, which some consider to be the best in the world,
operates with 12 teams on a semiprofessional basis. Two years ago,
Hink said, the national cup championship, played as a doubleheader
with the men's cup, drew 76,000 in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The top female players in Germany can earn up to $50,000 a year
with salaries and endorsements, though most earn far less,
officials said. The top clubs also offer free cars and apartments
to their star players. Some players also coach, while others attend
school, serve in the Army or hold part-time jobs _ Jones is a clerk
_ that allow them freedom to train up to nine times a week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The former East Germany did not emphasize women's soccer, and
its national team played only one match before the Berlin Wall
fell, Hink said. Several eastern Germans joined the unified
national team, he said, but ``the pressure was so bad, they
couldn't stand it. They weren't used to so much training.''
</P>
<P>
   The current German team is typically well-organized, but lacks
overall speed. It was also unable to hold a lead against Brazil
after Jones provided a 3-2 margin in the 58th minute. The captain,
Martina Voss, is out with a leg injury. But Jones steadies the
defense, midfielder Bettina Wiegmann is a threat on free kicks and
penalty kicks, goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg is one of the world's
best and forward Birgit Prinz gives the team a toughness it was
previously lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Americans have the better players and the better
team,'' coach Tina Theune-Meyer said. ``But we can play fast and I
think we can set their defense under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger question is whether the German defense can withstand
the pressure of an American attack that has scored 13 goals in
three matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great second half against Brazil,'' Jones said. ``If
we play like that, we don't have to hide.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They passed on the risk and potential of Lamar
Odom, the explosiveness of Steve Francis and an open invitation to
Wally Szczerbiak's world. In the end, the Chicago Bulls went
straight to the low post to rebuild their franchise, taking the
burly Duke University forward Elton Brand with the No. 1 pick in
Wednesday night's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of speculation over who would emerge first from
this year's class, Bulls general manager Jerry Krause went the
conservative route in selecting the 6-foot-8-inch, 260-pound
college player of the year before a nearly sold-out gathering at
the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know who would go one,'' Brand said after his
selection, echoing the sentiment of most NBA observers. ``Lamar
Odom, Steve Francis, Wally Szczerbiak, they're all great players,
so I didn't know exactly where I would fit in this draft.''
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore became one of four Blue Devils selected in the
first round, along with Duke teammates Trajan Langdon, taken 11th
by Cleveland; Corey Maggette, taken 13th by Seattle, and William
Avery, the 14th pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver picked a disheartened Francis, the skywalking Maryland
junior, with the second pick, and Charlotte nabbed the UCLA point
guard Baron Davis with the third pick. Rhode Island's Odom, the
draft's biggest enigma, was taken fourth by the Los Angeles
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks, with the No. 15 selection, passed on the
local player, Ron Artest of St. John's, and instead chose Frederic
Weis, a 7-2 center from France.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of the evening involved the Toronto Raptors passing
on Szczerbiak, the Miami of Ohio all-American, and plucking
18-year-old Jonathan Bender out of Picayune (Miss.) High School.
Bender, Raptors officials said, was reportedly headed to Indiana in
a trade for Antonio Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Raptors needed to clear salary-cap room before the
deal was completed, the transaction may not be made before Aug. 1.
Still, their intention to acquire the 6-10, 205-pound Bender spoke
volumes about Indiana's desire to get younger and more athletic in
a changing Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana coach Larry Bird and the Lakers' team president, Jerry
West, tabbed Bender as the best athlete in the draft, and
apparently Bird became fixated on drafting the first high school
player taken.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak, the first senior taken, was drafted sixth by the
Minnesota Timberwolves. There was speculation that Cleveland might
try to make a deal to acquire Szczerbiak, whom the Cavaliers wanted
all along, in part because of his huge popularity in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   There was an absence of blockbuster trades and movement in
general, but the feeling among many teams is that with Aug. 1 the
first date that teams can sign free agents, more deals involving
drafted players would be made over the next month.
</P>
<P>
   The host Wizards had the seventh pick, and their selection of
Connecticut swingman Richard Hamilton nearly brought the house down
with applause. The only similar decibel level came about when
Francis raised his arms as he walked up to the podium to shake the
hand of Commissioner David Stern; in one, scintillating year at
Maryland, he became a D.C.-area fan favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Francis sounded too thrilled about going to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long he planned to remain a Grizzly, he said: ``As
soon as I can get this hat off. I hear it's cold, rainy, far away
from here and they take all your money,'' an apparent reference to
Canada's tax system. Mike Bibby expressed the same kind of
discontent a year ago as Vancouver's No. 2 pick, but eventually
settled in.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Cavaliers took Utah's Andre Miller with the eighth
pick. The Phoenix Suns took University of Nevada-Las Vegas forward
Shawn Marion with the ninth pick and the Atlanta Hawks, one day
after moving Mookie Blaylock to Golden State for Bimbo Coles, Duane
Ferrell and their No. 21 pick, took Arizona's Jason Terry with the
10th pick.
</P>
<P>
   Terry was one of five point guards taken in the first 14 picks
along with Francis, Davis, Avery and Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Brand, the first Duke player to be taken No. 1, seemed like the
logical pick given his production last season and that the Bulls'
starting center last season was Dickey Simpkins. Frontcourt help
was clearly needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of pressure playing for the Bulls, with the
heritage and the championships,'' Brand said. ``I am looking
forward to meeting that challenge. I don't know what my role is
going to be yet, but I'm ready to get out there and find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom created the most stir leading up to the draft, especially
after his whirlwind interview tour on Tuesday. Working out in Miami
in the morning for Heat coach Pat Riley, who was contemplating
trading up for Vancouver's second pick, Odom showed up at a
Washington hotel in midafternoon before catching a late flight to
Chicago to meet with Krause and Bulls coach Tim Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been hectic for the 19-year-old freshman, but it was
the only way he could push up his value after two weeks of skipping
scheduled workouts, missing the league's mandated physical, firing
his agent and briefly entertaining the idea of returning to Rhode
Island _ a notion that was scuttled by the NCAA and the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the decisions I made might not have been the best
decisions for me at that time,'' Odom said. ``But hey, I'm 19 years
old. It's a good thing I didn't make those mistakes when I was 29
and it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was smiling after being drafted by the NBA's
losingest franchise, he added, ``When the Bulls drafted Michael
Jordan, they weren't the best team in the NBA, either.'' &QL;

AGREEMENT ON UTILITY MERGER NEAR, EXECUTIVE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ The head of Western Resources Inc. on Wednesday
said the company was within days of reaching an agreement that
would clear the way for Missouri regulators to approve its merger
with Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely close to a settlement in Missouri,'' David
Wittig told more than 400 people attending Western's annual meeting
in Topeka. Wittig is Western's president, chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Western has been negotiating with the staff of the Missouri
Public Service Commission, the Office of Public Counsel and other
parties in the state critical of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri regulators would have to approve the agreement, but
Wittig said approval could be received before a decision by Kansas
regulators, which is expected before Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wittig said that he expected to settle differences
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission this fall and that
there was no reason the merger couldn't be closed by Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to get it completed by the end of the year,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wittig's comments surprised some of the other parties in the
talks, who declined to say where the talks stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was highly inappropriate,'' Martha Hogerty,
Missouri's public counsel, said of Wittig's comments that a
settlement was near. Her office represents consumers before the
Public Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Krueger, deputy general counsel for the Public Service
Commission, confirmed that the commission's staff was in talks with
Western but declined to discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Among the thorniest issues holding up any settlement is whether
Missouri ratepayers would have to pay some of the premium that
Western paid for KCP&AMP;L. Missouri regulators have never allowed
that.
</P>
<P>
   Hogerty said she wouldn't be ``comfortable'' with a settlement
that would have ratepayers pay some of the premium but declined to
discuss details of a potential settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having some pretty good discussions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would combine Western's two electric utilities, KPL
and KGE, and KCP&AMP;L into a new company _ Westar Energy, which would
be based in Kansas City. Westar would have $8.2 billion in assets
and 1 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Western's stock price has struggled in the past year, dropping
from the 40 level. On Wednesday it closed at 26 5/8. If Western's
share price is less than 29 25/32 just before the merger closes,
either Western or KCP&AMP;L has the option to kill the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be the first to say that no one is happy with our stock
price,'' Wittig said at the annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He said a $75 million reduction in rates since February 1997 and
the delay in getting the KCP&AMP;L merger approved had been big factors
in the stock decline. He said that plans called for shareholders to
get an annual return of 15 percent and that the company should be
measured against that over the next year.

CEO OF GLOBAL ONE JOINT VENTURE RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) In a sign of continuing trouble at Sprint Corp.'s
unprofitable joint venture with France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom, Global One said Wednesday that its chief executive, Gary
Forsee, would resign, effective July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Forsee, 49, is the former president of Sprint's flagship
long-distance division.
</P>
<P>
   After overseeing strong growth in that business, he was
handpicked in February 1998 to run Global One, which has been
dogged by management, operational and cost problems since its
inception.
</P>
<P>
   Forsee's departure comes on the heels of Deutsche Telekom's
unsuccessful bid for Telecom Italia SpA, which soured that
company's decadelong partnership with France Telecom and heightened
expectations that an already strained Global One could fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad blow for Global One, especially because Forsee
was named to shore up the venture,'' said Edouard
Vallette-Viallard, an industry analyst. ``It contributes to the
uncertainty hanging over the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The partners said Forsee was quitting to pursue other career
opportunities. And while Forsee's family still lives in the Kansas
City area, Sprint spokesman Bill White said Sprint had no plans to
rehire its former executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to take a look at what's out there,'' White said.
``He will not be with Sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsee was credited with sharpening Global One's focus on data
services to help it compete with other international alliances. The
company's sales from data services rose 45 percent last year, more
than twice the pace of adjusted sales for the whole group. Even so,
Global One isn't expected to break even until 2001, more than a
year behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The three partners in the venture, which offers voice, fax and
data services to multinational companies, reaffirmed their
commitment to Global One in March after news reports that the
alliance was near collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors and analysts, however, contend that ending the
venture would be the best way for the three to pursue increasingly
divergent international strategies.
</P>
<P>
   White said Global One's partners continued to discuss the future
of the alliance, but provided few details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll have a resolution in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect either Deutsche Telekom or France Telecom,
Europe's two biggest phone companies, to bow out of the venture.
The German company bid for Telecom Italia without first alerting
France Telecom. The French phone company is suing Deutsche Telekom,
saying it violated partnership agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Kroeske, Deutsche Telekom's chief financial officer,
said earlier this month that the German company would buy France
Telecom's stake if the French phone company quit the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Forsee is traveling and unavailable for comment, said Global One
spokesman Klaus Czerwinski.
</P>
<P>
   Global One's rivals are likely to use Forsee's departure as an
opportunity to poach clients made skittish by the continued
uncertainty, some analysts said.

wannabe entrepreneurs listened for two hours Wednesday as a host of
financing and regulatory specialists talked about ways to raise
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those different avenues are out there,'' said Brian Lane,
the Securities and Exchange Commission's director of corporate
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Lane opened the meeting, sponsored by the SEC, at Pierson Hall
at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosive growth of the Internet, more small companies
are turning to direct public offerings, or DPOs. These are
offerings of stock that are sold directly to investors.
</P>
<P>
   DPOs have been around for a long time, but doing one
successfully involves going to lots of chamber of commerce and town
hall meetings to get the word out.
</P>
<P>
   Now a company wanting to do a DPO can put all the information
pertaining to its stock offering on a Web site. DPOs don't involve
underwriters, and that carries advantages and disadvantages. They
must, however, adhere to all SEC regulations.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an underwriter provides several services to a
company planning a public stock offering. Those services include
doing due diligence _ making sure that all the i's are dotted and
t's are crossed, handling the financial matters and more.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters also help set the per-share stock price of an
initial public offering. But using underwriters also adds 7 percent
to 10 percent to the cost of an offering.
</P>
<P>
   With a DPO, the company sets the price. But in the end, there's
not a very liquid market for trading the shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what happens is the creation of these passive bulletin
board systems, where someone can say, `I want to sell X number of
shares at this price,' and another can say, `I want to buy X number
of shares at this price,' '' said Mitch Woolery, a lawyer with the
Polsinelli, White, Vardeman &AMP; Shalton law firm.
</P>
<P>
   DPOs aren't for all small businesses wanting to expand, Woolery
said. They make the most sense when a company wants to raise up to
$5 million. And they make sense for a company with a product that
has sizzle, as opposed to one that's commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense for, say, a microbrewery, but probably not for
gypsum board,'' Woolery said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first Internet-driven DPOs was, in fact, a
microbrewery, which put its Web address on its beer labels. When
customers checked out the Web site, they could link to the DPO page
and check out buying stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a lot of sense in that instance,'' Woolery said. ``It
was the old adage: Good customers make good investors.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, about 800 successful DPOs have raised a total of about
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Another revenue-raising idea that piqued a lot of interest at
the meeting was angel investors _ wealthy individuals looking for
small companies in which to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Bendis of the Kansas Technology Enterprise Corp. said
several databases had been built to help match angel investors with
companies. ACE-Net, for example, is a national, Internet-based
listing service designed to improve access to equity for small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 250,000 angel investors nationwide invest more than
$20 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages include the potential to reduce the cost of
capital, to shorten the time between beginning a search for capital
and getting it, and it's easy to use,'' Bendis said. ``And there
are no broker fees.''

DUCKS WON'T GO SHOPPING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM -- After trading for defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky and
winger Ted Donato and with the possibility that some recent draft
choices are ready to make the jump to the NHL level, look for
Anaheim general manager Pierre Gauthier to take his usual
conservative approach to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The market opens today, but it's unlikely that Gauthier will
become a shopper unless just the right deal comes along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (free agency) is not the same thing as other sports,'' said
Gauthier, who did his shopping late last summer when he signed
Fredrick Olausson on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Olausson turned out to be a $1-million bargin as he scored 16
goals and 56 points, fourth best among NHL defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   But Gauthier insists hockey free agency is crap shoot. And
indeed the Ducks have had mixed results at best with free agents
Warren Rychel, Jari Kurri and Tomas Sandstrom before Olausson came
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to our fans to look at it and we might (jump in) or
we might not,'' he said. ``Expectations shouldn't be the same (as
in other sports). I dare you in the last three years to look at the
money spent by each team and (see) if they improved or went down
... it's a scary, scary answer.''
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier already feels the Ducks have improved their skill
level, especially on defense where it was needed most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good team, we don't have to do anything,'' he said.
``Whether we do (make more moves) I don't know, but I know we are
better (than last season).''
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Among the high-profile free agents -- barring any last-minute
signings -- are forwards Theo Fleury, Valeri Kamensky, Joe Juneau,
Joe Murphy, Dave Andreychuk, Pat Verbeek, Ray Sheppard. It's slim
pickings on defense with Ulf Samuelsson, Gerld Diduck, Alexei
Gusarov and Lance Pitlock. But don't expect the Ducks to target one
player in particular, Gauthier says that often times that leads to
big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wind up paying whatever it takes to get him and (he) winds
up falling flat on his face.''

ALLAN CARR, 62, THE PRODUCER OF `GREASE' AND `LA CAGE AUX FOLLES'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allan Carr, the producer behind the popular movie musical
``Grease'' and the Tony Award-winning Broadway hit ``La Cage aux
Folles,'' died on Tuesday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He
was 62 and also had a home in Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, Ronni Chasen, a longtime friend,
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a varied career that included stints as a publicist and
manager, Carr was noted for his shrewd timing and keen nose for new
talent. He was perhaps just as renowned for his penchant for camp,
most notably as the producer of the 1989 Academy Awards telecast.
</P>
<P>
   That show's opening number featured a squeaky-voiced Snow White
singing ``Proud Mary'' with the actor Rob Lowe, prompting legal
action by the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   A party-giver par excellence who favored ``large-man caftans''
during the 1970s, Carr once feted Truman Capote in an abandoned Los
Angeles jail.
</P>
<P>
   Reared in Highland Park, Ill., Carr attended Lake Forest College
and entered show business after studying briefly at Northwestern
University. His first venture was as one of the creators of the
Playboy Penthouse Television series, which helped pave the way for
Hugh Hefner's Playboy clubs.
</P>
<P>
   He was also responsible for the opening of the Civic Theater in
Chicago, where he underwrote ``The World of Carl Sandburg,'' with
Bette Davis and Gary Merrill; Tyrone Guthrie's production of ``Mary
Stuart,'' starring Eva Le Gallienne, and Tennessee Williams'
``Garden District,'' with Cathleen Nesbitt and Diana Barrymore.
</P>
<P>
   With a string of minor films under his belt, including ``The
First Time'' in 1969 with Jacqueline Bisset, ``C.C. and Company''
in 1970 with Ann-Margret and Joe Namath, and ``Survive!,'' the 1976
movie about the survivors of a plane crash in the Andes, Carr went
on to produce ``Grease,'' the 1978 teen-age dance extravaganza
starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Carr took a chance on two relative newcomers to
the movie industry: Travolta had yet to appear in ``Saturday Night
Fever'' and Ms. Newton-John, a singer who ``knocked out'' Carr when
he met her at a party, he said, had appeared only once before the
camera, in ``Toomorrow,'' a British flop. ``Grease'' became one of
the highest-grossing films in history.
</P>
<P>
   While visiting Paris during the summer of the film's premiere,
Carr accompanied a friend to a play by Jean Poiret called ``La Cage
aux Folles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I dreaded going,'' he said afterward. ``I thought it was going
to be another boulevard comedy in a language I wouldn't understand.
And of course that night it hit me. I had to have the American
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway version of ``La Cage aux Folles'' (preceded by a
hit French film of 1979) was a critical and box-office sensation,
sweeping the 1984 Tony Awards with six wins, including best
musical. The show, about a homosexual couple, ran at the Palace
Theater on Broadway for five years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Carr sponsored England's Royal Shakespeare Co. in
productions of ``Cyrano de Bergerac'' and ``Much Ado About
Nothing'' at the Gershwin Theater on Broadway and the Kennedy
Center in Washington. The productions earned a total of 10 Tony
nominations, including another for Carr as producer.
</P>
<P>
   As a manager, Carr guided the careers of personalities including
Ann-Margret, Peter Sellers, Marvin Hamlisch, Tony Curtis, Dyan
Cannon and Joan Rivers. He is also credited with discovering Mark
Hamill, Michelle Pfieffer and Steve Guttenberg.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, he was preparing ``The New Musical
Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' for Broadway, and British and Australian
stage productions of Ken Ludwig's Tony Award-winning comedy ``Lend
Me a Tenor.''
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

WILLIAM BERGER, FUND MANAGER AND ART COLLECTOR, DIES AT 73
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Conn.)  (rk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William M.B. Berger, who started one of the first mutual funds
in Colorado and later sold his fund company and used the proceeds
to establish a vast collection of British art, died Tuesday at
University Hospital in Denver. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from heart and kidney disease, said
Timothy Standring, a spokesman for the Berger family.
</P>
<P>
   The great-grandson of one of the founders of the Colorado
National Bank, Berger began managing equity portfolios for the
bank's trust department in 1950. Over the next 40 years, he helped
establish Denver as one of the largest mutual fund centers outside
of New York and Boston and had a hand in the growth of at least
three families of mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   As a portfolio manager, Berger specialized in buying the stocks
of small, fast-growing companies in which profits were rising at a
faster pace than that of the overall market. But a big part of his
skill was knowing when to sell as well, watching for signs that
growth was slowing or the outlook for a particular business was
dimming.
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, Berger demonstrated his prowess well in 1994 when
he sold Berger Associates, which managed the Berger Funds, to
Kansas City Southern Industries, the railroad and
financial-services company. The $47 million sale was completed just
before the small growth stocks that Berger favored went out of
fashion, resulting in a performance downturn for many of the Berger
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's influence was felt across the major mutual fund
companies based in Denver. In 1960 he started the Centennial Fund
and in 1963 he began the Gryphon Fund. The two funds later merged
and are now part of the Founders Growth Fund, managed by the
Denver-based Founders Funds family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, he became a vice president and portfolio manager for
the Financial Programs asset-management company, which later
evolved into the Invesco Funds family of mutual funds. Invesco is
now part of Amvescap PLC, a global money manager.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 Berger founded Berger Associates to manage two
portfolios, the Berger 100 fund, which invested in small companies,
and the Berger 101 fund, which was named for a tax maneuver that is
now obsolete. As portfolio manager, Berger led the Berger 100 fund
to a gain of more than 88 percent in 1991, putting it among the top
five diversified mutual funds in the country.
</P>
<P>
   With the sale of the fund-management company, Berger turned his
attention to art collecting, a passion that began, he later said,
as a decorating project for a new home.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Anglophile, Berger soon concentrated on buying
British art, amassing in three years a collection of about 200
paintings and objects that span 600 years of British history.
Although Berger declined to disclose the cost of assembling the
collection, art experts estimated that he spent $25 million,
driving up the prices of British works available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Berger Collection, on loan to the Denver Art Museum, where
it went on display last year, can also be viewed on the Internet at
www.thebergercollection.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why British art?,'' the Bergers asked in a preface to the
collection's catalog. ``Because it represents a heritage that
belongs to all of us today, no matter where our forebears came
from. And because the British people and their culture did more to
advance our material well-being than did any other country in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   William Merriam Bart Berger was born Nov. 3, 1925, in Denver. He
attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., and Yale
University, interrupting his studies to serve as a volunteer
ambulance driver with the British Eighth Army in Italy in 1944 and
1945. He graduated from Yale with a bachelor's degree in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Berger served on the board of the Denver Art Museum Foundation
and was a member of the investment committee of the Denver
Foundation. He also served as chairman of the Urban League of
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Following the sale of Berger Associates, he formed two
charitable foundations, one for art education and another offering
opportunities for young people to experience outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's first wife, Claire McMenamy Berger, died in 1989. He is
survived by his second wife, Bernadette J.J. Berger, of Denver; a
brother, W. Bart Berger, of Denver; four children, William B.
Berger of Paris, George B. Berger of Denver, M. Merriam
Berger-Johnson of London and Katherine M.B. Berger of Virginia;
three stepdaughters, Susan Tweedy, Sheri McPhail, and Cynthia
Hayes, all of Denver; and five grandchildren.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ Thrice-champion Boris Becker, former king of
Centre Court, played his final match at Wimbledon on Wednesday,
confirming his retirement after losing to Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the story.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Courier lost three match points and ultimately a gripping,
emotional five-setter to Britain's great Wimbledon hope, Tim
Henman, in one of the longest matches, timewise, in the history of
the 123-year-old tournament. Then, in his news conference, Courier
set a record for clever one-liners and glib observations about
Henman, himself and life in general.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the story.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams rallied from a set down to take out Anna
Kournikova in a showdown between the surviving teen glamour girls,
after which Kournikova pronounced women less mentally tough than
men, saying: ``They tend to get more nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the story.
</P>
<P>
   The long-vanquished teen glamour girl, No. 1-ranked Martina
Hingis, was the subject of a color photo spread in one of the
morning tabloids, which ran pictures of her in a bikini on a beach
in Cyprus kissing her boyfriend, Ivo Heuberger, a marginal player
on the men's tour.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the story.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Courier's failure to advance, six Americans _ three men,
three women _ stormed into the quarterfinals, a surprising
resurgent show of force for our once-mighty tennis nation that has
been on the ropes of late.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the story.
</P>
<P>
   John McEnroe and Steffi Graf advanced through another round of
mixed doubles competition, although not before McEnroe, in a
classic McBrat flashback, threw a temper tantrum, insulting a
lineswoman by calling her a `` guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But no, no, no, that wasn't the story, either. With Alexandra
Stevenson on the grounds, John and Steffi could have revealed their
wedding plans and not been the story.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, no one except true tennis mavens had so much as
heard of Stevenson, 18, a willowy 6-1 late bloomer from San Diego.
But now she's in the quarterfinals of the most important, most
scrutinized tournament on the planet, and she finds herself trapped
in an ongoing maelstrom of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Figures. Her mom is a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   And according to her birth certificate, as reported by the Fort
Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, her dad is Dr. J, Julius Erving.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stevenson, a stringer for the New York Times, was one
of the first women to break into the male-dominated world of
sportswriting and worked in Philadelphia when Erving played for the
76ers. She raised Alexandra, who was born in December 1980 in San
Diego, as a single parent and has gone to considerable lengths to
keep the identity of Alexandra's father secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk about that,'' Samantha has said on several
occasions during the fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with the news of the Sun-Sentinal's revelations
by a colleague who is a longtime friend of hers, she issued no
denials _ but shed no light on the report, either.
</P>
<P>
   The father's name on the birth certificate is Julius Winfield
Erving II, the good Doctor's full name. Also, Alexandra's middle
name happens to be Winfield.
</P>
<P>
   But California law requires no proof of parenthood for names to
be registered. And Erving, who has been married since 1972 _ he and
his wife, Turquoise, have four grown children _ denied to the
newspaper he is Alexandra's father.
</P>
<P>
   This bit of beyond-bizarre intrigue follows on the heels of
Samantha Stevenson's threat to sue Wimbledon for not acknowledging
her daughter's professional status and thus planning to withhold
prize money from her, which is a tidy $80,000-plus with a spot in
the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra turned pro at the Wimbledon qualifier in Roehampton
but didn't appear to inform anybody, at least not the Women's
Tennis Association. Hence, she is listed as an amateur.
Nonetheless, that squabble has become a non-issue with Wimbledon
agreeing to fork over the cash, whatever the sum.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in an interview, Samantha also nebulously accused
women's tennis of rampant racism and lesbianism, never mind that
the specific racist incident she was citing happened on the junior
circuit. Alexandra said so after beating Lisa Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   As for the charges of lesbians in the locker room, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, through it all, the resolutely cheerful Alexandra has
found it possible to produce extended patches of brilliant tennis,
most recently rallying from a dreadful start against Raymond. She
dropped 15 of the first 16 points before steadying herself and
prevailing in three sets.
</P>
<P>
   And she might not be done. Her next opponent, Jelena Dokic,
clobbered the badly out-of-sorts Hingis in the first round. But
Dokic, 16, a fellow qualifier, is in similarly uncharted Wimbledon
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra began her news conference by reading an upbeat
statement that was intended to deflect questions about the racism
issue. It failed, of course, and then she would quickly get
broadsided by the paternity matter.
</P>
<P>
   What a day. About the only thing that didn't happen was rain,
and even that wasn't the story.

B-2 BOMBERS EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS DURING WAR, AIR FORCE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Missouri-based B-2 stealth bomber proved
crucial in the Yugoslav air war, but two Air Force generals stopped
short Wednesday of saying that more of the $700 million planes
should be added to the country's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The B-2 exceeded all our expectations in terms of durability,
reliability and overall performance _ period,'' said Brig. Gen.
Leroy Barnidge, commander of the 509th Bomber Wing at Whiteman Air
Force Base. ``Airborne performance was remarkably similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnidge and Lt. Gen. Marvin Esmond, deputy chief of staff for
Air Force air and space operations, briefed the Military
Procurement Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Esmond said the six B-2s deployed from Whiteman flew only 1
percent of all bombing missions in Yugoslavia, all at night, but
accounted for 11 percent of all targets hit. The other three B-2s
at Whiteman were not ready for combat.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Ryun, a Kansas Republican, asked if the Air Force would
like to see more B-2s. There are 12 more being built, and some
members of Congress have advocated a larger fleet. Original plans
called for 132.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would take the B-2s if we were issued those, of course,''
Esmond said, evoking laughter. ``We think the balance of bomber
support aircraft and fighter aircraft with our lift and tanker
capabilities, ratio-wise, is about right.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnidge said the B-2s were intended to be used in ``lethal
environments with hard-to-get-at targets'' and not as a workhorse
bombing fleet sent out on mass missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am quite satisfied with what we have right now...,'' he
said. ``I leave it to you gentlemen and the leadership of the
military to decide what the exact right number will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one on the subcommittee proposed adding more B-2s to
the 12 in production, some expressed a sense of vindication over
the plane's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who fought long and hard, first to get 15
(planes), then to get another five and then another one, feel that
this is a day of reckoning when we recognize publicly...how well
the B-2 stealth bomber did,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri,
ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some skeptics, but we can always make
something better,'' Skelton said. ``Let's aim toward that end.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the B-2 is a lack of ``forward bases'' overseas
to keep and maintain the plane so pilots wouldn't have to make long
round trips from Whiteman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get that done in the future,'' Esmond said.
``But again, we don't want to prematurely put (the plane) at risk
in forward locations at this point if we don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the subcommittee questioned whether two pilots,
taking turns, can get enough sleep on long missions or if room
should be made for a third pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in a cockpit twice in my life when planes were
refueled, and I could see the knuckles of the pilots holding that
speed and holding that height,'' said Rep. Norman Sisisky, a
Virginia Democrat. ``And it seems to me it would be a lot of
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnidge said he had the same concern about pilot fatigue, and
that he immediately asked every pilot returning from Yugoslavia
about it. The pilots said they got two to six hours of sleep on
``power naps,'' Barnidge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All said they felt good,'' Barnidge said. ``And perhaps more
significantly, all asked when they could go again.''
