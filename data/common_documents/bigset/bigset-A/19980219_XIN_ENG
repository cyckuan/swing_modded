<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Financial Crisis in Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific region will
achieve great economic developments in the 21st century and will
play a more important role in international affairs, visiting
Chinese Premier Li Peng said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Premier Li added, this area will not be the ``sole
center of the world,'' nor can we yet boast of a so-called
"Asia-Pacific century."
</P>
<P>
As a general trend, the world is developing into a multi-polar
planet, in which Europe, America, Latin America and Africa will
also enjoy many of their own achievements, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier's remarks were made in answer to questions
on the financial crisis ailing Southeast Asia during an interview
with Russian TV, the Independent Newspaper and the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Despite its impact on the momentum of development in the
affected countries, the financial crisis has not fundamentally
impaired the potential for an economic upturn in this area, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The affected countries are determined to remedy the defects in
their economic structures and policies, and to strengthen the
market monitoring mechanism as well as implementing precautionary
measures against financial risks, Li said.
</P>
<P>
They have also decided to boost regional economic cooperation
among the countries concerned, Li added.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the premier envisions an optimistic future of
economic growth for Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
As members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC),
China and Russia, share a wide range of mutual interests in the
Asia-Pacific area, Li pointed out. He said he hopes the two
countries will make a joint effort to play a positive role in this
area.
</P>
<P>
"We have every reason to believe that China and Russia will
serve as important factors in maintaining the stability and in
boosting the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region in
the new century," Premier Li concluded.

<HEADLINE> EU Recommends Better Disposal of Offshore Oil Rigs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
agreed Wednesday in a recommendation that offshore oil and gas
platforms no longer in use should not end up as waste on sea beds
around Europe.
</P>
<P>
All except a limited few of the 600 such platforms, the
recommendation suggested, should be completely, safely and
economically removed and taken to land for recycling and safe
disposal when no longer in use.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was made by European commissioners Ritt
Bjerregaard and Christos Papoutsis, who are in charge of
environment and energy affairs respectively.
</P>
<P>
It was also recommended that future rules in this aspect should
be based on the principle of a prohibition of disposal of such
platforms in the sea.
</P>
<P>
The platforms to be exempted from the rule would have to be the
existing large concrete platforms for which there is currently no
proven technology to remove and where the environmental impact of
disposal is limited.
</P>
<P>
It was suggested that existing installations may be exempted in
exceptional cases from the prohibition. But this should only
happen after detailed evaluation and consultation of all parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Energy Commissioner Papoutsis said: "We have succeeded in
successfully combining energy policy with environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
"Sea disposal is neither a realistic nor a desirable option for
the great majority of disused oil and gas installations. By
encouraging on-shore dismantling and recycling, we are not only
helping the environment but also creating jobs in communities
where they are badly needed," he added.
</P>
<P>
In European waters, there are now approximately 600 offshore
oil and gas platforms. Some 100 are the large steel platforms
directly concerned by the recommendation in that they represent 85
percent of the total mass of steel in the North Sea installations.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in the North Sea alone, about 450 steel
platforms will be taken out of use over the next 20 to 30 years or
15 to 20 platforms a year on average.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton Wednesday offered his most
detailed public explanation on why it is so important to curtail
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program, even at the cost of
going to war. At the same time, the administration blessed an
effort by the U.N. leader to travel to Baghdad to seek a
diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Suharto of Indonesia Tuesday dismissed the head of
the country's central bank, a step that has increased the risk
that the country could lose a rescue package worth 40 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>

Iraqi arsenals, saying President Saddam Hussein bears `onus' (the
responsibility to do something).
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton demanded that Iraq give arms
inspectors full access to all sites, hoping that Saddam Hussein

</P>
<P>
The legislators said the use of force will have "repercussion
on the peoples in other regions, particularly in Southeast Asia."
</P>
<P>
"The use of violent means in solving the crisis will benefit no

<P>
OTTAWA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Wholesale trade in Canada saw

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Stress World Multipolarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng said here Wednesday that both China and Russia shared the
idea of Multipolarity in world politics rather than domination of
one or two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in a joint interview by Russian TV, the
Interfax News Agency And Independent Newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The world affairs, he said, should be handled by more
countries, and every country can play its own role in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The premier said China will not seek hegemony, and it will
oppose any country which is seeking the hegemony in the
world. Both China and Russia maintained that multipolarity will be
help to world peace and stability, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li added that as permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, China and Russia are influential countries in the
world. The two countries, which share common views and stands on
many international and regional issues, are keeping in close
contact and consultation with each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said amid the rapid development of multipolarity,
it is significant for the two countries to further enhance the
cooperation in international issues.

MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
placed on "full alert" all its embassies and consular offices in
the Middle East in preparation for possible eruption of war
between the United States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency Wednesday quoted Department of
Foreign Affairs officials as saying that all diplomatic offices in
the region have made emergency plans to evacuate promptly the
Filipinos in dangerous zones.
</P>
<P>
The country has about 600,000 workers in the Middle East but
only 50 of them are in Iraq with the Philippine embassy there. The
rest are in neighboring countries including Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Evacuation will involve either bringing the Filipinos back to
the Philippines or just moving them to safer places in the region,
the Philippines News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-U.S. standoff has not yet shown signs of abating.
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan will visit Baghdad on

<HEADLINE> EU Investigates Spanish Ferry Firm for State Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Wednesday opened an investigation into state financing made
available to the publicly-owned Spanish ferry company, Transmed.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, also warned the Spanish authorities that they should
suspend the payment of state aid to the company until commission
examination of the case is concluded.
</P>
<P>
The commission is examining whether the annual budget of 40
million ECU (43 million U.S. dollars) that the Spanish government
forecast as necessary to compensate for the losses incurred on the
services and awarded under the contract is justified.
</P>
<P>
The investigation does not mean that there will be no ferry
services between Spain and surrounding islands.
</P>
<P>
It merely calls into question the amount of subsidy that the
Spanish government is making to Transmed to offset the loss the
company incurs in providing public services.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that the commission is bound by the
Maastricht Treaty to open an investigation into the case because
the manner in which the Spanish authorities tendered for this
public service did not comply with European Union rules on state
aid to the maritime sector.
</P>
<P>
Since 1952, Transmed has provided the ferry service between the
Spanish mainland, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, Ceuta
and Melilla on the coast of north Africa.
</P>
<P>
For this, the company receives a state subsidy to cover the
annual deficit incurred in providing ferry service.
</P>
<P>
Under EU state aid rules, direct financial aid designed to
cover operating losses is generally considered a state aid that is
not compatible with the Common Market.

<HEADLINE> EU Imposes First Merger Regulation Fine on Samsung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
decided Wednesday to issue a fine -- the first ever -- of 33,000
ECU (35,600 U.S. dollars) against Samsung for breaching merger
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean company was alleged to have failed to notify
in due time the European Commission of its acquisition and control
of the American company AST Research.
</P>
<P>
Carrying out this operation without the commission's
authorization was an infringement of the merger regulation that
went into effect in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The fine was the first since the regulation went into force.
Commission officials said the relatively small amount of the fine
was based on the fact that the operation had no damaging effect on
market competition.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the small fine was that Samsung had
eventually notified the commission of the acquisition and the
infringement appeared not to be intentional. The South Korean
company acknowledged the breach and cooperated with the commission
in its investigation.
</P>
<P>
Both Samsung and AST have significant activities in the
European Union in the manufacturing and sale of electronic goods
and personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation union, said
the combined market position of Samsung and AST did not raise any
competition concerns.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Thailand to Strengthen Border Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Thailand
will intensify joint development efforts along their border in
line with calls to step up regional trade and facilitate
transportation of goods, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that various government agencies must play their
parts in facilitating the transportation of perishable and
non-perishable goods crossing the Malaysian-Thai border and also
the Thai border with Laos," Badawi said at a joint news conference
with his Thai counterpart Surin Pitsuwan after their meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said while trade between Malaysia, Thailand and
Singapore has been increasing, the transportation of goods could
be improved.
</P>
<P>
Recommendations for this purpose would be submitted for further
discussions at meetings of the Malaysia-Thailand Committee
probably in the middle of this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said Thailand had proposed that the closing time of
check points at the Malaysian-Thai border be extended.
</P>
<P>
"This is also good as we are also encouraging tourism," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Surin said Thailand would like to see Malaysians and Thais
living along the common border benefit from the developments in
the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle, and to
participate actively in every endeavors undertaken by both
governments.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said during the two-hour meeting, the two sides also
discussed international and regional issues including the tension
between Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand had requested Malaysia to support its
participation as an observer in meetings of the Organization of
Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
Surin arrived here Wednesday afternoon for a two-day
familiarization tour.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Drop Sharply in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. prices at the
wholesale level dropped by 0.7 percent in January thanks to a
steep decrease in energy costs, the biggest one-month dip in over
four years, the Labor Department reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The department said that its Producer Price Index (PPI), which
measures prices before they reach the consumer, was held down by a
3.7 percent fall in energy prices, the biggest drop since a 5
percent decline in February 1991, the end of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
While the robust economy has pushed the U.S. unemployment to
the lowest levels since the early 1970s, inflation measured by the
PPI and the more closely watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) has
been well tamed.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday
that construction of new homes and apartments remained at a high
level of an annual rate of 1.54 million units in January.
</P>
<P>
That was down a slight 0.3 percent from the previous month, but
December's performance was revised sharply higher. It was reported
that the construction of new homes and apartments actually rose 1
percent in December instead of previously reported decline of 0.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1997, wholesale prices fell 1.2 percent while
consumer prices were up just 1.7 percent. Both were the best
performance since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe inflationary pressures will remain
moderate for the whole of this year as the U.S. economy is flooded
with Asian imports which are made cheaper by steep declines in Asian
currencies.

<HEADLINE> UAE Says Low Oil Prices "Temporary" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The minister of petroleum of
the United Arab Emirates has said the current weakness in oil
prices was temporary, the official Wam news agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The recent price fall was due to the decision by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase
its output ceiling by 10 percent to 27.5 million barrels a day
starting from January this year, Wam quoted the Minister Obeid bin
Saif al Nasir as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was also because of the economic turmoil in south-eastern
Asia countries and the prevalence of relatively warm weather in
the northern hemisphere, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"We know through previous experience that prices do not
continue to move in one direction only. They must have their ups
and downs," Nasir said.
</P>
<P>
Nasir, also current OPEC president, said that to shore up the
prices, the crucial issue was that all member states should not
exceed their quotas.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that other options to ease the oil price
collapse will be discussed during the group's meeting in
next June.
</P>
<P>
Nasir ruled out the possibility of reversing OPEC's output
increase decision, saying "there was no going back" in this field.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices slumped from 1997's averaged 19.43
U.S. dollars a barrel to the current level of 14 to 15 dollars in
the past four months when fears grew that a flood of supply will
swamp the world oil market.

<HEADLINE> France Counts on U.N. Chief, Iraq to Reach Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- France said on Wednesday that it
is counting on United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, who
will go to Baghdad on Friday, to reach a compromise with Iraq over
the method of inspecting eight presidential sites suspected of
hiding chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
"France is waiting for Iraq to show its will to find a
political and diplomatic way out of the crisis by making necessary
gestures,'' said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said Annan has enough space to act in Baghdad by focusing
on obtaining an agreement with Iraq on the method of inspecting
the eight presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
France has suggested the United Nations send experts other
than those of the UNSCOM teams to join inspections of these sites.
</P>
<P>
Once he obtains an agreement with Iraq, Annan will present it
to the U.N. Security Council, said the French spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She also said that France differs with Iraq over the method of
inspection, which was shown during the talks between President
Jacques Chirac and Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohamed Said al-Sahhaf
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chirac warned Iraq that time for a diplomatic solution is
running out, although a diplomatic solution is still possible if
Iraq makes further concessions over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview Wednesday, French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine said it is likely that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein will change his mind and make new concessions.
</P>
<P>
"It is not absurd to think that ... he can respond to what is
incessantly said, notably by France,'' said Vedrine.

<HEADLINE> UK Defense Chief on Possible Military Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
George Robertson said here Wednesday possible military strikes on
Iraq would inflict substantial damage on the country's military
capability.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview, Robertson said that he was
confident that planned air strikes would deal a fatal blow to
Iraq's military ability.
</P>
<P>
"I rely on skilled and careful military advice, and all I can
say to you is that we are absolutely certain that the damage that
will be done to him (Saddam) and his military structure is going
to be very considerable indeed and that will substantially reduce
his capability of attacking his neighbors," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, whose country has sent one aircraft carrier and 18
war planes to the Gulf Region, stressed that force would be a last
resort to make Saddam comply with U.N. Security Council
resolutions that demand the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which strongly supports military action against Iraq,
has voiced a cautious welcome to the United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan's visit to Iraq later this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Wednesday Malaysia remained
opposed to any military strike on Iraq as such action would not
achieve its stated objective and urged Iraq to fully comply and
implement all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
There is an ever present danger that should a strike takes
place, it might unleash unparalleled environmental damage that was
difficult to anticipate and it might also impinge on the overall
political and security equilibrium, he said in a statement read at
a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia wishes to reiterate that diplomacy is the only option
that is realistic and no other action should be
contemplated...there is a need for continuous and concerted effort
to find a diplomatic solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia wholeheartedly welcomes the impending visit of United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Baghdad and attaches great
importance to the visit, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Sino-Russian, Sino-American Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese-Russian and
Chinese-American strategic partnerships have common grounds,
visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier made the comment during a joint interview
with Russian TV, the Independent Newspaper and the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Tuesday for a two-day official and
good-will visit to Russia following his visits to Luxembourg and
the Netherlands, said that a 21st-century-oriented strategic
partnership based on mutual equality and trust has already been
achieved between China and Russia. Joint efforts will also be made
by China and the United States to build a constructive, strategic
partnership between their two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such partnerships, the premier said, are aimed at promoting the
healthy and stable development of the Sino-Russian and
Sino-American relations in order to play constructive roles in
keeping world peace and in promoting the progress of all peoples.
</P>
<P>
The partnerships follow the non-alliance, non-confrontational
principles, and are not aimed at third parties, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Because all countries have different situations, geographical
locations and historical backgrounds, the Sino-Russian and
Sino-American relations will not be completely alike, Li said.
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, Li pointed out that China is the largest
developing country in the world, while the U.S. is the largest
developed nation, and Russia shares a 4,000-kilometer border with
China.
</P>
<P>
Given these facts, the premier concluded, the emphases in the
cooperations and the contents of bilateral relations will differ
between the Sino-Russian and Sino-American relations.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment, the Sino-Russian strategic partnership
has become more substantial in content, Li said.
</P>
<P>
It has been proven that strengthening the partnership conforms
to the long-term basic interests of the two countries, and will
help quicken the realization of a multi-polar world. It is also
beneficial in maintaining world peace and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is not an expedient measure that China maintains a
strategic, cooperative partnership with Russia, Li said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Announces Influenza Vaccine Formula for 1998/1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Health experts have recommended
influenza vaccine formula for 1998/1999 with changes of two of the
three influenza vaccine components for the previous year,
according to a press release of the World Health Organization
(WHO) here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a meeting of international experts, it is
recommended that vaccines to be used in the season 1998-1999
contain: an A/Sydney/5/95(H3N2)-like virus; an
A/Beijing/262/95(H1N1)-like virus; and a B/Beijing/184/93-like
virus.
</P>
<P>
This year's vaccine composition differs from last year's in
that the A/Sydney/5/95(H3N2)-like and A/Beijing/262/95(H1N1)-like
virus strains replace the A/Wuhan/359/95(H3N2)-like and
A/Bayern/7/95(H1N1)-like virus strains.
</P>
<P>
As in previous years, the specific viruses used in vaccine
manufacturing in each country will need to be approved by the
national control authorities.
</P>
<P>
Between October 1997 and February 1998, influenza was reported
in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. During the
first three months of this period, outbreaks continued to be
reported in a few countries in the northern hemisphere while
outbreaks continued to be reported in a few countries in the
southern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, North America and some countries in Asia had
widespread activity while in Europe influenza increased from early
February. Influenza A viruses were predominantly of the A(H3n2)
subtype. In some countries, influenza A(H1N1) viruses were also
frequently isolated.
</P>
<P>
Few laboratory confirmed cases of influenza B have been
reported. Following the first case of human influenza A(H5N1) in
May 1997, 17 additional cases occurred in November and December in
Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China.

<HEADLINE> France Sceptical About Signing of Investment Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- France said Wednesday that it is
little likely the countries of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) can sign the Multilateral
Investment Accord by the end of April as is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"France, as other participants in the negotiation, considers
that the respect of the technical deadline should not be imposed
at the expense of the quality and usefulness of the accord under
discussion," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The Multilateral Investment Accord is aimed at liberalizing
investment criteria among the 29 member countries of the OECD with
the principle of non-discrimination between national and foreign
enterprises in investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The OECD members and the European Commission resumed the
two-year-old talks on the treaty on Monday in Paris amid protest
from French intellectuals who suspect that the United States is
trying to force its way into the European market through such an
accord.
</P>
<P>
France, Italy, Belgium and Canada have also set up a united
front to defend cultural exception of different nations, as was
guaranteed by the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT).
</P>
<P>
Ecologists and other non-government organizations of both
Europe and the United States have expressed fear about "social
dumping," as countries could lower environment protection
standards in order to draw investments.
</P>
<P>
Europe is also opposed to the U.S. extra-territorial laws such
as Helms-Burton Act and D'Amato-Kennedy Act, which ban foreign
companies from doing business with Cuba, Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
European Union countries are also reluctant to give up
"European preference" which allows European companies have
preferential treatment in making investment among European
partners.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President-Elect Invites All Parties to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- President-elect Glafcos
Clerides of Cyprus has invited all political parties to join a new
government of national unity, a government spokesman said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In view of his public position to form a government of
national unity, President Clerides considers it his duty to
address the parties in writing and invite them to participate,"
Manolis Christofides said at a daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was re-elected on Sunday for a second five-year
term. He has pledged to form a government of national unity and
has asked the parties to reply to his invitations this week,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
If there is no response from the parties, the president would
go ahead and form a cabinet which would be widely accepted,
Christofides added.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition left-wing Progress Party of the Working
People (AKEL), which supported Clerides' rival, former Foreign
Minister George Iacovou, in the presidential elections, has been
unwilling to participate in the new government.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot be part of such a government since there are
fundamental differences between us and the side Clerides
represents," AKEL's General Secretary Dimitris Christofias told a
press conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But he said that AKEL would continue to work with the
government in the National Council to achieve maximum possible
unity as far as decisions on the peace process of Cyprus are
concerned.
</P>
<P>
The council is the top advisory body to Cypriot president for
the peace talks with the Turkish Cypriots controlling northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after an abortive coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been making efforts to help
reunify Cyprus in a bi-zonal and bi-communal formula. But no
tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Issue Joint Communique (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia issued a joint
communique following a two-day official good-will visit by Chinese
Premier Li Peng here Wednesday. The full text of the joint
communique reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
State Council Premier Li Peng of the People's Republic of China
paid an official good-will visit to the Russian Federation on
February 17-18, 1998, at the invitation of Prime Minister Viktor
Stepanovichn Chernomyrdin of the Russian Federation. The premiers
of the two countries held a third regular meeting.
</P>
<P>
During Premier Li Peng's meeting with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the two
sides exchanged views, extensively and intensively, on bilateral
relations and major international issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides state with satisfaction that the continued smooth
advance of the Sino-Russian partnership of equality and mutual
trust is in line with the interests of the Chinese and Russian
peoples, and is for the good of peace and security of Asia and the
world; and meetings and contacts by leaders of the two nations
have a significant bearing in this regard. The two sides hold the
belief that the first informal meeting between President Jiang
Zemin of the People's Republic of China and President Boris
Yeltsin of the Russian Federation in the second half of 1998 will
further push forward the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides express grave concerns over the situation in
Iraq. The Chinese and Russian leaders appeal to Iraqi leaders for
full compliance with United Nations Security Council
resolutions. And advocating a political solution, China and Russia
believe that resort to use of military forces will be of no help
to an effective resolution to the dispute, and will be against the
respective interests of all nations involved. The two sides
identify the needs to pursue a political solution to the current
crisis through further diplomatic efforts, and appeal to all
parties to adopt an attitude of self-restraint and flexibility, so
as to avoid the further deterioration of the situation. China
appreciates the active diplomatic maneuvers by Russia in search of
an peaceful ending to the conflict, and Russia values highly the
related constructive efforts by China.
</P>
<P>
The two sides point out that the Sino-Russian joint communique
on the multi-polarization of the world and the establishment of a
new world order, and the agreement signed by China with Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan on disarmament along border
areas have had a positive influence on the world. And as permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council, China and Russia
have constantly enhanced their constructive cooperation and mutual
trust in handling international affairs, which will help promote
the healthy development of the world situation.
</P>
<P>
As two big powers in the Asia-Pacific region, China and Russia
are deepening their bilateral cooperation to consolidate peace and
stability in the region. The two sides, in hope that the Korean
Peninsula maintain long-lasting peace, pledge to continue working
for that end.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia attach great importance to creating
conditions favorable for the economic growth of the Asia-Pacific
region. The two sides are willing to keep close bilateral and
multilateral contacts in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reiterate that the Sino-Russian strategic
partnership of cooperation is not directed at any third party.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Russian leaders emphasized that the expansion
of cooperation in economy and trade has played a pivotal role in
the bilateral relations. The two sides point out with satisfaction
that recent achievements in this area are as follows:

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vows to Fight Environmental Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has vowed to
wage a war against environmental problems, said Benjamin Mkapa,
Tanzanian president and national chairman of the ruling party
CCM.
</P>
<P>
The war against environmental destruction should start from
every household, Mkapa said Tuesday when opening a two-day
seminar for members of the CCM national executive committee.
</P>
<P>
"People must realize that their survival depend on the
nature," Mkapa was quoted by Daily News as saying.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that in 1970s, Tanzania initiated several programs
but the country still witnesses massive environmental
destruction.
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that the country's environment is worsening
at a very fast rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a ruling party, CCM has an obligation to reverse the trend
of environmental destruction and pollution, which was stipulated
in the 1995 election manifesto, he noted.
</P>
<P>
To implement the manifesto, CCM members should take the lead
in using land properly, planting trees and protecting water
resources, Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
"If every CCM member will plant one tree this year, we will
have three million more trees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that Tanzania, which has 44 million
hectares of forests, is losing between 300,000 and 400,000
hectares per year as a result of tree felling. Only 20,000
hectares of trees are being planted.
</P>
<P>
Between 1979 and 1983, some 17,000 hectares of forests were
destroyed by fire in 66 incidents.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is also expected to review CCM's 20 years of
performance and future direction, the state of the economy and
preparations for parliamentary and presidential elections in the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar, vice-president Dr Omar Ali Juma said
destruction and pollution of the environment is directly linked
to poverty and if the problem remains unresolved, the nation will
live in absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the CCM leaders should endeavour to educate
on the importance of environmental conservation and protection.
</P>
<P>
Omar cited some of the environmental problems such as the
felling of trees, overgrazing, lack of alternative sources of
energy, as well as polluting of sea. "It is very important to
mobilize people to take part in protecting environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said most environmental problems were caused by human
activities. The existing laws were formulated in 1950s and
therefore the penalties are too lenient.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chinese Premier's European Tour Complete Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The official good-will visits
by Chinese Premier Li Peng to Luxembourg, the Netherlands and
Russia from February 12 to 18 have greatly enhanced China's
political and economic ties with the three European countries.
</P>
<P>
The cordial talks between the visiting Chinese premier and top
leaders of the three countries have enhanced mutual understanding
and established common ground. The signing of the China-Russia
Joint Statement and a series of cooperative agreements will have a
remarkable effect on promoting cooperation between China and the
three European nations in a number of fields.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Russia, Li Peng held his third regular
meeting with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. They
shared the view that the regularity of premier-level meetings has
played an important role in accelerating bilateral cooperation in
economy and trade, science and technology, transport and nuclear
energy, and in developing bilateral ties. They hope to continue
to give full play to such meetings.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers reached a consensus that through the visits,
the two sides have gained a better understanding of each other's
needs and the areas which offer greater prospects for
cooperation. The meetings have also provided them with the
familiarity and confidence to improve bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers have also confirmed that Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin will hold their
first non-official meeting in Russia this autumn. The joint
communique issued Wednesday points out that the first non-official
meeting between the two heads of state will help further develop
the China-Russia strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting between Yeltsin and Li Peng, the two leaders
expressed satisfaction over the major achievements made by the two
countries in substantiating and consolidating their strategic
partnership. They agreed to adopt specific measures to further
raise the level of bilateral economic and trade cooperation. They
also agreed that the two countries should continue, as they did in
the past, to maintain contacts and consultations on major
international issues.
</P>
<P>
Li's Russian tour also saw the signing of five documents on
economic and trade cooperation between China and Russia. The tour
is believed to have given a new impetus to the development of
bilateral relations based on mutual respect, equality and trust,
non-alignment and non-confrontation, and were not directed against
other countries.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the Netherlands, Li Peng held talks with
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, met Dutch parliamentary leaders and
was present at two luncheons held in his honor by Dutch financiers
and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng and Wim Kok exchanged views on bilateral ties, regional
and international issues of common interest, and reached a
consensus on many issues. Both sides expressed their hope for
better cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The signing of a framework agreement on the next phase of the
4.5-billion-U.S. dollar joint venture petrochemicals complex in
China demonstrated the great potential and prospects for economic
and technological cooperation between China and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Luxembourg, Li Peng held talks with
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker and met Prince Henri
and parliament leader Jean Spautz.
</P>
<P>
Major achievements made during the Luxembourg tour included the
increase of mutual understanding and trust, and the signing of an
annex for scheduled cargo services between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said at a press briefing with Li Peng that the success
of his visit presented excellent prospects for the development of
relations between Luxembourg and China.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Police Urged to Fight UNITA Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Andre Pitra Petroff, Angolan
Minister of the Interior, Wednesday called on police around the
country to take up action to fight militiamen of the former rebel
UNITA movement, the Angola News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Petroff made the call at the opening ceremony of the national
meeting of Angolan police.
</P>
<P>
According to him, militiamen of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have been striking horror in
central Angola's Benguila province recently.
</P>
<P>
Over last weekend, the militiamen launched armed attack to
Capupa and Utalala town, killing five and wounding seven
seriously, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In the town of Lomaum, which was previously occupied by UNITA,
the report noted, armed militiamen killed a chief of a tribe for
the reason that he had been implementing policies of the ruling
People's Liberation Movement since local authority was
re-established in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The fighters were engaged in a looting spree during their
evacuation. Although they were defeated by local police, they
had exerted negative influence to local people.

<HEADLINE> UK Pledges to Seek Full Iraqi Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair pledged here Wednesday his country would seek full Iraqi
compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions on arms
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in British parliament Wednesday afternoon, Blair said
that he welcomed the planned visit to Iraq by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan as a last-ditch effort to resolve the worsening
Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We hope his mission will succeed. Whether or not it will
depend on Saddam Hussein," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair, whose country maintains a tough position on the
U.N-Iraq standoff, made it clear that Annan's Baghdad mission is
within the following parameters:
</P>
<P>
"There must be full compliance with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions on weapons inspections; There must be no inhibition or
condition that prevents the inspectors gaining full access to the
sites that they need; there must be nothing that in any way
undermines the integrity of the weapons inspection process."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a
statement issued Wednesday afternoon that Annan's Baghdad visit
"represents the last chance to resolve this crisis by diplomatic
means."
</P>
<P>
"Our demand is straightforward: Iraq must comply with the
Resolutions of (U.N.) Security Council. Iraq must put in writing
any new agreement on access," Cook said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG May Stay in Sierra Leone for Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Chief of Defense
Staff Major-General Abdulsalam Abubakar has said that the west
African peace-keeping force ECOMOG may have to be in Sierra Leone
for the next six months to carry out the disarmament of
combatants.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the remarks at a meeting in New York with staff
of the Nigerian missions during his visit to the United Nations,
the News Agency of Nigeria reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament of all combatants, including soldiers of the
military junta led by Major Paul Johnny Koromah, is part of the
Conakry agreement, which provides that Koromah must return the
power to civilian President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah who was overthrown
by him in a coup last May.
</P>
<P>
Koromah, however, later insisted that his troops could not be
disarmed because they are the National Armed Forces of Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
After a week's fighting, the ECOMOG has captured Sierra
Leonean capital Freetown and is now in control of most part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Abubakar said, "ECOMOG has broken the
backbone of the factions".
</P>
<P>
He defended ECOMOG's actions in Freetown by saying that the
sub-regional peace-keeping force was acting in defense of itself
against persistent attacks by Koromah's forces.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Liberia's protest over the arrest of fleeing
junta members by ECOMOG in Monrovia, Abubakar said the issue is
being addressed by the sub-regional body, the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Abubakar arrived in New York Sunday for a one-week visit to
the United Nations. He is expected to sign a memorandum of
understanding on Nigeria's contribution of troops to the U.S.
stand-by peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
The report said he has earlier met with U.S. officials on the
African crisis response initiatives suggested by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also briefed the group of ECOWAS ambassadors to the
U.N. on developments in Sierra Leone and Liberia, as well as the
political situation in Nigeria, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Not to Open Airspace for Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will not let other
countries to use its airspace to conduct air strikes against
Iraq, said a senior Jordanian official here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after meeting with Israeli National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, Jordanian Water and
Irrigation Minister Munther Haddadin said even if the U.S.-led
military attack on Iraq erupts, Jordan will not open its airspace
to any countries for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian government knows how to protect its airspace and its
security, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting earlier, the Jordanian minister conferred
with Sharon on joint water development projects in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Israeli relations had been damaged by the failed
assassination of a Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) leader,
Khaled Mashaal, in Amman last September by hit men of Israel's
intelligence agency Mossad. Haddadin was the first Jordanian
official to pay a short official visit to Israel since the
incident.
</P>
<P>
A committee appointed by Israeli government completed an
investigation of the bungled operation and submitted its report on
Tuesday. Israeli Foreign Ministry had sent a copy of the report to
the embassy in Amman the same day for immediate relay to the
royal palace.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had conversation over
telephone with King Hussein Tuesday on the report and confirmed
with him the joint efforts to regain diplomatic momentum lost
because of the Mashaal incident.

<HEADLINE> France, Rwanda Agree to Repair Ties: Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- France and Rwanda have agreed to
repair their relations, which have remained tense since the
overthrow of the French-backed Hutu military regime in late 1994,
according to a report by Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Rwandan foreign minister Anastase Gasana as saying
in Kigali on Wednesday that France had agreed in principle that
the "heavy contention" between Paris and Kigali should be solved.
</P>
<P>
Gasana said that French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine gave
the message during a meeting with him in New York not long ago.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to "create the conditions to let the citizens of
the two countries express their mutual understanding," said
Gasanar.
</P>
<P>
"Friendship is possible between France and Rwanda on the
condition that the heavy contention existing between our two
countries be solved, and France has already accepted the
principle," he said.
</P>
<P>
France supported the Hutu military government in the Rwandan
civil war which broke out after the assassination of the country's
president, Jubvenal Habyarimana, in a helicopter crash in April
1994.
</P>
<P>
Following that, at least half a million ethnic Tutsis and
moderate Hutus had been massacred by Hutu troops and militias from
April to July 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan foreign minister said that the two countries will
appoint senior officials to "analyze together without taboo this
contention."
</P>
<P>
"The French minister of cooperation, Charles Josselin, plans to
send a senior official to Rwanda in near future, and he himself
also plans to visit our country," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Supports a Cyprus Settlement: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States will take
advantage of the opportunities in 1998 to help reach a solution to
the protracted Cyprus problem, U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth
Brill said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Cypriot President-elect Glafcos
Clerides, Brill said that during the talks he conveyed President
Bill Clinton's warm congratulations to Clerides on his re-election.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was re-elected on Sunday for a second five-year term
in office in a narrow victory over his rival George Iacovou, a
former foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is very serious about trying to take advantage of the
opportunities that 1998 provides" in efforts for a solution to the
Cyprus problem, Brill said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the issue of Turkish Cypriot participation in
accession negotiations between Cyprus and the European Union
(EU), Brill stressed that "it is obviously better for that
accession process to start with a unified island rather than
otherwise."
</P>
<P>
The EU summit in Luxembourg last December reaffirmed its
decision to start membership talks with Cypriot government by the
end of next March, a stand angrily denounced by Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has suspended bicommunal
activities and contacts since last December in retaliation for the
EU decision, and further threatened to seek union with Turkey if
the EU membership talks proceed as planned.

ADDIS ABABA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- African countries are
urged to develop appropriate national and sub-regional policies
and strategies to address issues pertaining to sustainable use
and management of the natural resources.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a report adopted by the three-day

<HEADLINE> Victim Friendly Courts Opened in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Emmersom Mnangagwa, Zimbabwean
Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Wednesday
officially opened the first victim friendly court in Harare.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the victim friendly court was a result
of the increase in the number of rape cases involving children,"
Mnangawa said.
</P>
<P>
"The children would often fail to speak in court or, when they
managed to speak, they broke down several times during the course
of the trial," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the past some witnesses had failed to give evidence and
answer questions in conventional courts which resulted in the
discharge of the accused for lack of sufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
The friendly courts were designed to protect rape victims from
being intimidated by their perpetrators when giving evidence.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government would soon open
similar courts in all parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The courts were established in 1997 under the Criminal
Procedure and Evidence Amendment Act.
</P>
<P>
Last year there were 2,567 rape cases reported in Zimbabwe,
with the capital Harare alone recording more than 140 involving
children.
</P>
<P>
The program was being boosted by a number of embassies and
non-governmental organisations which were providing special
machines and trained manpower.

<HEADLINE> UAE Approves 1998 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) has approved the federal budget for 1998, putting this
year's deficit at some 480 million U.S. dollars, the official Wam
news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This figure was about 70 percent more than the deficit of 280
million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wam quoted Mohammed Khalfan bin Kharbash, minister of state for
financial and industrial affairs, as saying this was due to an
increase in expenditure estimated at 5.84 billion dollars,
compared with 5.43 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The revenues in 1998 were put at the level of 5.36 billion
dollars, up from 5.15 billion dollars last year, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Kharbash gave no detailed figures of the projected oil income,
which accounted for nearly two thirds of the tiny Gulf country's
total revenues in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
But informed sources from the ministry said the UAE expected
little change in this field. Oil exports earned the UAE 3.5
billion dollars last year when oil prices averaged 19.43 dollars a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices slumped to the current level of 14 to 15
dollars a barrel after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries decided to increase its output ceiling by 10 percent to
27.5 million barrel per day starting January this year.

<HEADLINE> UK in Serious Shortage of Trainee School Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Official figures show that
Britain is in serious shortage of trainee school teachers as the
number of people applying for the course fall sharply, local press
reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the figures, which were leaked to Don
Foster, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, show that there
are major falls since last year in the number of people applying
for the one-year post-graduate courses which supply the bulk of
secondary school teachers.
</P>
<P>
The number of applicants for the course have fallen by almost
1,000 in the last year and by nearly 4,700 in four years.
</P>
<P>
The 423 applications this year for the course in maths are 22
percent lower over last year and two-thirds down on 1994.
</P>
<P>
The number of chemistry and physics students fall 30.5 percent
and 27.7 percent respectively while English students down 8.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures are much worse than 10 years ago when the then
opposition Labor Party called the problem "alarming", saying
"crisis is not too strong a word to describe the teacher
shortages".
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats said that they will use the figures to
press the government to spend more on education.

<HEADLINE> Record Bankruptcies Foreseen in Germany This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of bankruptcies in Germany
would hit a record high of some 29,000 this year, up from 27,500 in
1997, the Federation of German Cooperative Banks (BVR) forecast
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase would occur in the country's construction sector, the
organization noted, while predicting a decline in export-strong
sectors and an overall improvement in the economy.
</P>
<P>
It also projected that investments in the construction sector would
decline by 1.5 percent in western Germany and by 4 percent in the
east.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait expressed its best
wish Wednesday that the United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan would succeed in his efforts to end the current Iraq crisis
peacefully during an upcoming visit to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah was quoted by Kuwait News Agency as saying that
"the visit which is comprehensively supported by the Security
Council members gives hope that Iraq listens to the voice of
reason and peace."
</P>
<P>
It gives hope that Iraq "complies with the international will
in honoring and fully implementing Security Council resolutions in
order to spare its country and people all of these repercussions,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the success of the U.N. Secretary General's
endeavor would contribute to opening a broader path for peace,
security and stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Annan said Wednesday in New York that he is leaving for Baghdad
Thursday to begin two days of talks aimed at resolving the crisis
that has developed over Iraq's refusal to allow an unconditional
and unfettered U.N. arms inspections of mass destruction weapons
in that country.
</P>
<P>
He said he has the full support of all the Security Council
members to seek a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which was occupied in 1990-91 by Iraq for seven
months, had repeatedly voiced support to a diplomatic solution to
the U.N.-Iraq stand-off over the arms inspection operations while
provides bases for thousands of American troops and a dozen of
F-117A stealth fighter bombers in preparation of a possible
U.S. military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait pins high hopes on a success of Annan's Baghdad trip
which would avert a military action that might cause retaliatory
Iraqi attacks against it.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi discussed the latest developments of the crisis over
United Nations arms inspections in Iraq respectively with his
Iraqi and French counterparts on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad
Saeed al-Sahhaf, Kharrazi called for coordinated diplomatic
efforts to implement the U.N. Security Council resolutions in a
way that "dignity and prestige of the Iraqi people will be
preserved."
</P>
<P>
He stressed Iran's belief that the implementation of the U.N.
resolutions needs no force, rather it will be possible through
Iraq's cooperation with the U.N. arms inspectors overseeing the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to take military actions to
force Iraq to grant full and unfettered access to all sites
suspected of hiding nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles to launch them.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf, who arrived in Tehran Wednesday morning, called on
Iran, chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, to
continue support for a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis and
head off a possible U.S. attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone consultation about the issue, Kharrazi and
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine expressed hope that U.N.
chief Kofi Annan would succeed in mediating a political settlement
for the Iraq crisis during his trip to Baghdad on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Annan has reportedly won the consent of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council - China, France, Russia, the
United States and Britain - to pay a visit to Iraq, which is
believed to be the last-ditch effort to defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers urged Iraq to comply with the U.N. Security
Council resolutions to avert possible air strike by the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Accuses Foreign Embassies of Backing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 18 (Xinhua) - Tanzania Wednesday
accuses some foreign embassies of backing youths who joined other
Moslems in last week's bloody riots near a mosque in Dar es
Salaam which left two killed by the armed policemen.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Home Affairs Ali Ameir Mohamed told a
press conference that Tanzania was aware that some youths were
being used by some foreign embassies here to further the
Fundamental course, but he declined to identify them.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware that some youths are being used by some
embassies to create chaos and disharmony in the country," he
said, adding that "I can assure you that we are seriously
monitoring this."
</P>
<P>
The minister also attributed the riots to some opposition
political parties in Zanzibar and the mainland with a view to
promote their own interests.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Tanzania is warily thinking of striking off
some religious organizations which are busy sowing seeds of
animosity and chaos to threaten the country's peace, stability
and unity.
</P>
<P>
Ameir Mohamed stressed that the government was not against
Moslems but some sects which use the religion to enhance their
ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
"The government respects the freedom of worship and doesn't
discriminate upon any denomination so long as that denomination
doesn't ridicule another religious sect."
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander Alfred Gewe said
Tuesday that the area near the down town Mwembe Chai Mosque,
where two people were killed last Friday when the armed police
quenched a Moslem-led riot, has become peaceful.
</P>
<P>
"There are no reported incidents of unrest throughout the
city," Gewe said.
</P>
<P>
Witness said that uniformed police officers, armed with
sub-machines guns, kept a distance from the mourners in an
apparent way to avoid provoking them into a riot.
</P>
<P>
"If they had rioted and destroyed vehicles or looted like they
had done before, we would have hit hard," one police official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The police killed two people in the first bloody riot since
Tanzania's independence in 1961 from the British colonial rule
last Friday when they tried to disperse a mob of some 2,000 near
the Mwembe Chai Mosque.
</P>
<P>
The violence erupted last Thursday when the Moslems protested
the detention of their leader by destroying dozens of vehicles
and stoned the approaching police.
</P>
<P>
Police forced their way into the mosque and arrested some 130
of the rioters including women and children who fled there for
protection.
</P>
<P>
The rioters detained have appeared in two groups in the Kisutu
Resident Magistrate's court, facing charges of destroying
properties and physically harming people.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank Profits Down in 1997 due to Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest bank, Deutsche
Bank, Wednesday said in Frankfurt its profits in 1997 dropped by
one-third to 4.0 billion marks (2.19 billion U.S. dollars) due to
the financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's spokesman Walter Schumacher, the effect
of the Asian crisis became apparent in the final quarter of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the bank announced that it had provided an
additional 1.4 billion marks to its risk provisions for the
business in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Being affected by the Asian crisis, the bank for the first time
had been prevented from setting aside reserves last year. It added
1.2 billion marks to its reserves in 1995, and 1.4 billion marks
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Deutsche Bank's balance sheet total for the first
time exceeded the trillion mark level, reaching 1.1 trillion
marks, an increase of 18 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on a press report that Deutsche Bank was
interested in acquiring Belgium's largest institute, General Bank
NV, Schumacher quoted management board chairman Rolf Breuer as
saying recently that such merger was "no topic" for the bank.

KIGALI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Former Rwandan army soldiers
are currently undergoing political training, government officials
in Kigali announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that over 1,500 former Rwandan army soldiers
from northern Ruhengeri Prefecture and who repatriated from camps
in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) are concerned with this program that started three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
"This is the last phase of political training, dispensed
through solidarity camps," an official from the Ministry of Youth
and Culture in charge of the program told Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The first three phases concerned the students, teachers and
doctors, as well as workers of both the public and private
sectors and clergy people.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government's aim in organizing such camps was to
clear the minds of the returnees of the genocide ideology and all
bad teachings they were exposed to during three years in refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
Some courses bear on national reconciliation, national unity
and patriotism.
</P>
<P>
With the first three phases of the political training, an
estimated 44,000 returnees benefited from that political
re-education.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Asked to Launch Travelers Check Sooner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has been called for the launching of the
much-awaited ECOWAS traveler cheque "without further delay".
</P>
<P>
The regional financial instrument was at first scheduled for
launching last December, but ECOWAS has to keep from issuance due
to reservations of the Francophone member states over the debt
owed by two members.
</P>
<P>
A planned ceremony to ECOWAS Chairman General Sani Abacha, who
is also Nigeria's head of state, to launch the scheme was also
stalled at a mini-summit on the creation of the ECOWAS single
monetary zone, which was held in past two days.
</P>
<P>
The reason of the failure this time, according to Nigerian
Finance Minister Anthony Ani, is "the inability of some heads of
state to arrive for the launching" in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Now that the travelers cheque is designed as the first step
toward a single monetary zone in west Africa by the year 2000,
finance ministers and central bank governors at the meeting seem
impatient with the development.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued by the ECOWAS executive secretariat
today, they recommended to the ECOWAS authority "the ECOWAS
travelers cheque should be launched without further delay".
</P>
<P>
According to Ani, the two member countries, Liberia and Guinea
Bissau, owe the ECOWAS clearing system a total of some 20 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The press release did not say when authorities concerned would
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS travelers cheque is a new payment instrument to be
issued by member central banks to help facilitate the settlement
of both financial and commercial transactions within the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Some five million travelers checks have been printed for the
take-off of the scheme.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A nasty new flu bug, first
identified in Sydney, Australia, last year, is racing across
Canada, a report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The virulent flu strain, dubbed A Sydney, is being blamed for
dozens of nursing home deaths, clogged emergency rooms and
sparcely attended classrooms and offices across the country.
</P>
<P>
The strain will eventually affect 25 percent of the population,
according to regional health officials in the Ottawa area, which
is suffering a significant outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Some 175 children turned up in the emergency ward in one
children's hospital here one night last week.
</P>
<P>
The flu has also played a role in eight deaths at local nursing
homes, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Winnipeg, it's believed that the strain is
responsible for five deaths at one nursing home.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Health Department also reports "widespread
outbreaks" in the Toronto area, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Like any flu bug, A Sydney's symptoms include aches, pains,
coughs and fevers. It usually causes fevers lasting three to four
days and fatigue that hangs up to a month.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Fees on Ships Passing Gulf Not Raised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 18 (Xinhua) -- International insurance
companies will not increase the charges of marine insurance fees
on ships and tankers passing through the Gulf region as a result
of the current tension flared up by the Iraq-U.N. stand-off over
arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Wednesday by Hjaj Bou Khdour, deputy
chairman of Contracts and Purchases in the Kuwait-based United
Arab Marine Shipping Company.
</P>
<P>
The sea route of ships sailing to and from Kuwait "will be safe
as it would be far from the theater of operations in case Iraq was
targeted with a military strike," Bou Khdour was quoted by Kuwait
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There are no fears on safety of ships and tankers entering
the Kuwaiti territorial waters because these waters will remain
absolutely safe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, no additional insurance premiums have been imposed
on the ships' hull and the cargoes against war risks in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Although three weeks have passed since the Iraq-U.N. crisis
flared up, the international insurance companies have not raised
the insurance fees on ships and tankers heading to and from the
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Bou Khdour affirmed that the movement of ships to and
from the Kuwaiti ports has been normal.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is expected to receive 10,000 container vessels and
125 ships this month compared with the same number of
containers and ships received in January, Bou Khdour said.
</P>
<P>
He anticipated that even if a U.S. military strike against
Iraq comes true, the insurance fees for ships passing the
Gulf would not be raised.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Annan's Visit to Baghdad,  Positive Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece described Wednesday the
forthcoming visit to Iraq by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan as
"a positive development," saying that it wished the U.N. chief's
mission a success.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said Annan's visit to Iraq aimed at persuading
Baghdad to allow U.N. weapons inspections was a positive
development.
</P>
<P>
Athens hoped for a successful outcome of Annan's mission, which
already won full Security Council support, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the current Iraqi crisis caused by Baghdad's blocking of
U.N. arms inspections, Reppas said that Greece was opposed to any
country producing, possessing or using chemical or nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos and
visiting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov contacted with
their counterparts of France, Germany and Belgium to promote
Annan's visit to Baghdad which is expected to take place Friday.
</P>
<P>
After their talks in Athens Monday, Pangalos and Primakov
expressed their opposition to the use of force against Iraq,
saying that the possibilities of a political solution to the Iraqi
crisis were not exhausted.

<HEADLINE> Kabbah Meets Cabinet, Parliament Members for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah Wednesday held a meeting with members of his cabinet and the
parliament in Guinea, where he has lived in exile since his ousting in
a coup last May, to discuss his return.
</P>
<P>
The president briefed the audience on his consideration of
government policies for building a new Sierra Leone after the return,
the British Broadcasting Corporation reported Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the president said, the only way out for Sierra
Leone is by avoiding the politics of confrontation, destruction,
suspicion and notorious pulling-down syndrome.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the opposition of "such a large bureaucracy" in the
Sierra Leonean government, Kabbah announced he would be restructuring
his cabinet, ostentatiously downsizing it and streamlining the
government bureaucracy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On his return, the president said, he will set up a policy advisory
council that will review cabinet documents and evaluate the
performance of government ministries.
</P>
<P>
However, some leaders of the parliament told him they have no such
intention at present, which seems to put the comeback plan into
chopping waters.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Five on Sierra Leone, a special body under the
Economic Community of West African States, is now in Freetown to
assess the situation in the country so as to fix a date for Kabbah to
return.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations special envoy to Sierra Leone, Francis Okello,
is also there for relevant matters.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah himself has already set up a task force after the fall of
the junta in Freetown to make preparations for his return, which,
reports said, might take place in the next one or two weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan health authorities
announced Wednesday that malaria, which killed 3,590 last year,
has become number one killer in the country.
</P>
<P>
Dysentery is the second killer which claimed more than 2,000
lives, with most of those died were under the age five.
</P>
<P>
Statistics issued by the authorities show that 506,840 people
were caught by malaria#,125,800 of them serious in 1997.
</P>
<P>
While the civil war, which ruined most of the health
institutions in the country, is labeled as the root of the
diseases, the heavy rains and poor sanitation conditions are said
to be the main reason for the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The statistics said the civil war has destroyed about 60
percent of the health institutions in the country, and four
million of the 11 million population in the country are suffering
from parasitic diseases.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Gerhard Schroeder, the Social
Democratic (SPD) head of Lower Saxony state, was likely to win
enough vote in regional elections which would make him the SPD
chancellor candidate for Germany's September general elections,
showed the results of two opinion polls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the March 1 state vote, Schroeder needs to obtain vote at
least half a percentage point more than the 44.3 percent he
achieved four years ago so as to win the contest for SPD
chancellor candidacy against SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine, it is
reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest two opinion polls, one conducted by the Infratest
Institute and the other by the Forsa Institute, revealed that
Schroeder would get at least 45.5 percent of the vote in Lower
Saxony.
</P>
<P>
Other recent polls also indicated that compared with
Lafontaine, Schroeder -- regarded as a pro-industry reformer,
would have a far better chance of beating Chancellor Helmut Kohl
in the general elections.

Kohl has been in office since 1982.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls on Iraq to Implement UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Wednesday called on Iraq to implement the United Nations
Security Council resolutions to "neutralize any ulterior motives"
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Saeed
al-Sahhaf, Khatami said the U.S. has a history of interference in
the affairs of the Gulf region, and any possible military attack
on Iraq would be against the regional interest.
</P>
<P>
He was referring the U.S. threat to take military actions to
force Iraqi compliance with the U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Khatami voiced
hope during the meeting that the visit of U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan to Baghdad Friday would help find a peaceful solution
to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He expressed sympathy for the sufferings of Iraqi people, who
have been under the crippling economic sanctions imposed by the
U.N. in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iran, as chairman of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, would continue its efforts to find a diplomatic
solution to the crisis, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf briefed Khatami on the standoff between Iraq and the
U.N. Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, U.S. threat to attack Iraq and Baghdad's efforts
to head off the possible attack.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated Iran's efforts to help defuse the crisis, and
called for a continuation of the efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister arrived here Wednesday morning and
has held talks with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi rejected the use of force under the pretext of
implementing the U.N. Security Council resolutions and called for
coordinated diplomatic efforts to preserve "dignity and prestige
of the Iraqi people."

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Direct Investment Pumps into S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The amount of foreign direct
investment (FDI) pumping into South Africa was on the increase, Trade
and Industry Minister Alec Erwin told parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
FDI increased to 13.6 billion Rand (2.7 billion U.S. Dollars) last
year from 4.9 billion (about one billion dollars) in 1994, the SABC
television quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Over the four-year period, the United States was the biggest
investor, followed by Britain, Malaysia, Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a low savings rate in the country, South Africa relies
heavily on foreign capital. Experts say it needs 4.6 to six billion
dollars every year to spur its economy.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said foreign investment was welcome but the government had to
keep its eyes open on foreign speculative investment in order to avoid
financial upheavals as in Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not Optimistic on Annan's Iraq Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
showed little optimism about a breakthrough to be achieved by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan during his talks with Iraqi officials
in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry flatly answered with "No" a
reporter who asked if the White House was optimistic about any
possible breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
But McCurry said Annan's mission to find a diplomatic way to
solve the current crisis is still "important."
</P>
<P>
"There's been no indication from the government of Iraq that
would lend anyone to be optimistic," McCurry said. "There has been
only obstinacy, concealment and deliberate lies about past
practices."
</P>
<P>
Annan won approval from the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council Tuesday to go to Baghdad in an effort to avert a
U.S. military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there were U.S. objections to a possible
compromise in which diplomats from council members would accompany
the U.N. inspection team, McCurry said, "There's only our firm
view and now the view of the Security Council that relevant
Security Council resolutions must be adhered to, that there must
be a process by which UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) can do its
work in Iraq, and that the integrity of that process which has
worked so well over the last seven years must be maintained."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday morning, U.S. envoy to the United Nations
Bill Richardson told NBC in an interview that the United States
could accept the proposal but on the condition that "the Iraqis
accept clear access to all sites unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
"In terms of diplomats, observers, that would observe the U.N.
inspection team itself, I think that is something we can deal
with," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
"If the Iraqis accept clear access to all sites
unconditionally, which they have not done, if they stop
politicizing the U.N. inspection team and give them the
professionalism and integrity and the ability to go anywhere they
wanted at any time, they may get themselves out of this box," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that did not mean the United States was backing
down from its previous calls for clear, unfettered access for the
inspectors in searching sites that the Iraqi government deemed
sensitive and thus off-limits.

Iraq.

about Annan's mediation efforts.

is expected to end his trip on February 23.
</P>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- There should be no
deals, no compromises in UN Secretary-General's forthcoming visit
to Baghdad, Bill Richardson, the Ambassador of the United States
to the United Nations said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Richardson made the remarks after UN chief Kofi Annan briefed
the Security Council members of the United Nations this morning on
his four rounds of consultations on the current Iraqi crisis with
the permanent five.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said the United States feels very strongly the
goals of the mission should be very clear, and the goals are: to
enforce the resolutions of the UN Security Council and get Iraq
into full compliance; free, unconditional and unfetered access to
all sites by UN weapons inspectors and the complete integrity and
inviolability of the United Nations Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the United States reserve the right to oppose
any arrangement that does not protect the Security Council
resolutions and what is perceived as the national interests of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Saying he fully supported the UN Secretary-General and and a
diplomatic solution, Richardson said the problem is in Iraq, which
violates the will of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Unites States has completed an extensive naval, air and
troop buildup in the Gulf, ready to strike if Iraq continues to
bar presidential sites to inspectors of the United Nations Special
commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief has been under pressure to make a mediation trip
to Iraq in order to solve the crisis peacefully. He announced to
go to Baghdad Tuesday after he got full support from the five
permanent members of UN Security Council, namely China, Russia,
France, Britain and the United states.

<HEADLINE> IMF Promises Loans to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Managing Director of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus has
announced that the IMF will offer loans to Russia in keeping with
an earlier schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Russian presidential press service said that during the
meeting with Russian president Boris Yeltsin Thursday Camdessus
proposed that Russia consider extending the current lending
agreement until the end of 1999 as part of an additional credit
line. The proposal met with a positive reply from the president.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin at the meeting expressed the determination of the
Russian authorities to follow the policy of reforms proceeding
from national interests.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Asian financial crisis, Yeltsin said Russia
would be able to protect its financial markets best by advancing
reforms and making tough financial decisions.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said that the major cause of the Asian crisis was the
merger of big business and government institutions, special
privileges given by government to big business and the absence of
transparency.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Wednesday had
talks with Camdessus on questions relating to the program of
cooperation between Russia and the International Monetary Fund in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Managing Director noted that in the process of its
integration in the world economy Russia must protect itself from
the turmoils which arise on the world markets from time to time.

Israel, under the pretexts of democracy, liberty, human rights and
international legitimacy.

Al-Bashir affirmed his country's support to Iraq against the
attempts to provoke it.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong SAR's Budget Copies to Be Re-Printed to Meet Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has decided to re-print
the financial secretary's 1998-99 Budget Speech to meet the
unprecedented public demand.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that a total of 80,000 copies of
the speech including 50,000 copies in Chinese and 30,000 in
English had been distributed to members of the public Thursday
morning. However, all 19 outlets in Hong Kong had run out of
copies within hours.
</P>
<P>
"The demand has exceeded all our expectations. The print run
for the Chinese version of this year's budget speech was three
times greater than last year and double the English
version. Despite this significant increase, we have still not been
able to meet the huge demand," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government has decided to re-print an
additional 10,000 copies -- 7,000 in Chinese and 3,000 in English.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government's first budget, which was unveiled by
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen Wednesday afternoon, has
won wide acclaim from the people of all walks of life in Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Show on Chinese Culture in Eyes of American Artists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Ambassador to China
Jim Sasser held an exhibition in the ambassador's residence this
evening of paintings, prints, and sculpture meant to chronicle the
changes in American views of China over the past one hundred and
fifty years.
</P>
<P>
On display were 15 lithographs of "Chinese Ceramics from the
Collection of W.T.Walters"; "7 Characters: Light, Change, Trunk,
Individual, Howl, Truth, and Red Heart", collages of custom-made
paper, silk, embossed calligraphy, and advertisements; "Cow and
Trees", with a lyricism, calmness, and rich but subdued colors
that reveal affinities with Chinese painting; and "Yi" (one), a
horizontal stroke made by a bar of lead imbedded in beeswax.
</P>
<P>
These reflections on style were meant as a testimony to the
extraordinary impact of Chinese art on American creativity,
according to the ambassador and his wife.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuehai, a Chinese oil painter who was among the dozens of
people to visit the show this evening, said that, if one oil
painting "Statuette and Vase" (1925) reflects China as mere symbol
in Chinese figurines and ceramics, a 1982 work, "7 Characters",
can suggest that the painter has a fairly good understanding of
Chinese art and philosophy.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Says to Help Indonesia According to Ability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will continue to
help Indonesia to tide over the current economic turmoil but will
only do so within the limits of its own ability, Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hsien Loong, who is also chairman of the Monetary Authority
of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de facto central bank, said
Singapore is also helping to work on a Trade Guarantee Scheme for
Indonesia imports.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was put forward because major banks no longer
provide trade financing for Indonesian firms, making it almost
impossible for them to import goods and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The proposed guarantee scheme is to give confidence to foreign
banks to accept letters of credit issued by Indonesian banks.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the central banks of several countries will
jointly counter-guarantee the one made by Bank Indonesia, but this
will only cover sovereign risks, Lee told parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said the scheme will assure the other central banks that
Bank Indonesia will honor its own guarantee and the scheme will
operate for a maximum of two years.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the two billion U.S. dollars that the MAS will pledge
towards the scheme will be from the five billion U.S. dollars
Singapore promised earlier.
</P>
<P>
He assured the parliament that though the loan still stands, it
is structured like a back-up credit to supplement the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) program.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that Singapore is still in discussion with
other countries about the scheme, which will proceed only when six
to 12 countries agree to participate. The IMF and the World Bank
will have to support the scheme.

<HEADLINE> Russian Communists Demand Urgent Roundtable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leaders
Thursday demanded a roundtable be held urgently to discuss the
current situation in the country, according to the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, Leaders
of the Communist Party of Russia Gennady Zyuganov, Valentin
Kuptsov and Sergei Reshulsky complained that roundtable meetings
were not regular and that the issue of private savings devalued at
the start of economic reform had not been solved.
</P>
<P>
According to Zyuganov, the issues of energy and railroad
tariffs have not been discussed, supervisory boards at the ORT and
RTR television channels have not begun working, and the situation
with science and education has not improved.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov said he had demanded that a government commission be
created to investigate "massive gross violations of legislation"
and his colleagues had urged the prime minister to increase
efforts for a peaceful settlement of the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
The communist party leader said, "We welcome U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's coming trip to Iraq, but we believe
that Russia should hold more intensive consultations with China,
Germany, France and Arab countries, which might play a positive
role for a peaceful settlement of the situation with Iraq."

officials at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, to make its

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sets Up Panel on Retrenched Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- In anticipation of more
workers being laid off in the on-going economic turmoil in the
region, the Singapore government will set up a tripartite panel on
retrenched workers within the Ministry of Labor, the ministry said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor said the establishment of the panel came
in the light of several major retrenchments by electronics
companies in recent months and in anticipation that more workers
would be laid off as a result of uncertain economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The panel will advise the ministry on developing a network to
obtain timely information on impending retrenchment and to source
for job vacancies to facilitate the re-employment of those
retrenched.
</P>
<P>
The panel will also encourage employers contemplating
retrenchment to explore alternatives like redevelopment, shorter
work-week and adjustment of wage costs under the flexible wage
systems.
</P>
<P>
It will also help employers take advantage of training
incentives to upgrade workers' skills during the lull period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the panel will enable the Employment Service
Department and the Labor Relations Department of the ministry to
better assist the retrenched workers.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member panel comprises representatives from the Ministry
of Labor, the National Trade Union Congress, the Singapore
National Employers Federation, the Economic Development Board, and
the Singapore Productivity and Standards Board.

<HEADLINE> Two Corrupt Enterprise Executives Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Two state-owned enterprise
executives in northwest China's Gansu Province were expelled from
the Communist Party of China (CPC) and removed from their posts
for taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the Gansu Provincial CPC Commission
for discipline Inspection and the Provincial Department of
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary of Gansu Province is looking into their cases
further.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Bingchang, former general manager of the Lanzhou Iron and
Steel Group, was found to have taken more than 800,000 yuan in
cash and treasury bonds as bribes when he served as deputy general
manager of the Jiuquan Iron and Steel Group, up to 1995. He also
abused his power to get another 400,000 yuan in bribes and by
embezzling public funds at Lanzhou Iron and Steel Group.
</P>
<P>
Wei Guangqian, former director of the Liancheng Aluminum
Factory in Lanzhou, was found to have received 520,000 yuan,
130,000 Hong Kong dollars, and 11,000 US dollars in bribes.
</P>
<P>
He was also found to have taken bribes from partners when
the aluminum factory was forming a joint venture with a company in
Guangdong Province, a move that caused the aluminum factory's
property value to drop 279 million yuan, nearly 30 percent of the
factory's total assets.
</P>
<P>
In a circular issued recently, the CPC Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection and the Ministry of Inspection recently said
that the two corrupt officials abused their power and embezzled a
large amount of public funds, causing heavy economic losses and
seriously impairing relations between the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
The circular noted that discipline inspection departments at
all levels should intensify checks on state-run enterprise leaders
and investigate those who have abused their power for personal
gains or caused substantial loss of state properties by
dereliction of duty.

<HEADLINE> Returned Tibetans Celebrate Tibetan New Year In Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 returned Tibetans
and relatives of overseas Tibetan today attended a reception to
celebrate the Tibetan New Year, which falls on February 27.
</P>
<P>
They said they appreciate the great changes taking place in
Tibet and the ethnic minority and religious policies of the
Communist Party at a reception that was held by the United Front
Department of the CPC Tibetan Autonomous Region Committee.
</P>
<P>
"I have witnessed the great changes in my hometown under the
correct leadership of the CPC since I returned more than a decade
ago," said Yexe Doje, a member of the Lhasa Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and concluded,
"If it were not for the CPC, there would not be a prosperous new
Tibet."
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Tibet had a GDP of 7.35 billion yuan, up by ten
percent from the previous year, the executive vice chairman of the
autonomous region said, and went on to say that the reunification
of the motherland is the aspiration of the Chinese, and the Dalai
Lama is still trying to get independence while pretending to favor
negotiations, and attempting to internationalize the Tibet issue.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that returned Tibetans and relatives of
overseas Tibetans will better understand Chinese history and
socialism, and contribute to Tibet's stability, development and
social progress.

<HEADLINE> China Starting Global Mapping Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China will start some projects
this year as part of the International Steering Committee for
Global Mapping's world map plan, the State Bureau of Surveying and
Mapping said today.
</P>
<P>
It includes data on China's administrative divisions,
topography, vegetation, and updating information about cities and
their surrounding areas with satellite imaging, said Yang Kai, the
Bureau's deputy-director.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan to develop a global map started with a world
environment and development conference in 1995. It will provide
geographic data for studying global environmental problems,
reducing the damages of natural disasters, and maintaining
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The plan will have two moves, the first, various countries
using data to develop a preliminary global map by the year 2000,
and second, international organizations updating the map with
satellite imaging and data on land and vegetation, Yang
explained. Then it will be updated every five years.
</P>
<P>
The International Steering Committee for Global Mapping was
established in 1996 to get various countries to develop a global
map. According to its general plan, China, Japan, the Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, and some European countries will be responsible
for mapping Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
China's participation means expanding international exchanges
and contributing to the sustainable development of the global
economy, Yang said.

"The US military build-up in the Gulf means nothing less than
annihilating the Islam in the region," he said, warning that the
U.S. should refrain from what he called "its arrogance and show
of power business in the Gulf."
</P>
<P>
Other religious scholars who spoke at the gathering emphasized

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The production materials for
spring farming, such as fertilizers, pesticides and field
plastics, are in sufficient supply, according to the All-China
Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The cooperatives forecast the demand for chemical fertilizers
at 160 million tons this year, including 100 million tons for the
spring sowing.
</P>
<P>
Having analysing production and import of chemical fertilizers
and those in stock, the cooperatives said that the country is able
to provide farmers with 186 million tons of chemical fertilizers
this year, and of which, 106 million tons may be available during
the spring farming period.
</P>
<P>
Over-supply last year has kept the prices of these fertilizers
at the level at the end of last year, the cooperatives said,
adding that the current price stands at 1,099 yuan per ton, down
9.8 percent from the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials have called on departments involved to
prepare enough production materials and funds for the spring
farming.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa to Adopt New Strategy for Better Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda,
the three members of the East Africa Cooperation (EAC), will
adopt a joint strategy aimed at improving human settlement
conditions in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of the three states will meet together at the EAC
headquarters in Arusha, northern Tanzania, from Monday to
Wednesday to discuss and approve the new strategy, the U.N.
Center for Human Settlements (Habitat) based here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The strategy, known as the East African Community Development
Program, will tackle various challenges in human settlements
development in east Africa through participatory and
collaborative efforts at regional, national and community levels.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on encouraging people's direct involvement in
improving their living conditions and enlarging the capacities of
the local, national and regional institutions that serve them.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will also seek to gain more access to appropriate
technology in human settlements development, harmonizing relevant
policies of the three states and promoting their strategic
partnerships, effective coordination and collaboration in the
field.
</P>
<P>
The living standards, particularly of the poor segments of the
population in most parts of east Africa, have continued to
decline steadily in recent years, the Habitat claimed in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
While many rural residents live in temporary structures made
of mud, poles, and thatch, conditions are worse in the urban
areas, where millions live in overcrowded informal settlements
that lack basic services such as safe drinking water, sanitation
and health care, the agency lamented.
</P>
<P>
Around 60 delegates from the EAC member countries are also
expected to attend the Arusha meeting to seek agreements on the
strategic areas of cooperation and to reconfirm their countries'
commitment to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda.

<HEADLINE> Curb of Repeated Construction Urgent Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, the
country's leading newspaper, said today that duplicate
construction needs to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Construction needs to meet market demand, and excessive
construction will hinder quality and efficiency, a commentary of
the paper said, and that one gauge of rational construction is
supply and demand and another is utilization of capacity, with 80
percent or higher utilization being considered reasonable.
</P>
<P>
In China, the supply and demand of farm products, energy, raw
materials, and infrastructure are basically balanced, while there
is a surplus of many processed products like machinery,
electronics, and textiles, and a shortage of of better processed
products, it said.
</P>
<P>
In analyzing the reasons for the overlapping of construction, the
commentary said that some construction is actually the result of
market demand. This kind of construction can improve competitive
ability and meet consumer demand, but it may also run into
financial difficulties and cause enterprises to fail. The consumer
electronics goods surplus is one example.
</P>
<P>
Another kind of repetition is production based on outdated
polices that fail to follow the changing market situation. The
glut of textiles is an example.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that industries blindly seek to expand,
resulting in low-grade repetition. This problem can be found in
some machine manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Lack of mature reforms and relevant legislation is also to be
blamed. This has caused over-heated development of commerce,
foreign trade, finance and real estate.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that repetition in future can be stopped by
abiding by the rules of the socialist market economy and
tightening macro-economic regulation and controls.

<HEADLINE> China to Support Packaging Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China plans to invest ten
billion yuan in 1996-2000 to support the development of packaging
industry.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized packaging firms will be the major
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
Though the country's packaging industry maintained an average
of 29 percent growth rate in the past few year, 80 percent of its
products are of poor-quality, noted specialists.
</P>
<P>
So far, the country has more than 4,000 such firms, employing
500,000 people and producing 3,000 varieties of products. But the
country still suffers 14 billion yuan of loss a year because of poor
equipment and technology in 20 percent of the firms.
</P>
<P>
China's per capita consumption of packaging materials stands at
20 kg while that in some developed countrys at 210 kg, noted
specialists.
</P>
<P>
According to a national economic plan, the country will provide
100 billion yuan to 200 billion yuan-worth equipment for food
processing and packaging industry in the next few years, which will
offer great opportunities for packaging firms.
</P>
<P>
Specialists also suggested the industry pays more attention to
develop low-cost and high-efficient packaging and recycling of
waste packages.

governors from the Philippine opposition would defect to the
ruling Lakas-NUCD party, the Philippine News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>

The agency quoted Lakas presidential candidate, House Speaker
Jose de Venecia, as saying that the defection would further weaken
the divided opposition and ensure the ruling party's "sweeping
victory in the coming elections."
</P>

De Venecia said the opposition congressmen and governors have
decided to bolt from their respective parties and join Lakas in
recognition of the achievements gained by the administration of by

However, the speaker refused to identify the new Lakas
recruits, saying party officials would make an official
announcement in due time.
</P>
<P>
"This is a big boost to our campaign. We are getting the
support of respected leaders of the opposition, not disgruntled
politicians who switch parties because they were not given slots
in the campaign ticket," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also shrugged off reports that at least 24 members of the
House of Representatives are defecting to the opposition, saying
an overwhelming majority of the congressmen from the ruling party
have pledged to support the Lakas-NUCD ticket.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said the ruling party has the support of about 90
percent of congressmen, governors, municipal mayors, provincial
board members and municipal councilors.

<HEADLINE> Plan to Be Drafted to Ban Export of Hazardous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from various
governments are to work out a worldwide export ban next week of
hazardous wastes from developed countries to developing ones, the
Nairobi-based U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting next Monday in Kuching, Malaysia, under the auspices
of the Basel Convention, governmental ministers will decide what
kind of wastes to be banned internationally, said UNEP Executive
Director Klaus Topfer.
</P>
<P>
Two lists of wastes developed by the Basel Convention's
Technical Working Group will be presented at the one-week
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The first "hazardous waste" list would ban the export of
wastes containing arsenic, lead, mercury, asbestos, and dozens of
other chemicals and substances.
</P>
<P>
The second "non-hazardous" list includes wastes that can be
safely recycled or re-used and will normally not be covered by
the ban treaty. This includes scrap iron, steel or copper,
certain electronic assemblies, non-hazardous chemical catalysts,
and many ceramics, solid plastics and paper and textile wastes.
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of these lists will help clarify the rules of
the game and enable governments to satisfy both environmental and
economic concerns," said Topfer.
</P>
<P>
"Such global environmental cooperation is critical at this
time in which we witness the globalization of the economy, of
markets, and of products," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly specifying which wastes are covered by the
Convention, and which are not, will enable countries to make more
informed economic decisions," noted the U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
Annually the Earth sees a production of 400 million tons of
wastes hazardous to people or the environment because they are
toxic, poisonous, explosive, corrosive, flammable, or infectious.
</P>
<P>
The Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary
Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal was adopted in
March 1989 after a series of notorious "toxic cargoes" from
industrialized nations were dumped in developing and eastern
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The convention, taking effect in May 1992, strictly regulates
the trans-boundary movements of such wastes and provides
obligations to its members to ensure that such wastes are managed
and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner.

<HEADLINE> Brunei Supports Use of Regional Currencies in Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Brunei has agreed to the
proposal to use regional currencies in trade among ASEAN member
countries, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah agreed to the
proposal during a meeting with him in Bandar Seri Begawan, capital
of Brunei, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"During my visit, I briefed the sultan on my trips to Thailand,
the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia and we made a general
assessment of the economic situation and the type of cooperation
we proposed among ASEAN countries," Mahathir, who returned from
Brunei to Sabah, east Malaysia earlier Thursday, told at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
On the region's protracted currency depreciation problem,
Mahathir said ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
is now under pressure.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the pressure from outside, it's difficult for us.
If left to ourselves, we can manage our economy but every time we
do something, they apply pressure," Mahathir was quoted as saying
by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
On international concern over Indonesia's proposal for a
currency board system, Mahathir said: "Maybe they are concerned
but the concern is made worse by opinions which will only cause
the rupiah to go down."
</P>
<P>
"We feel that Indonesia is an independent country. They
(Indonesia) have accepted all the conditions (of the International
Monetary Fund) already. Some things must be left for them to
decide but if everything is being forced and if it is successful,
it's alright but if not successful, the so-called 'help' has not
helped Indonesia at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is reportedly considering adopting a currency board
system that pegs the rupiah to the U.S. dollar at a fixed rate to
help pull the country out of its current economic slump. But the
IMF opposed such a system and warned that the 40-billion-dollars
bailout it had extended to the country could be in jeopardy if the
Indonesian government went ahead with the scheme.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Improvement in Quality of Engineering Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved much in
improving the quality of various engineering and housing projects,
thanks to the effective supervision and monitoring system
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of construction Tan Qinglian told Xinhua today
that large groups of China's key projects and large urban public
facilities as well as nearly one billion sq m of newly-built
housing projects have been up to the advanced world standard or
have met the State targets in terms of construction quality.
</P>
<P>
A national survey on construction quality shows that the
qualification rate of the country's engineering and housing
projects has increased by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, breakthroughs have been made in planning, designing
and construction of the country's engineering and housing projects
and big headway was made in protecting environment and in
completing the infrastructural facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior official, more than 90 percent of
China's cities and counties have set up engineering quality
supervision stations, which cover 88 percent of the country's
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country has practised the engineering
monitoring system, establishing a total of 1,500 construction
monitoring institutes, which handled or prevented some 60,000
hidden construction hazards and troubles in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress, many loopholes still exist, particularly
in the construction of residential housing, the vice-minister
said, adding that much still needs to be done in this respect.

<HEADLINE> China (Shenyang)-Italy Trade Fair Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The China (Shenyang)-Italy
economic and Trade Fair, the first non-governmental trade fair in
Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, was
inaugurated here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local enterprises provided Italian investors with 22 projects
in the fields of textile, machinery, electronics and garment
processing during the four-day fair.
</P>
<P>
This was a new experiment carried out by the local government
to encourage the non-public sector to conduct economic cooperation
with other countries and regions, said Zhang Shichun, an official
of the Shenyang Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Committee.
</P>
<P>
The city will continue to back such trade fairs to attract
foreign investment, which are sponsored by non-governmental or
individual firms in future, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Since China opened up to the outside world, more than 40
countries and regions have built Sino-overseas joint venture
businesses in Shenyang. But the majority of overseas investors
came from the Southeast Asia, Japan and the United States. Only
11 italian-funded businesses were built in Shenyang, bringing in a
direct investment of 6.7 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> (Round-up) Germany Takes Two Golds, But Austrian and DutchHave the Day (u pdated with short track skating) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Germany jumped to take two
gold medals at the 18th Olympic Winter Games on Thursday, but it was
Austrian skiier Hermann Maier and Dutch skater Marianne Timmer who
stle the limelight of the day.
</P>
<P>
German women biathletes and skiier displayed their prowess on snow
slopes, winning the women's biathlon 4x7.5km relay and the men's
slalom race respectively.
</P>
<P>
After Hilde Gerg won the slalom for Germany, the German foursome
biathletes Ursula Disl, Martina Zellner, Katrin Apel and Petra Behle
won the relay, making a revenge over their loss to Russian rivals at
the last winter Olympics in Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
Maier, nicknamed as Herminator, won the men's giant slalom race,
the second gold medal for the iron-will skiier in the games after a
terrible crash in the downhill event.
</P>
<P>
Timmer, gold medalist in the women's 1,500 meter speed skating on
Monday, continued her bulleting speed on the ice rink Thursday
afternoon, winning the 1,000m sprint.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which lost to Russia in Lillehammer, covered the 4x7.5km
relay with a total of one hour 40 minutes and 13.6 seconds, beating
Russia to the second place by 11.6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Norway finished third with a further 23.7 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Gerg outskiied world champion Deborah Compagnoni of Italy in the
women's slalom, bringing Germany their third women's Alpine crown in
Nagano following Katja Seizinger's victories in the downhill and
combined.
</P>
<P>
Gerg, who was 0.60 second behind Compagnoni after the first run,
clocked 46.51 in the second round to win the gold with an aggregate
time of one minute 32.40 seconds, a mere 0.06 second faster than the
Italian two-time Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
Compagnoni, winner of the giant slalom at the 1994 Lillehammer
Games and the super-G event at Albertville in 1992, settled for the
silver medal after an accident-filled second run in which seven of the
first 10 skiiers tumbled out of competition.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to Zali Steggall with 1:32.67, the first
Australian ever to win an Olympic medal in Alpine skiing.
</P>
<P>
Maier pulled off an Olympic golden double with victory in men's
giant slalom, which saw an early downfall of skiing legend Alberto
Tomba of Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian, who suffered a bad crash in the downhill race last
Friday, proved himself the comeback king of the hill with his second
gold medal in four days.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Austrian, who won the men's super-G title on Monday
on the Happo'one slope which had been his undoing in the donnhill,
prevailed in similarly swashbuckling style in the giant slalom on
Mount Higashidate.
</P>
<P>
Maier, in a class of his own in the World Cup this season, pounded
out the fastest times in both runs of the giant slalom to win by 0.85
seconds from fellow-Austrian Stefan Eberharter with a two-leg
aggregate time of two minutes 38.51 seconds on the 1,487-meter course.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's Michael von Gruenigen prevented an Austrian medal
sweep, snatching the bronze by just 0.02 seconds from Hans Knauss,
joint silver medallist behind Maier in the super
</P>
<P>
But the race under blue sky was almost a nightmare for Tomba, who
smashed his dream to win third Olympic giant slalom gold after
crashing out early in the first run. In 1988 Calgary Games and 1992
Albertville Olympics, Tomba stormed to victories in the races.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on the ice rink, Marianne Timmer, surprising winner in
the women's 1,500m speed skating, triumphed to take her second gold in
the games, outskating pre-race favourite world record holder Christie
Witty of the United States in M-Wave. Timmer was clocked an Olympic
record time of one minute and 16.51 seconds for the gold, the fifth
one for the Netherlands in the sport.
</P>
<P>
Witty struggled hard on the ice, but could only manage to take the
silver with 0.28 seconds behind Timmer.
</P>
<P>
"I put all out on the line, and in the last curve, I struggled a
bit," Witty said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian skater Catriona Lemay-Doan, winner in the 500m distance,
was third at 1:17.37.
</P>
<P>
Germany's strongest skater Franziska Schenk, also a medal
contender, lost her balances in the second curve and crashed against
the pad of the rink. She did not finish the race.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 500m short track speed skating, Canadians displayed
a brilliant technique in the final, beating Chinese rivals to win the
gold.
</P>
<P>
Annie Perreault claimed the crown after her teammate world record
holder Isabelle Charest slipped and tripped pace leader China's Wang
Chunlun in the final curve. Charest was disqualified and Wang, who
was angered by the case, did not finish the race.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang was second and South Korea's Chun Lee-kyung, who raced in
final B, got the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Outside the competition arena, the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) announced that two athletes have been tested positive for
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati, who was disqualified for
being tested positive for marijuana, was reinstated by the Court of
Arbitration for Sports earlier in the games. The IOC did not give any
details on the second case.
</P>
<P>
After 13 day competitions, Germany leads the gold medal standings
with nine golds, Russia is second at eight and Norway third at seven.

<P>
SINGAPORE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong disclosed on Thursday that with his agreement, Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew presently sits on the international advisory
boards of five organizations.
</P>
<P>
Lee also receives 55,000 US dollars each year as honorarium
from three of the boards, Singapore television reported, adding
that he donates the money to charity.
</P>
<P>
It said Prime Minister Goh disclosed this at Thursday's
Parliament session in reply to a written question by
Non-Constituency-Member-Of-Parliament (NCMP) J.B. Jeyaretnam, who
is leader of the opposition Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
Goh reportedly said that membership of these Boards gives the
Senior Minister useful insights into the world economy in his
capacity as chairman of the Government of Singapore Investment
Corporation (GIC).
</P>
<P>
The five organizations are: Stanford University Institute for
International Studies; Institute for International Economics,
Washington DC; JP Morgan International Council; Total
International Advisory Board; and Daimler Benz International
Advisory Board.

<HEADLINE> Drug Abuse, Trafficking Continue to Rise in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Drug abuse and trafficking
continue to rise in Africa in an alleged climate of "tolerance,"
the U.N. International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite eradication efforts and significant seizures in some
African states, the continent remains a major supplier of
cannabis and cannabis resin to rapidly-growing domestic illicit
markets, as well as to Europe and North America, INCB said.
</P>
<P>
Some African seaports and airports have become major transit
centers for cocaine from South America destined for Europe, and
for heroin from Asia to Europe and North America, the INCB noted
in its annual report which is to be officially published next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There is an apparent increase in tolerance of the illicit drug
culture across Africa, as in recent years, drug use and abuse in
certain circles has gained acceptability, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Once again, drug abuse, appears to be almost normal, even
fashionable in Africa, especially in the big cities, said the
agency, giving evidents in the pop music, fashion, entertainment
industries, media and many other areas in society.

<HEADLINE> Degrading Freshwater Resources May Spark "Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Environment Program
(UNEP) warned Thursday that deteriorating freshwater shortages
around the world may cause "water wars" if there is a lack of
strong national policies and global cooperation countering
against the trend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the body announced that environment ministers and
high-level officials from around the world have been summoned to
attend a meeting at its headquarters here in the Kenyan capital
from March 2 to 4 to discuss, among others, the issue of
freshwater shortages.
</P>
<P>
"The potential for conflict or `water wars' is great, and this
issue needs urgent political attention," UNEP chief Klaus Topfer
noted, adding that "in some cases, competition for water may lead
to conflicts over trans-boundary resources."
</P>
<P>
This is partly because there are few international agreements
to provide for the sustainable management and use of water
resources contained in about 300 shared international river
basins around the world, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, "it is estimated that 25,000 people die
each day as a result of poor water quality. Indeed, waterborne
diseases still represent the single largest cause of human
sickness and death worldwide."
</P>
<P>
Some 1.7 billion people, more than one-third of the world's
total population, are without safe water supply and an estimated
one-quarter of the Earth will suffer from chronic water shortages
at the beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
"The proportion of people without access to adequate supplies
of clean, safe freshwater is greater in Africa than anywhere else
in the world", said Topfer. Africa has 19 out of the 25 states in
the world which have the highest percentage of populations
without access to safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Global priorities on the issue should be put on the more
effective use of water, the equitable distribution of water among
countries that share international river-basins, the prevention
from water pollution and the impact of major dams and diversion
projects, he urged.
</P>
<P>
An adequate supply of safe, clean water is the most important
precondition for sustaining human life, for maintaining
ecosystems that support all life, and for achieving sustainable
development, he stressed.

ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), a
major opposition party in Pakistan, Thursday launched a
country-wide campaign against corruption.
</P>
<P>
The JI, regarded as the third largest political force after
Pakistan People's Party and the ruling Muslim League (N), Thursday

hundreds of people.
</P>

The campaign is to "create awareness among the masses of the

Ahmed, who led Thursday's caravan from Rawalpindi near Islamabad,
to Lahore, capital of Pakistan's largest Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue the caravan in the next three months to
highlight this problem to the people," Qazi told reporters.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 of the folks
in Guang'an County, Sichuan Province, Deng Xiaoping's hometown,
gathered at his former residence to remember him today, on the
first anniversary of his death.
</P>
<P>
Tang Lunhui arrived with a board bearing the words "Comrade
Deng Xiaoping's Former Residence" carved in the style of President
Jiang Zemin's handwriting.
</P>
<P>
"It's the most valuable board I've ever made," said Tang, a
locally known woodcarver in Guang'an County, where Deng was born
in August 1904.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, Tang and a group of students gazed at the
board, which was placed in the hall of the residence. They then
visited all the rooms, which are maintained in their original
state and decorated with pictures of Deng in his youth.
</P>
<P>
They also planted several rows of saplings in the courtyard of
Deng's former residence, which is now a national patriotic
education base.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China has been holding
various activities to commemorate its two great leaders, Zhou
Enlai and Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 100th birth anniversary of Zhou Enlai, the
first premier of the People's Republic of China. When he died 22
years ago, Beijing's Chang'an Avenue and Tian'anmen Square were a
sea of tears.
</P>
<P>
This month, both the Chinese capital and Zhou's native province
of Jiangsu are holding seminars and photo exhibitions in his
honor. Beijing TV is also running a series, "Zhou Enlai in the
past 100 Years". According to a newspaper survey, the main reason
the people of Beijing are interested in the series is that they
esteem him.
</P>
<P>
The survey in Beijing shows that what impressed audiences most
was Zhou's care for the common people, and 72 percent of the
people questioned said that tears came to their eyes when they
watched the program.
</P>
<P>
Next month, the series will be shown on China Central
Television Station during prime time.
</P>
<P>
Today is the first anniversary of the death of Deng Xiaoping,
who was regarded as the "chief architect of China's reforms and
opening-up". People attended various commemorative activities,
even in the early morning sleet, to show their respect for him.

<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
ordered a temporary ban on sending Filipino overseas workers to
the Middle East in anticipation of a possible outbreak of armed
hostilities in the Gulf area.
</P>
<P>
Tension in the Middle East could adversely affect some 600,000
Filipino workers there who would be displaced as many of them had
been during the 1991 Gulf War, the Philippine News Agency said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has placed on "full alert" all its
embassies and consular offices in the Gulf area which are prepared
to evacuate Filipino workers in danger zones should fighting break
out.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Leonides Caday said Thursday
that other agencies are also under orders for immediate
mobilization in case evacuation become necessary.
</P>
<P>
Caday said they had raised alert level one in the Gulf with
team leaders who have been designated to implement systematic
evacuation when ordered. The alert, he said, comes in four levels
with Level four representing actual evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Emergency evacuation of Filipinos in danger zones will consist
primarily of airlifting them to safer grounds in the neighboring
Middle East countries by the Philippine Air Force, which did the
same thing in 1991, he said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Expresses Reservation over Outcome of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's permanent representative
to the United Nations Nabil el Arabi Thursday expressed his
reservation over the outcome of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's upcoming visit to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted the official as
saying that progress was made regarding the proposed weapons
inspection formula for Iraqi suspected sites Annan would take with
him to Iraq on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has accepted that Annan would appoint political
observers in the U.N. weapons inspection teams, he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, no one can fully guarantee the success or the failure
of Annan's visit," Arabi added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian diplomat said he has spoken to Annan, who himself
"does not know whether his mission would succeed or fail."
</P>
<P>
Annan, with the backing of the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council, leaves New York for Paris on Thursday and
will arrive in Baghdad on Friday, the MENA said.
</P>
<P>
"It (the visit) will be a very short one. I expect Annan to
return to New York by Monday or Tuesday," Arabi said, "because
obviously the U.S. has taken all necessary measures."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's trip to Baghdad is widely believed as the last
chance to solve the Iraq-U.N. crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have threatened to launch military strike
on Iraq if diplomacy fails to end the current standoff between
Iraq and the U.N. over weapons inspection.

<HEADLINE> Young Scholars Win Social Sciences Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China today granted awards to
young scholars who have made outstanding achievements in social
science research.
</P>
<P>
A total of 99 books and theses won Hu Shen Awards and
the National Awards for Outstanding Achievements, the most famous
awards for young social science scholars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Most prizes went to pragmatic research topics, particularly
economics and sociology, which are very helpful to the country's
moderization drive.
</P>
<P>
They deal with subjects like finance, the reform of
state-enterprises, rural labor, the Hong Kong issue, a market
economy, laws and foreign situations.
</P>
<P>
Such a trend in the academic community shows that social
sciences are becoming an engine pushing the reform and opening up
as natural sciences, observers say.
</P>
<P>
Some awards also went to the research into the origin of Chinese
civilization, the study of the culture of bamboo, and the study of
Confucius.
</P>
<P>
The study of Deng Xiaoping Theory also received a prize,
according to the sponsors at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, sent a
letter of congratulations to the award ceremony to congratulate
the winners. Head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central
Committee Ding Guangen and State Councilor Li Tieying also sent
letters of congratulations to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Giving awards to young scholars is regarded as a move to
encourage more talented people to do research work, as the country
is facing a shortage of scholars.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Bank Earnings Expected to Decline in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's six major banks
are expected to see their earnings in the aggregate decline by
about 30 percent in 1997 as a result of exceptional provisions for
regional risk, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asked to give the latest update on loans extended by local and
foreign financial institutions to regional economies, especially
Indonesia, Lee told parliament that as of December 31, 1997, the
six local banking groups had loans and investments amounting to
37.2 billion Singapore dollars (22.68 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sum accounted for 16 percent of their total assets in
Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"Two-thirds of this exposure was in Malaysia, where Singapore
banks have long established operations. Their exposure to
Indonesia was 5.4 billion Singapore dollars (3.29 billion
dollars), or 2.3 percent of their total assets," said the deputy
prime minister, who is now also head of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS), the de facto central bank.
</P>
<P>
The six major banks are the United Overseas Bank (UOB),
Overseas Union Bank (OUB), the Development Bank of Singapore
(DBS), the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), the Keppel
Bank, and the Tat Lee Bank. The last two had announced their
merger in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the total classified loans of the six local banking
groups to these five countries accounted for 5.7 percent of their
loans to these countries.
</P>
<P>
The total classified loans of the local banks, including both
local and overseas loans, were 2.6 percent of their total loan
portfolios. As a percentage of their total global assets, this was
2.3 percent. "These figures remain well within comfortable
limits," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All six banks are financially sound. They have strong capital
positions, exceeding 12 percent of their risk-weighted assets,
higher than most banks in other countries. They also sit on
substantial reserves," he added.

<HEADLINE> Macao Newspapers Mark Deng Death Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Some newspapers here Thursday
carried articles commemorating the first anniversary of the death
of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary entitled "Forever Commemorate Deng Xiaoping
and Learn From Deng Xiaoping," the Macao Daily News described the
late Chinese leader, who died on February 19, 1997, as a great man
whose great achievements outlive his time.
</P>
<P>
He will continue to be respected and learned from by the
Chinese people, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said Deng's theory has been proved as the only
correct one to guide China in the course of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics and the greatest guarantee for
China's prosperity and reunification.
</P>
<P>
"Deng enjoyed great prestige both at home and abroad and will
be missed, respected and learned from by the Chinese people," said
the commentary.
</P>
<P>
It attributed to Deng Xiaoping's theory Hong Kong's smooth
return to the motherland, the 21st-century blueprint worked out at
 the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
the successful visit by President Jiang Zemin to the United
States last year and other "glorious achievements" made in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Those remarkable accomplishments are due to the third
generation of China's leadership who has handled domestic and
international affairs by following Deng Xiaoping's theory," it
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commentary hailed Deng's concept of "one
country, two systems" as "scientific," saying it has been proved
by Hong Kong's smooth handover and the subsequent prosperity and
stability there.
</P>
<P>
"The correctness of the concept will be further proved by the
prosperity that will follow Macao's handover (in 1999)," the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newspaper Correio Macaense Daily said in a
separate commentary that the best way to commemorate Deng Xiaoping
today is to implement the Basic Law of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The best action to commemorate Deng Xiaoping is to fully
implement the basic law so that the goal of 'Macao people
governing Macao' and a 'high degree of autonomy' will be
achieved and Macao's prosperity and stability maintained," it
said. "That will also offer a good example for Taiwan in the
course of China's reunification."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Papers Applaud SAR's First Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- All major Hong Kong
newspapers Thursday expressed support to the Special
Administrative Region (SAR)'s first Budget, which was unveiled
Wednesday by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily commented that the first Financial
Budget drawn up independently by the SAR, when unfolded yesterday,
gained positive reaction from all walks of life, different parties
and the media community. The Chinese daily said that this is "a
Budget to boost people's confidence", which proposed targeted
measures to relieve the burdens on people and to improve Hong
Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
Express News said in its editorial that the Budget did a good
job in restoring confidence in Hong Kong's economy. The Financial
Secretary predicted an exceptionally high level of fiscal surplus
totaling 77 billion HK dollars (9.9 billion U.S. dollars) for
1997-98, demonstrating the SAR's resolve and strength to maintain
the linked exchange rate, said the Chinese paper.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po said that the Budget reflected Hong Kong people's
wisdom for governing Hong Kong and the administration's vision in
pursuing sustained, long-term economic growth. The Budget also is
also designed to give relief to the people in the time of
economic uncertainty, and reduce tax burdens on businesses. "It is
a pragmatic and far-sighted Budget," said the Chinese paper.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao's commentary said that the SAR's first Budget is
widely welcomed, Ming Pao said that "it is a good Budget and
deserves support", and Hong Kong Daily News said "it is a Budget
well received by taxpayers, especially the middle class".
</P>
<P>
South China Morning Post said in its editorial Thursday that
the Budget was a well balanced one. The English paper said, "in
times of turbulence, such solid reserves help to underline the
distinction between free-market Hong Kong and the economies in
trouble elsewhere in Asia."
</P>
<P>
Another English daily Hong Kong Standard carried a front-paged
editorial, saying that the budget has gladdened many a
middle-income heart with lower taxes, lower rates and mortgage
relief. Noting that the tax cuts proposed by the Financial
Secretary will benefit 99 percent of taxpayers, the paper
commented: "That's something no financial secretary in the rest of
 Asia can afford to do this year, perhaps not even in the next."
The paper concluded that a positive, well-received Budget would
have a strong psychological impact.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A curfew in some areas of
Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan states remained in force Thursday as
the situation there was still tense.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said Ferozabad city in Uttar Pradesh is
still under curfew and security forces kept vigil at the Imambara
locality where members of two communities exchanged fire
Wednesday, wounding at least 10 people, three of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
Forty people have been taken into custody in connection with
Wednesday's clash which followed an altercation between two bangle
dealers. Seven bangle shops were set on fire.
</P>
<P>
The indefinite curfew, which was imposed in two areas of Ajmer
town in Rajasthan State after group clashes on Tuesday, remained
in force for the third day Thursday. The trouble started over a
dispute on photographing some pilgrims. Violent groups resorted to
stone-pelting and someone reportedly opened fire from the mob.
They also set afire more than a dozen shops.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times said in an editorial entitled "a Tense
Poll" Thursday, "One reason for the prevailing tension is perhaps
the closeness of the contests. As a result, the usual appeals on
the basis of caste and community may have become even more
intense."

<HEADLINE> HK Business Community Welcomes First SAR Budget (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Leaders and organizations
from such sectors as industry, finance, trade, tourism and
service in Hong Kong welcomed the Budget speech delivered by
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Henry Tang, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries,
described the Budget, the first of its kind since the Special
Administrative Region was established last July, as "a good and
balanced" one which demonstrated continuing prudent financial
management.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that our calls for a reduction in profits tax
have been heeded," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also welcomed the proposal to allow an immediate 100 percent
write-off for new expenditure on plant and machinery specifically
related to manufacturing and computer hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
"This will help strengthen Hong Kong's position as a commercial
center," he stated.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong gave a good response to the
government's decision to reduce stamp duty on stock transactions.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the belief that this is a step in the right
direction and hoped that stamp duty will be abolished eventually
as the tax constitutes a major part of the transaction cost of
stock trading in Hong Kong and affects the competitiveness of the
market.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Neoh, chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission
(SFC), said he was pleased with the positive messages in the
speech and pledged that the SFC will work with the government in
reviewing the regulatory system in the wake of recent market
volatility.
</P>
<P>
He said the reduction in stamp duty on stock transactions from
0.3 percent to 0.25 percent would further enhance the
competitiveness of the Hong Kong securities market.

<HEADLINE> HK Business Community Welcomes First SAR Budget (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Victor Fung Kwok-king, chairman of the Trade Development
Council, said that through a package of very specific budgetary
measures, the Financial Secretary has sent a strong message to the
international business community that Hong Kong is determined to
remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident the overall budget strategy will help
to sustain the momentum of the SAR's economic growth through this
challenging period.
</P>
<P>
Fung said that the Financial Secretary had rightly pinpointed
two key factors for Hong Kong's continued trade growth -- the
expansion and stability of the Chinese mainland economy and the
strength of the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
"These are markets where the TDC is particularly active with
its promotions this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Tourist Association also welcomed the measures
proposed by the Tsang in his Budget speech.
</P>
<P>
The measures include the cutting of the airport departure tax
from 100 HK dollars (12.8 U.S. dollars) to 50 HK dollars (6.4 U.S.
dollars) when the new airport opens, the reduction of the hotel
room tax from 5 percent to 3 percent, and the bringing down of the
Marine Ferry Terminal Passenger Fee from 25 HK dollars (3.2 U.S.
dollars) to 18 HK dollars (2.3 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"All these measures will give the community new confidence in
the future of tourism," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce believed that the
first SAR Budget provides a sound base for the economic recovery
of Hong Kong without abandoning its long history of fiscal
prudence.
</P>
<P>
The Budget also shows that Hong Kong has a very healthy economy
attractive for investment and has a very strong ability to benefit
its people, it said.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Ko, chairman of the Hong Kong Coalition of Service
Industries, also warmly welcomed the Budget, saying: "the
Financial Secretary has achieved the difficult task of balancing
the need for prudence on the one hand, and answering the call of
the community for financial relief on the other."
</P>
<P>
"The reduction in hotel tax and airport tax will together
inject a healthy dose to our troubled tourism sector," he said.

Chinese Academy of Social Sciences hosted a seminar today to
commemorate senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who passed away on
February 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
They recalled Deng's great concern for the academy and his
great attention to the policy respecting intellectuals. "We were
happy to work under Deng's leadership," said Shan Tianlun, a
senior researcher.

Deng often met with foreign experts visiting the academy, and
fully supported the installation of facilities in the academy,

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Hails Annan's Visit as New Hope for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan's scheduled visit to Baghdad Friday revives "all hopes"
for averting a military confrontation, Arab League chief Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League fully supports the implementation of
U.N. resolutions, a peaceful settlement to the Iraqi crisis and
the prevention of force that will be a real regional disaster,"
he was quoted by the Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief, who met with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in
Baghdad recently in a bid to soften the Iraqi stance, said the
Iraqi leader was in fact seeking a diplomatic solution to the
standoff with the United States over U.N. arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
"He should receive all the help and support to reach a peaceful
settlement and avert a military confrontation," Abdel-Meguid
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the situation now is totally different from the
circumstances that evoked the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led multinational forces drove Iraq out from its
neighboring state Kuwait in 1991. The Iraqis have since been
living under U.N.-imposed sanctions and succumbed to seven years
of U.N. arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The recent crisis between the U.N. and Iraq was ignited in
November over Baghdad's refusal to let the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping Iraqi weapons of mass destruction
into its presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has completed an extensive naval, air and troops
buildup in the Gulf in preparation for a strike if Baghdad
continues to bar "presidential sites" to U.N. arms inspectors, a
central dispute of the current crisis.

NANNING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou
Jiahua today urged efforts to tap the potential of inland river
navigation in a bid to improve the country's transportation
services.

Addressing a national meeting on inland water transport
construction that ended here today, Zou said inland water
transport is inexpensive and energy-efficient, and causes less

</P>

He said China enjoys advantages in developing inland water
transport as it has many rivers suitable for
navigation. "It is an indispensable part of the national transport
network and making better use of it will certainly help ease the
country's transport congestions."
</P>
<P>
The leader outlined strategies for developing inland
river transport, such as improving planning while
giving priority to major projects, gradually standardizing ships
and shipping operations, raising funds from all channels for

<HEADLINE> Budget Suggests HK Maintains Simple, Low Tax Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The largest-ever package of
tax concessions unveiled Wednesday in Hong Kong's 1998-1999 budget
sends a clear message that Hong Kong tries to maintain "a simple,
certain and competitive tax system" which appeals to investors, a
major tax services firm said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moderate tax cuts and incentives offered by the first Special
Administrative Region (SAR), combined with the curbing of the
threat of double taxation, show that "one country, two tax
systems" is being honestly implemented in Hong Kong, said Joseph
Wang, tax partner of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.
</P>
<P>
The budget, coming out at a time of economic uncertainty,
focused on two key issues: maintaining economic growth and
ensuring stability and confidence, he told a budget seminar hosted
by the firm.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the budget as "scoring very well, sprinkling salt and
pepper evenly at the main dish."
</P>
<P>
Another tax partner of the firm, Sarah McGrath, commented that
"everyone was asking for a lot, but not expecting much" from the
budget, but "now we have more than we anticipated."
</P>
<P>
The package of tax measures, costing the revenue 13.6 billion
HK dollars (1.7 billion U.S. dollars) in the financial year
starting April 1998, has positive effects on promoting Hong Kong
as a financial, service and trade center, McGrath noted.
</P>
<P>
The budget proposed, among others, a reduction of corporate
profits tax from 16.5 to 16 percent, the lowest level in the
region, immediate write-off for expenditure on manufacturing plant
 and machinery and computer hardware and software, reduction of
stamp duty levied on stock trading from 0.3 to 0.25 percent and
cuts in hotel accommodation tax and air passenger departure tax to
 help revive tourism.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the financial secretary's statement in the budget
that Hong Kong has reached an understanding with its biggest
trading partner, the Chinese mainland, for avoidance of double
taxation, McGrath said: "This will further boost cross-the-border
business."
</P>
<P>
Henry Tang Ying-yan, member of the SAR Executive Council and
chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, also addressed
the seminar.
</P>
<P>
He said he, like everyone else, is "generally pleased with and
fully supports" the budget, which has taken into account many
views from various sectors of the community and tried to create a
business-friendly environment.
</P>
<P>
The budget offered some relief to the industrial and commercial
sector which faces a tougher year in 1998, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
But it still can do better in boosting the manufacturing sector
and helping small and medium-sized enterprises which form the
backbone of Hong Kong's economy, the industrialist noted.

<P>
To make its threat real, FIFA has put Argentina on standby,

<P>
FIFA officials led by Jamaican Jack Warner had expressed
dissatisfaction with the state of available facilities for the
competition when they visited Nigeria last December.

Of all the six designated venues, only three stadium in Lagos,
Ibadan and Enugu were given pass marks, while the the other three
in Kano, Calabar and Kaduna failed to get FIFA's nod.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Nigerian government has constituted the Local
Organizing Committee and charged it with the task of getting all
the facilities ready for the championship.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Minister Calls New Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Media Minister
Mangala Samaraweera said Thursday that a new publication
regulation issued two days ago is aimed at protecting children
from being exposed to violent pictures.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulation, publication of any photographs depicting
a person killed or injured as a result of a bomb explosion or any
other acts, or any part of the body of any such person, will be
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation, called the Emergency Regulation of
Photographs, was issued by President Chandrika Kumaratunga on
Tuesday in accordance with the Public Security Ordinance of Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Any person who violates the provisions of the regulation will
be guilty of an offense, it says.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera told a news conference that the publication of such
kind of pictures has become part of the people's daily life during
the past one and half decades.
</P>
<P>
This kind of publications have very bad effects on young
children, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, exposure to such pictures in the long term could
create "a very violent generation in the future, even more violent
than they are now," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
There have been many complaints about the publication of such
photos. As a result, the president issued the regulation in order
to control the publication, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
In many Sri Lankan newspapers or on other electronic media,
pictures of dead bodies or body parts were often highlighted after
a bomb explosion or similar attacks occurred.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Stresses Importance of Civil Engineering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Thursday underscored the importance of civil engineers in
transforming the environment and helping shape the life of the
people through construction projects.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the opening ceremony of the 1998 Civil
Engineering International Conference on Asian Infrastructure,
Sustainable Development and Project Management here, Ramos said
the civil engineer's handiwork is special in that it is meant to
last for generations and continue having an impact on economic
and social life for decades.
</P>
<P>
But he reminded civil engineers that the misuse of natural
resources, haphazard planning and irresponsible construction can
lead to catastrophic repercussions such as floods, collapse of
structures, pollution, landslides and other disasters.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, the first international civil engineering
conference held in the Philippines, is jointly sponsored by the
American Society of Civil Engineers, Japan Society of Civil
Engineers and the Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers.
</P>
<P>
A civil engineer himself, Ramos urged his colleagues in the
profession to "keep improving our skills, to make better use of
our resources -- including our brains."
</P>
<P>
He also urged American and Japanese engineers to consider
forging strong international partnerships to meet the growing
clamor for state-of-the-art technology.

<HEADLINE> Volume of Goods Transported for Foreign Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China transported 400 million
tons of goods for foreign trade in 1997, an increase of 8.4
percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a breakdown, exports amounted to 185 million tons and
imports to 215 million tons, according to statistics released at a
conference on transportation of foreign trade goods held recently
in Beihai city in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
China's ports handled 10.76 million containers in
1997, and the amount of containers transported through the new
Eurasia Continental Bridge doubled that of 1996, reaching 30,016.
</P>
<P>
Freight transported by sea amounted to 350 million tons, with
exports at 160 million tons and imports at 190 million tons.
</P>
<P>
A total of 9.35 million tons of foreign trade goods were
forwarded through railways, and 640,000 tons by air.
</P>
<P>
Since China's comprehensive transportation capacity was
increaed in 1997, the contradiction between supply and
demand had been eased and the environment for transportation of
foreign trade goods relaxed, said Wei Xiaorong, director of
the Transportation Coordination Department of the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As the shipping capacity was over-sufficient in the
international market and charges for maritime transportation
declined greatly, the problem of ship delays in Chinese ports has
been basically solved, Wei said, adding that railway freight was
smooth in most parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the market had begun to play a major role in
adjusting the transportation and the role of administration has
been gradually weakened, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wei predicted that the deepening of the reform in China's
transportation, especially in the railway sector, will affect
the transport of foreign trade commodities this year, and
adjustment should be made to conform to the implementation of the
diversity strategy of China's foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Leprosy Patients to Enjoy Free Treatment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Leprosy patients in Nigeria are
expected to be treated freely soon as the government is planning
to do so with the Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT) recommended by the
World Health Organization (WHO) for curing the contagious
disease.
</P>
<P>
According to Health Minister Rear Admiral Jubrila Ayinla, the
project would be supported by the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), set
up by the government to specialize in funding social welfare and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The ministry and PTF were about to conclude arrangements to
facilitate the incorporation of the MDT into PTF's essential
drugs supply system, Ayinla said in the capital Abuja Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, PTF purchases essential drugs and provides
to all the 36 states across the country for distribution to
hospitals and health care organizations.
</P>
<P>
The measure is being adopted because most leprosy patients
could not afford the minimum cost of 80,000 Naira (about 1,000
U.S. Dollars) per patient for curing the disease, he said at a
press conference to mark the World Leprosy Day.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the number of registered leprosy
cases in the country reduced from 200,000 in 1989 to 14,000 last
year, which shows a prevalence rate of some 1.3 per 10,000
people.
</P>
<P>
This compares to the WHO eradication target of under one
leprosy case per 10,000 people as a measure of stoppage of
transmission.
</P>
<P>
Ayinla reaffirmed the country's commitment to the global
target of elimination of leprosy by the year 2000, using the MDT.
</P>
<P>
He however pointed out that the drugs available for the
treatment of leprosy for now were inadequate and were being
provided by donor agencies.

<HEADLINE> (Round-up) Germany Takes Two Golds, But Austrian and DutchHave the Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Germany jumped to take two
gold medals at the 18th Olympic Winter Games on Thursday, but it was
Austrian skiier Hermann Maier and Dutch skater Marianne Timmer who
stle the limelight of the day.
</P>
<P>
German women biathletes and skiier displayed their prowess on snow
slopes, winning the women's biathlon 4x7.5km relay and the men's
slalom race respectively.
</P>
<P>
After Hilde Gerg won the slalom for Germany, the German foursome
biathletes Ursula Disl, Martina Zellner, Katrin Apel and Petra Behle
won the relay, making a revenge over their loss to Russian rivals at
the last winter Olympics in Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
Maier, nicknamed as Herminator, won the men's giant slalom race,
the second gold medal for the iron-will skiier in the games after a
terrible crash in the downhill event.
</P>
<P>
Timmer, gold medalist in the women's 1,500 meter speed skating on
Monday, continued her bulleting speed on the ice rink Thursday
afternoon, winning the 1,000m sprint.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which lost to Russia in Lillehammer, covered the 4x7.5km
relay with a total of one hour 40 minutes and 13.6 seconds, beating
Russia to the second place by 11.6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Norway finished third with a further 23.7 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Gerg outskiied world champion Deborah Compagnoni of Italy in the
women's slalom, bringing Germany their third women's Alpine crown in
Nagano following Katja Seizinger's victories in the downhill and
combined.
</P>
<P>
Gerg, who was 0.60 second behind Compagnoni after the first run,
clocked 46.51 in the second round to win the gold with an aggregate
time of one minute 32.40 seconds, a mere 0.06 second faster than the
Italian two-time Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
Compagnoni, winner of the giant slalom at the 1994 Lillehammer
Games and the super-G event at Albertville in 1992, settled for the
silver medal after an accident-filled second run in which seven of
the first 10 skiiers tumbled out of competition.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to Zali Steggall with 1:32.67, the first
Australian ever to win an Olympic medal in Alpine skiing.
</P>
<P>
Maier pulled off an Olympic golden double with victory in men's
giant slalom, which saw an early downfall of skiing legend Alberto
Tomba of Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian, who suffered a bad crash in the downhill race last
Friday, proved himself the comeback king of the hill with his second
gold medal in four days.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Austrian, who won the men's super-G title on Monday
on the Happo'one slope which had been his undoing in the donnhill,
prevailed in similarly swashbuckling style in the giant slalom on
Mount Higashidate.
</P>
<P>
Maier, in a class of his own in the World Cup this season, pounded
out the fastest times in both runs of the giant slalom to win by 0.85
seconds from fellow-Austrian Stefan Eberharter with a two-leg
aggregate time of two minutes 38.51 seconds on the 1,487-meter course.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's Michael von Gruenigen prevented an Austrian medal
sweep, snatching the bronze by just 0.02 seconds from Hans Knauss,
joint silver medallist behind Maier in the super
</P>
<P>
But the race under blue sky was almost a nightmare for Tomba, who
smashed his dream to win third Olympic giant slalom gold after
crashing out early in the first run. In 1988 Calgary Games and 1992
Albertville Olympics, Tomba stormed to victories in the races.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on the ice rink, Marianne Timmer, surprising winner in
the women's 1,500m speed skating, triumphed to take her second gold in
the games, outskating pre-race favourite world record holder Christie
Witty of the United States in M-Wave. Timmer was clocked an Olympic
record time of one minute and 16.51 seconds for the gold, the fifth
one for the Netherlands in the sport.
</P>
<P>
Witty struggled hard on the ice, but could only manage to take the
silver with 0.28 seconds behind Timmer.
</P>
<P>
"I put all out on the line, and in the last curve, I struggled a
bit," Witty said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian skater Catriona Lemay-Doan, winner in the 500m distance,
was third at 1:17.37.
</P>
<P>
Germany's strongest skater Franziska Schenk, also a medal
contender, lost her balances in the second curve and crashed against
the pad of the rink. She did not finish the race.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's competitions featured five events. The women's 500m
short track speeed skating is scheduled in the evening. Skaters from
China, South Korea, Canada and the United States are medal contenders
in the event.
</P>
<P>
Germany now leads the gold medal standings with nien golds, Russia
is second at eight and Norway third at seven.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Congress to Pass Urgent Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Thursday made a final appeal to the congress to pass urgent
bills for enactment during the last two days of an extended
special session.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the last-ditch effort after learning that many
members of the congress, particularly those who are running for
re-election, have shunned the special session because they are
busy campaigning.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that during the last two days of the
special session, which is the last before the May 11 elections,
senators and representatives will pass the bills he certified as
urgent.
</P>
<P>
By attending the session, he stressed, they might win more
votes than campaigning here and there.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the special session includes the passage of the
Amnesty Proclamation Extension Bill, the Anti-Racketeering Bill,
the Police Reform Bill and the Anti-Smoking in Public Bill.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said there are many rebels who would like to avail
themselves of the amnesty but the government could do nothing at
this point if the Amnesty Proclamation Extension Bill is not
enacted during the special session.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Racketeering Bill is also important because it will
prevent racketeering and white-collar crimes.
</P>
<P>
Another equally important bill that needs to be enacted is the
Police Reform Bill to modernize the Philippine National Police to
enable it to effectively fight crime.
</P>
<P>
The most important bill Ramos would like the congress to pass
during the special session is the long-delayed Fishery Code from
which hundreds of thousands of Filipinos will benefit.

MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine ruling party
Thursday denied reports that the party's provincial campaign
activities have been temporarily halted due to alleged financial
squabbles.
</P>
<P>
"These reports are baseless. These are nothing but rumors
spread as part of a desperate attempt by other parties to bring

Abaya reiterated that the campaign sorties of Lakas in the

"so called financial squabbles" in the ruling party "are probably
being perceived."

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic clashes between
members of two Muslim groups continued in the southern province of
Cotabato, the Philippine News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a military spokesman as saying the crossfire
between members of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) started Monday night and was
still going on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were no reported casualties from both sides and no report
of mass evacuation by residents, said Rosque Garingalao, spokesman
of the army's Sixth Infantry Division.
</P>
<P>
Garingalao said MILF rebels stormed the villages of Naangan and
Simuni, both run by the MNLF under Commander Dimalao Ambel, thus
leading to the encounter.
</P>
<P>
He said the military are still looking into the probable motive
behind the attack but hinted, "This might be the result of a
continuous grudge between the two forces that still needs patching
up."
</P>
<P>
Garingalao said the military have already mobilized the 602nd
Brigade in the area to act as peacekeepers before the situation
gets worse.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, MILF guerrillas also attacked Dug-ong, another
MNLF-run village and left four MILF rebels killed and six others
wounded when members of the two groups were engaged in an ensuing
clash.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Steps up Efforts to End Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of a visit to
Baghdad by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iran has stepped up
its efforts to bring a peaceful end to the Iraq crisis by
coordinating with regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi Wednesday exchanged
views on the Iraq crisis with his Syrian, Omani and Yemeni
counterparts through telephone calls and held two rounds of talks
with his visiting Iraqi counterpart Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, the
Iranian official news agency IRNA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi and the foreign ministers from the four regional
countries discussed the possible diplomatic solution to the
standoff between Iraq and the U.N. over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
All the five foreign ministers stressed the need for stepping
up diplomatic endeavors to defuse a U.S. military attack on Iraq
by supporting Annan's visit to Baghdad, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf once again called on Iran, chairman of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), to continue its
efforts to avert a U.S. strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said that Iran would do all within
its power to prevent such a military action.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the implementation of the U.N. Security
Council resolutions needs no force, rather it is possible through
the cooperation between Iraq and the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa and Kharrazi expressed
optimism that a close and coordinated cooperation between Iraq
and the U.N. chief in the implementation of the U.N. Security
Council resolutions would be helpful in defusing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
They also said that a U.S. military strike on Iraq was
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani
announced that Yemen was fully prepared to closely cooperate and
coordinate with Iran in trying to find a peaceful solution to the
Iraq-U.N. standoff triggered off by Iraq's refusal to allow
U.N. inspectors unfettered access to all sites suspected of hiding
banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
As the United States and Britain are strengthening their
military buildup in the Persian Gulf to prepare a military strike
on Iraq, regional countries pinned their hope on the forthcoming
visit of the U.N. chief to Baghdad to avoid a military
confrontation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Annan has announced that he would go to Iraq on Friday to
continue his efforts to solve the crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister arrived here Wednesday morning in a
bid to seek more support from Tehran. This was his second visit to
Iran within a month. His last visit came in January.
</P>
<P>
Worrying about the impacts of the possible U.S. military
attack on Iraq, particularly the possible shift of power in
Baghdad and Iraq's disintegration, Tehran has strongly expressed
its opposition to any military attack, calling for diplomatic
efforts to end the Iraq crisis peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Get Investment in Platinum Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Anglo-American Corporation in
South Africa Wednesday announced plans to invest some 80 million
U.S. Dollars in a platinum mine in the midlands town of Shurugwi
in central Zimbabwe#,wnich is expected to create 1,400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Unki mine would be the second major platinum mine in
Zimbabwe after the Hartely platinum mine being developed by BHP
Minerals and Delta Gold from Australia in Chegutu, 80 kilometers
southwest of Harare.
</P>
<P>
Anglo Chief Executive Philip Baum said the mine would earn
Zimbabwe 880 million U.S. Dollars in foreign currency over its
life time.
</P>
<P>
The mine would have an initial life span of 20 years,
although Baum said extensive ore reserves surrounding it should
allow the span to be extended considerably as well as to increase
output.
</P>
<P>
The mine will produce 1.02 million tons of platinum ore per
annum when in full production it will be just below half the full
capacity of the Hartely mine, which is the second largest
platinum mine in the world.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility studies for the project which began in 1995 were
completed in October last year, while the construction of the
mine was expected to last two and half years.

<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The preparatory meeting for a

Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) here.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 40 countries and organizations
attended the opening ceremony of the preparatory senior officials
meeting presided over by Thai Industry Minister Somsak Thepsutin.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Somsak reviewed the economic turmoil in the
Southeast Asian region, saying the domino effect of local
currencies devaluation triggered by the sharp fall of the baht,
the Thai currency, should be attributed to the more and more
integrated world economy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he called for increased contact and communication
and broadened cooperation within and beyond the region.
</P>
<P>
Before Somsak's speech, Adrianus Mooy, ESCAP executive
secretary, also made a statement, in which he noted that
challenges and opportunities lie ahead in achieving sustainable
industrial and technological development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting will be held on Monday and Tuesday,
during which ministers are expected to discuss industrial and
technological restructuring, investment-related technology
transfer and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a separate symposium on the private sector's role in
the industrial and technological field will be held on February
21.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their meeting, the ministers are expected to
issue a declaration and an action plan suggesting measures for
further industrial and technological development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of industry and technology ministers has been
organized periodically by the ESCAP, with the last meeting held in
Tehran, Iran, in June 1992.

<HEADLINE> China Lists Top Ten Archeological Finds for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archeologists also unearthed a smaller, but older ancient city
in Henan Province. They estimate the city was built when the Shang
Dynasty (1600-1100 B.C.) defeated the Xia Dynasty (2100-1600 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The extensive archeological site provides important clues to
accurately determine the periods of China's three earlist
dynasties -- Xia, Shang and Zhou.
</P>
<P>
A number of expers rated the most valuable find of the year as
the 334 ritual and musical instruments unearthed at a sacrificial
site in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The find included a bronze Ding (three-legged tripod, or
four-legged cauldron) and Zhong (bell) crafted during the Spring
and Autumn Period (770-476 B.C.). The well-preserved large pieces
feature beautiful decorations.
</P>
<P>
The Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C) imperial summer resort and
bathhouse unearthened in Liaoning Province will prove highly
valuable for further studies of Qin architecture, art, religion
and technology. The site was excavated over a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most conspicuous find in terms of ancient
architecture centers on a large channel built with stone which was
discovered in the palace ruins of the southern king during the
Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 A.D.). The ruins were discovered in
central part of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The stone channel extends to a stone pond in the shape of a
crescent moon, with the configuration representing one of the
major scenic sites in the magnificent royal garden.
</P>
<P>
Archeologically speaking, the "youngest" find on list was
represented by the excavation of 110 tombs dating to the Kingdom
of Loulan (Kroraina) which thrived along the ancient Silk
Road. The tombs, which date back at least 1,500 years, yielded
over 200 artifacts, including articles made of wool, silk, wood,
and glass, as well as pottery and lacquerware.
</P>
<P>
Selection of the annual top ten archaeological finds was
initiated in 1990.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Arranges Repatriation of Refugees in W. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nation High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is making arrangement to
repatriate Congolese refugees in western Uganda, a high official
of UNHCR has said here.
</P>
<P>
Sadako Ogata, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, told a
news conference Wednesday that a team has been sent to the
Democratic Republic of Congo for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
She had talks with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on the
same day on the refugee issue, Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
"The president made it clear that people must go back to their
countries voluntarily," Ogata narrated.
</P>
<P>
The refugees reached western Uganda last year when Laurent
Kabila's troops launched their attacks to grip power.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR cannot influence political situation in a country, but
it will help in dealing with the problem, Ogata added.
</P>
<P>
She had an impression that the period of large outflows of
refugees in this region has subsided, Ogata added.
</P>
<P>
Ogata began her three-day trip to Uganda from February 17. She
is visiting nine African countries including Zimbabwe, Tanzania,
Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, the Republic of Congo
and Democratic Republic of Congo, exploring ways to enhance
adherence to humanitarian principles and refugee law.

<HEADLINE> China Lists Top Ten Archeological Finds for 1997 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China has selected its Top Ten
archeological finds for 1997, including the world's oldest known
rice paddy, 2,000-year-old stone structures rivaling those found
in Greece and Rome, an imperial summer resort and bathhouse dating
back over 2,000 years, and more than 100 tombs along the ancient
Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
The Top Ten list was selected from 479 archeological projects
carried out during 1997. Leading Chinese archeologists noted that
the finds were quite satisfying, despite the lack of highly
significant discoveries.
</P>
<P>
The oldest find, which dates back over 300,000 years, included
more than 30,000 stoneware items found in a cave in Luonan County,
Shanxi Province. "The stoneworks date to the Early Stone Age in a
place south of the Qinling Ranges," according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists working in Zhangqiu, Shandong Province, unearthed
19 cave dwellings with above rooms. The archeologists described
the find as the "best preserved dwellings from the Neolithic
Age". The dwellings, which date back at least 7,700 years,
contained cauldrons, jars, kettles and stoneware.
</P>
<P>
A mound site with a history of between 5,000-6,000 years was
discovered in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
during the summer of 1997. Archeologists also excavated 149 tombs
in the region and for the first time found evidence of
dismemberment during burial.
</P>
<P>
Experts working in central China's Hunan Province found traces
of the world's oldest rice paddy dating back over 6,500 years.
</P>
<P>
One of the most significant archeological finds in 1997 was
unearthered in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region. Excavation of housing complex and 20 tombs dating between
the Neolithic Age and Early Bronze Age yielded a large array of
pottery, stoneware and jade items.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Import 1.2 Million Tons of Cereals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) has predicted that kenya would need to import
1.2 million tons of cereals including wheat and rice as a result
of the extensive crop destruction caused by the El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
In a special report on the African food situation, FAO said
that the heavy rains, particularly in November and January,
adversely affected the 1997/98 maize crop, the staple crop for
Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rains in October/November at the time of the
harvest of the main season crop reduced the yields of maize
already affected by a dry spell at the critical grain filling
stage.
</P>
<P>
The worst effect of the floods was on second-season crops
grown in the bi-modal rainfall areas of Western, Central and
Eastern provinces from mid-October to February.
</P>
<P>
The maize output of this season is estimated to have declined
by one-third from the normal levels while the bean crop was
sharply reduced due to both adverse weather and lack of seed.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the 1997/98 (September/August) maize
production is estimated at 2.3 million tons, slightly above the
1996/97 level but below the average of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Maize import requirements, expected to be covered mainly
commercially, are estimated at 800,000 tons which is lower than
in the previous year when maize imports reached one million tons,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
The areas worst-affected by the El Nino-induced heavy rains
include Coast and Northeastern provinces, and parts of Eastern
Province which have been declared disaster zones by the kenyan
government.

CHONGQING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China Southwestern Airlines
will open an air route from Chongqing, a new municipality in

dozen Japanese companies cooperate with enterprises in Chongqing in
producing motor vehicles and cars, using some 300 million US
dollars from Japan. Currently, two Japanese banks have set up
their representative offices in Chongqing.

<HEADLINE> S. African Health Minister Urges to Fight Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- South African Health
Minister Nkosazana Zuma has urged the people of the whole country
to fight smoking habit.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference of international tobacco control
experts at Sea Point, Cape Town Wednesday, Zuman said it was time
to change society's relatively benign tolerance of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The mistaken impressions about the importance of tobacco to
the economy should be corrected, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, entitled Economics of Tobacco
Control, is being hosted by the University of Cape Town and the
Medical Research Council and has drawn delegates from 17
countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was designed to share research findings with
scientists worldwide, invites debate with researchers from the
tobacco industry and intends to formulate policy proposals for
tobacco control.
</P>
<P>
Zuma quoted researchers as saying that there were about three
million deaths worldwide each year from tobacco-related
illnesses, and an estimated 30 million people would be killed
this decade by smoking.
</P>
<P>
She said while fewer people were smoking in industrialized
countries, there were an estimated 800 million people who smoked
in the developing world and the number was increasing.
</P>
<P>
"Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and 85
percent of cases in men and 46 percent in women are due to
tobacco."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that tobacco use in South Africa was
declining, with consumption falling at a rate of three percent a
year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said surveys showed the number of smokers had dropped
from 30.2 percent of the population in 1996 to 28.4 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
For years, the tobacco industry repeatedly emphasized the
importance of tobacco to the economy, the number of jobs it
created and the tax revenue it generated.
</P>
<P>
Yet a 1993 World Bank study estimated that tobacco use
resulted in a global net loss of 200 billion U.S. Dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
"This is more than the total current health expenditures in
all developed countries combined," Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
It was currently believed that the best weapon the South
African government had to deter smoking was taxation, the price
at which cigarettes were sold.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said the government was considering to amend the current
legislation so as to ban smoking in public and in the work place.
</P>
<P>
"We may ban tobacco advertizing, sponsorships and promotions,
and raise to 18 the age at which minors can buy cigarettes," she
added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Japanese Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stressed today that the development of Sino-Japanese relations
should be based on the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark here this morning in a meeting with Isamu
Takada, governor of the Nagasaki Prefecture of Japan, and his
party.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Takada, an old friend of the Chinese
people, Jiang pointed to the helpful work done by Takada and the
Nagasaki Prefecture in past decades for the promotion of
Sino-Japanese friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Stating that this is the 20th anniversary of the bilateral
treaty of peace and friendship, Jiang said that the development of
bilateral relations has generally been good since the
normalization of bilateral diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Japanese relations will face the 21st century and enter an
important period which is a juncture linking the past and the
future, added Jiang.
</P>
<P>
On historical issues, Jiang said that Japanese aggression
against China initiated by the Japanese militarists caused great
suffering to the people of both China and Japan, including people
of the Nagasaki Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a Chinese saying that "past experience, if not
forgotten, can be a guide for the future," Jiang pointed out that
Sino-Japanese friendship from generation to generation can be
realized so long as Japan's younger generation is educated with
correct historical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for the efforts made by
Japanese figures of insight for the promotion of bilateral
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Takada said that Nagasaki Prefecture, which took the lead among
Japanese autonomous bodies in passing a resolution demanding
normalization of Japan-China relations, has followed the spirit of
the bilateral treaty of peace and friendship in past decades and
conducted wide-ranging friendly exchanges in various fields with
China.
</P>
<P>
He said he will, as always, continue to play an active role in
Japanese autonomous bodies in promoting the development of
Japan-China friendship.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese visitors are here as guests of the China
Association for International Friendly Contacts.

<HEADLINE> Books on Deng Xiaoping Popular Among Beijing Readers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- "I worship and love Deng
Xiaoping, and I felt so sad over his death last year," a
university student told reporters while reading a biography of
Deng in a local bookstore, SDX Joint Publishing Company.
</P>
<P>
"It is his reform and opening-up policies that made China
stronger," said the student named Yang Chengwei, who is majored in
economic management.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the readers who have come to the bookstore recently
are buying books on Deng Xiaoping, who died on Feburary 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bookstore has opened three special counters for books on
Deng, and sells 70-to-100 copies daily. The bookstore has sold
more than 10,000 books concerning the late leader during the past
year.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 100 different books on the late leader are
being sold around the Chinese capital.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Visitors Enjoy Deng Photo Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A retired Beijing teacher
arrived at the China Military Museum early this morning to visit a
photo exhibition presented by Deng Lin, daughter of late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The visitor carried a book on Deng's life and carefully
surveyed the 112 photographs on exhibit with tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that Deng is still amongst the people," said the
teacher.
</P>
<P>
Deng, the architect of China's reform and opening, passed away
on February 19 last year at the age of 93. Deng Lin, the late
leader's eldest daughter, joined in commemorative activities to
mark the first anniversary of her father's death by presenting the
first public exhibition of photographs showing his daily life
activities.
</P>
<P>
"My father enjoyed hobbies and just like everybody who
experienced joy, anger and sorrow. Deng Xiaoping not only served
as the nation's leader, but was also a good son, good husband and
good father," said Deng Lin.
</P>
<P>
She noted that her father was unaware when most of the
photographs were being snapped.
</P>
<P>
Many visitors learned for the first time that Deng liked to
read works about legendary figures, enjoyed playing with his
grandchildren, and liked to take walks in the snow.
</P>
<P>
One photo showed Deng and his grandsons planting a tree in
suburban Beijing. Deng, in fact, advocated the "Green China" drive
some 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The total number of trees China has planted since that time
would cover an area the size of Switzerland. Beijing citizens, who
formerly suffered from strong winds and blowing sand, have greatly
benefitted from the afforestation effort.
</P>
<P>
The photographs were taken between 1980-1993, a period which
Deng Lin cites highly important for both her father and the
Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Predicts Rebound for Asian Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Thursday predicted that Asia will soon rebound from the
current economic turmoil and the Philippines "will be right on top
of that rebound."
</P>
<P>
"Mark my word," Ramos told more than 600 participants in the
1998 Civil Engineering International Conference on Asian
Infrastructure, Sustainable Development and Project Management
here.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the turmoil, Asia will rebound. It is just a
question of when and how soon," Ramos said at the opening ceremony
of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The economic setback, he said, "may even strengthen our
institutions in the long run. What is important is that we are not
only surviving, but we are adjusting, we are adopting and we are
formulating creative responses to the crisis."
</P>
<P>
The currency meltdown started last July with Thailand being the
first country in Southeast Asia to be hit by the crisis when its
baht dived considerably.
</P>
<P>
The contagion affected Indonesia and Malaysia when their
currencies also depreciated to a record low.
</P>
<P>
For a while, the Philippines warded off the currency attack but
the peso later stumbled. From an exchange rate of 26 pesos to a
U.S. dollar, the peso declined to 30 and 35 and even reached as
low as 46 to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos said the economic fundamentals adopted by his
administration have prevented the peso from further devaluation.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the peso has appreciated from 46 to 39.1 to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramos, Asia may have fallen victim to its rapid
success in the past decade. However, he remained optimistic that
the Philippines and other Asian countries affected by the economic
turmoil will recover soon.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Import 1.2 Million Tons of Cereals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) has predicted that kenya would need to import
1.2 million tons of cereals including wheat and rice as a result
of the extensive crop destruction caused by the El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
In a special report on the African food situation, FAO said
that the heavy rains, particularly in November and January,
adversely affected the 1997/98 maize crop, the staple crop for
Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rains in October/November at the time of the
harvest of the main season crop reduced the yields of maize
already affected by a dry spell at the critical grain filling
stage.
</P>
<P>
The worst effect of the floods was on second-season crops
grown in the bi-modal rainfall areas of Western, Central and
Eastern provinces from mid-October to February.
</P>
<P>
The maize output of this season is estimated to have declined
by one-third from the normal levels while the bean crop was
sharply reduced due to both adverse weather and lack of seed.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the 1997/98 (September/August) maize
production is estimated at 2.3 million tons, slightly above the
1996/97 level but below the average of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Maize import requirements, expected to be covered mainly
commercially, are estimated at 800,000 tons which is lower than
in the previous year when maize imports reached one million tons,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
The areas worst-affected by the El Nino-induced heavy rains
include Coast and Northeastern provinces, and parts of Eastern
Province which have been declared disaster zones by the kenyan
government.

CANBERRA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
stronger Thursday, after rolling up on a wave of buying sparked by
firmer Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 67.33 U.S. cents, up from 67.13
previously.
</P>
<P>
However, traders said the market was cautious in light of an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) threat to withdraw 40 billion
U.S. dollars in financial assistance to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The struggling Indonesian economy appears to be moving closer
to implementing a currency board and pegging the local currency,
the rupiah, to the U.S. dollar, despite IMF opposition to the
plan.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar started the day in negative territory
before managing to climb from an intra-day low of 66.62 U.S. cents
to a high of 67.45.
</P>

HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A new major dam, Kunzwi in
Murewa, will cost the Harare City Council more than five billion
Zimbabwean Dollars or 300 million U.S. Dollars, "The Herald"
daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kunzwi Dam will be built on the Nyagui river, and it will have
a crest 2.6 km long and be 40.3 m high. The resultant lake will
cover 986 hectares and should yield 70 million cubic meters of
water a year from the total capacity of 157.9 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
The water in Kunzwi will be considerably clearer than the
polluted contents of Lake Chivero and Lake Manyame, the two major
storage dams now serving the city.
</P>
<P>
Tender documents for Kunzwi have been ready since October last
year, although no invitations to tender have yet been made by the
council.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian company has
discovered vast reserves of gold at Kukuluma in Geita District,
in north Tanzania's Mwanza Region.
</P>
<P>
Samax Gold, which owns 100 percent share of the Kukuluma mine,
said the gold reserves are in two deposits, amounting to 1.5
million ounces.
</P>
<P>
A report, signed by the company president, Dr. Martineau,
reveals that the mine is one of the most significant in Tanzania
because of its high grade, great width and deep oxidation, The
Guardian paper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Samax is in a position to plan a full feasibility study with a
continued exploration program, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, which has abundant gold resources, has implemented
favorable policies in handling approval procedures and taxation
for investors in the mining sector over the past decade. A number
of investors have been licensed to develop mineral resources in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Energy and Minerals, Abdallah Kigoda, told

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan, by exporting more and
importing less, ran a merchandise trade surplus of 381.5 billion
yen (about 3.02 billion U.S. dollars) in January.
</P>
<P>
The year's first month, the Finance Ministry said Thursday, was
the 10th month in a row to witness the country's favorable balance
on rise, and the 30th month to see its exports increasing.
</P>
<P>
The monthly surplus, partly the result of 3,853.7 billion yen
(30.58 billion dollars) in exports, was a sharp contrast to the
deficit of 24.5 billion yen (194 million dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Together with the 8.8 percent year-to-year hike of exports was
a 2.6 percent reduction, to 3,472.2 billion yen (27.5 billion
dollars) in January, of Japan's imports, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States jumped 65.7 percent from a year before to 493.9 billion yen
(3.91 billion dollars), rising for the 16th straight month.
</P>
<P>
Of the total U.S. trade volume, Japan's exports advanced 20.7
percent to 1,274.4 billion yen (10 billion dollars) while imports
was up 3.0 percent to 780.5 billion yen (6.19 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, its trade with financially troubled Asian nations
dropped in January, resulting in a deficit of 34.3 billion yen
(270 million dollars) for the first time since January 1990.
</P>
<P>
The surplus with the European Union more than doubled from a
year earlier, totaling 186.4 billion yen (1.46 billion dollars).

<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and European
Union are willing to co-sponsor a donors meeting to discuss an
East African Road Network Program in May in Arusha, northern
Tanzania, according to a Kenya Times report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Nicholas Biwott, Minister for East African
and Regional Cooperation, as saying Wednesday that Belgium, Japan
and the United States would participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at improving the road network in Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda in a bid to facilitate the evolving East
African Cooperation Common Market at a cost of 4.2 billion U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Biwott made the remarks after he came back from a visit to
Brussels, Tokyo, Washington and London with Tanzanian Foreign
Minister Jakaya Kikwete and Ugandan Minister Rebecca Kadaga.
</P>
<P>
He noted that The ministerial delegation's visit was designed

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippines Acts to Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Eight months after the currency
crisis started in Southeast Asia, sweeping countries including the
Philippines, the monetary authorities here have shifted their
focus from defending the peso to reducing the interest rates which
are killing the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank jacked up its overnight borrowing
and lending rates to ward off speculators when the currency crisis
began last July. To protect their own benefits, commercial banks
also hiked their interest rates. The inter-bank overnight
borrowing rate even jumped to a record high of 160 percent at one
time.
</P>
<P>
The measures, however, have not stabilized the Philippine
currency as expected. In fact, the high interest rates themselves
have become a crisis and begun to put a great strain on the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
During the past few months, the prime lending rates have
averaged out at 30 percent in the Philippines, leaving companies
either too scared to borrow or compounded by tighter credit. As a
result, some enterprises have been forced to reduce production or
simply shut down while some others had to apply for moratoria on
loans payments.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the high interest rates are more harmful than
a volatile peso because they would deal a heavy blow to the
manufacturing sector, the pillar of the country's economic growth.
Pinched by both the high interest rates and the declining peso,
manufacturers in the southern Philippines have decided to boycott
loans payments.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has repeatedly called on commercial banks to
lower their interest rates and it took the lead by cutting its
overnight lending rate to 15 percent and the banks' liquidity
reserve rate to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the central bank's move has allowed the
banks to have 48 billion pesos (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) more in
liquidity and should therefore help bring down the interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, the banks failed to follow suit, making a
congressional committee believe that there is a cartel in the
banking industry which is profiteering from the high rates.
</P>
<P>
Tired of resorting to moral suasion, central bank governor
Gabriel Singson threatened to regulate the prime lending rates,
saying the rates must go down to just three percentage points
above the 91-day Treasury bill rate which currently stands at
around 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
The business community voiced its support for Singson's plan.
Raul Concepcion, president of the Federation of Philippine
Industries, said this would be the best way to force banks to cut
lending rates.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos also called for new strategies to slash
the interest rates at a recent national economic meeting attended
by 350 representatives from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
"We uphold the importance of downing inflation. We underscore
the importance of minimizing exchange rate fluctuations. But even
as we do so, let us not kill the economic recovery with high
interest rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from both the government and the private sector,
the 53 commercials banks in the country came to a gentleman's
agreement with the Bankers Association of the Philippines, under
which the prime lending rate will be cut by one percentage point
per week until it reaches about 21 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two leading insurance systems, the Government
Service Insurance System and the Social Security System, have also
made efforts to help cut down the interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Each of them has agreed to set up a 5 billion peso facility
(about 125 million dollars) to lend at lower than market rates to
small- and medium-sized enterprises and export-oriented firms,
which are the hardest-hit in the currency crisis.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Conduct Crime Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A "scientific" survey
will be conducted in South Africa next month to determine the
levels of crime and public perceptions, The Citizen daily said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-funded survey will poll 5,000 households throughout
South Africa, Bernie Fanaroff, head of the National Crime
Prevention Strategy, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey could be used as a base line against which levels
of crime could be judged objectively in future, with similar
surveys made each few years, he said.
</P>
<P>
There was a controversy over the actual crime level in the
country. The government repeatedly quoted official statistics as
showing that all serious crimes except rape were declining, but
opposition parties questioned the validity of the surveys.
</P>
<P>
Fanaroff defended the validity of of statistics and said the
public confidence in government's anti-crime strategy would grow.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the criminal justice system had not been
operating in such a way as to deter crime, because criminals did
not feel certain that they would be detected, arrested, charged,
tried and "put away".
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that our levels of serious crime are too
high, particularly in Johannesburg," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is no death penalty in South Africa and suspects, even
involved in serious crimes, could obtain bail easily. There were
also allegations that criminals won police cooperation in prison
escapes.

LUANDA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers from
Portugal and five Portuguese-speaking African countries will
gather in Lisbon, capital of Portugal in July to decide on the
establishment of a coalition force of these countries.
</P>
<P>

former defense minister of Portugal, last year when he visited
Angola and Mozambique, was welcomed by the African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Angola News Agency Thursday, the proposed
coalition force was aimed at carrying out a peace keeping mission
in Africa in line with U.N. and OAU decisions to ensure stability
and peace in the continent, especially in Portuguese-speaking

<HEADLINE> Beijing Developing New Tourist Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- With the monetary crisis in
Southeast Asia starting to affect China's tourist market, travel
agencies in the Chinese capital plan to develop new tourist
sources in Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
The tourism business will keep its markets open in Europe, the
Americas, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In January, there was 2.6 percent growth in the number of
foreign tourists in Beijing from the year-ago period, but the
number of tourists from Thailand and Republic of Korea dropped 50
percent, and from Malaysia, 26.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of their currencies has at the same time made
Southeast Asian countries strong rivals for the Chinese tourism
business. Beijing gets about 60 percent of its foreign visitors
from Asia, with Southeast Asian countries accounting for a third
of that. Forty percent come from Europe, the Americas, and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Beijing had 2.28 million overseas tourists last year, bringing
in 2.25 billion US dollars worth of foreign exchange. This year,
the city expects a five percent growth in both figures.

<HEADLINE> Textile Industry in Central China Province Becomes Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Henan Province in central
China has succeeded in transforming its financially-troubled
textile sector into a profitable one.
</P>
<P>
Textile mills in Henan turned a profit of 46 million yuan in
1997 after three consecutive years of economic losses.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official attributed the turnaround to a
spindle-reduction campaign, mergers, readjusting the product mix
and improving management.
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 Silk and Flax Printing and Dying Mill, the biggest
money-losing enterprise in the textile industry of Henan, merged
with the Shenma Group last year.
</P>
<P>
Nanyang Cotton Mill purchased a bankrupt operation at 80
million yuan and took over the 50,000 spindles lying idle.
</P>
<P>
Losses incurred by cotton mills in Zhengzhou, the provincial
capital, were reduced by 50 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to make greater successes, the provincial government
has decided to eliminate 765,000 outmoded spindles in the coming
three years to dovetail with the national spindle-cut drive. The
scheme is expected to affect 29,000 textile workers in
Henan.
</P>
<P>
About 261,000 spindles will be abandoned and 4,500 workers laid
off this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Beijing becomes the second of
the top 50 Chinese cities selected in terms of overall social and
economic strength, today's Beijing Youth Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
According to a study of 219 cities at or above the prefectural
levels conducted by the urban social and economic investigation
team under the State Statistical Bureau, Shanghai comes the first
and is followed by Beijing, Guangzhou and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The top four cities are playing a leading role in China's
political, economic and cultural development, the study finds.
</P>
<P>
Overall strength refers to the advanced degree in politics,
economy, social development, infrastructure, environment
protection, science and technology, and culture and education.
</P>
<P>
The study also shows that three regions, the area in the Bohai
Bay, the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, where over 40
cities at or above the prefectural levels are located, have the
fastest economic growth and social progress in the country, and
are the vigorous forces for the country's growth of national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The study also reveals some problems such as the imbalanced
development between different cities and gaps between in the
eastern and western parts of the country as well as poor urban
environment and infrastructures facilities in some of the cities.

<HEADLINE> Chengdu Witnessed High Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Chengdu, capital of Sichuan
Province in southwest China, generated 101 billion yuan (12.2
billion US dollars) in gross domestic products in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This made Chengdu the second largest GDP producer in western
China, only after Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu recorded economic growth of over 11.5 percent in 1996
and 1997 and the city ranked 12th among Chinese cities in overall
economic strength.
</P>
<P>
Scientific and technical progress is now accountable to 43
percent of the city's economic growth, as compared with 30 percent
in 1987, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed the economic growth to the commercial
sector, which accounted for one third of the city's revenue and
whose proportion in GDP was the second highest in the country.
</P>
<P>
The efficiency of the local industry has also been remarkably
improved as 90 percent of the city's state-owned small enterprises
have undergone transformation by means of merger, bankruptcy and
laying off workers. Meanwhile, large conglomerates have been
formed.
</P>
<P>
The city's grain output hit a record 4.02 million tons
last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China has broad prospects in
the development of precious stones and a greater effort should
be made in finding them, a recent forum on precious stones was
told.
</P>
<P>
Experts said at the forum that the precious stone market in

finds in Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
However, many precious stones are still buried beneath the

<HEADLINE> No Systematic Doping in Chinese Swimming, FINA Says (2-last) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following are the measures and penalties that the CSA has
decided to take in order to eliminate drug-taking in swimming:
</P>
<P>
1. To strengthen its education program related to anti-doping,
the Chinese Swimming Association will hold a working meeting
annually regarding anti-doping issues.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the meeting will be to have anti-doping
known to everybody and let all people in China's swimming circle
gain a thorough knowledge of the bad effect and harm of doping and
to fight against all kinds of banned substances conscientiously.
</P>
<P>
2. The CSA shall perfect its regulations on anti-doping without
diminishing the legal rights of swimmers and coaches.
</P>
<P>
3. The registration system shall be improved so that any
swimmers who has registered to participate in national
competitions must first sign a letter of guarantee not to use any
banned substances.
</P>
<P>
4. All local clubs and local swimming associations shall be
required to execute a letter of guarantee to enhance the
management of the swimmers in order to eliminate any doping cases.
</P>
<P>
5. The CSA shall intensify its test methods, increase the
tesing number (to 600 in 1998) and impose more severe sanctions.
</P>
<P>
When a swimmer is found using banned substances listed in FINA
Rule 9.2(a) for the first time, he/she shall be banned for life;
for other banned substances, the penalty shall also be more strict
than FINA Rules.
</P>
<P>
6. Because coaches have such a great responsibility for the
actions of their swimmers, coaches whose swimmers test positive
shall also by severely punished without the necessity of proof of
action or knowledge that the swimmer has taken banned substances.
</P>
<P>
7. If a club or a local association has been found with two
positive cases within 12 months, it shall be suspended from
domestic and international competition for 12 months and fined.
</P>
<P>
If four positive tests are found within four years, the club or
association shall be suspended from any domestic and international
competition, and disqualified from participation in the next
National Games or National City Games.
</P>
<P>
8. To strictly limit the amount of money awarded to swimmers
and coaches. Local clubs or local associations are not allowed to
give cash rewards directly to swimmers or coaches.
</P>
<P>
All cash rewards shall be put into the Bank by the Chinese
Swimming Association until the retirement of such swimmer, at that
time, cash rewards as well as the bank interest will be given to
him or her, and coaches may have the rewards after four years if
none of their swimmers test positive for any banned substances;
otherwise, all the honors shall be deprived and money shall be
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
9. The Chinese Swimming Association shall announce immediately
to the public any sanction to swimmers and coaches in order to
enhance the supervisory from all societies.
</P>
<P>
10. The Chinese Swimming Association shall suggest to state
authorities concerned to strengthen the criminal penalties for
doping, so that the use of doping in sports can be brought up as a
legal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
11. The Chinese Swimming Association shall make further
cooperation with FINA and FINA's member federations by inviting
coaches and other technical personnel to visit Chinese swimming
programs at their own expense, and by making other joint efforts
to fight against doping.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Says Recent Bomb Threats Untrue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian police has said no
real bombs were found in the bomb threats received by many
quarters in the country recently.
</P>
<P>
The bomb threats against a few office buildings in Jakarta and
Medan, North Sumatra province, as well as against an air-borne
aircraft all proved to be untrue, official Antara News Agency
Thursday quoted Spokesman of the Indonesian State Police Brig Gen.
Dai Bachtiar as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said security officers never found any package in which a
real bomb of low or high technology is usually contained.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the public should remain alert and not panic
when threatened.
</P>
<P>
Bachtiar said whether bomb threats were real or not real,
police and other security authorities were at all times ready to
secure up to 10 bomb threats in different places at the same time.
</P>
<P>
A bomb threat Wednesday led to the evacuation of hundreds of
workers from a shopping center building in West Jakarta's business
district.
</P>
<P>
After receiving a phone call, saying a time-bomb was planted at
the Gajah Mada Plaza Shopping center about mid-day, police sealed
off the building and hundreds of shop and office workers were
evacuated immediately and the traffic was also stopped. But the
police officers found nothing suspicious.
</P>
<P>
The threat was the latest in a series of hoaxes in recent days
being sent to office buildings in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
At least 12 bomb hoaxes have been reported at office buildings
and public facilities since the January 18 bomb blast at a Tanah
Tinggi apartment in Central Jakarta during which two people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the general session of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) scheduled for next month, Bachtiar said people
should help make the five-yearly event a success.
</P>
<P>
The MPR will meet from March 1 to 11 to elect the country's next
president and vice president as well as establish the state policy
guideline for the 1998-2003 period.
</P>
<P>
About the riots triggered by price hike that recently took place
in several places in Java as well as outside Java, the spokesman
said that based on information from those seized during the
incidents, security authorities believe the actions were
masterminded by certain quarters.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the security authorities had not yet come to
any conclusions about them so far.
</P>
<P>
According to Jakarta police, hundreds people, who protested
against the soaring prices of staple commodities amid the
debilitating economic crisis, have been arrested in the last few
weeks in the country.

<HEADLINE> Food Crisis Critical in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Food shortages in the West
African state of Sierra Leone will remain critical, even though
peace-keeping forces have regained control the capital of
Freetown, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Oganization (FAO) said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The FAO said that with the recapture of Freetown from a
military junta, the economic embargo imposed since last August may
be eased or lifted, allowing an increase in food imports.
</P>
<P>
However, as much as 80,000 tonnes of food aid may be required
this year, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's cereal import requirement for 1998 totals about
260,000 tonnes, but lifting of the embargo would enable local
traders to import only 180,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone army officers led by Major Johnny Paul Korma ended
a short experiment in democracy with a coup on May 25,
1997. Forces sent in by the Economic Community of West African
States recaptured Freetown from the rebels last weekend.
</P>
<P>
But an FAO official said fighting may spread to rural areas which
have been relatively calm since the coup.

confidence in the regional economy," he said at a news conference
after meeting Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim here.
</P>
<P>
The fund could revive the economy and bring back confidence in
the region, he said, adding "We need participation from
outside...with the Europeans who have faith in us as they have
shown two years ago in Bangkok, with enthusiasm and commitment."
</P>
<P>
The problem faced in the region is the lack of funding and lack
of liquidity, therefore it would be good if liquidity could be
accessed in the region, Surin said.

like to see something concrete not only just warm words,
comforting words, but something like a fund to promote trade in
the region."

<HEADLINE> No Systematic Doping in Chinese Swimming, FINA Says (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- An International Swimming
Federation (FINA) delegation said here on Thursday that they
believed there was no systematic doping in the Chinese swimming.
</P>
<P>
"The inquires of the FINA delegation has led to the belief that
the Chinese Swimming Association (CSA) is not a participant of any
systematic process of doping in swimming," the delegation said in
a statement issued on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The five-member delegation arrived here on Monday to investigate
the CSA's probe into two doping cases which involved five Chinese
swimmers.
</P>
<P>
Four swimmers tested positive for the banned drug Triamterene
(diuretic) in January's World Swimming Championships in Perth,
Australia, following the discovery of human growth hormones in the
baggage of Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The FINA delegation said that the discovery of Triamterene in
the urine sample of Wang Wei, Zhang Yi, Wang Luna and Cai Huijue
has been confirmed by the testing of the B sample by the
IOC-sanctioned Sydney laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The final sanctions on the four swimmers will be announced
after the hearing of the FINA doping panel in Lausanne on March
14, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The FINA delegation was headed by FINA co-vice president Ross
Wales of the United States. The other members are FINA co-vice
president Roger Smith of Australia, FINA Bureau members Sam
Ramsamy of South Africa and Pipat Paniangvait of Thailand, and
FINA senior official Cornel Marculescu of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
After their arrival, the delegation met with the Chinese
leading sports officials, medical and anti-doping experts and the
four swimmers who tested positive in Perth and their coaches.
</P>
<P>
The delegation concluded that the CSA failed to do a good job
in control of swimmers and coaches.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation was disappointed to deduce that the Chinese
Swimming Association did not exercise total control in the whole
country. It exercises little control over provincial swimming and
over coaches," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, it was pleasing to note that the Chinese
Swimming Association has recognized this problem and has agree, in
conjunction with the Chinese Olympic Committee, to adopt a series
of measures and penalties to overcome this issue," FINA Bureau
member Ramsamy said.

<HEADLINE> Italian Deputy PM on Annan's Iraq Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
was warned against refusing the United Nations' attempt at
mediation in the weapons inspection crisis by Italian Deputy Prime
Minister Walter Veltroni on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's diplomatic mission to
Baghdad on Friday will mark the re-emergence of the U.N. as the
main protagonist in the weapons inspection crisis, said Veltroni.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General, in deciding to go to Baghdad, had taken
over responsibility for the international response to the Iraq
crisis - which until now had been led by the United States, said
Veltroni.
</P>
<P>
If Saddam Hussein refused Annan's attempts at mediation, "he
should be aware that he would be saying no directly to the U.N.,"
Veltroni warned.
</P>
<P>
"This would change the scenario on which our discussions till
now have been based," he said. "It would amount to a challenge to
the U.N., not to a single country, and would demand that everyone
react accordingly."
</P>
<P>
Rome clearly preferred a peaceful solution to the crisis, but
Prime Minister Romano Prodi has said that if it came to the
crunch, Italy would not desert its allies.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges U.N. Role in Resolving Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The solution to the Iraqi crisis
should be sought through the direct involvement of the United
Nations, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Prodi
expressed the Italian government's hopes that Annan's visit to
Baghdad on Friday would be successful.
</P>
<P>
"Since the start of the crisis, which came about because of
Iraq's failure to respect the pertinent resolutions of the United
Nations, the Italian government has been convinced that the
solution should be sought through the direct involvement of the
United Nations and its personnel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said he expressed this conviction in a joint declaration
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on February 10.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his satisfaction over Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak's similar attitude, and over Annan's appreciation
for Italy's stance on the Iraq crisis.

<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said Wednesday that putting the Iraqi crisis in the hands of
the United Nations was a decisive step for safeguarding peace.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a U.N. Security Council mandate for Secretary
General Kofi Annan to pursue a diplomatic approach, Prodi
said: "Moving this controversy to the United Nations is decisive
for safeguarding peace and closely examing the problems."
</P>
<P>
He recalled the joint appeal made with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin for a diplomatic solution little more than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
"When with Yeltsin, I said there could be a solution to the
Iraqi crisis only through the U.N. and a visit by Kofi Annan to
Baghdad," the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
"Kofi Annan is now leaving," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Though it was clear the problem of U.N. inspections of
suspected weapons sites in Iraq had not been settled, putting the
controversy in the U.N. hands was decisive for protecting the
peace, Prodi said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is trying to enter
a joint project with the United States to develop the next
generation of multi-role strike fighter aircraft, the Straits
Times reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said that Singapore is poised to become the first Asian
country to join the United States in a program to develop the
fighter plane.
</P>
<P>
"A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is under discussion which
could pave the way for the Republic's Ministry of Defense to join
the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program as an 'informed customer',"
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The arrangement is another indication of the close
relationship between the governments of the two countries and the
good defense ties they have been cultivating," it commented.
</P>
<P>
The JSF program is said to be aimed at developing and fielding
an affordable family of next-generation multi-role strike fighter
aircraft for the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and its
allies.
</P>
<P>
As an informed customer, the Republic of Singapore Air Force
(RSAF) would be given access to 90 percent of the data on the
program, thus allowing the RSAF to evaluate the JSF against future
requirements.
</P>
<P>
But, Singapore's observer status would not give it key
information on radar-evading stealth technology or allow it to
influence the fighter's design, the paper said, quoting a report
from the weekly aerospace news magazine Flight International.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have already become
informed customers, while Italy is holding talks on joining the
program and Australia has been briefed on it.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has granted an aid package of 26.52 million Rupees (427,742 U.S.
dollars) to Sri Lanka to help the country maintain a sustainable
supply of fuelwood, a government newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News quoted a spokeswoman for the EC in Colombo as
saying the grant has been approved by the EC after the Science and
Technology Ministry of Sri Lanka presented a project proposal last
year.
</P>
<P>
She said the Natural Resource Institute of the United Kingdom
will send an expert team shortly to Sri Lanka to work on the
proposed project, which would last for five years.
</P>
<P>
Due to the absence of indigenous fossil fuel resources, Sri
Lanka is heavily dependent on fuelwood for industrial and
household needs.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the project was aimed at increasing the
sustainable supply of fuelwood to meet the needs of industrial and
household consumption.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Forestry and Environment Ministry in its Action
Plan 98' said 260 hectares of land will be allocated to plant
trees this year. The move is a major step of the ministry to meet
the timber and fuelwood requirement and to conserve
environmentally vulnerable areas.

BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will try to restart
progress on the region's industrial cooperation scheme, the
Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Thai industry ministry sources as saying
that officials will review the situation in each member country

</P>
<P>
Progress had been delayed by budget constraints affecting
member nations.
</P>
<P>
Under the industrial cooperation scheme, approved manufacturers
based in any ASEAN member, and with 30 percent local ownership,
will be eligible for preferential tariffs below five percent on
intra-ASEAN trade of parts and components.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a working group will meet in Bangkok on
February 26 and 27 to discuss ways to speed up tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will find out if there was any concern among
members about slashing tariffs while trying to balance national
budgets, the sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign exchange
reserves have decreased to 17.07 billion U.S. dollars as of
February 16 from 20.39 billion dollars recorded on January 15,
Bank Indonesia (BI), the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
A statement signed Wednesday by BI Director Miranda S. Goeltom
said the current level of reserves was enough to finance non-oil
and non-gas imports for 4.2 months.
</P>
<P>
However, the reserves have plunged 41 percent from the record
high of 28.85 set at the end of June last year.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Indonesia still had 1.87 billion dollars in
stand-by loans, which could be cashed anytime the government
needed.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not explain why the reserves were being
depleted.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers have said the central bank has been active
lately defending the rupiah (national currency) from continuous
attack by intervening both in the spot and swap markets.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has been under speculative attack since the
devaluation of the Thai baht on July 2. Since then the rupiah has
lost more than 70 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Up Nationwide State Property Administration System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China's state property
administration system, which was set up a decade ago, has had a
positive impact on the reform of China's economic structure.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Youcai, director of Chinese State
Administration of State Property, China's state property is
administrated by people's governments at different levels and
managed by state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To date, state property administration bodies have been set up
in 94 percent of China's counties, involving a staff of more than
20,000 specialized in evaluating, registering and checking
state-owned property.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China's total state-owned assets were worth
6.5 trillion yuan with 4.99 trillion yuan of productive property.
</P>
<P>
The present system has guaranteed a clear separation of
property ownership and the operation rights of a state-owned
enterprise which has greatly improved the operation efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Under the former state planning economic system, the operation
and debts of state-owned enterprises used to be controlled by the
central government or local governments at different levels. No
specialized government agencies administered these assets before
1988.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Invests More in Fruit Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government will
invest 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in increasing fruit production and
promoting fruit exports, in an aim to become the world's top fruit
exporter in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Agriculture Ministry says fruit exports
(including dried and candied fruits) reached 1.88 million tons in
1997, an increase of 7.4 percent over last year. The exports
earned more than 1.69 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has more than two million hectares growing fruit, with
an annual production of more than 31 million tons. This includes
orange, avocado and papaya which are in first places in the world.
</P>
<P>
Orange juice, the biggest export product of Brazil, amounted to
1.18 million tons, worth more than one billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
To occupy international markets, the Brazilian government began
to implement a "support plan" for the development of fruit growing
in the northeast last September. It predicts the cultivation of a
million hectares in a few years and the annual creation of 200,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the authorities would invest 1.5 billion
dollars in 10 years to increase the plantation areas.
</P>
<P>
The main markets for Brazilian fruit exports are the European
Union countries, the United States and the Southern Common Market
countries, and there are plans to broaden exports to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Thai Revenue Department Tax Collections Reach Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai revenue department
tax collections in January amounted to 47 billion baht (about 1
billion U.S. dollars), 1.1 percent more than the month's target,
according to Phaithoon Pongkesorn, A spokeswoman for the
department.
</P>
<P>
She was quoted Thursday by the Bangkok Post as saying that the
department succeeded in collection corporate, petroleum, sales and
special taxes last month. However, the department did not receive
much in the way of personal taxes as workers have been hard hit by
the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Although the department received more taxes last month, the
department could not meet the revenue target in the first four
months of fiscal 1998, October 1997 to January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The department collected a total of 162 billion (about 3.4
billion dollars) in tax the first four months of the fiscal year.
However, that fell short of the target by 1.79 billion baht (about
38 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The department's income target for fiscal 1998 is 541 billion
baht (about 11.5 billion dollars). The total revenue target for
the Thai government is 872 billion baht (about 18.5 billion
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Trade Deficit Declines in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's trade deficit in
1997 has dropped by 195 million U.S. dollars due to the impressive
performance in exports and a decline in consumer goods imports,
the Central Bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit during the January-November period in 1997 was
1,077 million dollars, compared with 1,272 million dollars in the
corresponding period a previous year.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the drop to the prudent economic management
of the government and the incentives offered to the export based
industries by the government.
</P>
<P>
The total exports grew by 14.4 percent during the first 11
months last year, while imports rose only by 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the period, export earnings amounted to 182 billion
Rupees (2.94 billion dollars), a 23.7 percent increase over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The investment goods and intermediary goods imports have
increased to 70 billion Rupees (1.13 billion dollars) during
January and November, which industrial experts say will help
strengthen the local industrial sector.

BUDAPEST, February 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's visit to Iraq will speed up a solution to the weapons
inspection crisis, said Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Favorable conditions are being created to find a diplomatic
solution, Primakov said after meting with his Hungarian
counterpart Laszlo Kovacs on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rising tensions over the situation would incur grave
consequences, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hungary insisted on a diplomatic solution and was watching
efforts made by Russia, said Foreign Minister Kovacs.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also repeated Russia's opposition to the eastward
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and
said the three Baltic nations' bids to join NATO were unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Hungary would endeavor to stop its ties with Russia from being
affected by its admission to the alliance, said Kovacs.

Primakov also met with Prime Minister Gyula Horn and President
Arpad Goncz during his two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> China to Set Up Sino-foreign Tourism Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China will launch Sino-foreign
joint venture travel agencies on a trial basis this year in a move
to expand facilities for travelers and offset losses caused by the
Southeast Asian financial crisis, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper quoted He Guangwei, Chairman of the
National Tourism Administration, as saying that this is part of
the administration's multi-pronged effort to make sure the tourism
industry maintains a relatively high growth rate this year,
although the industry is already feeling the effects of the
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include sponsoring more tourism promotion
activities and fairs in Japan, Europe and the United States,
sending 10 promotion delegations overseas and developing the
domestic tourism market.
</P>
<P>
New markets will be developed in India and Russia, where
well-off people have the money to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
He admitted the financial crisis will produce some impact on
the industry this year because countries in Southeast Asia are
major markets for China's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Many tourists from these countries are expected to cancel their
travel plans due to local currency depreciation and shrinking
domestic expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, the cheaper currencies in countries such as
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea will lure away some of Western
tourists originally destined for China.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the tourism industry will never give up the
Southeast Asian market and will develop more suitable tourism
products to attract travellers from these countries.

<HEADLINE> New Clinton Legal Defense Fund Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- With U.S. President Bill
Clinton owing more than 3.2 million dollars in legal bills, former
Senator David Pryor of Arkansas Wednesday announced the creation
of a new legal defense fund.
</P>
<P>
It will replace the fund shut down in December after it failed
to generate sufficient contributions.
</P>
<P>
The legal bills are mounting for Clinton, with a multitude of
litigation underway.
</P>
<P>
The trustees of the new fund can solicit contributions because
Clinton is not officially involved in the trust. The previous fund
could only accept contributions that donors "passively" offered.
</P>
<P>
The fund will solicit contributions of up to 10,000 dollars, a
major increase on 1,000 dollar limit of the previous fund.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference announcing the new fund, Pryor said,"I am
deeply concerned about the personal burden placed on the president
by the enormous and ever-mounting legal expenses that they have
incurred."
</P>
<P>
Both the White House counsel's office and the Office of
Government Ethics gave the new trust fund the green light to
solicit funds to help pay the Clintons' legal bills.
</P>
<P>
It will not take contributions from government employees,
corporations, labor unions, political action committees or their
registered lobbyists and will disclose its activities twice a
year.

BRASILIA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil registered a trade
deficit of 660 million U.S. dollars in January, far less than that

</P>
<P>
Mauricio Cortes, the minister of Exterior Commerce, on

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Draws 1.3 Billion US Dollars' Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Myanmar
recorded an increase of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, bringing
the total to 6.6 billion dollars by the end of the year, according
to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
The increase, however, is less than that in 1996 when the
foreign investment was registered at 2.26 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some observers here attribute the fall to the effect of the
recent Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Of the 23 countries and regions investing in Myanmar, Britain,
Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and the United States are leading
with 1.32 billion, 1.31 billion, 1.16 billion, 587 million and
582 million dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the total foreign investment in the country, other five
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries --
Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines --
shared 50 percent, investing 3.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 10 foreign-invested sectors involving 293 permitted
projects are leading with oil and gas (2.29 billion dollars),
manufacturing (1.27 billion dollars), real estate (997 million
dollars), hotels and tourism (770 million dollars) and mining
(498 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Myanmar began to shift its centrally-planned economic system
towards a market-oriented one when the country opened its door to
the outside world in late 1988, inviting foreign investment to
help develop the country.

GUANGZHOU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Calls for Development of Hydro-Power Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif said Wednesday that besides efforts to develop coal
fields for power generation, the government was trying to sort out
problems related to the development of major hydro-power projects.
</P>
<P>
It would enable Pakistan to utilize significant sources of
surface water available in the country, said Sharif while
addressing the concluding session of the two-day Oil and Gas
Summit.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said his government was trying to develop the most
optimum energy mix customized to domestic conditions and
peculiarities.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to achieve the dual socio-economic objective of
ensuring availability of energy at affordable price while
promoting investment in the development of the energy thus
creating more employment opportunities,' he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif stressed for preparing a long-term fuel energy strategy
to support a sustained growth of economy at about seven percent
per annum as it was essential that future strategies were
formulated by integrating both short-term and long-term measures.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for fast developing the national
economy, saying that national focus on infrastructural development
projects would enable Pakistan to play its central role in linking
various regional business blocks and exploit regional markets,
specially for energy supplies.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was keen to substitute imported oil with
imported piped gas from the neighboring countries to meet its
energy requirements.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also said that his government was determined to cut down
expenditure on uneconomical ventures and encourage private
investment in energy projects.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister asked the experts participating in the oil
and gas summit to look closely at the opportunities that have been
offered for profitable investment especially in the energy supply
and infrastructure sector.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to "join us in our endeavors to vitalize national
economy through profitable and mutually-beneficial economic
cooperation and investment".
</P>
<P>
Pakistan' energy supply and demand figures are dominated by oil
and gas which have become critical to the economy. Pakistan has to
spend about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars annually on oil imports.
</P>
<P>
Sharif called for better planning and management to reduce
heavy oil imports through optimum exploration of indigenous
resources.

<P>
Huge coal deposits have been discovered in the Thar area of
Sindh province and the estimated reserves are about 176 billion
tones while the remaining proven reserves of natural gas in
Pakistan are over 20 trillion cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
Overall theoretical potential is as high as 200 trillion cubic
feet. So far, a total of 600 million barrels of oil reserves have
been proven to exist in the country although the potential is
considered to be much higher.

<P>
Sharif said the government has, therefore, given liberal
incentives for exploration in large unexplored offshore areas
where major oil and gas fields are expected to be discovered.

The two-day Oil and Gas Summit was attended by about 370
delegates from 26 countries.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Given 15-Year Sentence in The Mainland for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Ruan Weiming, a Taiwanese who
does business in Shanghai, was recently sentenced to 15 years in
prison for a 510,000-yuan (61,000 US dollars) fraud case involving
IDD fees.
</P>
<P>
He was also deprived of political rights for four years by the
No. 1 Intermediate People's Court of Shanghai Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Ruan, 43, rented offices and IDD telephones from nine Shanghai
companies from 1995 on for his telecommunications company
Jiexin. He then had employees install a hi-tech automatic
telephone exchange on the rented telephone line.
</P>
<P>
The company then offered prices that were 25 percent off the
standard telephone rates of the post and telecommunications
department for IDD calls, and got a large number of customers. To
avoid trouble with the police, his employees ran away after the
telephone fees were paid.
</P>
<P>
Since October of 1995, the nine companies that signed rental
contracts with Ruan have suffered a loss of 510,000 yuan on IDD
calls.

<HEADLINE> NZ Manufactured Exports Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand exported more
manufactured products in 1997 despite the Asian economic crisis in
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured exports in the year reached 8 billion NZ dollars
(4.6 billion U.S. dollars), while elaborately transformed exports
hit a new high of 5.6 billion (3.3 billion U.S. dollars), the
Manufacturers Federation President David Moloney was quoted by the
Wellington newspaper "The Dominion" on Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the eight billion dollars accounted for 39 percent of
the total exports and did not include meat, dairy products, fish,
wool or wood pulp.
</P>
<P>
Growth was expected for some months because of the lower NZ
dollar.
</P>
<P>
"But clearly this growth is a result of much more than just the
level of the currency because several leading industry sectors
have kept on growing strongly right through the previous 18
months, when out exchange rate was very high," Moloney said.
</P>
<P>
He listed the sectors producing electronics and electrical
equipment, industry machinery and equipment, transport equipment
and plastic goods as the top performers in export.

<P>
BRUSSELS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Formula One's ruling body FIA
confirmed on Wednesday that this year's Belgian Grand Prix will be
saved as scheduled on August 30.
</P>
<P>
The race, one of the most famous in Europe, had appeared doomed
last week when a Belgian appeal court upheld a law that will
introduce a strict ban on all forms of tobacco advertising and
sponsorship from next year.
</P>
<P>
FIA had warned in January that this year's race would be
cancelled unless an exemption for Formula One was agreed by
February 15.
</P>
<P>
Cars will apparently be free to carry tobacco logos at this
year's race, until the introduction of the new law next year.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa have been hoping to replace Belgium to
stage the race.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Posts Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
posted a 1.87 billion pesos (46.75 million U.S. dollars) budget
surplus in January compared to a deficit of 3.18 billion pesos
(79.5 million dollars) in January last year.
</P>
<P>
Documents from the Bureau of Treasury showed Thursday that
improved revenue collections amounting to 44.19 billion pesos (1.1
billion dollars) during the period boosted the government's fiscal
position.
</P>
<P>
The revenue collected last month were substantially higher than
the 37.44 billion pesos (936 million dollars) collections during
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The government's two main revenue-yielding agencies, the Bureau
of Revenue and Bureau of Customs, which had incurred huge
shortfalls last year, both exceeded their collection targets for
the month.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal officials said that if these positive developments
continued, the government could perform much better than the
modest 1 billion pesos (25 million dollars) surplus targeted for
this year.
</P>
<P>
The government was originally hoping for a 16 billion pesos
(400 million dollars) surplus this year, but this was scaled down
in consideration of the adverse impact of the currency crisis.

<HEADLINE> Guang'an Achievements Commemorate Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Rapid economic growth, the
large number of people who escaped poverty and the construction of
30 roads over the past year represent monumental achievements the
people of Guang'an feel appropriately commemorate the 1st
anniversary of Deng Xiaoping's death on February 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Guang'an County, in southwest China's Sichuan Province, was the
birthplace of Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China's reform and
opening drive.
</P>
<P>
Local people heeded Deng's call for "building a better
Guang'an" by launching a road construction campaign in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Construction of an expressway linking Guang'an with Chongqing
Municipality is in full swing, with over 2,500 meters of a
4,775-meter Huaying Mountain highway tunnel, China's longest,
already completed.
</P>
<P>
Work continued nonstop on the eve of Lunar New Year, the major
traditional Chinese festival which commenced on January 28.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about one million people are working on
related projects.
</P>
<P>
Guang'an has also engaged in arduous efforts to help more local
residents escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
Guang'an, a major agricultural area, initiated its poverty
eradication program by building houses for over 2,500 rural
families who formerly lacked housing or lived in cave dwellings.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1997 show that the county's industrial output
value jumped by 18 percent, ranking the second of the province;
the total retail sales by 20 percent, ranking the third; and
financial revenue by 21.3 percent, ranking the fourth.
</P>
<P>
The fact that people refer to Guang'an as the "Hometown of Deng
Xiaoping, one of the greatest men of the century" has brought fame
and wealth to the county.
</P>
<P>
A record 700,000 domestic and overseas tourists visited Deng's
former home during 1997.
</P>
<P>
A number of Guang'an natives have left the county to study
advanced experiences in economically developed areas across the
nation.

<HEADLINE> Study: Lewinsky Case Coverage Confuses Reporting with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Opinion and speculation
have routinely been mingled with reporting in coverage of the
allegations that U.S. President Bill Clinton had a relationship
with a former White House intern, according to a study by a group
of journalists.
</P>
<P>
The study, released Wednesday by the Committee of Concerned
Journalist, suggested a decline in journalistic standards,
particularly a growing emphasis on disseminating the latest
developments in a competitive story rather than determining their
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
"The media culture today is oriented around talking about the
news rather than reporting it," said Tom Rosenstiel, a media
critic and vice chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The study was billed as "a snapshot of the news media culture"
in the first week after Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
expanded his investigation to determine whether Clinton obstructed
justice or lied under oath regarding his relationship with former
intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton has denied any improper
relationship.
</P>
<P>
The study looked at the news coverage of various forms to
determine the extent to which they relied on unnamed sources or
other media to deliver the story. It also tried to quantify the
amount of each account that was fact-based rather than
speculation.
</P>
<P>
The examination conducted for the committee by Princeton Survey
Research Associates found that 41 percent of the reporting was
either analysis, opinion or speculation. Forty percent of the
reporting based on anonymous sourcing relied on a single source,
while only one statement in 100 was based on two or more named
sources.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who have firsthand knowledge of the
Lewinsky case is quite small, and the number of reporters with
direct access to them isn't too much bigger. The study found that
organizations with better sources relied less on analysis and
opinion.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Protest in London Against Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people gathered in
the Whitehall street opposite Downing Street in Central London
Wednesday evening to protest against possible air strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators urged the British government to give up its
plan to bomb Iraq because only the innocent people could suffer
from the military action.
</P>
<P>
"No Blood for Oil!", "Don't Bomb Iraq!", "Save the innocent
people!" the people chanted.
</P>
<P>
"We hold no brief for (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein. But we
demand that the Labor government back off from this unjustified
war, which will only kill the Iraqi people," one speaker told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
Britain's House of Commons gave overwhelming support on Tuesday
to the government's hard line on Iraq, backing its readiness to
use force against President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
During the protest, two women and a man were arrested as they
tried to handcuff themselves to the gates of Downing Street, where
Prime Minister Tony Blair's office is located. But the
demonstration held on the other side of Whitehall continued
without disruption.

<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Irish peace talks,
currently held in Dublin, Ireland Republic, broke up on Wednesday
with no decision on Sinn Fein's fate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the British
and Irish governments had not decided yet whether to expel IRA's
political wing Sinn Fein for IRA's involvement in two killings in
Belfast last week.
</P>
<P>
"We have been going for three days listening to Sinn Fein's
presentation of their case and the views of the other parties.
</P>
<P>
"The governments will now take into account the points made by
Sinn Fein and the other parties in making our final
determination," Mowlam said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace talks are due to reopen in Belfast,
capital of the divided British province, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legal bid by Sinn Fein to stay in the peace
talks was adjourned until tomorrow, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, which denied any involvement in the bloody violence,
sought legal action on Tuesday to block the expulsion of the party
from the multi-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The threat of expulsion from the talks hangs over Sinn Fein
after police claimed the IRA was involved in two recent murders.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Expects U.S. to Lift Arms Ban Soon: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- It was a question of time
before the United States lifted its arms trade embargo against South
Africa, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has done everything possible to assure the U.S. of its
commitment to complying with the terms set out in an agreement reached
between the two countries last year, South African Press Association
quoted Mbeki's legal advisor, Mojanku Gumbi, as saying in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was imposed in the 1980s to prevent South Africa from
selling technology imported from the U.S. to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be discussed by Mbeki and his U.S. counterpart, Al
Gore, when the two men meet next week, Gumbi told a news conference on
the U.S.-South African Binational Commission meeting.
</P>
<P>
But she said the issue would not be on the agenda of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, international news agencies reported that the
U.S. had refused to let Sweden export its JAS 39 Gripen jet fighter to
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The jet is manufactured by a consortium led by the Swedish company,
Saab, and its partner British Aerospace. A third of its components are
from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The consortium hopes to contribute about 40 aircraft to South
Africa's military modernization program, and has offered counter-trade
deals to the value of 3.75 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is trying to re-equip its National Defense Force by
buying military equipment worth 12 billion Rand (2.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Six countries -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Spain
-- had reportedly been shortlisted by the South African Defense
Department as potential weapon suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Frank Chikane, Director-General of Mbeki's office, told the
news conference that there was no tension between South Africa and the

<HEADLINE> UK Rules out New Investigation into 89 Soccer Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A British minister said on
Wednesday there would be no fresh inquiry into the 1989
Hillsborough football stadium tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jack Straw told parliament there was no
"significant new evidence" to justify a new inquiry into the
Hillsborough football match incident.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, there were no grounds to quash its verdict of
accidental death, he added.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy at the ground of Sheffield Wednesday in northern
England occurred ahead of a cup semi-final match between
Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-six Liverpool supporters died after they crushed each
other when they found themselves unable to leave an overcrowded
section of the stands because gates were locked.
</P>
<P>
The families of the victims, who have long complained that no
one has ever stood trial for their part in the tragedy, called
Straw to step down.
</P>
<P>
"We are disgusted with the report....The public will feel as
appalled as we do," spokesman Trevor Hicks told a news conference

UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (xinhua) -- A peaceful and

community has expected, Chinese Permanent Representative to the
United Nations Qin Huasun stressed here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting of the security Council, Qin Huasun

The Ambassador said China fully supports the UN chief's visit
to Iraq and wishes him success.

Iraq, saying that Iraq should fully comply with all the relevant
resolutions of the Security Council and cooperate fully with the

At the same time, Qin stresses the sovereignty, dignity and
territorial integrity of Iraq should be fully respected.

<HEADLINE> German Economic Growth Loses Momentum Late 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economic upturn lost
momentum in the final quarter of 1997 with industrial output
growing only by a seasonally-adjusted 0.5 percent, the German
central bank said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest economic report issued by the central
bank, the Bundesbank, on Wednesday, the German industry also saw a
2.5 percent drop in foreign orders in the last quarter of 1997
compared with the previous quarter. The booming export demand has
been the only major driving force for the country's economic
growth so far.
</P>
<P>
Although the Bundesbank said that it was still too early to
estimate the full impact of the financial crisis in Asia on the
German economy, it had at least made a considerable dent in
Germany's economic confidence.
</P>
<P>
For some German industrial sectors, serious problems could
arise from the combination of weaker demand and stronger
competition from Asia due to the financial crisis, the Bundesbank
said.
</P>
<P>
While urging the trade unions to continue to pursue a policy of
moderate wage growth, the central bank today also repeated its
call on politicians to push ahead the stalled structural reforms
in a bid to boost the country's competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Extending Medical Insurance for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday ordered federal agencies to seek out millions of
children who are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can weigh more heavily on your mind than the health of
your child," Clinton said Wednesday during a visit to Children's
National Medical Center here.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked eight agencies to make a concerted effort to
enroll three million uninsured children in Medicaid -- the federal
health insurance program covering poor, elderly and disabled
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The agencies are the Social Security Administration and the
departments of Agriculture, Interior, Education, Health and Human
Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor and Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Extending coverage to Medicaid-eligible children, Clinton said,
would go a long way toward insuring five million children within
five years under the 24 billion-dollar Children's Health Insurance
Program.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's fiscal 1999 budget plan includes 900 million dollar
over five years for outreach on children's health, including using
schools and child care centers to enroll Medicaid-eligible
children. States would have the option of automatically enrolling
children in Medicaid before completing all of the eligibility and
enrollment forms.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that two states, Colorado and South Carolina, have
joined Alabama in expanding their state child health coverage
under the children's program.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Clinton said, 14 states have submitted expansion
plans to the Department of Health and Human Services, and 30
states are coming up with plans to address coverage for uninsured
children.
</P>
<P>
"I still have a hard time believing that this country, with the
finest health care system in the world, cannot figure out how to
give affordable, quality health insurance coverage to every single
child in America," Clinton said. "This is wrong. If we really
want to make America strong for the 21st century, we will correct
it."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Top Aides met with Opposition to Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton
administration's foreign policy team Wednesday held a forum at
Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, in effort to make the
case for U.S. military action against Iraq, but were met with
loud oppositions from the audience.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary
William Cohen and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, who
made the team for the marketing campaign, made their remarks
over jeers from the audience, trying their best to convince the
people of the necessity of military action to force Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to comply with U.N. resolution on
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
But right after their statements, the audience sharply
challenged the U.S. authority to launch an attack on Iraq, given
a lack of support from Iraq's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Some of the protesters held aloft a banner that said: "No
War." And some shouted "No war, no war," "One, two, three, four,
we don't want your racist war."
</P>
<P>
A person identified as an assistant professor at Ohio State
University asked the three top aides of the Clinton
administration whether the United States has "the moral right"
to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
And another questioner said as many as 100,000 Iraqi
civilians could be killed by U.S. air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Ohio State University forum was one of several places
that the Clinton administration is trying to drum up support
from the public.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said on Tuesday that "the American
people have to be ready" for the looming military action.
</P>
<P>
Albright will continue her trip, first to Tennessee State
University in Nashville and then to the University of South
Carolina at Columbia, where she will continue to try to do
mobilization campaign for the military action against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Again in Amman for Consultations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf arrived here Wednesday, the second time in three
days, for further consultations with Jordanian officials on the
Iraqi-U.N. crisis over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
This was the continuation of his multi-nation tour, which has
taken him to Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, France and Iran, to
explain Iraq's position and solicit support for a political
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi position was based on reaching a balanced diplomatic
solution that could satisfy the demands of all the concerned
parties and avoid a military strike by the United States, the
foreign minister said in a statement upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, al-Sahhaf said that Iraq very much
appreciated Jordan`s stand about the crisis as well as its
efforts to help avert military strikes.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iranian leaders also affirmed to him Iran`s
opposition to any military action, with which the U.S. wanted to
compel Iraq to open all the sites to inspections without any
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not elaborate on what results his tour had
achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for Development Affairs and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani greeted al-Sahhaf at the
Amman Ali International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Anani told reporters that Jordan's efforts focused on sparing
Iraq the dangerous consequences of military actions and there was
possibility of reaching a diplomatic solution that could meet the
demands of all the concerned sides.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf once was in Amman from February 12 to 16. He met with
senior Jordanian officials and expressed willingness to hold
direct political talk with the U.S. to end the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Relations With US Aid Agency: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The relationship between
South Africa and the United States Agency for International
Development (USAid) would be reviewed following reports that the
agency meddled in South Africa's internal affairs, Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki's office announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The priorities of USAid funding might have to change, South
African Press Association quoted director-general in Mbeki's
office, Frank Chikane, as saying in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
All aid should be aimed at assisting South Africa to achieve
its objective of transforming the society, Chikane told a news
conference on the upcoming U.S.-South African Binational
Commission meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday Star newspaper said last week that a U.S.
Congress report accused the USAid of directing its funds mainly
to conferences and other policy-formulating activities, rather
than poverty relief in the country.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Lester Munster, a member of the U.S. House of
Representatives' Foreign Relations Committee, as saying that the
USAid used its fund to play a major role in key South African
political issues, including race and affirmative action policies,
land, education, labor and healthcare policies.
</P>
<P>
Munster said the USAid interfered in South African domestic
policy to the point of making the Mandela government's work more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Chikane said the South African Department of Foreign Affairs
had compiled a report on the relationship between USAid and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report was discussed with the United States and USAid
officials, who agreed that a review was needed.
</P>
<P>
Chikane said the issue would not be discussed at next week's
Binational Commission meeting, which is to be attended by U.S.
Vice- President Al Gore.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force B-1B Bomber Crashes in Kentucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A B-1B bomber of the United
States Air Force crashed in western Kentucky Wednesday and
exploded. But all four crew members survived.
</P>
<P>
The B-1B bomber was flying out of Dyess Air Force Base near
Abilene, Texas and was on a routine training mission when it
crashed, officials at the Air Force Base in Virginia was quoted by
the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police said that all the four people aboard the bomber were
found alive after the crash in a rural area near Marion, west of
Kentucky, but their conditions were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials said that the bomber was not one of the
additional warplanes being dispatched to the Persian Gulf. There
was no immediate information about the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
It was the second crash of the 200 million U.S. dollar bomber
in five months. Last September, a B-1B crashed in a training
mission on the Montana prairie, killing all four people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The B-1B "Lancer" bomber is one of three long-range heavy
bombers in the Air Force arsenal, in addition to the B-2 Stealth
bomber and the venerable B-52. The B-1B can fly intercontinental
bombing missions without refueling.
</P>
<P>
The bomber was designed in the 1970s as a nuclear bomb-dropper
and it has been converted since then for conventional missions.
The bomber is being deployed to the Mideast for the first time in
a potential combat role.

ANKARA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Despite an earlier rejection
from Greece, Turkey called on the neighbor on Wednesday to respond
positively to a peace initiative, the Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is expecting an "official and serious" response from the
Greek government to the initiative concerning issues of the Aegean
Sea, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan told a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that our proposal will be considered (by Greece) and
that the answer will be a positive one," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem presented a verbal note
Last Thursday to the Greek ambassador in Ankara, proposing to find
a peaceful settlement for the issues of the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the foreign ministries of the two countries
hold talks on ways and means to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
But Greece rejected the proposal on Monday, saying that it does
not think that the issue should be solved through bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
"The comprehensive political talks on the bilateral problems
that Turkey has proposed could never and will never take place, "
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over the Aegean issues,
including the airspace limits, sea-bed resources and sovereignty
over some islands.
</P>
<P>
Greece maintains that the problems should be solved through
international arbitration, while Turkey prefers to seek a solution
through bilateral negotiations.

<HEADLINE> France Normalizes Religious Tolerance Edict 400 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- France is marking the 400th
anniversary of a religious tolerance edict, the Edict of Nantes,
which was signed in 1598 by the then French King Henri IV and
recognized the legal status of Christian Protestants to co-exist
with Roman Catholics for the first time in French history.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made Wednesday at the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), French President
Jacques Chirac said that the signing of Edict of Nantes is "the
strong moment of awakening of the national conscience" of France.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the edict for ending the religious war in
France and bringing national unity and the spirit of tolerance to
the country.
</P>
<P>
"France was strengthened and knew from this text a period more
secure and more peaceful because the choice of tolerance,
co-existence, not that of hatred and rejection of others, had been
made," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that some ideas from the edict, such as the recognition
of differences, later led to the establishment of the "essential
values of the French republic" in 1789.
</P>
<P>
However, the Edict of Nantes was abolished in 1685 by King
Louis XIV, 87 years after its signing. The abolition resulted in
severe persecutions of Protestants in France and forced 200,000 of
them to go into exile in Germany and the Netherlands, two European
Protestant nations at that time.
</P>
<P>
"Civil peace is always fragile. The values and principles which
allow people to live together should be reaffirmed and defended
all the time,"said Chirac.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) - The U.S. State Department
said on Wednesday that it was considering a request from Gerry
Adams, leader of Sinn Fein in Northern Island of Britain, for a
visa to visit the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We're considering the application," State Department spokesman
James Foley told a regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The head of Sinn Fein, the political arm the Irish Republican
Army (IRA), last visited the United States in September last year.
</P>
<P>
Foley said he did not know what criteria would be used to
decide whether to grant the visa.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Britain government, accusing the IRA of killing
two men last week in violation of a cease-fire it declared last
July, decided to expel Sinn Fein from multi-party Northern Ireland
peace talks under way in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government also said it believed the IRA does have a
case to answer about last week's two murders.
</P>
<P>
However, Sinn Fein says it is totally separate from the IRA and
is committed to a peaceful resolution of the Irish conflict and
began a legal legal battle on Wednesday to stop Britain throwing
it out of the talks.

<HEADLINE> Greece Not to Take Initiative to Improve Ties With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece decided on Wednesday not
to take the initiative in improving its relations with neighboring
Turkey, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a meeting presided over by Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis concerning developments in Greek-Turkish relations
and the Cyprus issue, Reppas said that it was decided that there
was no margin for undertaking an initiative to better ties with
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
"We consider that presently the conditions for doing something
different from what has been done thus far are not in place," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side, he stressed, must show its respect for the
rules of good neighborliness and abstain from the increasingly
provocations, violations and infringements in order to create a
favorable climate for fruitful contacts between officials of the
two countries, whose relations are at odds over decades for
territorial waters, airspace rights, the delimitation of
continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He added that no meeting between Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem had been
scheduled, and any such meeting, which was possible and desirable
in the framework of international organizations, had no relation
to dialogue, and with any form of negotiations on Greece's
sovereign rights.
</P>
<P>
As for the Cyprus problem, he said that Greece would contribute
towards an effective tackling of the problem in the framework of
the initiative regarding the expected renewed mediation by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that a lot had to be done still for "a just and
viable solution to emerge."

million U.S. dollar loan to El Salvador to expand and improve
basic education through the use of new technologies.

The resources will be used to help expand coverage of the third
cycle of basic education, grades seven through nine, to reach
24,900 new students, closing 47 percent of the gap that is
expected to be created by a high rate of population growth.
Expanded use of school video libraries will be an important
element in carrying out the phase of the program.

For urban and rural schools serving grades one through three in
disadvantaged communities, the resource will be provided to help
expand the use of interactive radio to improving teaching for
570,000 rural children in mathematics and Spanish.

<P>
A fund will be set up to finance education projects conducted
by school administration organizations so as to promote community
participation in the investments, and learning resource centers
will be introduced into schools to apply new technologies.

The total cost of the program is some 81.3 million dollars.
